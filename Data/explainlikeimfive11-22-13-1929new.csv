austac,14,1,1r5xmx,1,Some background I am  years old with a Masters level education I have at best a poor understanding of economics I now qualify for my employers retirement savings plan and I would like to know some more information about investing before making a decision I already did some searching and found thishttpwwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentskakzwhatisakandwhyismyjobofferingittome thread from a few months ago which was helpful but didnt answer all of my questions I already understand that under my employers plan the money I contribute to my investment plan will come out of my salary before taxes and if I contribute a certain amount my employer will match it which equates to free money as others have put it and is really the best option Im more concerned with what to do with those investments  Some of the questions I have What are stocks  What are bonds What does it mean when the stock market goes up or down and how does this affect my investments I assume that this has to do with an increase or decrease in the price value of stocks but I couldnt really explain more than that  When I invest my money what happens to it Is it moreorless credit that goes towards a companys expendable money and when they are profitable I get a percentage of that profit based on the stocks that I own Or am I confusing this with shares My TIAACREF representative said that younger investors tend to invest more aggressively due to the fact that they have a longer time to invest and less risk whereas older investors invest more conservatively because they have more to lose if the stock market is doing poorly From what I understand investing aggressively means that you put more of your investments towards stocks which fluctuate with the stock market and have a greater return on investment if the stock market does well and a greater loss when the stock market does poorly On the other hand investing conservatively means you put more of your investments towards bonds which will appreciate and depreciate less than stocks depending on the fluctuation of the stock market In other words stocks have a greater risk but greater reward than bonds Am I close with this or completely off the mark What does it mean to diversify my investments My rudimentary understanding is that you put a little bit of money in different investment options so as to cast a wide net on your different opportunities rather than putting all of your eggs in one basketall of your money on one horseother moneybased metaphors How is investing in stocks different from gambling To break it down into its simplest form from what I understand you are basically putting your money towards something that may increase or decrease your money depending on external factors that are not due to chance like in gambling but still have some level of risk What is the difference If my rudimentary understanding above is correct or at least kind of close what is my incentive to invest my money in stocks bonds and other areas Why not just take my investments and put them into a savings account and let that account accrue interest over timePreemptive thanks to anyone that can provide insight I really appreciate the time to help me understand how this whole process works Right now it is approximately  pm EST and I am still at work so I may not be able to respond immediately but I will try to check back later tonight ThanksEditMy questions have been answered but those answers have raised new questions Heres a summary of what I learned from everyone today Stocks or shares represent small pieces of a company When you buy a stockshare you own a piece of the company The price of the share at the time of purchase is based on the value of the company If a company gains value the value of the shares will increase Likewise if a company depreciates in value the share will too Ideally you want to buy shares when the cost of those shares are low and sell those shares when the value is high Bonds are essentially loans to a company When you buy a bond you loan money to the company to be used in the companys operation The company then pays you interest over the life of the loan At the end of the loans life the company repays the principle in full Some redditors have said that bonds are relatively low risk and are unlikely to default whereas others have said that they carry a similar amount of risk to stocks  Diversifying your investments means to buy stock in multiple markets Rather than buying stock in only one area of the market ie real estate you want to buy stock in multiple areas ie real estate computer and auto to reduce the risk of losing money when the only market youve invested in does poorly  The only real similarity between investing and gambling is that both carry a certain level of risk In both you can invest or bet smartly when you have a certain amount of confidence that the area you invested in or bet on will do well but in either case you cant be  certain of the outcome You can be smart and invest based on an assessment of the current market game state The difference between investing in stocks and putting your money into a savings account is that the interest that you accrue through a savings account will not outpace inflation whereas your investments have a good chance of increasing your overall savings assuming that you invest wiselyThanks again
