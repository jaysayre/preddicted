shnk,4,0,1r8wp6,1,"Yeah can someone explain this to me in kiddie words i have no clue what its trying to say:

In fact in all the mathematical work left by Fermat there is only one proof. Fermat proves that the area of a right triangle cannot be a square. Clearly this means that a rational triangle cannot be a rational square. In symbols, there do not exist integers x, y, z with
x2 + y2 = z2 such that xy/2 is a square. From this it is easy to deduce the n = 4 case of Fermat's theorem.

It is worth noting that at this stage it remained to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for odd primes n only. For if there were integers x, y, z with xn + yn = zn then if n = pq,

(xq)p + (yq)p = (zq)p.

This is particularly true with video plugins. Instead of scaling in size as I make the window bigger or smaller it reaches a point where it just cuts off the side of the video, making it difficult to view. 

With older web standards that use HTML and Adobe, etc. the video will scale regardless of how big or small you make the window, changing size in response.

I find this is also true with many websites that rely heavily on HTML5 to display content. This includes text -- with older standards it would just reorder the wording on the screen to make it fit -- newer standards don't seem to do this well. It makes multitasking with multiple windows and possibly multiple tabs per window, much harder to handle.

So that makes sense, I suppose. In synchronous communication, every exchange between client and server happens in order, and the next one doesn't happen until one is completed. Right?

austac06,14,1,1r5xmx,1,"Some background: I am 25 years old with a Master's level education. I have, at best, a poor understanding of economics. I now qualify for my employer's retirement savings plan, and I would like to know some more information about investing before making a decision. I already did some searching and found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1kakz7/what_is_a_401k_and_why_is_my_job_offering_it_to_me/) thread from a few months ago, which was helpful, but didn't answer all of my questions. 

I already understand that, under my employer's plan, the money I contribute to my investment plan will come out of my salary before taxes, and if I contribute a certain amount, my employer will match it, which equates to ""free money"", as others have put it, and is really the best option. I'm more concerned with what to do with those investments.  

Some of the questions I have:

* What are **stocks**? 

* What are **bonds**?

* What does it mean when the stock market ""goes up or down"", and how does this affect my investments? I assume that this has to do with an increase or decrease in the price value of stocks, but I couldn't really explain more than that. 

* When I invest my money, what happens to it? Is it more-or-less credit that goes towards a company's expendable money, and when they are profitable, I get a percentage of that profit based on the stocks that I own? (Or am I confusing this with **shares**?)

* My TIAA-CREF representative said that younger investors tend to invest more **aggressively**, due to the fact that they have a longer time to invest and less risk, whereas older investors invest more **conservatively**, because they have more to lose if the stock market is doing poorly. From what I understand, investing **aggressively** means that you put more of your investments towards **stocks**, which fluctuate with the stock market and have a greater return on investment if the stock market does well, and a greater loss when the stock market does poorly. On the other hand, investing **conservatively** means you put more of your investments towards **bonds**, which will appreciate and depreciate less than stocks, depending on the fluctuation of the stock market. (In other words, **stocks** have a greater risk, but greater reward, than **bonds**. *Am I close with this, or completely off the mark?*)

* What does it mean to **diversify** my investments? My rudimentary understanding is that you put a little bit of money in different investment options, so as to cast a wide net on your different opportunities, rather than ""putting all of your eggs in one basket/all of your money on one horse/other money-based metaphors"".

* How is investing in stocks different from gambling? To break it down into it's simplest form, from what I understand, you are basically putting your money towards something that may increase or decrease your money, depending on external factors (that are not due to **chance** like in gambling, but still have some level of risk). What is the difference?

* If my rudimentary understanding above is correct (or at least kind of close), what is my incentive to invest my money in stocks, bonds, and other areas? Why not just take my investments and put them into a savings account and let that account accrue interest over time?

Pre-emptive thanks to anyone that can provide insight. I really appreciate the time to help me understand how this whole process works. Right now, it is approximately 3:30 pm EST, and I am still at work, so I may not be able to respond immediately, but I will try to check back later tonight. Thanks!!

**Edit:**

My questions have been answered, but those answers have raised new questions. Here's a summary of what I learned from everyone today:

* **Stocks**, or **shares**, represent small pieces of a company. When you buy a stock/share, you own a piece of the company. The price of the share at the time of purchase is based on the value of the company. If a company gains value, the value of the shares will increase. Likewise, if a company depreciates in value, the share will too. Ideally, you want to buy shares when the cost of those shares are low, and sell those shares when the value is high.

* **Bonds** are essentially loans to a company. When you buy a bond, you loan money to the company to be used in the company's operation. The company then pays you interest over the life of the loan. At the end of the loan's life, the company repays the principle in full. Some redditors have said that bonds are relatively low risk and are unlikely to default, whereas others have said that they carry a similar amount of risk to stocks. 

* **Diversifying** your investments means to buy stock in multiple markets. Rather than buying stock in only one area of the market (i.e. real estate), you want to buy stock in multiple areas (i.e. real estate, computer, and auto) to reduce the risk of losing money when the only market you've invested in does poorly. 

* The only real similarity between **investing** and **gambling** is that both carry a certain level of risk. In both, you can invest (or bet) smartly, when you have a certain amount of confidence that the area you invested in (or bet on) will do well, but in either case, you can't be 100% certain of the outcome. You can be smart and invest based on an assessment of the current market (game state).

* The difference between investing in stocks and putting your money into a savings account is that *the interest that you accrue through a savings account will not outpace inflation*, whereas your investments have a good chance of increasing your overall savings (assuming that you invest wisely).

    Turning and turning in the widening gyre
    The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
    Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
    The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
    The best lack all conviction, while the worst
    Are full of passionate intensity.

    Surely some revelation is at hand;
    Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
    Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;
    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
    Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.

    The darkness drops again but now I know
    That twenty centuries of stony sleep
    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

""In Contagious Architecture, Luciana Parisi offers a philosophical inquiry into the status of the algorithm in architectural and interaction design. Her thesis is that algorithmic computation is not simply an abstract mathematical tool but constitutes a mode of thought in its own right, in that its operation extends into forms of abstraction that lie beyond direct human cognition and control. These include modes of infinity, contingency, and indeterminacy, as well as incomputable quantities underlying the iterative process of algorithmic processing. The main philosophical source for the project is Alfred North Whitehead, whose process philosophy is specifically designed to provide a vocabulary for ""modes of thought"" exhibiting various degrees of autonomy from human agency even as they are mobilized by it. Because algorithmic processing lies at the heart of the design practices now reshaping our world -- from the physical spaces of our built environment to the networked spaces of digital culture -- the nature of algorithmic thought is a topic of pressing importance that reraises questions of control and, ultimately, power. Contagious Architecture revisits cybernetic theories of control and information theory's notion of the incomputable in light of this rethinking of the role of algorithmic thought. Informed by recent debates in political and cultural theory around the changing landscape of power, it links the nature of abstraction to a new theory of power adequate to the complexities of the digital world.""

Why PSU / UPS manufacturers wont come to an agreement on developing new connector that would just pipe 12v fom UPS directly into PC without needing to upconvert/downconvert.

KingBroseidon88,3,2,1r3nv2,1,"I could't think of a good way to phrase this question, but lets try..... I recently read somewhere that the average familial generation is somewhere from 20 to 30 years. Makes sense when I say it, but never really gave any thought to that. 

Now lets pretend its still the year 2000 for the sake of making of simplifying things. 

If we low-ball the average generation size then I'm in the 100th generation of my family since the common era began. If we assume that each generation has two parents, and that those parents were not related in any way then my family size would double each generation.  So used that to try and figure out how many people I could hypothetically be related to.

I used this formula 2^100.

That gave me 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376.

Over 1 Nonillian...... an impossible number by any means fathomable

So I thought what if each generation in my family was 40 years. Its the exact same concept as before, but now the equation is 2^50th power.

That new number is 1,125,899,906,842,624.... So I'll round that down by over 100 trillion and call it an even quadrillion.....A number I still cant believe because that would mean that in the past 2000 years I would be related to ten times as many people than some scientist believe ever existed. 

If each of my generations is 100 years then 20 generations have gone by... 2^20 is 1,048,576 a realistic number but an otherwise terribly unrealistic age gap between generations.

So how many people cold I be related to since the start of the common era? I can accept that down the line my grandfather must of had two wives that gave birth to both of my parents or old timey incest might of happened happened somewhere. How can we estimate this?

(TL;DR) I have two parents, they both had two, and so on and so on. How many people in my family since 0 AD?",ELI5: In theory how many people could I trace my lineage to that have been alive during the Common Era? or can you make sense of this anthropological math problem?,3
