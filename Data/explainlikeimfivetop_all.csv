is Part  of the PointByPointAs I said before this is a huge undertaking The current version of the billhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdf is  pages long and Im going through it bit by bit But its going to take a while to do it Ill keep adding to this until Im finished but given that I have a job and a social life I cant say how long itll takeAlso Ill try to address questions people have as best I can but again it might take me a while to get back to you Please be patientSo without further ado here goesNote I am NOT an expert Im just a guy If I have made an error on any of this please let me knowNote For the sake of clarity and continuity any references to page numbers will be referring to the PDF file not the page number in the documentPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting in  everyone up to  of the poverty line is covered by Medicaid From what I can tell looking at the Social Security Act it looks like its currently a mishmesh of various qualifications one being that a person is under  of the poverty line So this will make for a pretty huge number of people who Medicaid grows to encompass This section also increases federal funding to support the increase However it should be mentioned that a recent court rulinghttpwwwsupremecourtgovopinionspdfcapdf amongst other things made it clear that individual states could opt not to do this However in Justice Roberts opinion Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer so in other words States cant be forced to do this but they can be given incentives to do thisPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting in  Medicaid covers former foster children under the age of Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Increases the amount of Medicare money given to US Territories like Puerto RicoPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act It looks like what its doing is that starting in  the amount of money the Federal Government chips in for medical care when there is a major disaster increasesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Between  and  this cuts about  from a part of Medicaid called the Medicaid Improvement Fund a yearly fund established to improve the management of Medicaid Clearly this was done to help fund this bill which itself tries to improve Medicaid along with everything elsePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that Between October  and September  the amount of money allocated to the Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP increases and this section says that states that want to get this increased funding need to make sure that the health insurance provided under CHIP meets the same standards as those in this billPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters two other bills the Social Security Act and the Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of  CHIPRA It looks like its just coordinating everything so it all makes sense togetherPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act by adding the following sectionPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This calls for the creation of a website for people who use Medicaid and CHIP to sign up for and renew insurance plans using their states insurance exchangesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act From what I can tell it looks like this allows a hospital to choose whether they want to be able to make a determination whether or not a patient is covered under Medicaid Im just guessing here but I think that this is to streamline things and make it easier for hospitals to sign patients up for Medicaid if a patient looks like they might qualify for Medicaid Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to allow Medicaid to cover Freestanding Birth Centers which look like they are essentially an establishment which is not a hospital but which provides services to mothers giving birth So picture a maternity ward without the rest of the hospital and that seems like the sort of thing theyre describing Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to say that if a child has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and the parents have chosen to pay for hospice care that paying for hospice care doesnt mean that they are giving up any other forms of care that Medicaid and CHIP might provide for their child as wellPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to provide those with a low income an amount which is to be decided by each State access to family planning medical services From what I can tell this means stuff like STD testing contraceptives etcOkay it looks like a lot of the stuff coming up pertains to longterm care  for people who are bedridden and need medical supervision people who are in a nursing home or have an inhome caregiver etcPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to clarify the wording of one partPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that beginning in October  states may provide those with an income level under  of the poverty line which like I said in Part  is based on your age and how many people are in your household care in a nursing home inhome care etc It looks like this section is optional for States to follow but those that choose to do it and follow numerous standards set in place by this section will benefit from an increase in Federal fundingPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create regulations for various types of stateprovided longterm care again stuff like nursing homes and inhome care allowing states to cater to those who could benefit from different kinds of longterm care while still working within preset standardsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Deficit Reduction Act of  Reading around on this it looks like this has to do with states funding longterm care and transitioning into and out of hospitals as opposed to nursing homes and inhome care The Deficit Reduction Act had a part to smooth this transition and this section extends that part as well as expanding the people it can cover based on how long a person has been receiving longterm carePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act Its hard to parse through this one since it bounces around to different sections of the Social Security Act but the gist of it seems to deal with a part of the Social Security Act that happens when your spouse becomes institutionalized in some form of longterm care and the state helps with your expenses during that time because longterm medical care can be costly This section seems to make it so that from  this help also includes medical coveragePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Sets aside  over a fiveyear period to help pay for another bill the Older Americans Act of Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This is basically the bill talking about how important a topic longterm care is and saying in a general way that Congress should talk about it more and that more support should be made for communitylevel care like nursing homes and inhome care as opposed to only hospital carePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to increase the size of the drug rebates poor people get through Medicaid and also to specify that no rebates are to be for an amount higher than the average price of the drugPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to allow Medicaid to cover more types of drugs including Barbiturates Benzodiazepines and drugs that help people to quit smokingPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act It looks like this sets a way to determine what the limits are for how much Medicaid is supposed to reimburse people for pharmacy drugsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act This one is cutting a lot of money from payments made to states called Disproportionate Share Hospital DSH Payments These are payments that states then turn over to hospitals to help compensate them for treating emergency patients who dont have insurance Clearly the idea is that since more patients will have insurance after the PPACA goes into full swing hospitals wont need as much of these funds From   Billion will be cut from the amount given to states for this and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to decide how much each state gets cut based on what percentage of their population is insured as well as a few other factorsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act Im not entirely sure about this because its hard to find information on it but it looks like it gives states the option to get year waivers so they dont have to follow Federal regulations for Medicaid when it comes to Demonstration Projects Look farther down to see some of these which looks like they are ways to test out new alternate approaches to Medicaid However the Secretary of Health and Human Resources can pull the plug on these waivers if it looks like a Demonstration Project isnt working the way it is intendedPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to create the Federal Coordinated Health Care OfficehttpswwwcmsgovAboutCMSAgencyInformationCMSLeadershipOfficeFCHCOhtml which is in charge of managing the areas of overlap between Medicare and Medicaid to make it more effective and efficient for people who qualify for both to get the services theyre covered for and make sure theres not any wastePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to add the next sectionPage  Sec Bhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  On a yearly basis from  and then every three years after  the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to write a report on recommended standards for adult care for Medicaid patients much like a similar report thats already written for children This section also calls for the establishment of the Medicaid Quality Measurement Program to develop and test better methods of adult care again like a similar program already in existence for children  Million will be set aside every year from  to fund this programPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  From what I can tell this part directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to look at individual state practices that withhold payment from hospitals for health conditions caused by the hospitals own neglect and negligence and adopt them as general Medicaid practicesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting in  states may choose to offer medical plans for those with chronic conditions that theyre calling a Health Home which appears to be a phrase that doesnt mean what it seems to A Health Home doesnt seem to be an actual home per se but more like a team of specialists assigned to look after you and coordinate your carePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  From  the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up one of those Demonstration Projects I mentioned earlier to test the effectiveness of doing bundled programs in MedicaidPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage   From The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another one of those Demonstration Projects to give participating States an option to try out a different Medicaid payment structure for hospitals so instead of paying hospitals based on the quantity of service they give its based on the qualityPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  From  The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another one of those Demonstration Projects This one gives states the opportunity to allow hospitals to become Pediatric Accountable Care Organization which looks like its a way to reward Pediatric hospitals who find ways of saving money without reducing the amount of care patients receivePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The Secretary of Health and Human Resources will start up another Demonstration Project This one gives states the opportunity to allow private psychiatric hospitals to be covered under Medicaid This section allocates  Million for this and specifies that it will be a threeyear project that will happen sometime between  and Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to try to improve MACPAC which looks like it handles Medicaid and CHIP payments This section clarifies wording emphasizes efficiency and preventive care and adds in a bunch of directions to communicate more clearly and frequently with Congress and the states as well as coordinating with MedPAC which handles Medicare payments It also allocates  Million for this in  as well as reallocating  Million from Social Security for this out

this program from  and the Secretary is to report to Congress on its progressThe next few sections focus on reducing readmissions where a patient keeps coming back for the same problem Apparently this is a big drain on Medicare One in five patients discharged from a hospital  approximately  million seniors  is readmitted within  days at a cost of over  billion every year  Source The Center for Medicare and Medicaid InnovationhttpwwwinnovationscmsgovinitiativesPartnershipforPatientsCCTPindexhtmlitemIDCMS Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting in  the payments made under Medicare to hospitals will be slightly reduced in cases of excessive readmission This is apparently to encourage hospitals to fix the problem a patient comes in with in the first place This section also adds the following section to another bill the Public Health Service ActPage  Sec KKhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Within two years of the enactment of this section So March  I think the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make a program for hospitals with a high amount of readmissions to improve their readmission rates So while the previous section penalizes them for having too many readmissions this one helps them to get their readmissions to acceptable levels Hospitals that do this will report to the Secretary on the changes they make and how effective they arePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  From January   to January   the Secretary of Health and Human Resources will create a program to try and improve the care for patients being transitioned from one location like a hospital to another such as the athome care or CommunityBased Organizations for the purpose of reducing readmissionsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Deficit Reduction Act of  to extend a demonstration project in that bill to last roughly another year and setting aside an additional  for this This demonstration project had to do with gainsharing From what I can tell it looks like the idea is to give doctors and hospital staff incentive to reduce costs without reducing the quality of care by giving them a portion of that savingsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section was repealed Im not sure what it was before but its nothing more than a placeholder nowPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to renew one part that sets a bottom limit for the Work Geographic Index used for determining Medicare costs as well as adding what looks like some additional criteria for determining those costsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to

for ambulance services for Medicare patients through Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Medicare Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of  Another one thats difficult to read but from what I can tell its just renewing funding for longterm care hospitals for Medicare patients for another two yearsPage  Sec

an additional year until Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting on January   Physician Assistants are added to the list of professionals line nurses and doctors allowed to order posthospital extended care services services that a patient can be given after a  day stay at a hospital In other words its just giving physician assistants more freedom to sign you up for services you need after a long hospital stayPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage Alters another bill the Social Security

exemptions for certain types of pharmaciesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act It looks like the gist of it is that some beneficiaries of Tricare civilian health benefits for veterans will have an additional year to enroll in Medicare Part B if they choose to do soPage  Sec

Secretary of Health and Human Resources to work with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to conduct a report on the effect that this hasPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to cut all the funds going to the Medicare Improvement Fund in  Specifically this is cutting  Most likely this cut is because the PPACA does many of the same things the Medicare Improvement Fund is intended to so this payment would be redundantPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a twoyear demonstration project starting July   where complex lab tests are paid using

whether the caregiver is forprofit or nonprofit etc The phasein is to be across  years to make sure the shift in payments isnt too much of a shock to the market In addition this section directs the

number of smaller edits to indicate that the Secretary is to limit the amounts paid to these caregivers in a number of different ways This section also alters another bill the Medicare Prescription

hospitals who treat indigent patients will change to be determined by a number of factors outlined here Its a bit complicated but the short version is that it looks like itll be cutting these payments

the PPACA was passed by another bill the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of  HCERA However the new text has been entered here It amends another bill the Social Security Act Its got a lot of talk about numbers but the gist of it seems to be that its going to be lowering the amount paid for Medicare Advantage until the costs are more in line with the costs of normal Medicare This section seeks to bring those costs back down to something comparable to normal Medicare costsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage   Alters another bill the Social Security Act

Association of Insurance Commissioners to revise standards for supplemental Medicare benefit plansThe next group of sections deals with Medicare Part D the Medicare Drug Prescription ProgramPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act Firstly it says that starting January   any drug companies wanting to continue to work with Medicare Part D must participate in the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program outlined in this section Secondly it outlines the actual Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program which also starts January   This section addresses the infamous Donut Hole in coverage which plagued Medicare recipients who purchased enough drugs to surpass the prescription drug coverage limit but not enough to qualify for catastrophic coverage It does so by making the drug companies that work with Medicare give discounts to those who fall within that gapPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that the lowincome benefit for Medicare part is calculated without taking into consideration discounts and rebates received under Medicare Advantage This way those getting discounts like that wont be penalized for it when purchasing drugsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act From what I can tell starting January   it makes it so the Secretary of Health and Human Services can allow a prescription drug plan to charge lowincome beneficiaries the lowincome subsidy if the plans premium is more expensive than the lowincome subsidy plus a de minimis amount That amount is apparently   sourcehttpwwwcmsgovMedicarePrescriptionDrugCoveragePrescriptionDrugCovContraDownloadsMemoDeMinimisClarificationpdf Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act This section deals with widows and widowers on lowincome assistance Normally Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services check beneficiaries financial status on a regular basis to make sure they still qualify for lowincome programs and if someone is making too much money in a given timeframe they may no longer qualify as low income However generally when someones wife or husband dies they inherit their significant others stuff This section says that that check on beneficiaries status can not happen within a year of the death of a spouse so someone isnt dropped from Medicare or Medicaid just because they lost a loved one This section goes into effect January  Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that no later than January   when the Secretary of Health and Human Resources reassigns someone to a different Medicare drug plan apparently due to a change in their economic status they are to be informed of the differences between their old plan and the new one as well as being informed of their right to request a coverage determination exception or reconsiderationPage  Sec

programsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act As I understand it starting in  Medicate Advantage insurance companies must include coverage for specific categories of drugs designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services Until the secretary designates which drugs are to be covered these categories are to include anticonvulsants antidepressants antineoplastics antipsychotics antiretrovirals and immunosuppressants for the treatment of transplant rejectionPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act From what I can tell starting on January   if you make over   for couples filing taxes jointly your Medicare Part D monthly costs will increase in a fashion similar to Medicare Part B This amount will be taken out of your social securityPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that on a date no earlier than January   if youre eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid and receiving home or communitybased services instead of going to a hospital you cant also qualify for costsharing under Medicare Part D From what I can tell this is because they can most likely get costsharing by other meansPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting on January   drug plans for patients in longterm care facilities must be more efficiently managed and drugs given to patients must be dispensed in a more efficient manner using uniform dispensing techniques to reduce wastePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create and maintain a complaint system to be made available on Medicaregov and the Secretary

the type of drugs used by those in Medicare Advantage plans which the Secretary of Health and Human Resources is to present to Congress no later than July  every year starting in  The Inspector General is also to conduct a study on the  most frequentlyused Medicare Part D drugs and their pricing under both normal Medicare and Medicare Advantage That report is to be given to Congress no later than October  Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act This one is hard to parse but from what I can tell it makes it so that starting on January   drugs paid by AIDS drug programs and Indian Health Services count towards calculations for determining qualification for Medicare Part D catastrophic care I imagine that this is because someone with AIDS definitely needs catastrophic care Not sure what Indian Health Services has to do with anything thoughPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section was repealed by another bill HCERA However it replaces it with similar text which is mirrored here It alters another bill the Social Security Act to give a  rebate to Medicare recipients who fall into that donut hole that I mentioned above in Section  Its only in effect for Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section alters another bill the Social Security Act It reduces the increases in payments that many various types of medical facilities and services were going to be getting through Medicare undoubtedly to keep down Medicares ballooning costs For some of these services it reduces those increases gradually starting at a quarter of a percent less than what those payment increases were going to be gradually going up to threequarters of a percent less than what the payment increases were going to be For some it reduces increases in payments based on a productivity assessment which from what I can tell is based primarily on what operating costs are For some it reduces the increases in payments by a flat amount And for some it reduces the increases in payment using some combination of those three methods It bears note that this is undoubtedly what some alarmists believe is a reduction in Medicare services but none of these reduce Medicare payments below what they are now they only slow down the speed at which Medicare costs are rising and it seems like its largely trying to keep payments close to the actual costs needed by these facilities and servicesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to say that from January   through December   income thresholds if you earn more than that amount a year youre considered highincome for Medicare Part B will be frozen at their  levels rather than being tied to inflation like they previously had been Looking around apparently those thresholds are currently at  if youre single and  if youre filing taxes jointly Freezing the thresholds means theyll stay at those dollar amounts instead of rising with inflationPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to create the Independent Medicare Advisory Board This is one of the sections that brought up talk of death panels but the truth is its pretty benign The board is to be comprised of  experts who cannot hold any other employment while they are part of the board so theres no conflict of interest who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate as well as the Secretary of Health and Human Services the Administrator of the Center for Medicare amp Medicaid Services and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration who will be nonvoting members The presidential appointees serve year nonconsecutive terms The boards purpose is to reduce Medicare spending per person by submitting proposals to be enacted by the Secretary unless Congress says otherwise These proposals must cut costs must not ration health care and must not increase costs to Medicare recipients must not cut Medicare benefits and must not modify eligibility criteria In addition until  these proposals must not reduce payments for hospitals and services probably because the ACA already does some of that It can cut payments for administrative expenses The board is also to try and make its proposals increase Medicare solvency improve quality of care improve access to services and reduce spending in areas with excess growth in costs while also taking into consideration the needs of care providers Before these proposals go to the Secretary they are to be reviewed by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Then the Secretary reviews them and then they are brought to Congress Starting in  these proposals are to be brought to both houses of Congress and the President by January  each year The President will review this proposal for two days before bringing his own proposal to Congress A few different committees in Congress are to review this proposal and report back to Congress on it by April  Congress is not allowed to make another bill to repeal or alter congressional consideration although the Senate may waive Congressional consideration by use of a threefifths vote thats subject to appeal This section goes into all sorts of Congressional rules for how the proposal is to be considered before deciding whether to pass it Anyway Congress votes on whether to pass it and the President may choose to veto it if it is passed like any other bill If the proposal passes it is to be implemented by August  Additionally in  Congress can vote on whether to discontinue the board If the board didnt create a proposal in a given year it is still to report to Congress on matters relating to Medicare and every year regardless it is to create a public report as well They are also to do a yearly advisory report on recommendations for ways to improve health care outside of MedicarePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Public Health Service Act to add the next sectionPage  Sec

CarlH,166,177,jauzj,858,A number of people have asked questions on ELI related to how stocks and stock market work Here goes Part One  Stocks First lets imagine that down the street there is a toy store Mr Jones owns the toy store and he has owned it for the last ten years The toy store is a company which sells toys and all the kids love to get toys from Mr Jones toy storeLets suppose we wanted to buy Mr Jones toy store from him so that all of the kids would buy toys from us instead Would we be able to buy it for a dollar No of course not It is worth a lot more than that How about ten dollars A hundred dollarsWell how exactly would we find out how much we need to pay in order to buy Mr Jones toy store The most important thing to consider is simply how much money is the toy store making If the toy store is making  every day that means it is making roughly   days of  every month or  every year  months of  Lets suppose we are able to figure that the toy store should be able to keep making this much for the next ten years Then we could consider that the entire toy store is worth  which is  for ten years Now in practice this is a lot more complicated But the basic principle is simply to figure out how much money a company can be expected to make in a certain time frame Fortunately we dont have to figure it out ourselves There are big companies whose job is to figure out how much other companies are worth and they do all of the hard work for us They will tell us just how much Mr Jones toy store is really worth and then we can decide to buy it or notSo lets consider that the toy store is worth  If we want to buy it and if he is willing to sell it we can pay Mr Jones that much money and now the toy store is oursNow this is all well and good if we have  and we want to own the entire company But lets suppose we only have half that much we have  What can we do now Well as long as Mr Jones is willing we can buy half of his company instead of the whole thingThis means that we will own  or half of the company and he will own the other half That means that instead of all of the money from selling toys going to Mr Jones half will go to him and the other half to us Another way of saying that we own  of the company is to say that we own  of the stock in a company When a company is set up in a way that you can buy pieces of it those pieces are called stock There are two ways to think about stock percentages and sharesWhat we just talked about are percentages We can buy  of the shares in Mr Jones toy company for  Similarly we could buy  of the shares in Mr Jones toy company for  assuming the total value of the company was  or we could buy  of the shares for  and so onWhen you hear people talk about stocks you will hear them talk about shares of stock What exactly does this mean Well lets imagine that Mr Jones has a lot of people who want to buy a piece of his company What he can do is say Hey everyone I have  different pieces of my company for saleIn this example there are  total pieces he has for sale each one being worth  of the stock To buy all  pieces would cost you  and this would mean you own the entire company This would mean that whenever the company makes money you get all of the money But lets suppose we only have  to use This means all we can afford is one piece of his company but that one piece is worth  which means that every time the company makes a hundred dollars we will get one dollarSo in this example Mr Jones looks at the situation and realizes it is very hard to find people to buy pieces of his company because each piece costs  which is a lot of money So he decides rather than just have  pieces or shares he is going to have a thousand pieces Now it takes ten shares to have  of the company but each share is only  That is a lot more affordable He could even decide to make  shares which means that you could buy a share for only So this is the basic concept Companies cut their value into pieces or shares and then sell the shares to people who will buy them The people who buy shares are called investors and the act of buying a share is called investing This means that they are buying shares in a company because they think that eventually they will make back more than what they paid because they are getting a piece of all of the money that the company makesWhen a company is enormous worth billions of dollars even a thousand shares is simply not enough They need to have many many shares in order to make sure that shares are affordable Some companies have millions of shares of stockNow we have covered one aspect of what it means to own stock in a company You are able to keep some of the money the company makes based on how many shares you own But when you own part of a company you dont just get some of the money it makes You also get to make decisions Everyone who has shares in a company has the right to vote for what the company will do next The amount of voting power you have is equal to the percentage of shares you have Imagine that a company is owned by three people Billy Melissa and James Imagine that Billy owns  of the total shares and that Melissa and James each own  which is less than what Billy owns Lets suppose that the toy company is trying to decide whether to sell a certain toy Billy thinks it is a good idea but Melissa and James think it is a bad idea Well even though Billy has more shares of stock in the company and more voting power he will still be out voted by both Melissa and James This is because together Melissa and James have  compared to Billys  When a company has a lot of share holders people who own stock in the company they will have meetings called shareholder meetings In these meetings everyone gets to vote based on the shares they own The company will do whatever the prevailing vote decidesSo then this brings up a question What if there are a lot of people who own shares but one of them owns more than half of all the shares Would that person be able to outvote everyone else no matter how many other people there are The answer is yes If a single person owns more than half of all the shares then they have what is called controlling interest in the company This means that they can decide anything for the company and outvote everyone else  Part Two  The Stock Market So by now you should have a pretty good idea of what stock is Now lets imagine that there is also a video game company owned by Mr Smith Now Mr Smiths company is doing a lot better than Mr Jones We had said that Mr Jones company is worth  based on how much it is expected to make over ten years but Mr Smiths is worth twice that His video game company is worth  Lets imagine that Mr Jones company has  total shares of stock each valued at  per share Lets also imagine that Mr Smiths company also has  total shares of stock each valued at  per share This means that if we had  we could choose to either buy two shares in Mr Jones toy company or one share in Mr Smiths video game company Lets suppose that we already own two shares of stock in Mr Jones toy company Our two shares are worth  which is enough to buy one share of stock in Mr Smiths company We looked at both companies and we decided that Mr Smiths company seems like it is doing the best so we decide to sell our two shares in Mr Jones toy company and buy one share of stock in Mr Smiths company And this is the basics of stock tradingNow here is where things get interesting How much a company is really worth changes constantly Mr Jones company has been making  every day for ten years but all of last year his company was only making  per day Is it still worth   Maybe it is losing value or maybe it is just going through a rough period If we owned stock in the company we would have to decide which it is If we decide the company is losing value then we will probably want to sell our stocks and buy stocks in a company that is doing better There are a lot of reasons to assume that a company is doing better or worse We might have heard a rumor that Mr Jones toy company even though it has only been making day is about to start selling a really really cool toy We say Wow if he sells that toy lots of kids will buy it and so we decide to buy a lot of stock because we think that the stock is actually worth more than Mr Jones says Similarly we might have heard a rumor that an even better toy company is going to be opening up a store right next door to Mr Jones toy store In this case we might say Oh no we have a lot of shares of stock in Mr Jones toy company and we better sell it fast If we dont we will lose money because the kids will all shop at the new toy store instead You can see that emotion plays a big role in this  Now lets imagine that instead of two companies Mr Jones Toy Company and Mr Smiths Video Game Company there are hundreds of companies Lets also imagine there are thousands of people all trading stock in each company at the same time Now you have what is called a stock exchange If you take the value of all of the companies and add them together and then divide that by the total number of companies in your stock exchange you get an average that you can track over time to see how well on average all of the companies are doingLets suppose that all of the companies combined are worth a million dollars and that there are only ten total companies in the stock exchange Then we would say that the average value is a million divided by ten which is  Remember though that how much companies are worth changes over time so the very next day it might turn out that all ten companies combined are now worth two million dollars which means our average is now  If we keep track of this average over time we can create a graph We can watch this graph to get a good feel for how the companies in the stock exchange are doing This can also help us decide whether or not investing in more companies is a good idea or a bad idea There you have it the basics of stocks and the stock market I hope you enjoyed it,explainlikeimfive  Stocks and the Stock Market Explained,1035,explainlikeimfive,top_all

independent Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science has determined that preventive care for women should include access to amongst other things contraception Insurers must provide these services and cannot require a copay for them They are paid for by the insurance company On February   or February th if you go by the header in the document the Department of Health and Human Services issued thishttpwwwgpogovfdsyspkgFRpdfpdf document detailing its enforcement of this section It clarifies that churches are exempt from being required to provide coverage for contraception and that insurers are to create plans specifically for religiouslyowned businesses like Catholic hospitals so that employees still get contraceptive coverage through their employer without any of the

httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage   years after the law passed the Secretary of Health and Human Services needs to establish rules for how insurers will report on a yearly basis the quality of care given under their plans to be made available to the public online This includes stuff relating to wellness and prevention programs healthy eating antismoking etc as well as a big section making it clear that customers arent supposed to be asked about gun ownership in case someone thinks it might be a good idea to factor that into their reportingPage  Sec

down due to preexisting conditions This is already in effect as of  months after this bill passed for anyone under the age of Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Starting in  the only things about you that insurers can take into consideration when determining your premium rates are whether you want to cover your family or just you what your age is whether or not you use

shouldnt be able to screw with their insurance plans because they choose to participate in onePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Says that when this law passed no one had to change their plans They could if they wanted but they could totally keep their current plan if they like itPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Says that the changes this law

plansPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  You know the dozen or so In s Ive put in a bunch of the recent bulletpoints Well this is the part that specified they happen in  with the exception of a few parts that start soonerPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section talks about what a plan needs to be in order to be qualified basically okay for an insurer to sell It needs to be certified for the requirements of the insurance exchange its going to be in more on the exchanges later it needs to have the features described in the next section needs to be sold by a licensed insurer needs to be sold at the same rate regardless of whether its sold directly or in an exchange etcPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The last section talked about what a plan needs to be but this one talks about what needs to be in it And thats a lot of ground to cover so bear with me The Secretary of Health and Human Services is going to determine what the minimum levels need to be for everything but this section outlines that by saying that health insurance plans must cover bare minimums of ambulatory services emergency services hospitalization maternity and newborn care mental health services drugs rehabilitative services laboratory services preventative services and pediatric services that include oral and vision care This section also goes into detail on just how the Secretary is to determine those minimum levels be mindful of different types of people be balanced etc This section also limits how big deductibles can get starting in  no bigger than  for individuals and  for couples On top of that this establishes that plans should fall into BronzeSilverGoldPlatinum levels with each corresponding to a different level of benefits For Bronze insurers pay for  of the costs of the benefits Silver is  Gold is  and Platinum is  A plan thats not one of those could still be okay if its a Catastrophic plan which is only for people under  or with special tax exemptions and it only has to cover three primary care visits Additionally any plan created for adults must also be available for children under Whew That was a long one Okay lets move onPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  A state may choose to fund plans that include abortion coverage or they may not Its up to each state to decide that Basically the folks who wrote the bill knew what a hotbutton issue abortion was and they wrote this section to pass the buck on to state lawmakers without siding one way or anotherPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section defines a bunch of termsOkay now were about to get into health insurance exchanges which allow plans to compete across different areas The idea if Im getting this right is that by having more insurance companies competing across a larger area prices will be driven down due to competition As I understand it this is what they ultimately ended up doing instead of having a public option optional staterun insurance to compete with the others Since the public option got shot down before the bill was passed this was seen as another way to encourage more competition in the marketIt bears mention that in the  Supreme Court rulinghttpwwwsupremecourtgovopinionspdfcapdf on this bill it was declared that states are not required to establish health insurance exchanges and that they cannot be penalized for refusing to do so by reducing the funding they get for Medicare and Medicaid However if any states choose to optout of the creation of these exchanges the Secretary of Health and Human Resources may simply create the exchanges for those states directly or even go as far as to create a multistate exchange encompassing any number of states that refuse to create their own This is just speculation of course but in any case the court decision shouldnt greatly impact the creation of these exchangesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Another big one This section sets aside money to the states so they can start up health insurance exchanges The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines how much to keep giving the states based on how much progress theyre making States only have until  to get their act together though  after that they get no money However states must have something ready by  States can choose to require insurers to have benefits that go above and beyond what this law requires but they have to figure out how to pay for anything they come up with that requires more government money by  the exchanges need to be selffunding States can even team up to make multistate exchanges if they wantPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Individuals can get any plan they qualify for If you qualify for it you can get it if you dont you cant This section seems to be talking about different ways people can get insurance through employment through a broker etc and making sure they get it Also Congress has to make use of the same plans us ordinary taxpayers havePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  States need to keep track of the money these insurance exchanges are using make sure theyre working right financially and watch out for fraudPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to set the standards that these insurance exchanges are supposed to follow If any state fails to follow them satisfactorily fails to get it set up in time or chooses not to do it at all the Secretary will set one up for themPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This sets up the rules as well as instructions for loans and grants for the creation of nonprofit memberrun insurers called Coops Basically what credit unions are to banks this aims to be for traditional insurance companies This section aims to make it easier for a bunch of people to band together to start their own nonprofit insurance company to provide insurance all the people who banded together The idea is to give people more options and more competition in the marketPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This option is stricken and no longer exists Looks like it was probably the public option back before it was kicked off of this billPage  Sec  same number different section httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Allocates money specifically for territories that arent states like Puerto RicoPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This says that Coops have to work under the same laws as normal insurance companiesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This allows the government to create a lowcost insurance option for people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but who still make less than  of the poverty line which is a number that depends on your age and how many are in your household but this amount at its lowest is a little over yearPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  If any state can come up with their own plan one which gives citizens the same level of care at the same price as the PPACA they can ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services for permission to do their plan instead of the PPACA So if they can get the same results without say the mandate they can be allowed to do so Vermont for example has expressed a desire to just go straight to singlepayerPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  In  states can work with insurers to allow them to make plans available in multiple states with different laws and regulationsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  A different way for an insurer to do a multistate planPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Starting in  states must either create or work with an alreadyexisting nonprofit reinsurance agency Reinsurance agencies basically buy insurance plans from insurers when they are deemed to be highrisk This helps to keep premiums for other customers down since otherwise insurers would have to raise prices to offset that risk This section talks about some of the rules for these sorts of agencies  medical conditions are to be identified as highrisk conditions that insurers can offer up to reinsurance agencies Partly to offset the risk these agencies are taking by taking on these highrisk customers reinsurers are taxexemptPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  In  the government will create Risk corridors basically saying that in the first few years while insurers adjust to all these new rules the government will help with some of the risk associated with insurance payoutsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Each state will charge insurers who take on less risk and make payments to insurers who take more risk acting as an equalizer so that the companies that succeed arent just the ones who cater mostly to demographics with a low amount of riskPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another document the Internal Revenue Code by adding the following sectionPage  Sec Bhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Starting in  gives a refundable tax credit to everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid but makes less than  of the poverty line which again is based on your age and how many people are in your household Depending on how much you make this could save you up to  a year A refundable tax credit is basically a discount on your taxes and if its more money than you pay in taxes you actually get the extra money back as a refund This is the bills answer to the question How will I afford insurance if I make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford insurance on my ownPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  If Im reading this right insurers must reduce costs both copays and overall costs for everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid but makes less than  of the poverty line which like I said last time is based on your age and how many people are in your household Depending on how much you make your copay costs could be slashed by up to twothirds the normal price and your overall costs could be covered up to  If youre an Indian presumably Native American Indian making under  of the poverty line you have no copay This section specifically says it only applies to citizens and legal aliens living in the US so no illegal aliens allowedPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  It looks like this section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible to buy insurance It looks like its basically in a roundabout way trying to keep illegal aliens from being qualified for insurance and setting up penalties for anyone who lies on insurance formsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible for the tax credits and the insurance cost reductions that up to  stuff Basically instructing him to set up a system to determine what people qualify for based on their income And also no illegal aliensPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up standard forms and enrollment procedures for statelevel programs like Medicaid and Child Health programsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is allowed to share relevant tax information with those who need it in order to verify what people qualify forPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  All these tax credits and refunds wont count as income So they wont be taxed or anythingPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is instructed to conduct a study into the possibility of adjusting poverty levels based on where people live Because making year in rural Kansas is a hell of a lot different than making year in San FranciscoPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another document the Internal Revenue Code by adding the following sectionPage  Sec Rhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Businesses with  or fewer employees can get a tax credit worth up to  of the cost of the health care they provide their employeesThe following parts deal with The Requirement to Maintain Minimal Essential Coverage AKA The Mandate This is one of the big parts that people have taken issue with and the very same one that the Supreme Court recently ruledhttpwwwsupremecourtgovopinionspdfcapdf is constitutional as long as its seen as a tax and not a penalty for all those lawyertypes out therePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This is a big fat explanation for the reasons behind The Mandate Basically without the mandate people might just decide not to pay for insurance which places a huge risk not just on themselves but the hospitals who will eventually have to treat them when they get sick or injured The economy loses a ton of money due to uninsured people needing emergency care which in turn makes insurance premiums more expensive as that cost is passed on Whats more medical expenses account for  of bankruptcies which introduces even more stress into the economy And with this bill getting rid of preexisting conditions if there was no mandate people would just wait to buy insurance until they need it which pretty much defeats the whole point of insurance In addition requiring people to get insurance will make millions of people healthier and live longer Besides the more healthy people who have insurance the less of a risk insurers are taking which lowers everyones pricesPage  Sec Ahttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This is the actual mandate If you can afford healthcare if it costs less than  of your income but dont get it you will be hit in your tax return with an annual tax of  or up to  of income whichever is greater This will rise to  or  of income by  This section makes an exception for those with religious exemptions the Amish members of Indian tribes and prison inmates It also specifies that no ones going to be charged with any crime or anything its just a new tax if you dont complyPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Insurers need to tell the government who theyre insuring either directly or through employers in which case they need to tell the government which employer theyre working through tooPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This one is changing another bill the Fair Labor Standards Act of  by adding in the following sectionPage  Sec Ahttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  If an employer has over  employees and offers a health plan to those employees new employees will be automatically signed up for that health plan though employees can optout if they dont want itPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This one is changing another bill the Fair Labor Standards Act of  by

Hhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Starting in  if an employer has over  fulltime employees and doesnt offer them insurance the employer has to pay a fee of year per employee If they employ parttime employees their hours are to be added together to see how many fulltime employees theyd represent in other words its not a simple head count The Secretary of Labor is to conduct a report to see what effect this has on employees wagesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another document the Internal Revenue Code by adding the following sectionPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Employers need to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources about the insurance being used by the employees working for themPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another document the Internal Revenue Code by adding that you cant get a plan using an insurance exchange through a cafeteria plan a plan where you specifically pick what is and isnt covered I think this is saying that if youre well enough off that youre going to nitpick the details of your insurance policy you can buy all of the elements of that policy directlyPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section has to do with Free Choice Vouchers Judging from news reports it looks like it has since been repealed It would have required employers to provide these vouchers to employeesPage  Sec Dhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  More on Free Choice Vouchers Again looks like it was
