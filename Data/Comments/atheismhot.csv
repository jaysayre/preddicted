IvyMike,"I think this is one of the most important things we, as a group, can do to improve our image.  The atheists I know in person are generous both with their time and their money, but for whatever reason, polls keep showing that atheists give less money to charities than Christians, even when church-based giving is excluded.

https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/12-faithspirituality/102-atheists-and-agnostics-take-aim-at-christians#.UoVOfhopI08

There are several possible explanations for this, and we can argue about them (and I'm sure someone in the comments will).

But in the end, giving money to worthy charities is something I think we can do better at.  Let's try to close the gap.

Kai_Daigoji,"I know this won't be the most popular opinion here, but here goes:

The Bible isn't fiction.

I don't say that because I'm some sort of fundamentalist (I'm an atheist) or because I believe it's 'true.'  I don't.  I say it because literature is my thing, and we've gotten sloppy with our terms.

Non-fiction doesn't mean 'true', and fiction doesn't mean 'false'.  Both of these are genres that entail a lot of assumptions of how the author intends for the audience to approach the piece of literature.  For example, in fiction, the author knows that the audience will approach it as a narrative story, designed for entertainment.  This is completely different from a piece that is untrue, but non-fiction.

For example, the ancient aliens stuff on history channel isn't presented as fiction.  You could do basically the same show, but mockumentary style, and put it on Sci Fi network (no, I don't mean SyFy, I mean go back in time to when that network was good) and it would be fiction.  But the presentation of the show now is non-fictional.  At our most charitable, we could say that it's people discussing a certain interpretation of history - the show intends for people to take it seriously, even if they aren't convinced.

Which leads me back to the Bible.  Part of the problem with labeling the Bible 'fiction' is that it implies that it is a single book with a single author - nothing could be further from the truth.  The old testament is a collection of myths (creation myths, and founding myths) histories (books that were written as history at the time of their composition, which means something very different that it does today) poems and songs, and books that purport to tell the stories of various prophets.

The New Testament is similar, with new genres being the Gospels (a genre based in biography as it was written in the ancient world), letters, Acts (it's own genre, but there were several others like it that weren't canonized) and an Apocalypse (again, there are other, non canonical ones).

This is the most important thing - the Bible is a collection of books.  It's an anthology, of books sacred to two groups of people, and while some of them may have been intended as something approaching fiction (though that would still mean something different to us than it did at the time of writing) it's wrong to categorical call the Bible all fiction, or all anything.

The Bible belongs in non-fiction, my friends.  Sorry.",null,10,cdhw7hu,1qx9yn,atheism,hot,21

Yes, it may be a fictitious book, but that in itself doesn't give anyone the right to jab at believers. I believe that it should be, amongst other certain texts (i.e. Koran), should be put in a ""Religion"" section. Again, this is a time for tolerance. Having it's own section makes everyone happy.

I understand what the bible says, but honestly the average Christian is a person just like you and me. They really can and sometimes *do* help humanity. And yes, I know we've all seen those crazy nut jobs, but that isn't all of them (just like we atheists aren't **all** what we hope each of us can be). Many people who read the bible know that a lot of it is fucked up, but to them, the good parts are where they like to know/think their religious origins come from.

But for us to go and straight up throw it in a section along side Harry Potter makes us say ""Hey. Each and everyone of you and your thoughts are pretend in every way so I'm going to show it to the world!""

Again, **I believe that religious texts should have their own section. What if someone blended all the fiction books together? We'd have 50 Shades of Grey on the same table as Clifford the Big Red Dog.** To make everyone happy and at peace (especially in a shopping establishment for goodness sakes), just allow for people to go into public and not have someone tell you (or you tell someone) that they're doing things wrong in life.

DumbAsPooDoo,"As a person who has profited a bit from internet marketing, this shit works, as you can unfortunately see. However, I refuse to ever sink as low as using images of kids, sick or healthy. 

So a bit how this works, for those who don't know. Images that provoke a strong emotional response are posted with the requests for likes. Things like sick children or messages of thanksgiving. Many people click 'like' to show support, some click thinking 1 like = 1 prayer. Most of the religious macros you see shared on Facebook are not actually looking to spread religion, but to get people to share the image. If you go to the source of these images, almost always the page that posts them will be filled with similar images and with links peppered in to an offsite. The offsite will most likely be selling a product or service. The hope is that through shares and likes, awareness of the page will grow a huge amount, some people will like the page, and potential buyers are found. Free advertising. Affiliate links are also used. If there aren't any links or attempts to sell anything, chances are that the page admin is attempting to first build an audience to either push a product later or sell the page to someone who wants to sell a product to an audience whose interests are known.

I remember one image in particular that I saw my grandmother share. It was an inspiring bible quote over a pretty image. The image description asked people to like, share, and comment on what they were thankful for. When I followed the link to the source, there were plenty more images like this. Every once in a while there was a link that said ""Are you ready to let Him help you with your finances?"" and linked to a site selling an ebook/method claiming to use Biblical advice to help you deal with money. 

TL;DR - essentially 90% of the images you see like this are people trying to profit in some way. They're gaining an audience and are or will soon be trying to sell something. They are aimed at suckers and generally don't believe in the cause they promote through the images.",null,1,cdhyesb,1qylmp,atheism,hot,6

All religions put defines God as omnipotent and outside of His own creation. You cannot ""change the rules"", refute that, and then say, ""see, I proved your religion wrong"". As an analogue, it's like this: suppose I say that the theory is evolution is the idea that humans are evolved from Pop Tarts. I then refute that by saying that since there are obviously humans before the invention of Pop Tarts, the theory of evolution is therefore false. So, does this mean evolution, as deified by r/atheism, is wrong?

No! I can't unilaterally modify something, refute it, then claim victory. Similarly, Abrahamic religions put God on a pedestal as an omnipotent, eternal being. You can't change *that*, and then go and attack the idea, asking ""God could not be eternal; now, who created God""?. 

No one. The core belief of religion is the omnipotence of God, alpha and omega, without a beginning or an end. If there's a religion that claims God is not omnipotent, then you can ask that question to them. As it is, you're barking at the wrong tree.",null,4,cdhxqka,1qysze,atheism,hot,5

Because anything you say about God can be contradicted in the next breath, and since God doesn't have to be logical both can be true. No properties can be ascribed to God, no qualities excluded from God. Nothing said about God can be either wrong or right. If God is immune to paradoxes, then literally everything theists say about God is meaningless.

I'm an atheist. But, my family is ministers for the Salvation Army. My parents, they were ministers until I was in the third grade, and I've still got Aunts and Uncles, plus cousins who are officers. 2 out of 3 sets of grandparents retired as officers. 

I'll never forget this one time, we were in Russellville, Arkansas, and it was a Sunday night service. This man, if he wasn't homeless, he looked like he was. Multiple layers of clothes, despite the fact it was a rather warm night. And man, he stunk. 

Anyways, he showed up before the service, and he stayed for the entire service. After the service, I noticed my mom and dad approach the man. I didn't hear the conversation, but I noticed that during the service, the man had pissed on himself, and the front of his pants were all wet, as was the pew where he was seated. 

I'll never forget my parents reaction. They opened the food pantry, made the gentleman a box of food, and they offered him a ride home, where ever home happened to be. They offered to pick him up regularly for the services. Basically, they just treated him like a person. And when it was all over, they went back to the church and cleaned the urine out of the padded pews, and cleaned up the van. We didn't end up getting home until pretty late that night, because of the extra effort my parents took with this gentleman. *EDIT: We never saw him again, either. 

Another time, my Uncle Tom, he was also a Salvation Army officer, he showed up to church after having been made up to look like a homeless man. He quietly entered the back of the auditorium before the service and took a seat. Sure enough, people came and introduced themselves to him, welcomed him to the service, offered their pleasantries. Then, my Uncle walks to the front of the service and starts preaching. He was moved to tears that his congregation was either just inherently great people, or they had actually taken some of the lessons he was sharing to heart. 

Just thought I would share my story. Some people are assholes. Some people are pious. If they were more concerned about what Jesus thought, they wouldn't be such assholes.

But while we're bashing, I'd like to point out another form of damage; and I don't feel qualified to judge, so I won't, which is the worse.

This other damage is intellectual. This may not be universally so, but at least in the US it looks to me that clergy realize that the hair-raising nonsense at the core of Christian doctrine can (for the most part) only be swallowed by people with broken faculties of reasoning and critical thinking.

The fundamental component, the magic sauce of almost all religions is this: ""there are facts to be known whose truth can and need not be established by reason and evidence."" Specifically, revelation, ""feelings in the heart"" are a respectable source and justification of true knowledge.

This single assertion, once believed, opens the floodgates to any and every kind of nonsensical assertion:

* Aliens in UFOs are anal-probing us, 
* our souls live on when we die, 
* black cats influence our fates with their movements
* some people have privileged, non-worldly access to our dead relatives and knowledge of the future

...and so on. I think it was Voltaire who said, ""if you can believe in a man walking on water, you can believe anything."" As a result, huge segments of the population in the US (and elswhere, of course) are deliberately raised with broken truth meters. Or, stated more plainly, for the benefit of religion, the country's youth is brought up to be a population of gullible idiots.

Every once in a while, in /r/science and elsewhere I run across articles describing some achievement that seems too good to be true:

* a pharmacist mixing plastics in his kitchen developed a thermal plating that can resist thousands of degrees of heat;
* an African girl has developed a cheap and simple process for extracting electricity from urine;
* an American researcher now collaborating with NASA has developed a cold-fusion reactor that produces energy from converting (IIRC) copper into tin.

When people like me point out some obvious objections to the possibility of these claims, we get jumped by hordes of these gullible idiots who admonish us for being close-minded, or who point out that applying scientific arguments to these claims isn't conclusive because science has been wrong before.

Now people can be poorly educated, poorly informed and just plain wrong about things without the ""benefit"" of religion, of course. But I for one have a big problem with religion's persistent efforts to keep people gullible so they can swallow the bullshit.

And my relatives then have the gall to tell me that perhaps the same religion that terrified me as a child is the answer to my still-present depression and anxiety as an adult. 

As much as I tried to cling to faith, I only ever managed to believe in the parts that made me miserable. And when I mention that, I'm told I wasn't doing it right.

Her logic was that she didn't do a good job raising me if I questioned God. I was 10 years old when this happened. I got the hell talk several times growing up.

In order to understand what the writers intended, one has to look through the lens of cultural understanding. To understand what Jesus meant about ""loving your neighbor"", for example, one has too look at the audience Jesus was speaking to, and the culture surrounding that group. As an example, the meaning of ""christian"" has a *very* different meaning in the US when compared to Jordan, so when looking at ""interpreting"" the bible, especially the new testament, I recommend doing a bit of research into what the literature says, as well as who it was written to, rather than on supposed traditional church teachings.

fierceredpanda,"I certainly can relate. Where animals are concerned, I really wish I could buy into the whole ""Rainbow Bridge"" thing, because I know that when my beloved cat passes away, I will be an absolute mess. The human-animal bond can be exceptionally strong, and it doesn't seem fair that something so powerful can be terminated forever. But it's important to remember that the universe and life aren't concerned with what seems fair - they just are what they are, and false comfort is always false before it is comforting.

Bigger losses - that's hard. Shortly after I finally decided to out myself as an atheist, after a lot of self-denial, my wife's grandfather and my grandfather passed away (both from strokes) within three days of each other. At both funerals and visitations, I remember thinking and feeling a lot of things. I'll list them here, just for examples.

* A degree of happiness. Funerals are *supposed* to be celebrations of the deceased's life. In the case of grandparents, look at the family they created. Imperfect, but a family nonetheless. The idea that what we do while we live has no meaning after we die - that's total nonsense. Even people with no families - look at all the people from entirely different backgrounds who are invariably brought together to say goodbye. Take comfort from that. There doesn't have to be any afterlife for our life right now to have meaning.

* At the same time, there is the sadness and awkward loneliness of sitting at a funeral, listening to religious invocations and thinking about how empty it sounds. Even in the case of someone who died after a long, protracted illness, hearing things like ""He/She is in a better place now"" just sounds so hollow and degrading to this life, the one that matters.  And I think it's difficult feeling like you're the only person at the gathering who isn't comforted by mentions of Heaven or salvation. Certainly it would be a social faux pas to rain on everyone's parade and say, flat out: ""This is all bullshit."" Instead, a nonbeliever has to keep those feelings bottled up, unless there's someone you know to be like-minded around. In my case, I waited until I got home from both funerals and sought out someone I knew would at least listen. Ignoring grief doesn't make it go away. Ever.

* As a corollary to the last point, I'll mention entirely without shame that I cried my eyes out at my grandfather's visitation. The reason was simple: I knew for a fact that, despite what anyone else said, I was and am never going to see him again. That *should* make anyone sad. Again, I think it's important not to lean on false consolation. Remember the good times, and know that a very real piece of the deceased still remains as long as you remember them. 

* I'll add as a final note: Humor, even of the gallows variety, can go a long, long way to ease the feelings of loss. Laughter really is the best medicine.",null,1,cdi4a1i,1qznpv,atheism,hot,3
johnnyfiend,"You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.

And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.

And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. Amen.

Translation: Only the young ones will believe our bullshit, because trusting adults is wired into their DNA, so it's of utmost importance that we focus on them the most. Because our cowardly, bullshit religion is dead otherwise.

&gt;So many churches have no ministry to young people and that means they have no interest in the future.

Yes, because NO ONE ELSE ON EARTH has any interest in the future. THIS is the arrogance that we talk about, Christians. You act like your sorry, sick ass 2000 year old religion is the author of EVERYTHING, when the fact is that it STOLE most of it's tenants from older religions.

No one EVER loved, laughed, cried, felt shame, enjoyed life (even though you freaks can't wait to die - SUPPOSEDLY), cared about the future, had civil laws, had societies, was ever good or thought about ANYTHING other than themselves - until CHRISTIANITY, THE MOST GREEDY, LAZY AND SOLIPSISTIC RELIGION EVER came along and gave people purpose.

Shove your bullshit up your ass, dog of Jehovah.

&gt;Free college if you keep the baby.

Not exactly 100% untrue actually, there are many grants for single mothers and single fathers, and grants for all parents in general. But college is far from free even with grants. In any case, there is no formal program to my knowledge that would pay for your education 100% if you had a child. 

&gt;My boyfriend would leave me if I had an abortion

Well obviously, this can be true or untrue based upon the guy, circumstances and the woman. That being said this is not as much about your boyfriend as about you, it is true that he will be the father of the child if you so choose to keep it, but it cannot be guaranteed he would stay or leave in either case.

&gt;It would hurt my relationship with g-d.

This simply varies too much. 

&gt;I would become infertile 

**Please note that because of bias's and false information, it can be hard to find real information pregnancies after abortion**

[Planned parenthood makes no mention of this on their website](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures-4359.asp) however, a source for women who are trying to get pregnant, [babycenter.com](http://www.babycenter.com/404_does-a-past-abortion-affect-my-chances-of-getting-pregnant_6148.bc) says that having an abortion may have a little to no effect on future pregnancies, but there are exceptions and mild complications. 

&gt;Birth control leads to cancer

There is actually some truth to this believe it or not, but keep reading it is not what you think. according to [cancer.gov](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/oral-contraceptives) oral contraceptives (aka the pill) actually can raise breast cancer risk slightly, however going off the pill for 10 years can reduce this risk back down to normal levels, risk to cancer of the cervix also goes up slightly.

Brad_The_Impaler_,"My thoughts on ""In God We Trust""......I think it is important to clarify what exactly ""In God We Trust"" really means within the confines of our society......There is always the argument that in ""God We Trust"", is an all encompassing phrase that covers the God/Gods of every religion. This is simply not the case, this statement obviously refers to the God of the Abrahamic religions; the most prominent being Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. If the phrase is examined from a contextual standpoint, if we look at who feels it is important and defends it; it becomes a phrase rightly associated in this country with Christianity. In all cases the phrase being official, being placed on our currency etc... is a blatant violation of the constitution and the idea of both freedom of religion and the separation of church and State..................So basically the phrase violates the constitutional rights of anyone who is not from and Abrahamic religion( really anyone who is not a Christian), and those who are agnostic or atheist.

&gt;Rep. Saccone has introduced a bill that calls for the national motto of 'In God We Trust' to be displayed in all public schools on grounds that it ""is our heritage from Pennsylvania, and our children and grandchildren need to see and remember their heritage that united a nation.""

&gt;In God We Trust is a motto that has been clung to in the most dire times of this nation. When brother killed brother at Antietam, 'In God We Trust' rang across the battlefield. When faced with nuclear annihilation from the Soviet Union, we began printing it on our paper currency. When frightened by the threat of terrorism, we officially adopted it as our national motto.

&gt;The motto 'E Pluribus Unum' was on first drafts of the Great Seal of the United States presented to founding fathers in Philadelphia. As much as it pains me as a Pittsburgher to say it, that is a heritage and motto we should be proud of in Pennsylvania. Not a motto used in times of fear but one that gives faith in your fellow citizen. In your community. In your government. That even though we come from many different cultures, beliefs, and ancestries we are one America and one Pennsylvania.
&gt;
&gt;If all instances of 'In God We Trust' were amended to instead read 'E Pluribus Unum' I would be in favor.

Dudesan,"[From the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq#wiki_should_i_come_out_to_my_parents_as_being_an_atheist.3F):

**Should I come out to my parents as being an atheist?**

The short answer is ""No.""

The slightly longer answer is that if you are not in a position where that is likely to end well for you, you should probably wait until you're more self-sufficient. However, you know your own parents better than we do. You could try breaking the ice on the subject of atheism to get a feel for their reaction to it in general, if you're not sure. Always keep in mind that for many people religion is a highly emotive subject, and for many parents who have been raised to believe in the ""moral superiority"" of religious belief, a child who comes out as an atheist can be interpreted as a betrayal of them or as a failure of their own.

In some religions, it can actually be dangerous to ""out"" yourself. If your father is a hardline Muslim, for example, getting kicked out of the house is the least of your worries. You risk being beheaded or set on fire. If you're coming from one of those, keep that in mind as well.

r/atheism will almost invariably respond that you should wait. A common proverb here is ""The best place to come out to your parents is at a home you own, over a dinner that you paid for yourself"".",null,8,cdidvme,1r0pf7,atheism,hot,76

DetailedVenom,"Bit late to the party here but I'll add my 2 cents.

When I was growing up I was raised Jewish, no one in my family is Jewish except my paternal grandfather, and since we were from Russia we wouldn't have been allowed to practice anyway. My mother always wanted me to be raised a Jew, probably for my grandfather's sake.

From day 1 I didn't believe any of it. I fell asleep in temple, I never paid attention in Hebrew school, and I was yelled at twice by our Rabbi for being disruptive. When I turned 13 I had my Bar Mitzvah, I memorized the whole verse I had to read since I couldn't actually read Hebrew (because of the not paying attention). After that was 3 more years of going to temple dressed in the shawl and Kippah that my parents paid a lot of money for.

At 16 I told my mother I wasn't going to temple anymore, and at 18 I told her I didn't believe in god. I don't think she believes me, but she isn't a hardcore religious nut, she just wanted to appease her dad, and it did.

Point of the story, I am happy that I went through that. Not for any cynical reason, but it is because of the kind of understanding you can only get from experiencing something. At 13, I scoffed at religion and thought I understood all it had to offer. Looking back now, at 24, I realize how dumb I was.

You need to understand something very important, you are a young fool. All humans are stupid on some level, but most aren't aware of their own stupidity. Everyone does what they think is right, but very few people allow for the possibility that they are wrong. 

While I agree with your assessment of Christianity, I don't think you are old enough to really understand the implications of religion and what it could mean to your life. It's going to suck doing things you don't believe in, but you may gain something out of it in the end.

Do your research for BOTH sides of the argument. There is nothing wrong with being a christian. YES the chruch has issues, some of them really large, but Christianity does teach SOME incredibly solid values. 

I grew up in the church. I haven't been for quite some time, but i wouldn't have rather grown up in any other home. 

My parents were respectful and faithful to each other, kind to others, incredibly generous, and very fair to their children. Of course this can happen in Athiest homes as well but the belief does do well to try and make people genuine.

xiipaoc,"I'm going to disagree with everyone and say that nobody here but you can make this decision.

Let's start with some social issues.  Do your parents accept gay marriage?  Do they believe 100% in the catechism of the Catholic Church (I saw in another comment that your family is Catholic)?  How do they feel about women being priests?  Find out where they stand on a variety of social issues.  It may be that they care about the Church -- it's their home congregation, after all -- but don't actually agree with much of its doctrine.  You can tell them that you're having theological difficulties if you think there won't be much risk.  Again, it depends on how obsessed with believing in religion they are, and note that religion isn't the same as belief.  For example, I'm Jewish.  I know a lot more about Judaism than my parents, and I go to synagogue sometimes too, which my parents don't do at all, not even on the High Holidays.  My parents think I go overboard with it, even though I don't actually observe dietary or Shabbat restrictions or anything like that; I just say prayers and sing songs and have meals.  I wasn't actually atheist when I was 13 -- though I was never actually observant -- but if I had been, I think my parents would have wanted me to have a bar-mitzvah anyway.  For us, Judaism is a family tradition, and we may not observe it very strongly, but we observe it at least a little bit.  We never believed in the literal truth of the Bible, for instance.  So when I casually mentioned to my parents that I'm atheist -- late in my 20's -- the thing that surprised me the most was that they didn't already know.  I thought I'd mentioned it years earlier.  I guess it had just never come up in conversation before and I didn't realize it.

Anyway, that long story was to bring up the point that your parents may not actually care that you're atheist, but they might care about you being a Catholic even if you don't believe their shit, because your parents might not believe their shit either.

I think that if you have parents that are willing to discuss this with you and try to answer any particular questions, then talk to them. IF they're the types to try to convert you back at any cost, then you might want to hold off on telling them. Not because there is no Jesus (cause none of us really know) but because you need to know what you think for yourself without anyone guilt tripping you.

-- ""Sorcery"".  I love that some Christians think that sorcery and witchcraft and magic are real.  It makes me shake my head and laugh.   Grown men and women actually fear sorcery.

-- ""Militant"" seems to be written in above ""Homosexuality"" as an afterthought.  Perhaps it's to protect the author and all those hardcore anti-homos who have turned out to be gay.  ""Oh, sure, they're homosexuals, but they're not MILITANT homosexuals.  Those are the bad kind.""

-- The NEA is anti-racism, anti-segregation, anti-guns in school, and pro-equality for rich and poor in education.  Of COURSE they're the bad guys.

Also, the ""Body of Christ"" is a part of the Eucharist, a sacrament provided by a religious elder, since there are no religiously defined employees in Public Schools the ""Body of Christ"" wouldn't be present anyways.

disharmonia,"I know there's going to be a storm about this, so I'm going to just jump in right here.

I work at an abortion clinic.  I am a health educator that goes over medical history with the patients and then explains their aftercare instructions and what they can expect.  Since I'm the person they get to sit down with and talk to, I'm usually the one that goes through their situation with them and sort of ""counsels"" them.

We go up to 23 weeks and 6 days.  We used to be able to go up to 26 weeks until the state capped us at 20.  An injuction has allowed us to continue to go up to 23 weeks and 6 days, at least for the time being.

Abortions after twenty weeks are *very very important*.  If you live in a state where abortions are capped, please, *please* try to help with advocates trying to overturn those laws.

While amniocentesis can be performed at 16 weeks, the results are iffy at best, with some fetal anomalies not being able to be detected until the 18th week at the earliest.  Most amnios happen around 19 weeks, and the results can take up to 10 days to come back.

This means that most women will have *no idea* if their infant has a fetal anomaly until after 20 weeks.  This isn't just 'some' FAs are detected after 20 weeks.  I mean that the vast majority are.

In my time at the clinic, I have seen exactly *one* first tri FA patient.  Meanwhile I regularly see four to five each week in their second trimester.  They almost universally over 20 weeks.

You also have to take into account that women don't instantly know if they want to continue with an FA pregnancy.  There are a lot of anomalies that leave no choice(no brain, no kidneys, etc), but there are ones like Downs that means the parents often have to sit down together and decide whether or not they're capable of caring for a special needs child.

For parents who've spent months bonding with their unborn infant, this can be an absolutely wrenching decision.  It can take weeks.  And yet most of them have to told that they have only a few days to make up their mind -- after that, they're SOL.

Most of the clients I see over 20 weeks are FA clients, but there are also a reasonable amount of non-FA clients.  Most of those remaining ones are minors.

Because teenagers don't have regular periods, and because they're teenagers, it takes awhile for them to become aware that they're pregnant.  Then there's the fact that the vast majority are extremely unwilling to inform their parents.  As our state requires the parent to be present, unless the minor has a judicial bypass, there's nothing we can do for them until they inform their parents.

Often times, this means weeks can pass before actions that need to be taken are taken.  Most of my under-18 clients are second trimester.

I've also booked appointments for women who reach 20 weeks without being aware that they're pregnant.  This is more common than you'd expect -- it's very possible to have a consistent period while pregnant.  I know people boggle at the idea of a show about people who didn't know they were pregnant until they gave birth, but stop to think about that for a moment:  *that happens often enough that they could make a show about it.*

And no, those people aren't just idiots or rednecks.  I've seen women at 22 weeks that are skinnier than I am.  Pregnancy is not just one, predictable condition.  It can be different for every woman, and let me tell you, it can be *weird*.  There's a reason we have an entire medical field devoted to it.

For those who still don't get the importance of second trimester abortions: we had a few women testify before the state house when the law limiting us to 20 weeks was being debated.  They were women who'd had Potter's Syndrome babies, wherein the kidneys do not form.  This means that the baby can live so long as its inside the mother, using her as a dialysis machine, but once its born, it'll live for 2-3 days, then die.  There is no current cure or treatment.

This basically means that if a mother can't get an abortion, she is forced to carry her child with a death sentence on its head to term.  I still remember one woman talking about how she'd go to the store and people asking her what names she was picking out, and she'd think to herself ""They think I'm planning a nursery, when all I'm planning is a funeral.""

Due to these testimonies, House Democrats proposed an amendment saying that fatal problems with the fetus would be exempt.  House Republicans, being the majority, voted down the amendment.

Thankfully, the injunction is allowing us to still see women who're under 24 weeks, but things are far from settled.

Second trimester abortions are extremely important -- don't underestimate that.",null,2,cdj37cf,1r28r6,atheism,hot,41

Repost responding to questions about C.S. Lewis' apologetic writings;

---------

Here's my take on it;

* I focus on the ideas of the person I am talking with.  

* Even when someone borrows an idea from someone else, they aren't that other person.  They are giving their own interpretation of that other person's ideas.  

* Since it always comes back to what the person I am talking to thinks, why don't they skip bringing in some third party and use their own ideas -- ones that they understand and are able to discuss passionately and intelligently?
 
*[ Note: This is why I hate plagiarists.  Not only are they promoting someone else's work as their own (stealing and/or lying), but they often don't really have a very good grasp of what the other person actually meant.  This frequently leads to awkward questions that the thief can't give an informed response to -- yet they often don't realize that they aren't giving an informed response. ]*

In the case of Lewis;

* If his ideas were still of primary interest to Christians, they would use them in their own arguments.

* Back to the top: There is no reason to focus on Lewis when there's a living person to talk to who has their own ideas.  Lewis is unavailable.",null,3,cdiv61e,1r2e8g,atheism,hot,4

I doubt anyone has absolutely no beliefs whatsoever about where we come from, what consciousness is, how life originated and what are our goals in life.  
If you are talking about family, loved ones and people you want to be happy with in the long term, there is no point or gain in offending them.  They will probably be offended anyway.  
When I had to defend my initial atheism, and they claimed god this, jesus that, sin and virtue, etc. I just said, ""well I happen to not believe that, it makes no sense to me"" and when they asked for a better explanation just said ""I don't know, I don't need to know, I haven't replaced certainty with better certainty, I have embraced doubt and ignorance as a feature of humankind, that is more likely to be true than magic certainty"".

""Excuse me. I'm sorry, but you seem to be mistaken. You must have thought I am a subject, a thing to be trivialized, open to discussion, wrong, and in need of justifying myself to the likes of you or anyone. In truth, you are wrong on all accounts.""

&gt; and criticisms,

""Excuse me, once again, but it seems you have been misled to believe I give a flying fuck about your pretentious opinions, when in fact I don't, I never asked you, and I certainly never invited you to share with me. To be absolutely clear, whatever you have to say on the subject, I don't want to hear it. And if you can't handle that, then we need to re-evaluate our relationship.""

&gt; How would y'all handle the situation?

Just like that. I don't ask them, I don't pry, I don't judge, and I don't care. And the day before they find out about me, neither did they in kind. Everything is alright so long as I conform to your world view? To your expectations? FUCK YOU. I've got people in my life better than the judgmental pricks in my family.

That's not unconditional love. That's not mutual respect. In that case, as my grandfather taught me, ""they need me more than I need them."" That's damn right.

&gt; How do y'all explain your beliefs (or lack there of) to people who do not agree with you?

I don't need to justify myself to anyone, my position does not need defending, and I can't battle a foe (philosophically speaking) who is unyielding, unchanging, unwilling to be wrong. There is no debate, there is no educating these people, they are going to pepper you with questions and ridicule not because they want to enlighten you, or be enlightened, but because in their mind, they're infalliable. They're not worth your time.

The sooner you can identify these mindsets (people aren't made of stone, their mood can change and become approachable at the right time), the sooner you can avoid them.

The first thing you need to do, though, is establish your confidence, your willpower, your dominance, and your command over your domain. A family party is no place to be holding this conversation, and it is absolutely rude and unacceptable that they would flat out call you out in front of others, or not first ask you permission. HOW DARE THEY?!? If you wish to address me, you will do so politely, respectfully, and at the whims of my discretion. You came to me, I didn't come to you, so I don't care if you're a child, my grandparent, or the President, you will not disprespect me.

I'm sounding quite harsh, but that's because we're on the internet and I have a point to get across. You need to stand and be confident, and don't get treated like a child. You're old enough to expose yourself to a hostile group, you're old enough to act like an adault and not take shit.

--- But to address your question directly, I speak matter of factly. I define the terms belief, and why accept and deny are better than believe or disbelieve, and faith, and explain their consequences, I define proof, evidence, what falsifiable is, and what the credentials of a definition of a god, and will walk through their consequences (how every definition basically fails); I knock out fantasy and reality, and destroy the supernatural or any notion that god can exist outside space or time, and I come to my conclusion. All this is, most importantly, with an air that this is not a debate. I am confident, I will not be moved, they were not invited to forward a counter argument, I can stop this at any time; I already understand their position, usually better than they do, and so I don't need to hear it.

&gt; Also, what are some good arguments you can make that is for atheism?

I can't even think of any anymore. It's not worth the argument. You can't change people, and you're not going to. Psychology research this year has reported the more you challenge a person's belief, the tighter they cling to it. You can only change yourself.

My mom obviously wishes that I was not atheist but by her own admission, she knew that was a possible outcome. I asked her from time to time why she decided to not impose religion upon me and her answer is always the same ""It has to be YOUR belief, not mine"".

This works great with bibles in hotel rooms, for instance. Take a highlighter and highlight some ridiculous passage condoning rape, or slavery, or murder, fold the page in like marking your place, and put it back in the drawer.

In the case of children's books, a great thing to do is to past an image from the story on the inside cover, depicting the reality of it, before donating it to the local Sunday school or church.

&gt; DEAR BETRAYED: You could teach your son an important lesson by changing your own sexuality to show him how easy it is. Try it for the next year or so: Stop being a heterosexual to demonstrate to your son that a person’s sexuality is a matter of choice — to be dictated by one’s parents, the parents’ church and social pressure.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume that my suggestion will evoke a reaction that your sexuality is at the core of who you are. The same is true for your son. He has a right to be accepted by his parents for being exactly who he is.
&gt; 
&gt; When you “forget” a child’s birthday, you are basically negating him as a person. It is as if you are saying that you have forgotten his presence in the world. How very sad for him.
&gt; 
&gt; Pressuring your son to change his sexuality is wrong. If you cannot learn to accept him as he is, it might be safest for him to live elsewhere.

I would wager that this letter was submitted to the paper as a joke. Granted, there are some pretty out there and clueless people in the world, but that seems to me to be a bit too much. But regardless of that…

I am getting kinda sick of the whole ""being gay is a choice/being gay is biological"" argument. Whatever homosexuality stems from is not important. At all. As for myself, I am gay. Whether I choose to be this way or whether I was born this way has no bearing on anyone other than me. So what if homosexuality is a choice? What’s it to you? The choice of where I stick my dick only matters to me and to the person into which I choose to consentually stick my dick. It's not something that needs to be academically debated. It's not something that other people need to agonize over or even discuss at all because it is none of their concern. Other people don’t get to have an opinion on this matter. Whatever your personal moral beliefs are, you have no right to subject me to them. So let people say homosexuality is a choice. It’s a choice that I am allowed to make that doesn’t affect you at all, so you have no right to tell me I can’t make it. If I choose to paint the walls of my living room green, if I choose to have Subway instead of Wendy’s for lunch, or whether I choose to be gay or straight has no bearing on anyone’s life but mine. Just because you have cultural bullshit to deal with doesn’t mean you get to rain on my parade. 

Personally, I don’t believe homosexuality is a choice. When I look at a hot dude and I get a boner, it’s because of a chemical reaction in my brain triggering sexual arousal. Choice has nothing to do with it. But neither does anyone else’s opinion.  In a manner of speaking, I do choose to be gay. I choose to ogle and stare when I see a hot guy on the street. I don’t care if it makes him uncomfortable. Straight guys do it to women all the time. It’s a fucking compliment, get over it. I wish someone would do it to me. I choose to gush over the most recent episodes of Project Runway and I watch Supernatural in the hopes that Dean and Castiel will finally lay the liplock on each other. If I had a husband I would plaster my desk with pictures of us holding hands at Disney and kissing on the beach like every straight couple in the world does. And you know what? None of that requires anyone else’s understanding or approval.

A friend of mine who is a biology teacher said to me once that “homosexuality is an aberration in the brain chemistry. But it is a benign aberration. It has no bearing on the survivability of the individual organism, and if a small portion – like, I don’t know, 10% or so - of the population (especially in a species like humans that has no widespread breeding issues whatsoever) has it, it doesn’t negatively affect the survivability of the species either. So religious busybodies should mind their own fucking business.”

“Why would anyone choose to be gay?” Fuck that. If it was up to me I would choose to be gay. I love it and I don’t give two shits if anyone doesn’t like it.

TL:DR - So what if homosexuality is a choice? I choose it. It doesn't affect you in any way. Fuck off.",null,3,cdj2soa,1r2kbx,atheism,hot,15

CanAmChris,"Hey Boondock112, welcome to the reboot. It took me almost 40 years until I realized that a huge part of how I looked at things was because I was born in South Eastern Pennsylvania and was sent to catholic school as a child.

When I realized that religion is based on geography I had the same 'oh shit' moment that you might have had.

I always thought and was taught that having empathy was reserved for the religious who had a 'moral standard'

When I lifted the blinders I saw that the 'Moral Standard' was dictated by the guy who stands in front of everyone on Sundays telling them how to live and think and what is right and wrong.

That is when I called bullshit on it all.

Life is very simple now for me.

I do what is right. It's a simple concept that religion tries to manipulate to it's own ends. 

&gt;I no longer judge people, I am open to other people's lifestyles, and I try to help people as much as humanly possible. I have opened my mind to new experiences and knowledge that my family had taught me were ""wrong"".

This is key. There is no such think as ""wrong"" knowledge as long as your source is reliable and accurate.

In your search for knowledge please equate it to truth and fact and evidence.

If at any point you read or hear something that makes you question it's truth or has no facts for support or lacks evidence then you are well to dismiss it. It is your obligation to dismiss any idea that can not meet a burden of proof.

As I said. Welcome to the reboot. We are all born Atheists and your journey is just beginning.

2. why does he let bad things happen within the world. - No god, no 'let'. Bad things and good things are merely the perception of humans.

science_diction,"Define: ""God"".

When you do that, I will be more than happy to give you my personal perspective on it.

As for an ""atheist"" perspective, there are only two:

1) agnostic atheism: there is no evidence to support claims of a god

2) gnostic atheism: evidence definitively proves a god cannot exist in reality (due to either philosophy or science).

""If God is so loving and graceful etc. then why does he let bad things happen within the world?""

The terms ""evil"" and ""good"" are entirely subjective. One man's ""good"" is another man's ""evil"" and vice versa. Principles have to be based on something more tangible than a label to be effective. Furthermore, if the Christian god is without time (immortal), I don't really see how good and evil have any meaning whatsoever when ""t"" is removed from the equation. Nor do I see why an immortal being would even care about something as trivial as human existence - or I should say ""seemingly trivial from that perspective"".

""I am a Christian, I'm up for friendly debates. If anybody disagrees with me, or anyone do so respectfully.""

I am an atheist. I am up for discussion. I am more interested in how people think rather than what they think. I have never had a ""debate"" with a Christian, because a ""debate"" implies both sides accept the possibility they can be wrong. Religious people have ""faith"".

If a deity exists, it knows that I am a skeptic (and I would argue that it created me to be skeptical).  Further, it knows already exactly what evidence would convince me.  Since it is omnipotent, it is obviously capable of providing me with evidence.

Many religions claim that ""God loves us, and wants a relationship with us.""  If this claim is true, then this deity would already have provided me with the evidence I need to believe in it - especially if my eternal salvation depends on it.

If religion's claims were true, I would already be a believer it seems.

The southern and central parts of the country though are very homogenous. Overall, any difference in these regions is easily noticed, wether based on race, religion or behaviors. As such atheists in these areas are extremely vulnerable. Their presence upsets people, most likely because they embody an insecurity in the people around them. Those having a crisis of faith see someone openly not believing and will blame everything they connect with that feeling on that person.

Unfortunately, there's no clear evidence in the Bible that Genesis is meant to be allegory, and in fact there's some evidence that many key biblical figures, including Jesus and the Apostles, understood the Genesis account of creation to be the literal truth.

ninterd,"&gt; Creationists and atheists both too often mistake it for a challenge to the existence of God.

When we say this, we specifically talk about the Gods of the religions with a different creation story.

&gt;The reason I take it to be a non-issue is because, while it explains a great deal about the origin of life on earth, it does little to explain the more elementary questions of universal origins.

It's not supposed to explain anything else. And it's not even about the origin of life, but the changes over time.

&gt;If the universe can be shown to be infinite and eternal in the past, there would be no need to posit the existence of God; the universe would be self-sufficient.

Saying God is necessary for a finite universe is just an assumption. Evidence please.

&gt;However, if you take the Big Bang theory as being scientifically true- as most cosmologists do- then you have a valid, sufficient, and nearly necessary reason to posit the existence of something, at the very least, like God.

No, not at all. Maybe I don't understand where you're getting at, but the Big Bang theory does not imply a God at all. And the theory doesn't make an illogical belief like God justified.

&gt; If something like the universe, and thereby space and time- have a beginning, then it is finite.

Well, maybe, I don't see this as a problem, though. But I am not sure whether this is necessarily the case, ask a scientist.

&gt;What is finite is contingent, and what is contingent requires something beyond itself upon which it might exist.

Here we go again with just illogical assumptions. Maybe I've misunderstood the definition of contingent, because English isn't my first language, but wouldn't a contingent universe disprove a personal creator?

&gt; The only thing beyond the finite is the infinite; so, if the universe is finite, it requires something infinite as its cause.

Again, you're just *assuming*.

&gt;By inductive reasoning, you can assess what sorts of characteristics this cause would have by logical necessity. And some folks, like myself, find that the logical description of that cause is very similar to the traditional characteristics attributed to God- i.e. changelessness, timelessness, immateriality, infinity, etc.

By illogical ""reasoning"", you can assume that because you can't accept something we don't fully understand, a god must have done it. But you completely ignore the problems the God question itself creates. How could a God possibly exist? Why would God do this? Why would you assume that God exists? Why does the universe need a specific creator while God doesn't? How can you justify belief in something infinite (which we have no concept of at all, it's impossible to understand completely)?

no they do not. The big bang is currently the model that fits best and is far from being ""proven"" that being said your finite / infinite argument is no longer valid as you have no evidence for either.

Feinberg,"&gt;However, if you take the Big Bang theory as being scientifically true- as most cosmologists do- then you have a valid, sufficient, and nearly necessary reason to posit the existence of something, at the very least, like God.

Well, you don't really. You have a reason to think that the universe expanded out from a point, but there's not really much to fuel speculation about events before the Big Bang. We just plain don't know what happened before the Big Bang. Positing a deity is unnecessary.

&gt;If something like the universe, and thereby space and time- have a beginning, then it is finite.

We don't actually know that they had a beginning, though, and even if they did, we don't know that something existed before that beginning. 

&gt;What is finite is contingent, and what is contingent requires something beyond itself upon which it might exist.

Everything which has been observed to have a beginning has a cause, but the origin of the universe is a unique event and a unique class of events. We don't know enough about universe origins to say that the things which apply to toasters and stars apply to the universe. Also, again, we don't know that the universe if finite. All we know is that observable matter appears to be moving away from a single point. 

Another problem with this line of thinking is that one part of it, the necessity for things to have a creator or cause, rests squarely on what we know to be true of mundane objects through mundane observation. The other part, the deity, requires the introduction of an entity with an abundance of supernatural properties which we have no basis to expect are possible. There is no precedent to support the idea that something can be infinite or exist outside time and space, for instance. Frankly, if we had reason to expect that these things were possible, it would make more sense to apply them to the universe itself than a deity.

If everything needs a creator, then God would need a creator as well, and that creator would need a creator, ad infinitum. If it's possible for something to exist infinitely without a creator, then Occam's Razor would necessitate disproving an infinite universe before positing a creator for the universe.

Finally, even if it somehow made sense to assert that the universe was caused to exist, there is absolutely no reasonable bridge between that assertion and any specific, personal, intelligent deity. ",null,0,cdj75hd,1r3erq,atheism,hot,5
taterbizkit,"&gt;  By inductive reasoning, you can assess what sorts of characteristics this cause would have by logical necessity.

This sentence is confusing.  Logical necessity is the language of *deduction*, not induction.

Let's narrow down what ""universe"" means.  We live in a spacetime continuum that may or may not be the entirety of all existence.  Or, it could exist within some other framework, context, structure or whatever.  Which one is the ""universe"" ?

For the sake of discussion, I'm using ""universe"" to mean everything that exists in its entirety.  This is the only context in which this discussion is meaningful, since what good does it do to say that our spacetime contiuum had a creator, but not ask whether or not the creator exists within some finite context of its own?  This also eliminates advanced alien beings from consideration, since they too would live within a finite context. 

It also eliminates matrix-like universes, since the software would have to run on some hardware that, itself, existed in a non-simulated, finite context.

So we're down at the roots, here.  The absolute origin of all origins.

As you say, it may be possible to intuit certain characteristics that it ought to have.  Infinity sounds reasonable, just based on your initial argument.  I'm not sure ""changeless"" counts, because our coming-into-existence would be a change.  Immateriality -- this word loses its meaning once you're outside of our spacetime.  So does time -- I'm not comfortable with ""timelessness"" for this reason.  It's undefined.

So we've got infinity left still.  ""Infinite"" *seems* to still be meaningful I guess, assuming even that ""finite"" isn't a context-sensitive term that only has meaning to us as conscious beings.  So maybe whatever-it-is is infinite.

That's a lot of mental effort for not much result.  How much does ""So, it's infinite I guess"" sound like a god?

On the other hand, if whatever-it-is is warped back on itself in 4 dimensions (like a sphere in 3, or a ring in 2), then it can totally be *finite* and give rise to other finite things, without itself having an origin in the infinite.  It doesn't even need to be timeless, if it's warped back on itself in the time dimension.  It could just be cyclical and entirely uncaused.

Yeah, I don't think we can draw *any* conclusions about it at all, to be honest.  I don't think induction or even deduction is going to get you *anywhere*, if you're trying to do this in your head with a scientific layperson's understanding of cosmology.  No *a priori* conclusion is going to be compelling.

As always, this question boils down to *only one reasonable answer*:

There are quite a number of cosmological theories that include what could be termed a big bang. However they are sufficiently different from each other to make this kind of generalization invalid. As two examples some theories posit a cyclic universe where what existed before the big bang was another universe that collapsed, potentially ad infinitum. While in others time is seen as thing that only started at the big bang, meaning that there is no before, and the question of what happened before the big bang just does not make sense. 

So in asserting that either the universe is eternal or some god created it you are creating a [false dichotomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma). 

&gt; What is finite is contingent, and what is contingent requires something beyond itself 

The idea that everything needs a cause has been show to be false. Indeed what we seem to observe is that at the lowest level things happen without a cause all the time. To give it a label you seem to be using the 
[Ontological Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument) for the existence of god. 

&gt; if the universe is finite, it requires something infinite as its cause. 

let me do a little word replacement to test that:

If a car is finite, it requires something infinite as its cause. No I can't say that I find that assertion particularly likely. 

&gt; you can assess what sorts of characteristics this cause would have by logical necessity.

Clearly I disagree. However even if I didn't it would be a long
 way from Some kind of god exists to the Trinity, Allah,
 Brahman or Xenu exists. But then this seems to be a common error that theology seems to make all the time, come up with some vague blurred argument that seems to support the existence of some kind of god, and then jump to and therefor you must all bow down to the great Gewgew up the mountain.  

&gt; Anyway, just wanted to say that some theists give a great deal of thought to the reason for their belief.

The problem lies in the question being asked not in the amount of effort invested. The problem is that the conclusion, that ""my particular brand of god is correct"" is a non negotiable assumption, that is why its called [Apologetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics).",null,0,cdj8z0q,1r3erq,atheism,hot,3

It is tremendously convenient to dismiss all of life and biology for the sake of your argument. And isn't it this the way it goes? Scientists research and test, probing the unknown or not-well-known, until we have a sufficiently robust body of evidence to dispel the naive, supernatural explanations of our forebears. Where once god was an essential part of the explanation of life, we now have an ever-mounting collection of non-supernatural explanations. Who said, ""...God becomes an ever-retreating pocket of uncertainty""?

The problem is that the author confuses science with scientism. Science, which is really about the scientific method, is the only way to understand how the universe works. In fact, the test of any scientific theory is its ability to accurately predict. Scientism is the view that only scientific claims are meaningful. So, want to build an airplane, understand the building blocks of matter, figure out how old the universe is? Science, it works bitches! Want to talk about beauty, art, meaning of life? Science may or may not be the tool you want. For example, the author states:

“The claim that scientism is true is not itself a scientific claim, not something that can be established using scientific methods. Indeed, that science is even a rational form of inquiry (let alone the only rational form of inquiry) is not something that can be established scientifically.”

Incorrect, by definition. He confuses Scientism with science here because science is by definition explored only with the scientific method, and as it is evidence based, it is also by definition rational.  There is nothing self refuting about science. 

“…writers like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, who allege that because religion has no scientific foundation (or so they claim) it “therefore” has no rational foundation at all”

Stoicismus,"This is so misleading. Are we really comparing creation theories (or myths, whatever you want to call them) from 4000~ years ago to modern ones? What did you expect? Not like they had any way to analyze or prove anything. Every myth they had were based, believe it or not, on direct observations and rational thought.  

In fact if you bother studying those myths without prejudices of any sort you'll see that, under the god/deities/irrational surface, there is a very ""scientific"" logic. 

Of course these men HAD TO find a prime principle, something/someone who had started it all. And, surprisingly, this still helds true today. For many  people thinking that something started out of the blue, from thing to matter is difficult. *Where did the force that caused the big bang came from?* This is still a very common and interesting question. 

But let's go back to our primitive theories. Let's just take a quick glance at the judeo-christian's. It actually follows a very evolutionist/scientific logic. Let's just change 1 word but follow its underlying logic, shall we?

The ~~god~~ big bang created the world, beginning with the day and night **[basically, time was created first. Afaik this is what the scientific researches show today. Along with time the concept of motion. After all the cycle of day and night is cause by motion and a 4000yo man would understand this by sheer observation.]**, then the sky sea and earth **[here some others very scientific facts. The sky was created first. The sky is made from gasses and what does science says today? That the earth was originally made of gasses. Then came the sea and from further condensation the earth. Nothing in this is wrong]**, then the sun  the  moon and the stars **[chronologic-wise this may be wrong, but aside from that there is no wrong in this statement]**, then the animals and finally the first man **[100% concordant with evolution. Men developed from animals]
**.

Everything  that follows is just a way to further explain this creation and how from that came the men. 

I'm sorry if may have used incorrect words, I'm not scientist but I do like comparative religions, although I'm an atheist myself. If there is something I 100% believe in is that, behind different names, lies the same logical processes. We modern men just expanded that logic, systematized it and created instruments to confirm or disregard certain theories. Nonetheless, as I said at the start, the human mind still works today as it used to 4000 years ago.

bobbymack44212,"Had a contractor come to the house for an estimate.  He was wearing a black creation museum hat.  Not wishing to be rude, I shut my atheist piehole while he measured for new doors.  He was nice in a gruff, got shit to do sort of way, but he never took off his hat even in the house.

I caught myself staring at the hat more than once, actually awestruck that someone would wear it and admit that they driven hundreds of miles to visit a place that is wholly founded on lies, bad science and delusional thinking.  Then I thought, well, that isn't fair since we do send all our eighth graders to Washington, D.C. each spring for a class trip.

Anyway, so he works up the estimate and the price is fair but I don't really like any of the doors he offers compared to two other vendors, so I tell him that at that time, I don't think I want to do business and I hate it when clients give me the ""wanna think it over"" nonsense.  Bull, yes or no, and no is okay, y'know?  So I am saying no in a nice way.

He stares at me, points to the hat and asks me right out ""Is it because I'm a Christian?  Is it because of this?""

I take my time answering, hold his gaze and tell him, ""I don't like the style of the doors in your catalog.  Your prices are fair and your cost to install was better than anyone else I've looked at, but I have to look at the door for the rest of my life in this house, so I have to like it.  Kinda the way you chose your religion, I presume.""  

Huh, he grunts.

""But, truthfully, all that hat represents to me is false advertising.  I've fallen for false advertising myself every four years, so I know how disappointing that can be.""

He takes a sip of the coffee I offered him, pushes the hat back and says, ""My wife bought this for me.  I usually wear it to the truck, take it off and wear my business hat, I just forgot I was wearing it.  But I had to say something because you were staring at it like I had a sack of shit on my head!"" and he laughs, and so I laugh glad that the moment has passed.

We shake hands, he walks to the door to leave and just as he steps out he pulls the old Columbo on me,  ""What's the real reason you didn't want to buy from me?""

Welcome to /r/atheism, friend! Standard questions, first:  
What do you believe? (ie: what are you convinced is true?)  
Why do you believe it? (ie: what evidence convinces you that it's true?)  
How did you enjoy [reading our FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/faq)?

&gt; I believe that if it makes him happy then I should not take that away from him. 

""X makes me happy"" is a vastly inferior reason to believe something as opposed to ""X is true"". If you have any actual evidence that the claims of your religion are true, you do him a great disservice by withholding it from him. If you have no such evidence, you do yourself a great disservice by continuing to believe it.

&gt;I am not here to change him. I just want to be a good girlfriend

This is an admirable attitude. Out of curiosity, what you you believe will happen to him after he dies?

With all that said, you're **probably** going to be fine. Note that this is **not** an excuse to pretend that your differences to not exist. If they're going to cause major problems, it is **much** better to figure that out now than five years down the road.

I think we work well together because even though she has faith, religion is not a big part of her life. She doesn't go to church, or base her decisions on what a priest tells her. She trusts herself to understand what's right and wrong, and believes God will forgive my non-belief. She keeps her beliefs to herself, and I to mine, so religion never really comes up.

Learxst,"&gt;""Every child has a right to their natural mother and father"".

- Molestation

- Abuse

- Conceived through rape (meaning that the mother MIGHT have some issues with this statement)

- Orphaned

- Unable to financially support the child

No one is taking children away from loving parents to be given specifically to gay couples.  There are reasons why children are not with their biological parents. Most of the time they're pretty damn good reasons.

&gt; ""...to give them what only a mother and only a father can give. They are denied that.""

I'm trying to think hard on this one. Since there is no significant evidence showing that children raised by gay couples are any more or less successful than children raised by hetero couples. 

Secondly, what are these children being denied? 

Santorum also made a nice dodge on Colbert's question, ""What if they have no mother and no father? Wouldn't it be better to have no parents than to be loved by two gay people?"". Or at least it would have been a nice dodge if he didn't say...

&gt; ""The point of the law is to encourage what is best, right? Is to set a standard for what is best. Not to set a standard short of what is best because when you do that you'll get less of what is necessary.""

So are you saying that children who are either the victims of abuse or orphaned are better off alone than to be raised by a gay couple who wants children?

catch_a_park,"Wow. So many reasons.

1. Thousands of gods throughout human history. Why is Yahweh special? Yahweh was actually one of the seventy divine sons of El and Asherah from the Canaanite religion that preceeded Judaism. They didn't come up with their own god. They inherited him from their forefathers.

2. None of the people who wrote about Jesus ever actually met him. So how do they know exactly where he went, what he did, who he spoke to and what he said?

3. The god of the Old Testament commits genocide against his own creation on at least six separate occasions - the worst of which is a global flood in which he kills (almost) everyone and everything because he regretted what he had done.

4. God kills over 2 million people (and thats just counting instances where the bible gives a number of deaths and exludes the flood). The devil kills about 10 people. Who is the real bad guy?

5. Every challenge I present to a theist is met with nothing but unfalsifiable platitudes and nothing concrete or demonstrable.

6. We don't have any of the original texts of the New Testament. All we have is copies of copies. On top of that, why do later translations contain verses that the earliest translations don't? How can we trust the accuracy of the bible?

7. Christians claim to know the truth yet one of the cornerstones of their religion is faith, which by definition means they cannot know. They just kinda have to believe that they know.

8. Every time the human species tries to make progress it is the church that must be dragged along kicking and screaming like a little child. When people (who were christian) tried to abolish slavery for example, they had to fight against their own church (the Roman Catholic Church) to get the job done.

For example  it seems to be a growing opinion in Christianity that hell isn't a punishment of eternal torture but a simple realm that is completely absent of god.    So this type of Christian would simply answer there is no punishment simply choices.

So, sadly there obviously isn't a single answer to the question.     Some Christians have no problem with the ""mob boss"" god  offering ""protection""  or else. Some see it as the deities right to act in anyway it wishes  and even if it acts within a manner that it speaks against it is automatically just for god to do so.   I once debated a baptist pastor whom simply replied with ""The ten commandments do not apply to god""  meaning no rules apply to god not even his own.

It does not say it is disgraceful for women to interrupt a service.  It doesn’t say when women are more educated they can speak in church.  If the meaning isn’t that it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church, then Paul worded it poorly.

That said, he is wrong about the new testament:  

*""But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of every woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.... any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head ...For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair ...For a man ought not to cover his head; since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. (For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.)"" 1 Corinthians 11:2-10*  

*""Wives, be submissive to your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands."" Ephesians 5:21-24*  

*""...the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church."" 1 Corinthians 14:34-35*  

*""Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or have authority over men; she is to keep silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet woman will be saved through bearing children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness, with modesty."" 1 Timothy 2:11-15*  

*""Wives, be subject to your husband, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged. Slaves, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord."" Colossians 3:18-22*

A little review of Old Testament polygamy.
Abraham - [Sarah](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2016:1&amp;version=NIV),  [Hagar](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2016:3-4&amp;version=NIV),  [Keturah](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2025:1&amp;version=NIV),  [Concubines](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2025:6&amp;version=NIV),  [Sex slave girls](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020:17&amp;version=NIV);  David  - [8 wives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David#David.27s_family)  The Wikipedia reference has the scripture references.  Solomon - [700 wives and 300 concubines](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2011:3&amp;version=NIV)  

There are others: Lamech, Esau, Jacob, Rehoboam and more.  A [keyword search for wives](http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=wives&amp;version1=31&amp;searchtype=all&amp;wholewordsonly=yes) will bring up the references, but will  also bring up any use of the word wives.

I have heard this verse used to say that marriage should be between one man and one woman.  [Mark 10:7-9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10:7-9&amp;version=NIV)  However, Jesus is just quoting [Genesis 2:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%202:24&amp;version=NIV) to show that he is a good Jew.  Obviously, since the time Genesis was written, polygamy was acceptable.

I think you can also make the case with [1 Timothy 3:2 and 1 Timothy 3:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20timothy%203&amp;version=NIV) that marriage to more than one woman is acceptable.  “the husband of but one wife” and “A deacon must be the husband of but one wife” sound like exceptions to a rule which would allow polygamy.  Also, the rules in this passage are for overseers and deacons of the church, not the general population.

There are lots of New Testaments verses that allude to a husband and a wife and would seem to suggest that marriage could be between just one man and one wife, but there is no verse that I know of that says polygamy is wrong or that marriage must only be between one man and one woman.   Also, if a Christian uses a verse from the writings of Paul to support that marriage should be between one man and one woman, you can point out that Paul thought it was better not to get married and only get married if you could not overcome your lustful desires.

datcrazybok,"If the Bible was simply a reflection of what was occurring at the time, then you can immediately discount several attributes which have been given to God. For example, an all-powerful, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent being would not permit changing morals. So, either God's morals changed or he isn't quite as all-powerful, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent as they thought he was. 

Additionally, there is always the claim that those who practice Christianity are more moral than those who don't. This is very easily debunked through his own words... if it happened elsewhere in that generation, you would expect that followers of the most-high God would be above the behavior of the heathens surrounding them. Apparently not, because he claims that they were just doing what everyone else at the time was doing. 

Further, he asks where in the New Testament does it say women were oppressed... I'm glad he asked...

&gt;""But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of every woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.... any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head ...For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair ...For a man ought not to cover his head; since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.

1) “For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)  Clearly the Old Testament is to be abided by until the end of human existence itself.  None other then Jesus said so.
2) All of the vicious Old Testament laws will be binding forever.  ""It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid.""  (Luke 16:17 NAB)
3) Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets.  He hasn’t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.""  (Matthew 5:17 NAB)
3b) ""All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness...""  (2 Timothy 3:16 NAB)
3c) ""Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God."" (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)
4) Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law.  Mark.7:9-13  ""Whoever curses father or mother shall die""  (Mark 7:10 NAB)
5) Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating.  He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: “He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.”  (Matthew 15:4-7)
6) Jesus has a punishment even worse than his father concerning adultery: God said the act of adultery was punishable by death. Jesus says looking with lust is the same thing and you should gouge your eye out, better a part, than the whole.  The punishment under Jesus is an eternity in Hell.  (Matthew 5:27)
7) Peter says that all slaves should “be subject to [their] masters with all fear,” to the bad and cruel as well as the “good and gentle.”  This is merely an echo of the same slavery commands in the Old Testament. 1 Peter 2:18",null,0,cdjpssf,1r4z2y,atheism,hot,1

All of the violence, bigotry and intolerance is now performed in the park by way of amusements. The park has created a place where all of the past horrors take place while the rest of the world now lives in peace.

I'm among this subreddit's angriest anti-theists, yet not even I subscribe to the silly notion that religion is the root of all of our evils. An analogy in medicine would be to claim that all human illness is a form of cancer. No, that's simply not true!

To try to put at least a vague number on the situation, Axelrod's *Encyclopedia of Wars* summarizes all historically recorded wars and concludes that only 7% were caused by or were significantly about religion.

Then their folly should be brought out into the light of day, and exhibited there in all its hideousness until they flee from it, hiding their heads in shame.

True enough, even a superstitious man has certain inalienable rights. He has a right to harbor and indulge his imbecilities as long as he pleases, provided only he does not try to inflict them upon other men by force. He has a right to argue for them as eloquently as he can, in season and out of season. He has a right to teach them to his children.

Uncanevale,"&gt;Can someone here show me the source and evidence that Jesus was in fact a historical guy

It would be all over the internet if such a source was available.

IMO, the only credible reason to think that Jesus Christ was based on an actual person is the lengths to which the author of Matthew went to make Jesus' actions correspond to OT prophecies. Matthew 21:1-7 is an example where Jesus rides a horse and its colt at the same time. This is a clear misunderstanding of the OT where the description is more like ""He will ride on a horse, as a matter of fact a colt."" The author of Matthew couldn't have been describing an actual event, so it was probably an effort to enhance the actions of a real person to make it seem that they had fulfilled a prophecy.",null,0,cdjndim,1r531l,atheism,hot,1

datcrazybok,"I am torn on this one... because the Jews had prophecy which indicated that the Messiah was coming, there were many individuals who made the claim that they were this Messiah of prophecy. Many, many individuals, actually. 

All evidence I've read seems to indicate that several decades after the fact, people confirm Jesus existed. However, given the decades lapse in the time which Jesus exists, and the historical claims of Jesus, you can assume that AT THE VERY LEAST some of the facts regarding Jesus were muddled. In fact, I theorize that those who described Jesus later on were simply confirming that many individuals had made the claim to fulfill Jewish prophecy, and that a few decades ago, another one happened. However, I have also read that people were executed as often as monthly for the same crime that Jesus was supposedly executed for. 

So, basically, although historical scholars generally accept the fact that Jesus existed, when I look at their ""evidence"" I can't help but feel that it describes an individual who claimed to fulfill Jewish prophecy, rather than this specific individual, since none of the mentions really gives specific evidence that claims made in the New Testament actually happened. 

I'm with you, though. Whether or not a man caused a major revolution in Judaism about 2,000 years ago offers no insight into whether or not the historical Jesus existed, and certainly no insight into whether or not he was divine. In that sense, to me, it really doesn't matter at all. There were plenty of people who claimed to be the one to fulfill prophecy.  ",null,0,cdjnkgu,1r531l,atheism,hot,1

mavnorman,"The best argument, in my opinion, is kinda similar to the argument that leads to the conclusion about dark matter or dark energy. It's the argument to the best explanation.

What needs to be explained is why Christianity exists, and why the sources are the way they are. To explain the evidence, you can assume that a real guy existed whose story got embellished over time, or you can assume it was a fictional character that was later turned into the description of a real guy which then was embellished.

Historians think, the real guy hypothesis is the better explanation.

There is also a kind of external corroboration, in that one can look at other, similar cases in history. If, for instance, it's rather typical for a religion to be started by a charismatic founder, this corroborates the hypothesis that Christianity was probably started by a real person. And typically, religions are often started by founders.

warebec,"Bart Ehrman is a source for the historicity side, but I wouldn't call his arguments in *Did Jesus Exist?* very scholarly; they were fraught with problems.

On the other side, he recommended *The Jesus Puzzle* by Earl Doherty and the second edition of that book, *Jesus: Neither God nor Man*. Frank Zindler has given me copies of *Bart Ehrman and the Quest of the Historical Jesus* by various authors and two books by Robert Price: *The Christ Myth Theory and Its Problems* and *Jesus Is Dead*.  The scholarly work for the mythicist side, *The Historical Jesus* by Richard Carrier, comes out in February, but *Proving History* is the prerequisite book and it is out now.

Here are the sources you asked for.


Something else interesting to consider, the early Christian church dealt with persecution from the Roman state and the Jewish synagogue. Both groups were vigorously trying to stop the spread of Christianity because it was a threat to their establishment. The easiest way these groups could have killed the new religion from the start is if Jesus had never existed, there would be no argument and Christianity would not have even gotten off the ground. No one was skeptical that Jesus was a historical figure until about 1600-1700 years after the fact because proposing it sooner would have been absurd in light of the eyewitness evidence. 

In addition, the early church leaders did not have the freedom to invent facts about Christianity because of the harsh criticism it was already receiving at the time, any lies they could have been caught spreading would have ended the movement. The idea that rumors about said Jesus (particularly resurrection from the dead) would have been accepted so easily if there were not substantial evidence is also hard to  account for if there were not strong evidence supporting it. 

Historians agree that the letters of Paul were written 15-25 years after Jesus's death. So when he writes in 1 Corinthians 15:3-6:

""For what I received I passed on to you of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are living, though some have died.""

This proves not only that the claims of Jesus's powers were not added years later in the form of legend but also is strong evidence that Paul along with the other church founders had eye witnesses to testify for the events they were writing about which was needed to get anyone at the time to take them seriously. In addition, ancient cultures clearly distinguished between fictional stories and historical accounts when they were talking about them and historical accounts were not allowed to be changed.

Hambone3110,"To my knowledge, there is none. Not so much as a stray mention. 

He doesn't appear in any of the Roman writings from the period, and they were definitely the dominant source of literate scholars in the area. Had Pontius Pilate attended a trial in which he felt forced by local populist pressure to give a verdict contrary to his own feelings on the matter, then that would *definitely* have been recorded, but if it was then no such record has survived. 

There was certainly no census around about the year 0 during the reign of King Herod, and if there's one thing the Roman's kept a LOT of paperwork on, it's censi and tax information.

The first mention of JC that I'm aware of is an account of this new immigrant Jewish sect who are causing quite a stir in Rome, and that was in about CE 80, some fifty years after the supposed events of the Gospel.

I'm no expert on the subject, but I've looked into this myself out of interest, and considering how influential Jesus supposedly was, he appears to be remarkably absent from travel journals, letters and administrative records. I suspect that Yeshua of Nazareth may well have existed, and might well have been a charismatic rabbi or cult leader. But that the tales of his exploits and what happened to him seem to be basically a complete fabrication, a legend.

“My two-year-old will not stay in bed when I put him down. It seems like I am whipping him too much.  No matter how many times I whip him he still gets up.”  This is their recommendation: “If your spankings are too light to gain his respect, an increase in the intensity might be more persuasive.” p.6  ”If he gets up, when his feet hit the floor, spring into the room with your little switch and pop him on the bare leg one or two times.”  ”Never allow him to get his way.” p.7 If a child screams or cries “Just ignore him.  Don’t be moved by it.  Don’t pick him up.”  If the child says he is hurt give him “a terrible tasting herbal potion.” p.9
On p.19 Michael Pearl jokes about a “tot” getting “half a dozen little spankings a day.”
Michael Pearl praises parents who for a year kept their young son from medical treatment and who “was so sick that when he finally got to a doctor, the doctor expressed amazement that he was still alive.” p.20
To the question “Should a mature ten-year-old be allowed to switch a two-year-old if the mother is unavailable?” Michael Pearl says sure!: “Ten-year-olds ought to be mature enough to discipline a smaller child.  In our house, there was no difference between the parents and the older children in enforcing the rule of law over the younger children.” p.24-25
When a 3 year old screams the Pearls recommend: “without saying a word go straight to the switch.  Spank her where she stands.”  ”Never threaten, and never show mercy.  One squeak of a scream gets a switching.” p.26  The Pearls apparently have never read the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says “Blessed are the merciful!”
Here is some crazy teaching about violence from Michael Pearl:  If a child hits, bites, kicks or shoves he should get “a thorough spanking.  Children must be taught that violence is never an acceptable alternative in personal conflicts.” ??? p.27
When a 4 year old screams “Turn and walk away.  If she were to scream again, turn back and give her a spanking.”  p.30
On p. 33 “A mother describes her dilemma: `I get so frustrated with the children.  No matter how many times I tell them or spank them, they just do the same thing again.  We just go around and around.’”  Michael Pearl recommends “meeting every transgression with a swift penalty.”  ”They will obey.”
On p. 34 Michael Pearl relates the story of a mother hitting her 11 month old who doesn’t want to eat any more “spinach-squash-mush” and pushes it away.  The mother “picked up her little enforcer (whip), which was lying on the table, and swatted the child’s hand.”  When the baby tries again to push the unwanted food away she “received another spat.” Michael Pearl says about this scenario: “I loved it.  It was beautiful.” (p. 35)  And then on p. 36 he says “I must encourage those of you with small children, train up your children now.  Don’t want until they are one year old to start training.  Rebellion and self-will should be broken in the six-month-old when it first appears.  Take this young mother’s example and think of ways you can train your child. (smiley face)”
On p. 46 a mother is described as ignoring her crying 3 month old, until the baby “became cheerful.” The story ends with Michael Pearl’s comment about a teenage girl visiting this mother and baby: “Maybe when this young girl becomes a mother she will have the wisdom to begin training her newborns and not wait until they are three months old.”
On p. 47 a 9 month old is left crying, sitting alone and ignored. Pearl recommends coming by to pat her on the head every 10 minutes. This is cruel and neglectful, and dangerous.
On p. 72 Michael Pearl says “switches and rods make many things mighty inconvenient (for the child). (smiley face)”
On p. 85 Michael Pearl recommends giving a little girl who won’t get into her car seat “five licks with a stinging switch.” If the girl still doesn’t get in the seat “repeat the switching.” If the little girl continues to refuse to get in the seat he says to take the seat into the house and strap the girl in it for “two or three hours.”
On p. 96: when one of the Pearls’ children tattled on another child Debi Pearl “spanked both of them regardless of who did the tattling.”",null,0,cdjqflv,1r5d9g,atheism,hot,3

I sincerely hope that as time passes they come to regret their decision and seek to make amends with you. To that effect, and granted without too much knowledge of what your wishes are or what your situation is now, I would advise to neither make your absence easy for them to bear, nor their reconciliation with you hard should they seek it. 
As for your younger siblings... I think I would try and maintain at least some form of communication with them even if it is naught but messages sent through your older siblings as you have already indicated. Letting them know constantly that your absence is not your choice and that you care for and support them unconditionally (unlike your parents) should show them what love really means.

I am a closet atheist this situation is what scares me and keeps me silent the most. I could take any hate the world could throw at me, but for my family, my mother and father, my grandmothers, my elder brother and my wonderful nephew.... To have them taken from me or come to hate me.... You are surviving that which would break me. You are strong beyond measure as are all whom suffer as you do. Know that you have no call for shame.

Brokenshatner,"It's terrible that this happened to your family. But this happens constantly, and it drives me crazy. 

I have had so many students find themselves kicked out of the homes of their parents, always from the parents' inability to cope with the changing nature of the parent-child dynamic in the house. Whatever the trigger - sex, drugs, fundamental religious differences - being kicked out always forces children to rely more on their other social resources, which the parents should rationally see as enabling the behaviors they find so disturbing. Deprived of your nice warm bed at home, of course you're going to crash at your boyfriend's.

I have never seen a case of a teenager coming home to apologize, though this is probably what your mother's emails are inviting, as you said. From what I've seen, these crises usually find a positive outcome, but I've never seen that particular one - repentant children immediately rushing back to mama.

This might be because most of my teenaged students lacked the social skills to engage in that kind of confrontation with their parents, or that they're unwilling to fully adopt their old role again - the perfect sinless child their parents still imagine them to be. I'm not saying this is the case with you, as you're a few years older than my students, but that it would explain why it just doesn't happen in my experience.

You probably stumbled upon part of the reason parents so frequently take this nuclear option route. It sounds like your mother really does expect you to come home and be her baby for the rest of the summer. You yourself were surprised at how self-sufficient you are, how well you're taking to your new independent adult identity. Imagine how foreign your positive experiences with your newfound freedom would strike your long-suffering mother. Of course parents would assume their children would be happier at home, because they know how hard adulthood is, and could never imagine even their perfect children having what it takes. At least not without a couple more choice lessons from mom and dad.  

It's a testament to the respect you have for your parents that you actively put off becoming sexually active until legal adulthood. But expecting a college-aged woman to break off a relationship with a college-aged man just because he doesn't believe in the same cloudwizard as her parents is a bit unreasonable. 

I think I understand where the 'not under my roof' instinct comes from, but it's just so stupid when you really break it down.

On the bright side, at least you're in junior college, not junior high. Good luck contacting your siblings!

Turns out I'm a rather self sufficient adult and minus not being able to see my siblings, being kicked out is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.

There is no court order forbidding contact with your siblings. If you want to talk to them you have to change your mindset. Take all digital communication off the table. That can be monitored by your parents and have repercussions for your siblings.

You have to think old school. People have been having private conversations and meetings for thousands of years.

Your parents now have no leverage to control your actions. Use that advantage.

It can be as simple as hiding a note that says ""I miss you and I love you"" somewhere in a tree a quarter mile down the road and getting a well trusted friend to tell your brother or sister where it is.

You stated your mild surprise about how self sufficient you found yourself to be. I'll bet you can also find creative ways to talk to your siblings in a manner that does not place them in harms way.

You need to begin planning for contingencies, and even if your relationship with your boyfriend is a lasting one, having some savings of your own is still important.

Our daughter was constantly bringing friends from high school to our house when they were kicked out by their parents.

That means that while you are living in their home over age 18 that they are responsible for you, so they expect a minimum amount of respect and a minimum compliance to their house rules.  
     From my perspective as a parent, seriously, it sounds like we got a one sided picture from you here.  Understand that my grown children have been married, returned home, left again, etc.  In and out.  But, when they are back home, they follow the rules.  No boozing it up unless I am invited.  No sleep overs unless I am gone for the night and please don't use my bed.  No roommates unless they are pay half of MY rent and bills.  Simple stuff, simple rules.  
     Being respectful of your parents beliefs should not be a problem:  learning to be discrete is a priority when one is an atheist because of the historic social problems we have had when interacting with fanatical religious types who don't understand that this country is founded on the right of the freedom FROM religion and religious persecution.   
     I am sure it is a disappointment to your parents to learn that you are engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage and that ""secondarily"" are an atheist.  You managed to push two big buttons for parents everywhere... and the atheism may not have as much to do about your parents kicking you out as the lies and the sex issue.  Sex is so very taboo with Christians.  And telling your parents lies if very disrespectful to any parent.       
     About the atheism, my favorite point about speaking to a religious family member is summed up by Christopher Michael Langan who you can find on wiki (autodidact with an IQ reported to be between 195 and 210.)  When asked about creationism he says:  I believe in the theory of evolution, but I believe as well in the allegorical truth of creation theory. In other words, I believe that evolution, including the principle of natural selection, is one of the tools used by ""God"" to create mankind. Mankind is then a participant in the creation of the universe itself, so that we have a closed loop. I believe that there is a level on which science and religious metaphor are mutually compatible.
(Understand that God is a cognitive construct and not a reality.)    
     You go ahead and lay that on your parents as an opportunity to discuss why you remain an atheism and give them something to think about.  Don't allow your mother to push her beliefs down your throat, not allow her to let you feel guilty about your personal beliefs.   I suggest you face your mother and just tell her politely that her efforts to bring her religion into your life is offensive to you in the extreme and if she continues you will stop all communication with her.  Try putting the shoe on the other foot and she'll soon learn how you truly feel.  You can also then tell your mother that by the actions of herself and your father that you were forced to live with the boyfriend, and now have sex all the time.... I'm sure she'll have an ulcer in no time.  ",null,0,cdl1xyk,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,2

ImaginaryStranger,"This sounds a little similar to my story. My parents also don't like my boyfriend because he's an atheist and blame him for my atheism. So, in my story, when I turned 18 my boyfriend and I had a plan where I moved into his home. At this point I have not come out to my parents. I had a feeling if I ever came out to them they would kick my ass out so when my boyfriend gave me this opportunity I thought, sweet! I can come out and still have another family who will support me if my original family disowns me. (My boyfriend's mom is a really liberal Methodist so she's cool with our atheism.) Well, before I turned 18 my parents found out about my plan and basically told me if I moved in with my boyfriend they would drug themselves up on medication and not be able to take care of my younger siblings. That's when I finally came out to them but I guess the worse thing for them was me living with him than being an atheist. They convinced themselves it's a phase and that as soon as I break up with my boyfriend I will be a good little catholic girl again. Now I live in a city 35 minutes away from home for college in apartment they payed for to bribe me from living with my boyfriend. Little do they know he basically lives here with me. On the weekends when they come over we pack up all his stuff and he goes back with his mom. As soon as my parents go away he comes over again and the cycle begins again. They said to my face though if they find out he is living with me they will disown me and cut me off from all the money support. Good thing I got  job yesterday that pays better than minimum wage.

gamblingman2,"How well I know this situation. Nearly identical thing happened with me around the same age but for different reasons. I'd love to give you some advice, even though you're somewhat overwhelmed with replies.

1. Put your family and all the argument and etc... out of your mind for now. You need to be focused on what you are going to do in the short to near future on your own. Don't get too wound up with the distant future or how to help your siblings. You have a lot of thoughts running through your mind but the main one needs to be your own welfare first.

2. If your siblings aren't total idiots (no offense) they see whats happening and will realize how wildly ridiculous your parents are acting. You don't need to try and contact them and potentially create strife for them to handle when your parents give them hell also. You can be sure that your parents are already giving your siblings long speeches about how you are being directed by your sinful nature and you aren't right with god and satan is controlling your mind, etc.... Without a doubt your parents are telling your siblings that they have to stay away from you because you are a ""destructive influence"". 

3. You are not going to ""go after"" your parents. Dont be out for revenge or try to prove that they are wrong. They will use anything you do and twist what you do into a negative light, dont give them any ammo. They will not agree with you or compromise. They will want you to bend over backwards and abandon what you believe just so their view of their kids stays the same. They dont want you to be an individual, they want a clone of themselves.

4. Focus on yourself. Though you have a supportive bf, imagine if that ends. What will you do then? Begin your life by becoming a self sufficient individual.

5. Look for counseling services. When I was at Sam Houston State they had a free counseling service anyone could use. So when the gf and I decided to get married we did individual and couples counseling to make sure we were in good shape and it helped A LOT! Find a counseling service in your area and GO! You will need this because you need someone impartial to talk to that wont judge or spread what you say.

6. Dont dwell on your hate. Your parents have made bad parenting decisions, but people make a lot of bad decisions in life (I certainly have). If you choose to maintain a hatred toward them, that anger and hatred will negatively taint other areas of your life. 

7. There is a chance that over time they will relax and realize that they want their daughter around because they miss you, and your choices will not cause the world to end. I cant promise a result like this, but its what happened with me.",null,2,cdko1g5,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,3

mistersunman,"Many have shared in your shoes. My dad used to be Jewish, and would very much believe in God, until I started smoking pot. I started smoking it at the age of 26 (27 now). It helped me get out of depression and start putting my head on right. I was very sheltered and have been living under very conservative judgemental parents.
Their ideal son is one who makes a ton of money, has sex with only 1 girl (and she must be white and preferably Jewish) and I marry her and I must have children. They would say they care about my happiness, but their actions speak louder and they care more about their own ego and image than my wants and needs.
Before pot, I considered myself Jewish. After it opened up my mind, I converted to Agnostism. I confessed to my parents about what my green habit, and I told them that I'm tired of living a conservative life. I revealed to them
That they have severely oppressed me, that I should've been having lots of crazy sex when I was 18 like everyone else. And that because I couldn't experience that, I'm going to now. Even when I would present logic about how harmless and beneficial pot is, they simply would not accept it. They labelled it as harmful of a drug as Heroine. My parents have no idea what any of this shit is. They're very closed minded, naive, and pretty much keep to themselves all the time. They're very old school.
I realized I had to move out.  I was a 26 year old with the naive brain of someone whose 18. It was scary as shit.
I moved out and began learning about what life is really like. They grew increasingly aggressive towards me, that I wasn't obeying their standards and judgements. So then I told them, ""that's it! I'm independent. I'm an adult. This is my house. This is my roof. It's my rules. From now on I'm doing whatever I want, whenever i want, if I die, I die.""
I started taking shrooms and started unravelling just how fucked up they raised me. I had severe mommy
Issues, body dismorphic disorder, and pretty much socially insane. The shrooms opened my mind to the truth. I converted to Athiem and have a hate on God. That's right. Fuck God. Religion has corrupted my parents, fucked me up, started wars, and has been disproven by science for already too long. After a year of rebellion against my parents, I told my dad I'm an athiest.
He told me that over time, after witnessing his son go ""down hill"", he too has changed his beliefs about God. What he was describing was Agnosticsm. My dad told me he's agnostic. My mom later wrote me an email saying how selfish, scared and angry I am with myself and that I am blaming God for all of this.
After all my studying on philosophy, my exploration through psychedelics, and the self cognitive therapy I've been doing for a year, I can honestly say that I don't have any ""hate"" for god. Haha because dont believe he exists. When I say Fuck God, I'm saying fuck religion, and that I'm not afraid of a 5000 year old imaginary fairy tale old fart whose a hypocritical, homophobic manslaughterer.
My mom has the biggest ego out of anyone I know, except for me (which I've been working on).
I'm a lot better today, an moving out has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. I've discontinued communication with my mom until I can stop caring about that she doesn't actually love ""me"".
My dad on the other hand, also difficult, but at least he listens to reason. He seems to be okay with my habit after he has seen my rising success in life. And he seems to be proud of me for wanting to grow up and become a Man.
I have a similar experience to your bf experience. I once dated a black girl for 3 years... Those were very difficult times.

The system of morality is what humans use to weigh the impact our actions have on other thinking beings. Slavery (one of the given examples) is immoral because of the negative impact it has on the slave, as well as on the society which practices slavery.

As far as I can tell, the caller is using ""moral relativism"" to describe any situation in which two people disagree on what is the ""moral"" answer to a given problem. This is not the commonly accepted definition of the term, and not what Dillahunty rejects.

A moral relativist would look at the discrepancy and say ""each of their answers is moral for their time/culture/etc."" Dillahunty would likely say ""no, that person is wrong"" or ""both are wrong,"" or ""we don't have enough information to say.""

In other words, since there is a finite number of answers, one of them is the most moral (remember, we're trying to minimize harm to thinking beings). We may not know what that most moral answer is, and we may even get it wrong.

From these subjective things that we value, we can determine objectively through evidence and reason how we go about doing things (in other words, how to act morally).

&gt;Every single American should be given a MANDATORY course dedicated to critical thinking. 

If only that were possible, but it'll never happen in United States. Critical thinking skills are being actively suppressed, though surprisingly enough religion isn't the main culprit. 

So much of our consumer culture depends on customers without critical thinking skills. This is true with basically anything we buy, but lets use apple as an example. People were lining up for days to get the newest iphone even though it barely had any improvements over the last one.  Sure it's a decent phone, but adding a slightly better camera, marginally improved battery life, a thumbprint scanner or even the coveted gold cover isn't enough of an improvement to justify days in line.     People with solid critical thinking skills would be more likely to just wait a couple of weeks and avoid the hassle.  But the artificial increase in demand caused by this increases what people are willing to pay to get it and boosts apple's profits significantly.

I'm not just picking on apple.  You would be hard pressed to find any corporation that hasn't had a similar marketing scheme. They'd be crazy not to use those tactics, they've  been wildly successful.

I've heard it said that religion faith is the basis for many people being generous and altruistic.  I personally feel that people are predisposed by their evolution as a social species to be cooperative and even altruistic.  But what's being ignored are the daily indignities and useless self debasement because of the teachings of the church.

Generations of men who feel ""broken"" and ""dirty"" for masturbating because they are told so by their most trusted authority figures.  I myself felt this for years.  Generations of women told that they are prudes if they are virgins and sluts if they aren't and made to feel guilty about it either way (*Breakfast Club*, I think).  In both cases, men and women, it's merely a consequence of being a sexually reproducing mammal (apologies for the redundancy).  And there's OP's story.

I'm convinced that the Christian church has a net negative impact on modern society.  It's these personal effects on a family level, combined with my hypothesis that people are roughly equally generous and kind with or without religious faith that convince me.

-----------------------------------------

I'm not stubborn.  If any gods exist;

* They would know that I currently am not convinced they exist.

* They would know what would convince me that they exist.

* They would be able to act on that knowledge and convince me they exist.

Since I am not currently convinced any gods exist, either;

* Some gods exist but they do not want me to think they exist.

* No gods exist.

Now, she asked for three reasons.  Why?  What would a discussion between mere mortals provide when only the gods -- if they exist -- have any meaningful influence on this one question?

I'm an agnostic atheist, so are the majority of atheists here. 

That out if the way, on to the rest of your post. Is your parent's lack of respect part of the religion, or is it more a cultural/personal thing? That seems to be a trend in the asian cultures I've heard of. As a parent and child I'd doubt they will ever take you as an equal, you'll always be their baby. Some parents are a lot worse about it than others, but you do get used to it. If religion is that important to them, then they've ""lost"" their child, and they'll always try and get you back. Just try and bare with it until you can put some distance between you, that makes it easier.

(During the Vietnam war, the CIA recruited Hmong to fight against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. After the war, a lot of Hmong were forced out of their homes and ended up in refugee camps in Thailand. From there, a lot of them came to the US. The time I'm speaking of was at the beginning of that wave of immigration.)

A fundamentalist church in a small town in southern Minnesota agreed to sponsor a Hmong family. The church found housing and jobs for them (which is good) but also were very paternalistic toward them. They took control of the family's finances. (Which was easy to do because the Hmong people came here knowing nothing about banks, checks, credit cards, etc. Sponsors are supposed to help them learn all that stuff, but they are not supposed to take control of the family's money.) They insisted that the family attend church and tithe. The Hmong family, not knowing any better, complied with everything the church asked them to do. (Traditional Hmong religion is partly shamanistic and partly Buddhist.)

When the state welfare department found out what was going on, they removed the family from that town, and moved them to a larger city where a lot more Hmong were living. The Hmong were happy to go, but the pastor and other church members complained mightily.

A reporter interviewed the pastor, asking him: ""Do you mean to tell me the only reason you agreed to sponsor them was so that you could make good Christians out of them?""

I'll never forget the pastor's answer: **""Well, of course! If they're going to go to hell, they might as well go from Thailand as from here.""**",null,0,cdkhmfz,1r78gb,atheism,hot,2

Many of these programs try to maybe recruit into their church, but chances are that they these people are already theists.  Religion has always appealed more to the poor than the rich.  I do have less of a problem with theses recruitments than I prob should.  As I see it, christians are spending money at a christian church so they get get more christians in the church.  These people most likely know (maybe even volunteer) at this drives and see their money go to work.  If they see where their money is going and they are happy with it then thats none of my concern.

NOW, to play Devil's Advocate.
The Catholic argument toward why evil exists is as follows:

First, we need to understand that, according to Catholicism, God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit exist, and have always existed, in a loving relationship.

God created us to be in a loving relationship with him. In short, he wants us to love him.

The only way for us to truly love him is if we have the free will to choose whether or not TO love him. Therefore, God gave us free will.

Free will itself implies that good and evil must exist; if all humans have is the power to do good, we cannot truly love God.

Because evil exists, suffering and pain must also exist.


I know that these arguments are pretty weak in short answer form. If you really want to understand what I just talked about, I'd suggest talking to Jesuit priests.

BuccaneerRex,"I grew up in a secular household, but in the US you can't really avoid Christianity. I think one of the reasons I've remained unconvinced by any religion is due to a set of Children's Encyclopedias my uncle bought from a door-to-door salesman when I was around 5 or so.

I don't remember the publisher, or anything about the actual encyclopedia set. What I remember is that along with the reference volumes were some additional books: A book of Greco-Roman mythology, with beautiful classic artwork, and a book of Bible Stories that were illustrated the same way. Because they were published by the same company, they were written in much the same way. Instead of being traditional chapter/verse, the Bible stories went through the whole book, and basically wrote out the stories in prose form, without pulling punches or glossing over the details. 

So I had an early 'comparative religion' course right there. I read both sets of mythologies, and didn't find much difference between them. I grasped very quickly that the idea of a deity is just a way to explain the unknown that happens around us, and that the more we learn about how reality actually works, the less need there is for a deity to explain it.

So I asked my mom one day, when I was around 6 or 7 what God was. Her answer was ""It's what some people think explains why the world is here. But there are other explanations that work better.""",null,1,cdkjqa4,1r7t2m,atheism,hot,4

Then, when I moved out of the house and started reading atheist literature, I read Why I am not a Christian... it was like every argument I had ever heard for the existence of God had been taken apart in a much more eloquent manner than I was able to utilize.

As a teen, I volunteered in a nursing home and everday people were dying. 

I think death is one of the main things that determines someone's religiousity. Every person I have known who is really religious, as in they pray, go to church and are hard core spiritual has a story of how they were confronted it seems spontaneously with the realization of their own mortality. A beloved relative or friend died, or they were drug addicts or alcoholics...they all have some story like this. I think that until they had such an experience, they never gave a single thought to how short and precious life, they never gave a thought to the fact that one day they would be dead. Luckily, I was eased into this realization from a young age, and had family members who told me the truth rather than saying that the people who had died ""went to heaven"" or some other thing.

I got obsessed with paleontology, evolution and whatnot. It was a major thing, because as a kid, I was raised with the Bible AND books about dinosaurs. Weird? Probably, but I got access to both views on the continuity of life on the planet and I chose science.

However, many of the same things that proved the existence of God also proved the existence of faeries from this book. I had a very active imagination as a child and while my parents never tried to convince me of Santa Claus around the same time that I used to believe in God, I also believed that the Artemis Fowl books were accurate documents. I also believed the series of unfortunate events books were also true. I enjoyed considering many fiction books as reality. Once I finally started giving up these ideas, god ended up going with them.

The trailer makes it seem as if Todd Burpo is a farmer who questions his faith, when he's actually a fundy xtian pastor who decided to exploit his three-year-old son's NDE memories with a book and a movie deal.

Dudesan,"The suffix ""-phobia"" typically indicates an irrational or unjustified fear or hatred, but the term ""Islamophobia"" is used overwhelmingly to describe *justified* criticism. Something like 90% of the time the accusation is made, it is as a juvenile invective, comparable to calling someone a ""Big stupid doo-doo head!"". It's the remaining ~10% of cases that give the term any credibility at all, but which also provide the sharpest contrast to demonstrate when its use is inappropriate.

Unfortunately, there actually *are* some rednecks, chavs, and assorted white supremicists who don't understand the difference between ""Muslims"" and ""Brown People"", and who really *are* motivated by base xenophobia and ingroup/outgroup effects rather than by any actual objections to Islam itself. Indeed, most of these xenophobes *agree* with hardline Islam on subjects such as the rights of women, the separation of Church and State, the validity of the Scientific Method, whether it's okay to go to war because your Holy Man claims that the voices in his head command you to, and all the things that most ""Islamophobes"" actually take issue with. You need look no farther than the Republican Party to find a wide assortment of such people.

The word is mostly thrown around because certain people would like to silence any and all criticism of Islam, no matter how grounded in fact that criticism may be. They seek to accomplish this by pretending that the above-mentioned rednecks are the **only** people who could possibly dislike anything about Islam for any reason, lumping it all into the category of ""Islamophobia"". By this logic, anyone who objects to child marriages, or to *being raped* being punished more harshly than *actually committing rape*, or to demanding the death penalty for victimless ""crimes"" like blasphemy, or to enthusiastic and near-constant endorsements of violent ""martyrdom"", **must therefore be a racist**. The fact that none of these topics have *anything to do* with race is ignored, and frequently dismissed with some bafflegab about ""culture"". These people either cannot understand the difference between ""phobia"" and ""legitimate criticism"", or choose to ignore it when it is inconvenient to them. It's especially worrying that some of the people engaging in this dishonesty are not even Muslims themselves, but that's a topic for a separate rant.

This is a classic example of the false dilemma, ""You're either with us or you're with our enemies!"". It's roughly equivalent to suggesting that, since Adolf Hitler hated Joseph Stalin, it is impossible to disagree with Stalin on any issue without being a Nazi– even if that issue is something upon which Hitler and Stalin agreed, such as [whether it is appropriate to solve your problems with genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor).

taterbizkit,"This is a great first step, but that's all it is.  The judge's order stays enforcement until after the entire appeals process is completed.  That could take years.

Also, oddly, the FFRF's summary in the linked article seems to have misread the opinion.  The judge only ruled on 107(2), and did not rule on 107(1).  The article treats this as a victory over both exemptions.  There are good reasons to believe that 107(1) is constitutional, despite this opinion. (**Edit**: I misread FFRF's summary.  They make the distinction properly.)

107(1) allows exemption of the rental value of a home provided *to* a clergyperson.  Home is owned by the church, minister pays no rent.

107(2) allows deduction of a rental stipend paid by the church to the minister, who then pays rent on a home not owned by the church.

107(1) parallels an existing IRS policy allowing exemption of the value of a company-provided home, if having the employee live in company-owned housing is for the convenience of the company.  Applying this rule to clergy is *less* discriminatory than applying it only to business employees.

Anyhow, as frequently occurs with these cases, whether or not this ruling is valid may turn on the **standing** issue.  To have standing to sue the government requires that you have suffered an actual, factual, injury.  You have to have incurred a harm, or been denied a benefit.  Even if a law is blatantly, absurdly, comically unconstitutional, you have to have been injured by it to sue over it.  Silly, but that's how it works.

Being denied a tax exemption provided to others *is* a harm as a matter of law, so as long as the FFRF plaintiffs have been denied the exemption, they have standing.

What's not clear, unfortunately, is *whether or not* they have been denied.  The Government claims that they haven't been denied in-fact because they never claimed it on their tax returns.  The Plaintiffs argue that the tax code on its face makes it illegal to claim the benefit, thus operates as a denial of that benefit.  This is exactly the kind of semantic nuance that judges use to reach the outcome they like the best.

If an appellate judge (or SCOTUS justice) wants to, they can fatuously claim that as a purely technical matter, the benefit hasn't been denied because they never claimed it.  This would defeat standing, and the case would be dismissed *regardless of the merits of the plaintiff's arguments*.  Even though it could constitute a felony (perjury, tax evasion, etc) to claim the exemption, the court could rule that not claiming it defeats standing.

The judge addresses this point in the opinion, that this would have the effect of allowing an unconstitutional law to be un-challengeable, because it would be impossible to gain standing to challenge it.  Unfortunately, this kind of thing does happen.

One obvious problem with 107(2) is that it applies the deduction to ""ministers of the gospel"" -- which is pretty obviously an endorsement of religion.  Long before this case reached a final conclusion, it's possible that Congress would simply change the language of 107(2) to something more neutral, that would preserve the exemption in a way that is superficially constitutional but still manages to exclude non-clergy.

tl;dr:  **Don't hold your breath, folks.**  I doubt very much that this order is going to result in any clergymember or church paying more in taxes than they do now.  There are too many ways to get around this.

**""But it's unfair, other leaders and individuals who help just as much aren't given the same break!""**

Actually, yes they are. Pastor housing is subsidized under the e.451 clause of the non-profit partnership act, specifying that any non-profit founder or direct privilege employee is eligible for this subsidized housing. The act used to specify Christian church leaders only, but expanded to cover other religions, and eventually all non-profits which fall under certain community-based criteria. 

But if r/atheism has their way, the government will just tell them: ""Oh, well you could have had subsidized housing...until we discovered your organization is Christian.

bonesmagoo,"Sounds like Mark Twain.

Our own conversion came at last. We began to stir against slavery. Hearts grew soft, here, there, and yonder. There was no place in the land where the seeker could not find some small budding sign of pity for the slave. No place in all the land but one - the pulpit. It yielded at last; it always does. It fought a strong and stubborn fight, and then did what it always does, joined the procession - at the tail end. Slavery fell. The slavery text remained; the practice changed, that was all.

However, Weinberg was speaking of religion in general, not specifically of Christianity.

This is the paragraph with the pertinent quote:

&gt; Where religion did make a difference, it was more in support of slavery than in opposition to it. Arguments from scripture were used in Parliament to defend the slave trade. Frederick Douglass told in his Narrative how his condition as a slave became worse when his master underwent a religious conversion that allowed him to justify slavery as the punishment of the children of Ham. Mark Twain described his mother as a genuinely good person, whose soft heart pitied even Satan, but who had no doubt about the legitimacy of slavery, because in years of living in antebellum Missouri she had never heard any sermon opposing slavery, but only countless sermons preaching that slavery was God's will. With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil, that takes religion. ",null,0,cdks0f7,1r8vla,atheism,hot,1

&gt;Sexual harassment is a subjective analysis. If a woman feels put in a position of apprehension for her safety and if she feels like that she is being sexually harassed ... it is sexual harassment for a women in an area where she has a right to privacy and where men should stay out; just because somebody calls themselves a female, objectively he is a male! He will always be a male, just because you go through some kind of sex change mutilation surgery and cosmetic surgery and change your outward appearance.

First a quick tip: a whole lot of the beginning of your post seems off-topic. You could have cut out the Lego bits, for instance, and still have gotten your point across. Why discuss your kindergarten, your move to the city, the accusations of drugs? Your post is long enough that I worry many people who would otherwise help won't bother reading it.

&gt; How did you, fellow atheists, approach these questions of existence?

It's okay that there is no cosmic purpose to existence. I get to choose my own purpose. My life is mine to live, however I want. Personally, I try to learn as much as I can, have as much fun as I can, and make the world as good a place as I can. Why? Because these things make me happy, nothing more. Do whatever you want (though keep in mind the consequences; spending the future penniless, friendless, and in jail would probably suck). This life is yours to live however you see fit. That's pretty awesome, isn't it?

&gt; How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all you've believed was... false?

I admit, it's hard (and it sounds like you have it much harder than I did). It gets easier over time. You'll become more comfortable with your new outlook on life, and as the old one recedes into the past, it seems less and less important.

&gt; How did you deal with this sense of insignificance?

This is a very common question, and one which I think a lot of people get backwards. The universe is amazing and interesting and complicated and wonderful, and I feel privileged to be a part of it. This life is the only shot at existence that I get; I need to make it count. To [quote Richard Dawkins](http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/91-to-live-at-all-is-miracle-enough):

&gt; We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.

You might be interested in listening to [Letting Go of God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri3-DpSn7AA) by Julia Sweeney.

She discusses tensions with her religious parents, and raising children and mourning death without religion. It's funny, it's poignant, it's thoughtful.",null,2,cdktuoi,1r92wd,atheism,hot,9

How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all you've believed was, if you were not born to atheist parents, false?

Frankly, I've never been bothered by the reality of my, nor the human race's, existence.  Although I was born to a Christian family, I never believed in anything supernatural (I thought they were joking.)  This leaves me at a real disadvantage in assisting someone with your question - it is a common question, after all.  I have to hope that those who were once religious can fill this particular gap in my skill set.

For what it's worth, I find [NDT's comments on this topic fairly aligned with my own.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D05ej8u-gU)  My apologies if it seems cliche.  Almost all religions want you to believe that we are big fish (in a little pond) and not little fish (in a big pond), but I'm just happy to be a fish at all - as compared to an amoeba or a rock.  We're the most amazing development of nature that's ever been discovered - shouldn't that be enough?",null,3,cdktp18,1r92wd,atheism,hot,4
ca3799,"I just attended a book discussion at my local UU church that touched on some of your questions. The book under discussion was ""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Frankel.

I think what I took away from that discussion  was 'the meaning (not the purpose of life- that's a different question. One group member said the purpose was strictly biological, as in reproduction) of life is making meaning of life.'

Or, the meaning of your life is to make something meaningful of your life.

Frankel, a psychiatrist (and neurologist!) who survived the German concentration camps, thought that the meaning of his life was in helping others find meaning in theirs and he developed a psychoteraputic tool he called Logotherapy. He noted that those who lost hope or a vision of the future were more likely to succumb to the rigors of concentration camp life.

My feeling is that I won't live happily-ever-after in some gilded heaven or unhappily-ever-after in a torturous hell, so I only have this brief time to enjoy this amazing live I have and to help others enjoy theirs. True, my impacts won't last generations (actually my kids and my work may last a while), be recorded in history books, or change the world in major ways, but that doesn't bother me at all or make my tasks feel less important. It just makes me want to make more efforts so my impacts can be felt here and now.

I get my primary fulfillment from my very small family. Many are not so fortunate to have that. I try to focus on relationship and community. 

I also found fulfilling work that makes a real difference in other people's lives (nursing) and a fulfilling hobby that does this as well (running a community garden, teaching others to do so, and then and donating to the food bank). I think if you can't heal or feed one hundred, just try to heal or feed one. Even when healing won't happen, I can help ease the loss in a kind and professional way. I use the garden to allow others to contribute, too. 

So, best wishes to you! I recommend finding something that fills you up and that you can share with others. Relationship and community.

Do you have a purpose, in the grand scheme of 7 billion people? Probably not. No. So the fuck what? You get one shot at this life. Just one. You know what your purpose is? To live the hell out of the life you have been given. You know how many people didn't ever get to make it until their first birthday? You're here, and you're in well enough health, and there is always tomorrow. 

I got so tired of people trying to make me feel like I had no purpose, just because I'm an atheist. Look my 3 year old son in the eyes, watch him for a few days, appreciate the beauty that is a young person. I have to raise that little boy the best I can to be the best man he can be one day. That, for me, is purpose enough. And it doesn't have to be any sort of world-changing, earth-shattering purpose. But, for me, it is purpose enough. 

If you're telling me that it is better that the entire ""purpose"" of this life is simply to audition for the next life, then that to me is the true lack of purpose. This life is nothing, except for a test to get into the next one. I like the purpose of raising my 3 year old to be the best man he can be much better than the purpose of using this life as a try-out for the next one. What kind of purpose is that?

Sekret_One,"* How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all you've believed was, if you were not born to atheist parents, false?

You feel betrayed, and I do not think that is an inappropriate feeling. But there two ways you can approach learning: in fear an embarrassment, believing that each lesson just highlights your ignorance, or as a celebration, a thrill that there is something that you never even conceived of.

The old world is shattered. True It was familiar, with clear edges, simple rules ... that didn't work, and hatreds that didn't make sense. The world turns out to be a lot bigger, with a lot more properties than the little one. And the rules all seem to be a bit more... nerdy ... less ""gays are all evil"" and more ""matter cannot be created or destroyed"". Seems a bit fairer, though, don't it?

*  How did you deal with this sense of insignificance?

I am a small man. I will never eat all the food in the world. Does that make eating inconsequential? Do I not taste if I don't taste everything?

It is less scary when you get over the shock of not being in the center of the universe, and instead be part of the universe.

Personally, I can't see anything making me feel more insignificant than being created solely to acknowledge something else. Particularly when that something is insists on testing me when it already knows the answer, and baulks if I test it, when I don't know.

* the idea that everything needs a ""beginning"" and an ""end""? 

I wonder how baffled earlier mankind still applied 'beginning and end' to the surface of the Earth and found out it was a sphere. That Earth didn't really have 'edges'. The answer may be in the scope of a question we haven't even asked. But we can find answers, and that's exciting. But you can only find answers if you ask questions, and don't assume you're right.

The most harmful thing Christianity does is it instills this notion that everything you *need* to know is between the pages. It pretends that all that is unknown is unknowable. Yet we keep figuring stuff out.

It's startling to have the familiar fall away and see what appears to be an huge, unbound expanse. But trust me, that confusing but cozy place is nothing, nothing compared to what's actually out there. It's not a void. It's filled with people, strange plants, weird food, music reverberating on strings, vocal cords, drums and GUI displays, an internet that can freaking connect you to people on the other side of the world in a fraction of a second, moons in a perpetual state of falling, bacteria living without oxygen butted up against volcanic vents, blue whales, a genetic marker named after Sonic the HedgeHog, cartoons, robotic limbs, and corgis.",null,0,cdkvt7o,1r92wd,atheism,hot,1

I got the fuck over myself.  I let go of my ego and faced reality honestly and forthrightly.  Frankly, the entire history of science can be thought of as deflating the ego of a species which calls itself *Homo sapiens*.  The earth doesn't stand still with the rest of the universe centered on it.  Our planet isn't the center of the universe.  It's not even the center of our solar system.  The earth wasn't made to suit us, we were shaped by evolution to fit it.  We are not separate from the rest of the living world, we are an inextricably linked part of it.  We are not the center, we are a fortunate by-product.

So my experiences aren't of cosmic or eternal significance.  Waah.  I still get to experience them.  I get to eat donuts.  I get to have sex.  I get to hug my young daughters as I tuck them into bed.  For a (very short) while I got to be so poor that I couldn't afford sufficient food for myself.  I get to wonder whether I made the best choices in life and regret the people I know I've hurt.  I get to experience all the really cool stuff and all the really shitty stuff.  The fact that it's ephemeral makes it all the more precious and poignant to me.

This life isn't just a warm up or a prelude or a proving ground.  This is it.  This is all we get so we'd better make it as good as we can figure out how to.

DIEZEL59,"Sometimes I stare up at the stars on clear nights and I try to imagine [how fast I am moving through space at that moment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3p3K06dth4)  Along the earth's surface as it rotates around it's axis, the earth revolving around the sun, the sun moving through the galaxy, the galaxy rotating about itself.  It always gives me a bit of perspective and makes me feel connected to our world as a whole.  I like to imagine all the other planets out there in the universe flying around different directions at massive speeds just like us  and I wonder how many of them have someone/something else looking up thinking about the same things.

For me, living life without a god is about experiencing everything in the present.  I make up my own mind about things and do what I want because it's what I feel is right.  You'd be surprised how many people have blind faith in the church/state/news. This is obviously a very personal set of ideals and if you're inherently a good/bad person you're going to do good/bad things. 

I can imagine it being scary losing a sense of a god guiding and watching you.  I see it as a freedom to make your own existence. Yeah bad things happen sometimes, but it's ultimately up to us to make the best of our lives.  Each of us could have an impact on this world every day if we choose to.  Even something as simple as helping a friend, stranger, or animal.

 I hope you find some people to talk with that can relate with you and let you get things off your chest, It will help.  Our time here is limited and valuable, and I think it's better to spend each day with that realization rather than just waiting to move on to someplace else while thinking someone is pulling all the strings.

His people displayed the same mindless devotion as any religion, in fact it was so deep I remember stories of anti Sung defectors in the west crying when they heard he had died. We saw the same politics as religion with Stalin, Hirohito in WW2 Japan and many others.

We have bills to pay, provide a home for our pastor and his family and provide to our local foodbank. We donated 1587 pounds of food this year. Which feels great.

Another great fact to point out is that most Churches obtain their income through the donations of its members. Which, correct me if I am wrong, is money that has already been taxed. If I donate 100 dollars of what I made last cheque then that money was already taxed and I am choosing to donate to my Church.

What this means is that if the decision is not reversed on appeal, the IRS is barred from granting a tax exemption on extra income provided to a minister specifically apportioned for the paying of a minister's rent or mortgage. 107(1) which was untouched still allows a church to purchase a home and allow the minister to live rent free without reporting the market value of such  rental as part of his taxable income. 

This won't greatly effect most smaller, older, or more rural churches as historically these churches save money on minister salary by paying less and providing a living arrangement by way of a parsonage (often gifted to the church or bought by the church long ago rendering it a free addition for he church to make). Instead what the removal of 107(2) does is to prevent a minister from being able to hide any amount of income that they are able to show was spent on living arrangement, which is far more common among the larger churches which get proportionately more wasteful with increased size and grant ministers unreasonably high sums for their homes essentially allowing the Revruns and T.D. Jakes of the world to live lavish lifestyles while reported relatively little.

***""Readers will find that over the past twenty years, the case for the historical trustworthiness of the Gospels has grown vastly stronger.""***

It is generally considered, among scholars poor form to write your own blurb.

This quote from the blurb of [**The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man by Robert M Price**](http://www.amazon.com/Incredible-Shrinking-Son-Man-Tradition/dp/1591021219/ref=la_B001JPBXS8_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385179873&amp;sr=1-2) provides an interesting contrast;

***""For more than a century scholars have been examining the Gospels and other traditions about the life of Jesus to determine their historical accuracy. Although the results of these scholarly efforts are sometimes controversial, the consensus among researchers today is that the four Evangelists’ accounts cannot be taken at face value. In fact, a team of more than 100 scholars called the Jesus Seminar has come to the conclusion that on average only about 18 percent of the four Gospels is historically accurate.""***

There are two points worthy of note; 

 * Firstly, if you check the link to Amazon you'll note that Price, being a serious scholar uses quotes from published reviews of his books to provide the text for his blurbs. This one is from Freethinker magazine.

 * And secondly, that there is another very scholarly and respected perspective on these issues that is somewhat at odds with the views expressed by apologists such as William Laine Craig, Dinesh De Souza, and of course the very calm and balanced, Craig L. Blomberg.

Now, its not my place to tell you what you should think, or what conclusions you should draw on this issue. Likewise, I don't think you can be fully informed on a given subject until you've got an accurate and sound understanding of both sides of the issue.

Blomberg is as good an author as any to give you a grounding in the subject as it is presented by the modern school of evangelical apologists. Note, though that many scholars who are also Christian disagree.

The above link is as good a place as any to get all you need to know of the other perspective.

Anyone who read both of those books would be in a sufficiently informed position to consider the matter, and draw their own conclusions.

I've included a link below to a Robert M Price youtube video, because he should always be read as he speaks. I've also linked to a few Amazon pages for authors who have written well on the subject.

What people perceive as good and evil changes person to person.   Which shows it is largely a culture  and somewhat of a personal opinion.
Think of a few religions and then look at how drastically they can view certain issues differently.    A modern Christian for example would likely see Mesoamerican  mass human sacrifices to be  immoral,  yet obviously the other side of the fence would see it as a good and moral act.     

But it gets worse for theists as even people of the same faith will often disagree on at-least minor issues  and at times even major issues.    The topic of homosexual rights for example,  you can find that Christians can have a polar opposite opinion on this subject.

Daniellassander,"i will try to be as concise as i can but give me some slack english is not my native language.

There are many reasons why i dont believe in any religion god or gods first and foremost would be that even if we knew one religion was 100% true, how could we possibly know which one if we have to take it on faith? there is no clear way to differentiate between them. and we dont know if one religion is true at all.

Secondly would be that all religions (that i have studied) never has anything in their texts that reveals  something that we still did not know about the universe or the world we live in at the time it was written.

Third would be that most religions holy texts contradicts itself in certain places, so we know for certain that parts are not true/correct there is no way to discern which is the most accurate, and by this we also know that god indeed did not write it.

Fourth if there was a god and he cared about a relationship with us humans he would let us know, with evidence. and if that god had written any holy text we can be quiet sure that it would be unmatched in the literary world, it would be the most perfect thing ever written.

Fifth people of all religions often say that their god talks to them and tells them what to do, if that god was a real god those people would never find themselves at odds with others of their religion as the god would actually tell them the same things.

i can go on almost endlessly about this but there is one thing that stands out more then anything else. science gives us a clear and unbiased way of understanding the natural world we inhabit. it has uncovered that lightning comes from a charge building up in clouds by natural processes (no god there) earthquakes is tensions in the earths crust being released (no god there) volcanoes are magma under pressure bursting through fissures in the ground untill it reaches the surface (no god there) science gives us a way of understanding the world we live in that no religion can give us. and through all the progress of science we have not yet found something that requires a god.

we are also good and nice, but all of the traits i shared above, are things that are in the bible and are traits that humans have had since we developed speech and language in our socual circles, thousands of years prior to the bible being written.

I'd say that the odds in favor of a god existing are approximately the same: bad.

Also, as an atheist, I don't have a problem with creationism being potentially accurate.  The bible claims that it took her 6 days.  No problem.  Since I have absolutely no idea how to calculate a god day, I have to assume that it involves millions and millions of what we would think of as years.  The bible gets the order fairly accurate.  Nothingness, light, planet, plants and animals, man.  Seems spot-on to me.

I lost my faith when I was around 18 or 19.  Raised Baptist, I had a really hard time resolving some of the contradictions that I was being taught.  Eventually talked to a Jehovah's Witness who told me that many of those contradictions are actually translation errors introduced when King James was in charge.  Rather than offend the king, whenever there was anything ambiguous or controversial, the interpreters would ask the king what to put.  So, the JWs went back to the original text and translated it directly into fairly modern terms.  This is why they don't believe in hell: it was never mentioned in the original texts.  The grave, the burning pit, and the absence of a forever-after somehow translated to eternal damnation in the King James version.  They don't believe in blood transfusions because the original texts very clearly state that one does not consume human blood.

About 8 or 9 months of that and I realized that my problem wasn't getting solved because there was just too many inconsistencies.  I decided that I could accept the possibility of a god but, in no way was I about to believe that this book containing the word of man was accurate and that it was likely that if there *were* a god, for us to try to comprehend it would be like asking a goldfish to speculate a human's motivation.",null,1,cdlbjk0,1raker,atheism,hot,2

&gt;13 If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. 14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. 15 Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.

He specifically said that any who are reticent of conversion will be destroyed worse that the fate that happened in Sodom and Gomorrah.

This guy was a very devout Christian asking similar questions as you are now.Second:Answering the question you are asking. From what muddled explanation I've come to know. Think of yourself having a party at your house. You invite a bunch of your friends over. Some of them not so good people. Your friend John robbed a bank once, but he regrets it so you feel he's an ok guy. Your friend mike comes to the door, he helped John rob banks. He doesn't regret it so you turn him away. Whose to say he wont steal from you or anyone else at the party. Or corrupt people there. Then your friend jenny comes to the door. She's never done anything wrong. But she says to you, I would like to come in. I want to hang out too, but not with you. I'm here to use your stuff and hang out without everyone else.Jenny is a jerk, she's a great person otherwise and everyone elses friend, but she just wants you for your stuff and doesn't care about you. Will you let her in?In reality you are actually Jenny and God is the party host. This reasoning gets fucked up when your damning jenny to hellfire for eternity.

MartinTheRound,"I'm not sure what you mean by looking for signs and answers. Are you trying to have faith and find justification or are you looking for the truth out there. If you are looking for faith your quest is completely different, you will need to find something to reassure you to feel the spiritual connection. In this case I personally suggest something along the lines of being spiritual, that is to say just believe that there is a higher power and don't buy into any specific religion, search for the good parts of religions. If you're looking for the truth on the other hand you need to ask yourself, are you ready to find that there is in fact no higher power and the gods people believe in are just manifestations of psychology?

As for damning people to hell for not believing, it's one of the glaring problems with christianity. Think of if this way, if there were a loving god, he/she/it/they/them would not condemn people for silly stuff, surely. But from a critical perspective, consider that the jewish faith and the old testament has no concept of heaven or hell. And if you read the bible carefully you'll find that nothing jesus said mentions heaven specifically. Jesus spoke of the kingdom of god on earth and the resurrection of corporeal bodies when the time comes. And people are still waiting. Also consider that there is no single interpretation of pretty much anything in the bible. Or it can be seen that way, consider the christians that kill in the name of god despite thou shalt not kill is a commandment from god. Also consider that there are countless churches and denominations, so being right is out of the question, or at least practically out of the question. Since if a truth could be found and presented, it would not make sense to fracture churches.

You don't need a church or a doctrine to be spiritual. And you don't need to have faith in a higher power or spirituality to be good or happy. And if you're looking for the truth you might get surprised, be ready.

Even though atheists have this, quite frankly, drastic misunderstanding of Christianity, Christians have absolutely no idea what they believe, and they too have a limited understanding of their own religion. This ignorance is a turn off to most, and drive many further into atheism, searching for anything that remotely seems to refute Christianity based on that limited understanding, and even further, latching onto those discrepancies despite however weak those discrepancies actually are.

I watched alot of nature shows and out of interest started reading more and more about animals and eventually about extinct animals.  Over time evolution just started making more and more sense to me.  Eventually evolution went from being a crazy theory to something I could see everywhere.  You can look at related species and see their similar traits and imagine how they diverged at one point.  While accepting evolution does have to mean you don't believe in god, for me once I fully grasped evolution and could see how our world formed and life came to be the idea of god no longer made sense to me.  

As I moved further away I saw more and more how the bible was not divinely inspired but was clearly written by men, and many of them not very wise.  The bible is full of genocide, sexism, slavery, and so on.  The divine word of an infinite being would surely be more thought out.  If such a being did exist why would he so desperately need our worship?  It just doesn't add up, and one day it just clicked that I no longer believed in god.  

I'll also add that while I'd never go back, losing my faith was the hardest thing I have ever gone through.  I've never been more depressed than the initial 2-3 years after that.

so my mother thought that when she was young and ""got to knew god"" she had answers to everything and she is more a deist then anything else now but she thought that i would ask less questions and she wanted me to be a spiritual person growing up.

so i went to sunday school as it was called and at first we were allowed to ask questions as the priests or a nun told us stories about god and boy did i have questions, it was so bad they couldnt even complete their stories in the 2 hours we were there. so after a while they told my parents that we couldnt ask questions during the stories but after we could ask questions. and boy did i have questions! why this, why that, why so, why him, why there, why not etc etc.

and what really murdered religion for me in its infancy was the answers to my questions wasnt answers that told me anything, it was answers that required even more questions to sort through. ""god works in mysterious ways"", ""no one knows the mind of god"" these answers to my questions didnt feel right they just opened the door to even more questions.

and at home it grew worse as well, now my parents had to answers questions about god. and boy did i have questions!

so after a while my parents told me that i wouldnt go to sunday school anymore, but my sister still went. and they told me that no one really knew if god existed or if we lived in a world without a god. and that no one really knew the meaning of life. the only answer they had to that question was to grow up, get children, raise your children to be good persons and to try to be kind to other people, and try to find your own meaning of life.

I'm not religious, I don't have anything against religion itself or the people that follow their religion of choice (Assuming they're open minded and don't judge every living creature they encounter, ha ha, right?). I've had my fair share of experiences with several different religions as I was growing up, my parents were very open minded and allowed me to experience all sorts of different religions on my own. I learned very quickly that it just wasn't for me. I would probably consider myself Agnostic or simply Spiritual more than anything else.
As far as our government goes; Buildings, Currency, Monuments, etc. My opinion is there needs to be an absolute separation of Church and State on all fronts, plain and simple. We, as a society (And especially as Redditors) have already seen how chaotic and crazy a religious influence can make even the SIMPLEST OF DECISIONS in our government. For fuck's sake, they can't even wipe their asses without referencing some portion of the Bible that states exactly how many wipes is too many, not enough, and whether you can do it yourself or with someone of the same sex in the same room.
Our politicians can barely act on what is best for the people of this country without involving some flawed concept of Christianity or Catholicism. They can't vote on a simple idea without bringing in the Bible, the Jesus dude, or the big guy God himself. We can't even vote on a simple law to allow marriage to people who love one another, what the fuck is that all about, kids?
Anyway, my point in all this rant is simply that the longer we allow ANY religious references in any of our government activities, the longer we're going to be fighting this religious battle in a government that should not have any religious affiliations whatsoever. If you, as an individual, would like to think that God has his eye on us and is giving us the strength and the power to be a great nation... that's fine by me, do your thing. But DO NOT INTERFERE with what is best for the nation, best for the people, best for the majority, just because the Bible says it's naughty or ill-advised. 90% of what's IN YOUR BIBLE is terrible, evil, insane, outdated nonsense that offends even the religious followers who've failed to do their homework (i.e. Reading the fucking book that came with your choice of religion). The quicker we abolish these references, the quicker we can start to become a nation that focuses on the good of the people. All of the people. Bam, there it is. Chicks n' Midgets!!!

DinoDude23,"Apparently he needed to feel like everything was designed perfectly in mind for him in order for him to appreciate it. Ultimately it's an argument (as Richard Dawkins put it) from Personal Incredulity - ""I cannot accept that you can love without thinking things are designed, therefore there is a designer"". He interweaves this rather skillfully (befitting to his profession) with some some glaring non-sequiturs and errors of fact; for example, personalities and appearance aren't ""random"" - they're caused by an easily understood sequence of events occurring in childhood and gene expression, respectively. Lewis then blindly asserts that it is ""irrational"" for music to be pleasurable, without having any knowledge himself on what scientific reasons there might be for music existing within cultures in the first place, so once again we see argumentum ad ignorantium. Furthermore, he commits a non-sequitur by implying that because it is irrational, you therefore cannot explain it by chance alone - what a load of nonsense! Even if my love for ska music and kittens is inexplicable to me, that doesn't mean I can't appreciate them or that my feelings for them aren't real. He makes an assertion there that really amounts to little more than ignorant opinion. There's also a broad, implied false dichotomy here along the lines of ""science without God = total chaos, God = order"", when all the scientific principles we know of operate, interact, and originate all the same whether or not God's mentioned in the mix.

postoergopostum,"I've been thinking about a new approach to arguments about morality. Any thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciated.

One of the foundations of just about all religious doctrine is a moral code. Further, most of these doctrines are structured such that these rules are generally raised to a higher status than mere human rules and are regarded by the flock as being far more important and carrying more weight than civil laws.

This is then used as leverage to try and force all of society to conform with their individual ideology. Think of Sharia in the UK, or gay marriage in The US.

Apologists also use our own internal sense of right and wrong as an evidence for God. By claiming that the ideas we hold on the subject of how we should behave are not things that we have been taught or even conclusions we've reached on our own, the assertion is made that this moral law is a feature of The Universe, and it was put there by God.

To make matters worse there is the popular troll that those of us without faith are in some way morally compromised.

To date, we heathen have tried to construct scientific or philosophical justifications for a moral code or sense that is independent, as it must be of a non existent deity.

But what exactly is meant by the term morality?

Like 'spiritual' and so many other popular terms of faith (including faith), the word,morality is a slave to equivocation. Part of the way religious belief is kept unfalsifiable is by using a wide variety key terms ambiguously. If the things you say about your beliefs are confusing and difficult to pin down, let alone understand, then it's much more difficult for that belief to be shown as false.

Words like 'morality' are too loaded. We don't need them, and by using them we are giving too much ground.

As Hitch used to point out, those who are psychopathic, or sociopathic seem to exist without any genuine idea of morality and right or wrong. So morality, as such is not available to everyone.

Instead, let's talk about behaviour.

How human beings behave towards each other is something we can test and measure. There is already a wealth of data, and it feeds in directly to ideas like Harris' thoughts on well being and human flourishing.

We already call the subject, Ethics. It is the scientific study of human social behaviour. We even know where it comes from. Surprisingly, most social conditioning (formerly moral instruction) is carried out by our siblings and peers right from the very beginning of childhood. Fairness is understood the day after we first manage to crawl to the toy box under our own steam.

**TL:DR**
So my position is, to put it succinctly;

There is no such thing as morality. It's a term of ecquivocation, and only serves to cloud the real issue; How should we humans behave towards each other so that we maximise human well being and flourishing.",null,0,cdlepxw,1rava8,atheism,hot,1

Your example would not be an example of moral relativism, it's just a confusion of category. Few people would make the broad, categorical assertion that ""it is always immoral to kill"" (this view does exist, but it's rare), usually it's more akin to a view that gratuitous/non-defensive/unjustified killing is immoral.

Steven Pinker wrote a great, dense book called ""Religion Explained,"" which you could look at for better answers. He argues that our brains work by making categories for everything so as to better remember it later. We are attracted to supernatural ideas because they fit in some categories they should and shouldn't. A ghost may look like a person, so your brain says ""person category,"" which confuses you when you learn this person walked through a wall without breaking it. 

One would remember this story more easily than, say, an ordinary hunting story. But the hunting story can teach one a lot about hunting. So, ordinary stories and family histories are mixed with supernatural ideas to make them easier to remember and pass to the next generation. He talks about a study in which people were given words to read, and a week later were called back to tell the researchers which ones they remembered. It was always funny-sounding words that were spelled weirdly.

Basically, religion, Pinker argues, is a sort of culturally-specific memory system that eventually became what formed societies and made each group its own. The problem is, God and the supernatural can still exist in this scenario, Pinker only explains how our brains remember things.

Both athiests and religious people, as Tacsol5 aptly pointed out, at the moment depend on faith.

If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.

Further, apologists have sown the field with a host of escape clauses and equivocations.

His faith, like that of all believers is not rational. It's emotional.

Your rationalising and arguing won't deconvert him, and it certainly won't do it quickly.

People do abandon their faiths every day, but it's a long and slow process, and they have to think their way through it themselves. Though you can help. What you need to do is plant ideas in your friend's mind that he will return to and contemplate carefully over time. Being a delusion, the way to shatter it is to generate cognitive dissonance. I like to call them doubt engines, because once they're well planted, they just keep generating doubt. More effective than statements or arguments are questions, asked in earnest, with the full expectation carried on over time that a reasonable answer should be forthcoming.

Look I've got a question about Christianity that I'm having a hard time with. Correct me if I'm wrong, but salvation is guaranteed to The Flock because of the sacrifice of Jesus.

***Yes.***

Well what was actually sacrificed? Isn't he now seated at the right hand of The Father.

Ask him why prayer doesn't work. He'll say that there are ambiguous results, and we are still awaiting a definitive study. Then you can explain that the definitive study has in fact been done, and that the results are conclusive beyond all doubt and have been in since 1872. He'll say nonsense, nonsense. At this point in time you will need to be up to speed on statistics, institutionalised bias, and The Galton 1872 Prayer Study.

We grew apart a little at the end of high school when she grew more religious and preferred to hang out with her super Christian friend.

* The extremely sketchy employment contract that isnt any kind of employment, just a commitment from her to give them a lot of money. It is not an employment if you provide your own salary... That is recruiting to a pyramid scheme, nothing else.

* The use of ""partnership"" is also very pyramid schemy. Just as the ""employment"", it is nothing but ""how about you give us money?"", but just renamed so it sounds like something it isnt. Why not just call it ""giver""? It is to instill some kind of duty and loyalty so they can complain and demand stuff, which you cant do to people who are just ""givers"". 

* Pyramid schemes forces people to use up all their social contacts, milk as much money out of them as possible, and then when they and all their friends are dry, they just leave them or force them to stop doing it since they cant support themselves any longer. This is not a sustainable way to collect money, thats why they need to be able to get rid of all these used up people, and that is why the ""employment"" is completely self funded so they dont need to provide anything or have any kind of responsibility.

She is being used, and probably instructed in how to convince all her friends and relatives to give her money. The use of Jesus and calling itself nonprofit is just a way to try to get around the fact that pyramid schemes are illegal. I would research what they actually do with the money.

We pass through this veil of tears but once. What's more, in short order.

One of the surprises that strikes you in middle age is how insanely you have been undervaluing friends and friendship. Once they die, they are dead for a fucking long time.

There's a couple of points I might make. Firstly, you don't have to agree with your friends on every point of ideology.

That said, sooner or later we all have to grow up and take up an adult role in our community. In a democratic society it is your duty as a citizen to act as a representative for principles and ideals you feel are important, for if not you, then who. There is no shortage of the religious right representing God's interests in the gay marriage debate. Which is only as it should be. Everybody is always eager to claim their rights as a citizen, and far too reticent when it comes to their duties.

It is possible to stand your ground on a matter of principle, question and contradict the statements of those who disagree, yet maintain the respect of your peers. It's not easy, it's one of the great challenges of life, and few make the grade.

It is in our dialogues with friends that we can acquire and practice these skills. Our friends will give us a little latitude if our diplomacy is clumsy, and it is often possible after a faux pas to rehabilitate goodwill. These are life skills that will stand you in good stead for the rest of your life.

So decide what you want to achieve, make a plan, do it.

Good Luck.",null,0,cdljh48,1rbivg,atheism,hot,6

Jews like the first movie, but ignored the sequels, Christians think you need to watch the first two, but the third one doesn’t count, Muslims think the third one was the best, and Mormons liked the second one so much they wrote fanfiction that doesn’t fit with ANY of the series canon.

The tactic of sending out young, naive, polite and well-dressed missionaries seems to work for them.  They are trained to be non-confrontational in debate and not to raise their more crazy beliefs on first encounters.  They bend over backwards to be classified as 'Christians' but are not recognized as such by most christian and non-christian observers.  As a European I found it somewhat ironic that in the last US presidential election there were anti-Obama car stickers saying 'Vote for the Christian, not the Muslim.'  I'm not a huge fan of Obama but if Romney had been elected he would have been the first openly non-Christian President of the USA, though he would have declared himself as such.

CesarV,"I am always polite to them when I see them, but ask them a few questions that no Mormon has ever been able to adequately answer.  For instance: How do you explain the fact that DNA evidence contradicts the historical narrative in the Book of Mormon?  Why is steel mentioned in the BOM but not only has no steel been found that was made by natives in North/Central/South America, but no evidence that they had the technology to produce steel?  Why are horses and barley mentioned but both were not present or used by natives?  Why is it that modern linguistics has demonstrated no connection at all with native languages and the middle east?  If you believe in the ""small population theory"" why is it that in the BOM there are battles with hundreds of thousands of people killed, yet no evidence of these battles?   

Nine times out of ten, they smile, nod, listen... and then ask me to check their website or come to the temple for a chat with an elder.  I then tell them that I have already done this, and no solid answers.

I have to say though during my time with them a nicer bunch of people you would be hard pressed to meet. No one in the church gets paid for any work they do and 100% of money given as charity is used for charity.

Like all places there are a few people that were what I call Sunday Christians but I would say in my area they where in the minority.

As for the missionaries it is crazy what those kids go through mentally, I became friends with missioners as we where around the same age and when one went home she was institutionalized. She could not leave her room for weeks without another person. They live 24/7 with another person of the same sex for 18 to 24 months, so it must be hard being a missionary.  

So nowadays when I come across them I offer them a lift if they need it, I speak to them nicely although I may at times really push them with theological questions, they never react with anger or scorn and they have never said I would go to hell for not believing like my own brother who is a Evangelical church member said  to me one day.

Yes these kids know nothing about the real world but they do try and live there beliefs everyday which can rarely be said about a lot of religious people.

monedula,"A careful look at the list of prophesies you refer to quickly shows how nonsensical they are.

1. ""Messiah would be born of a woman"". Big deal. How many men are not?

2. ""Messiah would be born in Bethlehem."" This is *not* what the prophecy says: it says that he would be born to the clan of Bethlehem. 

3. ""Messiah would be born of a virgin."" If you read the prophecy in context it is clear that this prophecy has nothing at all to do with Jesus, but is referring to the Assyrian invasion, centuries earlier. And in any case the original Hebrew says ""young woman"",  not ""virgin"".

4. ""Messiah would come from the line of Abraham."" In other words he would be a Jew. Big deal.

5. and 6: Matthew and Luke give wildly different lines of descent, inspiring no confidence at all in their reliability. Furthermore they are *male* lines of descent. And Jesus' father was supposed to be God - on which basis he was *not* a male-line descendant of Isaac etc. The whole thing is a complete muddle.

7. ""Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah."" This contradicts the Micah prophecy that he would come from the tribe of Bethlehem.

8. ""Messiah would be heir to King David's throne."" Jesus was never the king of anything. All we get is a repeated prophecy that he will be one day.

9. ""Messiah's throne will be anointed and eternal."" We're still waiting.

10. ""Messiah would be called Immanuel."" He was called Jesus. See also point 3.

11. ""Messiah would spend a season in Egypt."" If you read this in context, it isn't even a prophecy. And according to Luke he didn't go to Egypt.

Notice how the gnostic atheist is depicted to be  similar to the gnostic theist and sort of a jerk as well.   This is the general idea that is passed around by some (Note I said some here)  agnostic atheists.  
That pretend to be more open minded  and more intelligent when they really aren't.    

Their stance is based on the idea since we cannot disprove we do not know and therefor we don't claim that they can be wrong.    Which is absolute bullshit,  there are tons of things agnostic atheists  will deem as false in their lives and they will not be open to it many of these things won't even be of religious nature and much more plausible than  the claim of a deity.  They also almost never tend to be consistent  and will be agnostic about religions like Christianity but not Scientology.  Go and ahead and test this yourself watch how many without pause will outright claim Scientology to be false as if it were a known fact.

I just treat them the same as agnostic theists now. Because if you don't believe in something but are open to the idea no matter how absurd it is, it's really just a step away into belief.   Being closed minded is not a bad thing when it is placed upon absurdities.  If I were to over a tonic  that provided super powers  how many of them would believe me?  Zero,  how many would be open to the idea that it may? Zero,  and rightfully so.

im-a-noob,"&gt; The only reason we even consider the possibility of a god is because some guys wrote stories about nonsense because they did not know science.

No. There are deities in all human cultures. We are natural worshippers and followers. We worship and follow leaders, things, desires... That's what lead some guys to write stories, not the other way around.

Of course, that does not mean those guys were right about anything. It just tells us something about ourselves.

&gt; I am completely sure there is in fact no god. I can not prove that one doesn't exist, but I can't prove the non-existence of something.

I'm even making an assumption when I rule out some of them, that assumption being that I am here typing a comment and this is reality (which is supported by lots of evidence, but you never *know*, I could be dreaming this, or I could be someone else's dream). 

Anyway, long story short, I don't think it's *taboo*, I just think gnostic atheists have a hard time being self-consistent with the way we actually know or don't know things about the world.

BuccaneerRex,"The nature of epistemology does not allow certainty on some types of claims. But the lack of certainty is not a vote for belief in the claim. An agnostic atheist simply acknowledges the lack of certainty. 

Some people like to denigrate that as 'fence sitting' or 'holding out', but it's really not. It is just admitting that the concept of a deity is not one that can ever really be proven or not, because of the nature of the claim, not because of a failure of knowledge or science.

Theist hypotheses are, to paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli, ""Not even wrong."" 

They can't be scientifically proven or disproven because they're not science. The ""supernatural"" is an oxymoron. If something has an effect in the universe, it can be studied scientifically. If something does not have an effect within the universe, it can't be said to exist.

What this leads to is the conception of a deity being goalpost-shifted until $deity is simply defined as the universe itself, at which point you've just made the $deity irrelevant as an entity within your hypothesis. 

I can't say with perfect certainty that no deity exists anywhere. But not because I expect one to be hiding somewhere in the universe; it's because I don't make any claims regarding a deity. I can say that any theist claims I've ever heard of are ruled out by the nature of reality as exposed through scientific investigation, and that I do not accept any theist hypothesis as an explanation for the observed phenomena around me. 

By holding this stance, I am not making any claims, and therefore leave no rhetorical ""cracks"" to get an argument into. The burden of proof remains completely on the side of the theist, and thanks to Hitchens' Razor, I can reject claims without evidence without needing any more justification.

The 'strong' or 'gnostic' atheist position strikes me as a 'doth protest too much' assertion. It is like including ""And we have ruled out Leprechauns explicitly as the mechanism for this phenomenon"" in a scientific paper.

- The estimation of the world, owing to the above, as flawed or a production of ""error"" but possibly good as its constituent material might allow.
- The explanation of this state through the use of a complex mythological-cosmological drama in which a divine element ""falls"" into the material realm and lodges itself within certain human beings

&gt;THE FIRST BOOK OF APES, CALLED
**KINESIS**

&gt;CHAPTER 1

&gt;1 At the beginning there was nothing but a big ball of gases.
2 For a long time it just sat there in the nothingness, getting hotter and hotter.
3 Then it exploded.
4 The explosion created the stars, which were burning bubbles of the first big ball of gases.
5 The stars threw out chunks of debris that cooled and became planets.
6 The planets spun round and became round.

&gt;CHAPTER 2

&gt;1 In a remote and insignificant sector of the universe, one planet fell into an orbit around its star that by accident made its surface conducive to the molecular formations known as amino acids.
2 Neither so close to their planet's star as to be incinerated, nor so far from it as to be frozen, the acids survived,
3 And proceeded to combine into new molecules of a complexity advanced enough to permit change and growth,
4 And meiosis, and the development of certain other transient characteristics of a generic nature classifiable as life.

arthurpaliden,"Genesis For The Modern Age

1. In the beginning there was only God and he alone created the void that was the Universe. Then into the void that was the Universe God placed a infinitesimal part of his being. Then he sat back and watched.

2. And the void being with out substance was unable to contain this essence of God and so it expanded at a terrible speed releasing unimaginable energies.

3. Where upon there was created the four fundamental forces to contain these energies. The Strong Nuclear Force, the Weak Nuclear Force, the Gravitational Force and the Electromagnetic Force.

4. And with the establishment of these controlling forces expansion of the Universe slowed and the great energies cooled  the first elementary particles were formed. 

5. And from these partials the first atoms were formed. The initial one having a single proton and electron and God looked down and said let this be called Hydrogen.

6. Then when all the Universe was Hydrogen  the Fundamental Force of Gravity caused groups of these atoms to come together in ever larger masses.

7. Where upon when the masses became so large and the Force of Gravity so strong that they started to smash the atoms of Hydrogen together creating new atoms and releasing new energies that  illuminated the Universe.

8. And thus Stars were born and there was now light upon the void.

9. Then as the forces within the stars created heavier and heavier atoms the energies generated within became great. Greater in fact than the Force of Gravity. Where upon the very Stars themselves exploded spewing the atoms out in great clouds into the void.

10. Again the fundamental forces came into play creating new stars from the lighter atoms and Planets from the heavier ones. Starting the  cycle of Star birth and death.

11. Now it came to pass that the Planets once formed were much cooler than the Stars allowing the atoms of various types to join together according to the Fundamental forces into molecules.

12. Some were simple such as the water that filled the seas some were complex such as the precursor proteins of life itself.

13. And with in the waters those combined to produce the first self replicating proteins which then became  the symbiotic proteins and they first living organisms appeared.

14. And as population pressure grew life began to change to venture into new habitats to eat new foods and thus evolution began.

15. And God marveled at the result of what he had put in motion,  which was Man.

16. Then God spoke to man thus,

17. “Do unto others as you would have then do unto yourself”

18. “Use your intelligence to discover the wonders of this Universe and solve your own problems as it will help you to grow as a species and become better people.”

19.  “And, oh ya, Don't be jerks.”.

20. Then all was quiet and Man looked about and thought, “Now where do we start?”

This is a specific example of the general unreliability of faith as a means of determining fact.  Every religion uses faith, and the fact that they are incompatible shows that faith leads to error more often than truth.  As always, stating general principles is useful but examples really send the message home.  Good job!

A_mellifera,"As someone who left the fundamentalist religion I grew up in, I think I recognize where you are. You have largely made the rational decision about what you believe. You can't un-see the world as you now see it. But there is all of the emotional part to deal with. In some ways, this is the bigger obstacle. No, you definitely aren't a terrible person for losing the ability to relate to the way your family and friends speak about and think about the world. Leaving a religion can feel like a huge loss. There is fear of the unknown, but also this suddenly looking at the known differently. It takes a while to adjust.

I'd recommend that you don't tell your parents anything until you feel pretty comfortable with where you are. It's clear you are already mentally comfortable. I'm talking about the emotional part of it. Maybe you never confront them with it. I have tried a couple of times, over the years since I left, to tell my dad my opinions. It's clear this will be so hurtful to him that I have decided to let him construct his own opinions about why I never go to church, why I change the subject when he starts in on the Hope for Israel. My mom has a better idea of what I think. They both know I believe in evolution, but my mom will actually talk to me about it. They both believe I still believe in a higher power. I have never said anything to reinforce this idea; I have actually said things to make them believe I am an atheist. But it's clear this is something they need, so I don't press it. My mom knows I don't believe in their specific religion (Christadelphianism). My Dad believes I have issues with the power structure. I don't know why he constructed this story, but I've decided to stop challenging it.

I'm addressing your first question last, because everyone approaches this differently. For me, it helped to sit in a space where I asked myself: OK A_mellifera, let's just say God does exist. Do I want any part of what he's done? Do I really want to support a supreme being, who created people who are rational and capable of understanding his message, but then decided that a girl who grew up in China at the time of Christ was never to have a chance to be saved? Do I really want to believe that he sent his son only to the Middle East, and a boy growing up as a native of America or Australia would only hear his message (of love, supposedly) from people who enslaved him and took his land and used God as an excuse for it? And these kids - real kids who actually existed - are sentenced to a life without God or eternal torment for things they couldn't control. If that's what God is, then I don't want any part of it. Giving myself this was a huge relief. It can be completely internal, but once you make the emotional break, you'll feel it. Then you can start constructing what you really think and feel about the world without all of the baggage. Seriously, I can't explain it to you until you are there, but it is a HUUGE relief to let yourself believe what you already believe. Some of that is recognizing the ridiculousness of people who think God answered their prayers about a promotion, even though He let your aunt die of cancer. Because it IS ridiculous.

Science which is the atheist foundation and backbone for intellectual support when used to counter religion, is only an observation through our perception of our natural and biological surroundings. It is in a constant state of evolution through observation and realization of the outside world. 

Religion or theism is internal self assessment and processes to better yourself and grow your consciousness and guide you through life situations. to help create a higher potential for a sensible, moral, &amp; rational ideology.

A big part of my growing up was realizing (and ultimately understanding and forgiving) my parents' flawed psychology and its impacts on my younger self. I encourage you to consider your current thinking in the context of becoming an adult. No matter where you end up theologically, you will need to come to an understanding of why your parents raised you the way they did. I applaud you for starting on this essential process. Too many people blame their parents without understanding, and/or parrot their families without critiquing.

Do NOT tell them as long as you are dependent on them.

1. Your question is a thought experiment. the answer to the second part is determined by how you define God. Clearly no one really knows anything so worrying about it is kind of a waste of time. It's a great thing to think about and I've spent much time doing it, but there is nothing you can really do about it. Asking ""what if there is a God, what happens if I don't believe"" is the same as asking ""What if there is something unknown, what are the results of taking a certain position of unknown.""
P.S.  (The arguments about a ""good god wouldn't do this..."" are just as much nonsense as the bible.)

2. I would say no since you are posting on here asking if its bad or not, clearly you care enough for them to ask that question.

3. That's tough, it really sucks when there is no one to talk to other than on reddit lol. I wouldn't just flat out tell them but instead just try to drop hints, obviously you didn't wake up one day and say ""I'm an athiest"" or ""I'm not a christian anymore"" (or did you?) Try to recreate the gradual process that you went through to get to the point your at. Otherwise it will be too much of a shock for them.

Whatever you take initiative to make happen. Obviously, the world is a large and chaotic place, and there's no guarantee that plans will turn out the way you planned them...but being the one to decide your own course of action, as opposed to some plan laid out by some ""Divine Being"" long before you were born, sounds much better, I venture.

JacksmackDave,"I am familiar with this issue.  I am 32, and my parents know I don't go to church anymore.  I don't come out and say I don't believe the same things I did when I was younger because I respect people who want to keep their beliefs.  I have experiences that make me question the biblical version of things, but I also have experiences that to me confirm there is more to existence than random chance. 

I suppose I'm agnostic since I can't resolve my personal conflicts with the idea of a God that is perfect changing the rules to the game called life multiple times in the bible.  I laugh to myself thinking the rules could be changed again once everyone is in heaven, but no one sees that obvious possibility in Christianity. 

But my advice is, family is family.  If the only reason you want to come out to them is to argue your egotistical point about how they are wrong, you are going to cause more harm than good.

He gave you the ability to recognize and notice discrepancies, and to rationally analyze information. It would be cruel if he made you with these qualities, and then punished you for using them. Also, as everyone has pointed out, there have been tons of gods worshiped by people throughout history, and plenty of them are still worshiped today. The fact of the matter is that even if you forced yourself to ignore the problems in your faith, and to recommit to Christianity, you still would not have freed yourself from this question.

2. You didn't make the situation ridiculous, and you're certainly not a bad person for noticing that it is. One of my biggest personal grievances with religion is that a lot of religious people treat perception and intelligence like personal failings.

The point is to realize that God, if exists, can also be a douche at times (seriously, read the Bible) so if he wants to judge you by the amount of wanks you had and prayers you gave, he's petty and focuses on insignificant things.
2.

If there is a god and he is just then you will get into heaven based off how you lived your life, not how good you were at closing off your brain.

Some people retreat into religion because it is a way to cope with a scary world that they do not understand. Do not laugh at these people.

geeuurge,"* This is an argument for religiosity called Pascal's Wager. The idea is that if there is no God, there is no benefit to being an atheist, but if there is a God, it pays to be religious. The reason this is an unreasonable argument is that the consequences of god's existence literally have nothing to do with whether he actually exists or not. There's no real way to let this go, you just have to believe what you think is right, not what will net you the most afterlife. 

* No. But you probably shouldn't laugh about it to their faces. Imagine how you'd feel if someone did that to you when you were a devout Christian. We all tell little lies as social niceties, This is one of them. If you don't find that a compelling reason, bear in mind that ridiculing someone is probably the least successful way to get them to see your point of view. 

* Don't tell them, at least not yet. Deconversion is not an easy ring to go through, and you don't have to deal with being disowned at the same time.

2)  Humor is a way of coping with pain &amp; loss.  At the root of all humor you will usually find that someone has been hurt at least a little.  Sometimes this pain is nothing more than making a silly mistake that wastes time or resources or mildly hurts your reputation with no lasting damage.  But almost always there is some loss.  So you mind instead of getting stuck in depression, it just laughs and goes on.  So I would say the fact you find humor in the situation means you are normal &amp; healthy.  If you did not find at least a little humor I would worry you are suffering from depression.

How I would urge you to not make the mistake that ""ninterd"" does.  Do not believe that just because you recognize the damage it makes you superior.  Pride is very likely what keeps your family from recognizing their mistakes and escaping Christianity also.  And someday your pride will make you make a keep repeating a mistake also.  In the case of ""ninterd"", he comes off as an elitist and may actual alienate those he would like to help.  

3)  I don't think you have to take on the burden of deconverting your parents.  As far as I can see there are only two reasons you need to tell them.  One, is that you are trying to serve as an example of moral atheism in an attempt to deconvert them.  Two, is that their religious harassment is so burdensome on you that you need to tell them in order get them to let up on you.  If one is your only reason to tell them, then don't.  If two is your reason to tell them, then tell them as soon as you are no longer financial dependent on them.

Not remotely. I can't comment further, as I have no idea how you would have come to this conclusion.

&gt; I realize that I've been brainwashed my entire life, but how do I tell my parents that I don't believe? They are so extreme about their religion, that it's quite possible they'll disown me.

Don't. Ever. It's none of their god damn business. No one has the right to question you. Fuck them for judging you. And if live with lying by omission, then you can all get along just fine. There's nothing to gain except polish on your personal pride, and maybe some support to your siblings, but don't bother until they're all out of college and in their careers, so that your parents can't destroy them by disowning them if they become frantically paranoid. I'm suggesting that coming out now can have a cascade effect of hurting others in your family unit by association.

The common advice, though, is if/when you do have that conversation, do so after college, when you have a career, and your own home. You need to sever all financal ties with them and be completely independent. You need to make sure there's nothing that they can take away from you, because they might, or they will, if they can.

I also suggest you need the right attitude. It should be matter-of-factly; your atheism is not an open disucssion or debate. There is no right or wrong, no opportunity to be converted, which often they will try to do. Don't defend your atheism, as it doesn't need defending; it stands on its own.

&gt;Is the universe ordered or random?

You would have to define ordered and random a bit more to get a detailed answer.  There are certainly some fundamentals about the way things interact - especially on the small scale and very large scale.  But there is no need for the hypothesis that there is a deity behind the scenes pulling the strings.  After all, if the planet (or universe) was better suited for a different kind of life, then is is that different kind of life that would be here.  So I suppose my answer would be that it is random, *possibly* [brought about by a quantum fluctuation.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-EilZ4VY5Vs#t=1330)

Again, this depends on how you define evil.  It's a socially agreed upon empathetic construct that changes over time as people gain more/better access to knowledge and freedom to express themselves.  

For example, slavery is generally considered evil in modern America (even though it still takes place at greater numbers then ever worldwide, including in America) - but that was not always the case.

&gt;Is the universe ordered or random?  

Yes.  It is ordered in that the laws of physics apply universally (good try but no, anything beyond an event hroizon can't properly be said to be in our universe).  And the entropy is increasing, btw. It is random in that events at the quantum level can not be predicted, not as far as we know anyway.  There are also random processes at the macro level.  Hence the mathematical field of statistics.

Humans define evil into existence just like they do good.  Events occur.  Events that cause harm are defined as evil if there is an intelligence guiding it.

A theist should see it as evil given that their god has the ability to mitigate or eliminate the pain, destruction and death, yet does not.

 I was raised in a Confucianist culture, that years of communism and modern zealotry couldn't completely erased. The family is a sacred thing and the basic unit of society. It is the filial duty of all members of family to care for each other and extend the family and accumulate wealth for the family through work and marriage. Furthermore our complex communist culture also contributed to our modern understanding of a family, retired grandparents often watch over children while both parents work (in my parents time there was no way for one man to feed more than 2 children and a wife). Family is so important to us we consider it highly improbable a person can be a good person without a harmonious family life.

Good one! Families are obviously most important for raising children, and providing for their physical, emotional and developmental needs. In today's society where there's a lot of value placed on individual achievement, I think successful families will instill values of thinking and acting independently, while providing a physical and emotional safety net to fall back on when difficulties arise. Outside of childhood, I think the obligations of family only extend as far as the strength of the relationships that make them up. If a family member repeatedly or severely mistreats you, there is no obligation to continue a relationship with that person just because they are family.

&gt;Is the universe ordered or random?

There are obvious examples of both order and randomness at work in the universe

&gt;What is the meaning of life?

Life does not have a meaning in the way a sentence has a meaning, since it arose through natural forces acting on random events (see, there is order and randomness again). Our lives have meaning because we, as thinking agents, assign them meaning. However this meaning cannot be a monolith since each of us has our own perspective. I find meaning by concentrating on developing my strengths and creating good feeling in the people around me.

&gt;Is truth subjective or objective?

Pretty obviously, it is objective, since truth is determined by comparing a statement's meaning to reality. Of course, if one makes statements about subjective things, such as favorite colors, then the truth of those statements is in some sense subjective. Furthermore, since truth depends upon meaning, if the meaning of the statement depends on subjective evaluations, then the truth can be subjective as well.

&gt;Where does evil come from?

To the extent that evil is a thing, say ""a disregard for the well-being of others to the point of taking intentional harmful action,"" there are evolutionary reasons why these impulses still exist despite our best efforts to eliminate them. Individuals can act evilly because greed and self-interest have been successful strategies for propagating genes, and groups can act evilly towards other groups because defending ones tribe against outsiders allowed the tribe's gene pool to succeed collectively.

It plays a huge role by omission. Theistic views tend to have a pretty oppressive effect on the formation of worldviews. It's pretty hard to ignore something like a sky dictator when determining how you feel about things. My atheism allows me to consider each issue according to its observable properties, and find the answers best supported by evidence and reasoning.

Family: Family is an emotional safe place. It's the people you care about and (hopefully) can count on for emotional and other support.

Truth: Truth is the same as reality. It's that thing that doesn't go away when you close your eyes. Reality can't be fooled. So very objective.

Root of Evil: Evil comes from people. When we forget that other people are, well, people then we are capable of anything. It can also happen when people lose sight of reality.

At any given moment, this planet could be ripped apart by a nova blast wave without even seeing it. To us it would be ""the end of the world"". To the universe, it would be another blip.

There is no inherent meaning to life - or to anything - other than *what you bring to it*. Instead of asking ""what is the meaning of life"" , you should ask ""HOW SHOULD I LIVE MY LIFE?""

Notice - that *actually has purpose* and *can be answered*.

""Is truth subjective or objective?""

The world would be a lot better off if we tolerated each other and defended our right to be unique.

thorne36,"As an Atheist as well, I know exactly how confounded people are by the fact that I participate in Christmas. This answer may be kind of long but I want to go into why I participate in Christmas even though I fundamentally disagree with the idea of it. Btw, I want to use the phrase 'participate in xmas' rather than 'celebrate xmas', because although I celebrate the gifts, friends, and moments of Christmas; I don't celebrate Christ.

First of all, I want to criticize the Christian idea of Xmas. I'm sure, long ago, xmas started out as truly a Christian celebration of their messiah (and to some, or maybe even most, it still is). However, it has since turned into an industry and an embedded AMERICAN tradition (I can only speak for the US). One example, and I understand this example may be hard to make since almost all the US is Christian, Hanukkah. As xmas grew in to the huge commercial enterprise it has over the years, a relatively insignificant Jewish holiday seems to have had undue importance placed on it to compete with the commercial enterprise of xmas. Seemingly indicating that there is an underlying value to the holiday outside of its religious value. That other value, in my opinion, is economic enterprise. It ultimately is an enormous American economic enterprise, that can't be ignored by other religious preferences within the population. It's a time when large segments of the population don't have to work, when bonuses are paid and an almost nationally-agreed-upon time of year for 'a day off', for lack of a better term. The American economy nearly comes to a halt, which makes Christmas too big to be ignored. But if it’s too big to be ignored, what should we do as Atheists? Come up with an ‘Atheistmas’ and try to apply some type of values to it, when the rest of the country is doing something else, that way more fun?  You could try that and write your own xmas-type holiday that takes place at the same time but assign your own traditions to it (festivus?). I think most of us aren’t as bold as Frank Costanza though and we’re stuck celebrating an enterprise that has a religious origin, but now is simply an American enterprise

After all that, I want to say I agree with you, I like all the festivities, the music, the gifts and everything that xmas brings. I think it’s fun to celebrate the enterprise that is Christmas, but I just exclude the religious elements of it.

The last thing I want to say is a warning to Atheists who participate in xmas. Like I said, I feel xmas is an American industry that we choose to participate in, but there is a danger in us participating. We belittle the cause of Atheism by participating; if we allow the Christian part of xmas appear to be the part of xmas that we participate in. If we allow it to be seen by others in that light, we seem to admit defeat to go along with the status quo rather than adhering to our beliefs. The danger is that we appear to others to not be serious about our cause and lose the little bit of traction that we have in juxtaposition to Christianity in America. So, I don't feel it's bad to participate, just that we have to let others know why it is that we do participate.

tl;dr: Christmas is an American Industry, not necessarily a religious holiday

Your mother's anger phase is a show — a drama — that she is performing to pluck at your heartstrings and to hurt your feelings. Your mother is using “emotional blackmail” to make you do what she wants. Emotional blackmail is a type of bullying. Do not take to heart anything that your mother says about you.

The story is attributed to R' Moshe Leib of Sasov, one of the top students of R' Shmelke of Nikolsburg. The end of the story (as recounted by Buber and translated by Olga Marx in the 1947 Schocken Books edition) is as follows:
For if someone comes to you and asks your help, you shall not turn him off with some pious words, saying: 'Have faith and take your troubles to God!'

He was almost sure he wouldn't have been able to be so charitable without his belief in ""The Lord"". We load boxes for shipment and a few moments later he'd handed off a box to me he didn't think could fit in his shipping container, and I jokingly told him I had no problem taking up the ""slack"", or being generous without a belief in God. We've always had open discussions about religion, race, sexual orientation and the like, and he seems to agree with me and my more secular stances despite his broad belief in a higher power and the bible. I thought it was funny that I'd see this having confronted him about it and giving him something to consider.

Lithuanighanistania,"I spent a year in Japan as an exchange student at a Christian school (I put 'atheist' on my application under religion; it was removed because, ""Atheism is not a religion."") and I can say it did sour the experience somewhat. Luckily, no one there really cared about that aspect of the school and none of my host families were religious.

If this is bothering you now, I can pretty much say definitively that it will get worse and it will ruin the rest of your stay. It's in your best interest to talk to your coordinator first, get his/her advice on it, and you'll almost have to tell your family at some point.

Circles_for_Infinity,"I came out to my parents and in-laws in a letter format. My wife to be and myself ran into a roadblock with the priest that was to marry us when I started asking questions about leaving the mention of God out of my portion of the vows. It was important to me that I not vow something that I didn't intend to hold up and live by, and I didn't want to lie to the church by vowing certain things before God. More importantly, this priest was my god father and was full aware where my journey of faith had taken me over the years and that I had become an atheist as a result. Instead it was his way or the highway, so we elected to take the highway. As such, we needed to break the news to our families about what had transpired so I printed out the email exchanges that we had had with him and presented them to the parents. Of course they were able to connect the dots and soon became aware of my doubts and rejection of faith and belief in the supernatural. It was a tough pill to swallow for my parents, and my in-laws absolutely freaked out and wanted to stop the marriage proceedings. After my parents talked sense into them the wedding went off without a hitch. My in-laws still take issue with my lack of faith, but that is an entire different story and long post. My parents, on the other hand, started asking me questions. Long story short, both of my parents have quite a bit of doubt and continue to be interested in where I am and what my thoughts are regarding certain issues. They both read many thoughts and links that I post and expand and challenge their own comfort zone with faith. In fact, they both recently admitted to me that the only thing that keeps them involved in the church is the sense of community and family that it offers. They pretty much admit that nothing in the text makes sense, and that science is a far better explanation for things than magic.

I once thought I was dead, and that I was experiencing the afterlife. It was fascinating.

I was skiing in the Symphony Bowl (I think? It was a decade ago.) at Whistler, solo, and there were some cliff zones under the chair. One of them looked promising. I couldn't tell you just how tall it was now - taller than the trees anyway but it could've been anywhere from 20 to 40'. Anyway I wanted to jump it. 

When I came down (and passed under two ropes and past lines of signs signaling a cliff area and a ski area boundary) I wound up at the top of the cliff, and learned that there wasn't a good launch. No space to start with speed and no lip to hop from because the slope just curved to vertical and the rocks below protruded. I elected to do a quick turn and go out the side, but I was on the steeps, and knocked loose the crust under me. I went over the side with a (very) small avalanche of my own making, missed the rocks and trees on the way down, landed mostly upright (with one ski missing - it was stuck at the top of the cliff somehow) but promptly lost it, yardsaled, and tumbled to a stop some hundred feet later.

I was buried, shallowly, with a decent air pocket in front of me, and I was hyped on adrenaline and endorphin. No injuries - nothing hurt, and I felt amazing. Also, I was comfortably warm. After I wiggled my hands and feet, I leapt to the conclusion that, having just gone through an avalanche and off a cliff apparently unscathed, I was very clearly dead.  This posed lots of interesting questions for me, as I had assumed there was no afterlife. It was comfortable, but dark and boring, so I first wondered if there was any merit to the idea of purgatory, which is where I imagine honestly that I would probably go if the myths were substantially accurate (having never really done anything bad, nor particularly good for that matter).

My next thought was that I was actually dying, not dead, and experiencing time-dilation from some kind of neurochemical bonanza in my damaged brain.

My next thought was that if I were dead, or even if I were just euphoric and trapped in a dying brain, that I might be able to either experience or imagine something better than cozy, warm darkness. I thought I would start by trying to fly. So I jumped.

I jumped out of the snow.  I was under the chairlift at the bottom of a bigass cliff.  People started applauding noisily.

I got so drunk that night that I almost died again. ",null,1,cdmhey4,1relo7,atheism,hot,7

One (or more) of these choices will therefore deliver the greatest benefit/least detriment to everyone.  This choice is the most moral one possible, therefore it represents the objective morality.

People may disagree with the level of benefit/detriment an action causes, however this is due to each person having incomplete knowledge of the situation, and weighting the knowledge they do have differently.  However simply because we are unaware of all the data, or how to weigh it, does not alter the actuality of the situation.  Simply because we differ on what the best choice should be, does not mean that there isn't an actual optimal decision.

**please explain to me:** why do different countries have different laws if they all have the same objective morals?

&gt;Well, evolutionary, it is not good to kill others in your own group (as in social group, not biological groups) because the other animals are going to attack you and probably kill you for betraying them. 

natural logic does not equal good; mantis females eat the males sometimes during sex; that does not mean it is good

&gt;It is objectively bad to steal, because you will not gain anything (well, except for the object), but you will not gain anything else as a reward. 

if you and your children are starving; is it bad to steal from someone who isn't? I think not; so that is not objective

&gt;However, the other people will lose respect for you and you will ultimately be alone (well, maybe not completely alone, but theoretically basically).

not if they don't find out, so would it not be immoral if you are a master thief?

&gt;It is objectively bad to do anything that lowers another person's well-being, because we are a social species, and we need to live together to survive. Is this a good argument for objective morality?

Sebas2001,"( I don't speak good English , I apologize )

Objective morality means that moral don't change with the context.
For example , ""your will not lie"" , but, what if you must lie to save your life or someone else ? 
(see in the Bible , Joshua 2 Rahab and the spies )

If lying is not an objective value , then never , no matter the context , you will lie .

There's more, objective values ​​implies that moral values ​​are universal , which means moral values apply to everyone, without exceptions.
Objective values also implies that moral values ​​are immutable , they do not change over time .

The Bible has no objective moral values ​​, you 'll see :
Numbers 15:32-36 According this story, we should kill anyone who violates the Sabbath .

Why Christians don't kill someone who works on the Sabbath ?
Christian Excuses :

- There is a new and old covenant ( see Hebrews 8:13), we are in the new covenant.
Or: Jesus changed those laws.
So moral values ​​change over time , then, they are not immutable values ( goodbye moral objectivity )

- The covenant with those laws was only for the Jews.
Then moral values ​​are not universal (again, bye moral objectivity )

And finally , the most anti-objectivity excuse :
- It was another historical context.
Can not be more clear that this argument removes any objectivity.

In summary, Christians believes that morality is objective ""in theory"", but in practice , they need moral relativism to justify or explain the Bible.",null,0,cdmls8p,1rete0,atheism,hot,1

No, it's objectively bad to steal becuase a society which does not punish stealing is less profitable for all than a soceity that makes theft illegal.

taterbizkit,"You lead a small band of hunter-gatherers.  Your tribe knows of an apple grove, and keeps it secret.  Life is a struggle -- food is adequate now, but there have been severe famines recently.

One day, you see someone you don't recognize in the apple grove.  What do you do?

You must consider killing him.  His knowledge of where the apple grove is represents a threat to your people.  In future times of scarcity, your people can't abide competition.

What's more, you have to make a determination of how likely it was that he has been to the grove more than once -- and his people know where it is.  If you think they do, you must consider chopping down all the apple trees.  It may be better to deny your enemy a food source than to allow something to exist that keeps them close by.

The upshot is that even your claim that killing is *bad* is a product of our modern civilized culture.

That means that ""killing is bad"" is not objective.  Objective means ""a quality inherent to the object"" -- ""object"" being the other person, ""subject"" being you.  

Your argument ""you will not gain anything"", ""lose respect for you"", etc. are arguments aimed at the subject -- the killer/thief.  You're trying to convince us that we suffer consequences if we act anti-socially.  Those are subjective arguments.  Objective arguments would sound like ""The person's life is too precious to lose"" or ""denying the right of personal property to someone else denies it to all human beings"".

I am subjectively free to be a hedonist -- to say ""I don't care about other peoples' happiness, only my own"".  So even the argument that it's good for the species is lost on such a person.  He does not care about other people, and you can't force him to.",null,0,cdmnpit,1rete0,atheism,hot,1

jmsr7,"Here now: while my first reaction is like everyone else, ""just move out;"" it's possible that OP lives in a culture in which the children stay at home until they marry.  Now as someone who was raised in north america, i know how weird that sounds but i've met multiple people (classmates, coworkers, etc.) who are the children of first generation immigrants and currently live at home (even though they're freaking 30 goddamn years old and what the hell, right?).

In my culture (i'm canadian), we expect children to move out at 18 and make their own way in the world because living on your own teaches independence and maturity; and we view people who stay at home as being either weird or immature or suffering significant misfortune like being long-term unemployed. However, one of my coworkers once explained to me that her culture has the opposite view and basically views parents that kick their children out as abandoning them.  What's more, this is the standard model of child rearing throughout the majority of the world.  

In other words, posters have to remember that the north american tradition of moving out at 18 is unusual, and simply moving out may not be an option for the OP.

Therefore it is incumbent on us to try to think of suggestions for the OP to deal with this situation without belittling him/her, or saying 'just move out' because that may not be an option for many reasons.

IN THAT SPIRIT, i would suggest to OP that she(?) tell her mom that she is 19 years old and that because she is an adult now, taking her belongings is technically theft, a criminal offense.  Further,  adults are guaranteed freedom of association, and can choose to associate with anyone they want and avoid anyone they choose.  As a fellow adult, her mom no longer has power over her; only influence like freedom of speech (though you don't have to listen).  THAT SAID, perhaps OP can contribute to the household as an adult would, say by paying rent?  What would mum think of that?

It never mentions formal religion, and it's attacks and debunks are mostly focused on obscure woo. This is how it camouflages it's true nature.

While it's innocent victim is laughing along with Carl at the silliness of Velokofky and his mates, the book is quietly going about the business of restructuring their brain.

Without even realising it their own mind has become their faith's worst enemy. At first they won't even notice it, they just feel a little curious about some things.

As the infection starts to completely enslave the host and they become keenly aware of what's happened, it's too late. The questions can't be stopped, they just keep hearing their own voice in their mind, ""Hang on, what's that? Doesn't seem to make sense, does it, Are you sure?""

Eventually you'll hear them drop the biggie, they'll look startled as they find themselves unable to prevent themselves from asking, ""That's not a proof, where's your evidence?""

I enjoyed reading your journey. I wish you the best of luck, and if you ever answer these questions

&gt; are we a cosmic accident and nothing more? Is there anything at all special about mankind in the universe? Is there a point to all this?

do let me know. I would respond to the second question, in the affirmative, at least in our sector of the galaxy.
I read a rather intersting book called ""What Are You Optimistic About"", in which leading scientists and the like chime in on different topics and why they are optomistic about them. In it, Max Tegmark, a physics professor from MIT,  makes the claim that [""We're Not Insignificant After All""](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1li/max_tegmark_on_our_place_in_history_were_not/) and I've grown to agree with him. While I would hardly make the claim that we are alone in the universe, I do believe that we are the most advanced form of life in this sector of the galaxy (if not the entire galaxy).

Special Pleading is not ""moving the goalposts"". It is an arbitrary claim that something is ""different"" from other members of a class of things with no justification.

Tu Coque is a subset of Ad Hominem, and in particular, it's claiming that the opponent doesn't act in accordance with the principle they are putting forward. It doesn't have to involve criticism at all. 

Ambiguity is again not a logical fallacy as stated in this example, it's just a poor argument.

Also loaded question isn't a fallacy either, its just bad debating.   A question is not a logical appeal, and therefor cannot be fallacious.

Meanwhile you are missing half the appeal fallacies, but cherry picked a few.   You could have grouped them all as Irrelevant appeals, but if you are going to list some separately, list them all!

Science knows this quite well, and everyone in the scientific community strives to support their hypothesis with as much hard data and provable facts as they can.  For instance, evolution has quite a lot of evidence behind it. 

In a fair argument or debate, you shouldn't be sidestepping your obligation to present the evidence.  You should be presenting it in all its glory.

However, the fact of the matter is that its easier just to put the obligation on someone else.  This also puts the other side on the defensive and makes the argument easier to win.  Its a good tactic, but its often labelled (correctly) as a disingenuous argument by the other side.  If the person asserts X is true, they have to support it... and if you are asserting Y, or even if you are just asserting NOT X, you have to support your argument to.

BrianJ25,"/u/HastyUsernameChoice -- I have a question. 

Why is the fallacy ""appeal to authority"" a fallacy? 

The Principle of Testimonial Arguments maintains that you should accept a testimonial argument that satisfies the following premises: 

1 - It is true that the proposition is *reasonable* to believe 

2 - It is true that the proposer is *sincere* in saying that the proposition is true 

3 - It is true that the proposer is *knowledgeable* in the topic at hand 

I understand that you shouldn't accept someone's argument based *solely* on the fact that they are an expert without first weighing the reasonability of the claim made and the sincerity of the proposer. But this is what this poster states about the ""authority"" fallacy: 

&gt;The authority that such a person or institution holds does not have any intrinsic bearing upon whether their claims are true or not.

But their authority *does* have an intrinsic bearing on how close to the Truth their claims might be. Unless someone makes an unreasonable claim, or seemingly has a reason to spread falsities, shouldn't we accept testimony on the basis that someone is an expert? 

Consider this: 

Biology Professor (A) and your crazy uncle on Facebook (B), who cut a frog open in high school one time, have two contradicting arguments. 'A' makes a sincere, reasonable proposition regarding Biology; 'B,' though crazy, is sincere in refuting it, and does so with an equally reasonable statement. For the sake of my enlightenment, let's pretend that you have absolutely zero knowledge of the topic at hand and therefore are not in a place to weigh the truth of the premises against each other. 

All you know is that both 'A' and 'B' have presented identically reasonable arguments, and neither have anything to lose or gain out from establishing their proposition as True. 

Would it therefore be logically fallacious to accept 'A's' proposition as deductively or inductively stronger than 'B's' on the basis that 'A' is a certified expert whereas 'B' is not? 

Because it seems, to me, that the fallacy of ""appealing to authority"" is not a fallacy at all. In fact, it seems like quite the opposite. It seems like it would be logically fallacious to presume that someone who is a non-expert on the given topic is as capable of proposing a True proposition about the topic as an expert (of course, with all other premises constant).

lordslag,"Young Sir,

I find your ability to genuinely question what you're being told to indicate your curiosity and intelligence, that said, please let me tell you some things about atheism, and atheists.

Firstly, your teacher is lying to you, about everything he's said about atheists.  Whether that's intentional or not I can't say, because I don't know the contents of his mind or whether or not he knows better.  Keep in mind that almost all atheists were indoctrinated with religion as toddlers and children before we knew to question or seek answers for ourselves, just like you were.  And most of us were threatened with eternal torture for disagreeing with it, most likely just like you were.  We simply set out to find out what the truth was, no matter where the evidence led us, or what the consequences of that search would be.

Regarding morality and ethics, we get those things from the same place that everyone does, that is, from the social instincts we're all born with.  The necessity to work together in a group to provide for our needs and defense against privation, the elements, and predators whether that be from animals, or other groups of humans.  It is very important to realize that religious people DO NOT get their morals from the bible or other holy books.  No one stones people to death for working on the sabbath, or not being a virgin on their wedding night, or being a disobedient child, or breaking certain commandments or worshiping other gods, all of which is in the bible.  Instead, evolution equipped us with an inherent sense of right, wrong, and justice which we codify and adhere to in order to build civilizations, we call this sense a conscience, and even babies, toddlers and animals exhibit it.  The reason I bring up those three groups is that they can't possibly know about religion, yet have a sense of right and wrong anyway, proving my point.  Most atheists that I know, myself included, subscribe to ""Secular Humanism"" as a moral framework, and I won't belabor that subject here since google will provide you with plenty of resources on that subject.

So far as a soul is concerned, no one has ever located one, or presented any evidence that one exists.  Add a little critical thinking on top of that lack of evidence and one must eschew belief in that concept unless and until better evidence is forthcoming.

Regarding his accusation that atheists just ""don't care"" about anything, I think it's obvious to you that's just bigoted drivel.  We love our family and friends just as much as any other person, we strive to be good people, do good works for their own sake instead of in pursuit of divine reward, feel the pain of sympathy when we see other's suffering, and enjoy candy, music and sex just like any of our fellow humans.

In closing, please keep questioning everything around you and never accept anything that anyone tells you at face value.  Demand they cite evidence in reality to prove what they claim.  Search out more evidence for yourself to make sure you're not being lied to.  Seek out the educated and wise outside your friends and family who are willing to speak with you, because they will have nothing to gain by lying in order to manipulate you.

Strive, seek, find...and never EVER yield, young sir.  Good luck on your journey, and I can only promise two things about it: It will NOT be easy, and it will be TOTALLY worth it.

Sincerely,

Slag

TL'DR: Never believe anything without evidence to back it up.  Keep questioning everything everyone tells you, including your own instincts and conclusions.  The journey will be VERY difficult, and even more rewarding.",null,6,cdn1q6j,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,21

Atheism has no specific moral code. That's because its only a lack of belief in gods. There are no tenets or dogma or anything associated with it. That being said, atheists do have moral codes. They're usually quite similar or exactly the same as everyone else. Many people assume that their morality comes from their religion. What they fail to realize is that morality comes from society, religion are part of society and ultimately conform to it.

guaboy05,"I want to share something with you, as an Atheist person. You are obviously very young, and therefore interested in what is going on here. These are my simple thoughts, might help you or maybe not, but I am going to share.

Entering the churches (and thy were Catholic ones, since it is a culture in my country where I originate from) as a very young guy I had noticed what it is all about. It is about death, and fear from it. What is the most important part in the story of Jesus? His death. Yes, we are a mortal beings, and death is a big mystery that any church uses upon us. The story of the sins is number 2. Combined, those two stories, in a form of the church dogma tells us: we are guilty of something, therefore we must die.

Church is about our fears. That is why it is so successful. Being an atheist, and denying the sins and fear of dying does not mean rejecting the moral of the humanity. On the contrary; it is more awareness by accepting of what we are. And there is a moral; Jesus Christ wanted to formulate some thoughts here (like, don't do to the others what you do not want to be done to yourself). Existent or not, he said what every Atheist already knows: there is a morale. But, some guys tell you that you should be paying for this.

Are you afraid to die? I am not: I face my mortality, equally like any characteristics that as a human being I have, every day. I know that my fellow humans have the same characteristics. I do not need God to explain me that, via some funny dressed guys. That ask for money. This is how it goes, how it went for centuries. What is good enough for my ancestors, it is good for me. And yes; if you ask yourself for a higher sense of all of this, I will tell you: it is a joke. There is no higher sense, sense is in us dying.

HermesTheMessenger,"First off, I would be glad to talk with your teacher privately.  

As I have talked with thelogians, seminary students, evangelicals, and more than a few Catholic priests over the span of decades, I think his objections to me can't be based on something as arbitrary as how old I am nor how informed and patient I may be.

So, please, if it would not cause you any harm, ask your teacher to make an account on Reddit and then click this;

* http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=HermesTheMessenger

I await a cordial and even tempered discussion -- not an argument -- from them.

&gt; ""Atheists aren't like us Catholics. They don't know about the difference between right and wrong."" This struck a lot of us odd, as we had just thought of Atheism as another religion people believed in. Once he saw our blank looks, he added on; ""For example, and Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head. Why?"" -silence- ""Because Atheists don't care."" A few kids questioned him, only to be silenced and we moved on.

Two basic points;

* If the Roman Catholic Church has a clear vision of morality, a deep understanding, then why is it infamous for protecting and shielding those who rape children?  Didn't the Pope and the cardinals realize what even the most hardened criminals know -- that abusing children is one of the worst crimes of humanity?

* As for any atheist doing what the teacher accuses us of, the teacher only needs to demonstrate that what they say is true.  If they can't, or won't, then they have to retract the claim.  Failure to do so is an indication that they are either lying and/or a bigot.

&gt; What bothered me is that this class and his teachings have put me off of religion completely.

Take a look at cultural anthropology.  Religion is fascinating and as a cultural practice does indeed exist in tens of thousands of variations.  I do not think it is a source of greater morality, nor do I think that theism describes reality.

No, atheism is not just another religion. A religion is a set of rites and beliefs associated to a supernatural power.

Yes, you might say many atheists have turned away from God (those that were at some point theists), but obviously we believe we have merely turned away from the concept of God. Other atheists have never believed in God so obviously can't be said to have turned away from him.

Finally, a lot of atheists care *deeply* about right and wrong. I think it's wrong to poison the minds of children against a whole group of people based on lies and ignorance.

DerberAuner,"my 2 cents on this:

im gonna go through the assertions made by your teacher, that you published through your post step by step, i hope i get them all:

1) ""Atheists aren't like us Catholics. They don't know about the difference between right and wrong.""

i would say this is just plain wrong. my guess is, it is based on the assumption, that only religious people can know what right and wrong is, because atheists dont have a frame of reference to go from. personally, i would adress this argument as follows:

a deity is not neccessary for us to have a sense of ""right and wrong"". we can use our own minds and think for ourselves about whether or not we think something is good for us or our society, or bad. a good starting point here is the golden rule ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". i personally use a variation of it, namely ""treat others, as you think they want to be treated (i am somewhat conflict averting), unless they have shown themselves to be douchebags. if they have, treat them, as they treated you""

2) ""Atheists are people who have turned away from God.""

just plain wrong. not everybody believes in god, or ever believed in god. personally, i was raised as a protestant, but i never truely believed. so, did i turn away from god? you might see it that way, but i wouldnt. i would say i looked at the idea of god and thought ""meh, seems to be without evidence"", once i was old enough. but i never really believed in the first place. others might never have been raised religiously from the start.

3) ""Atheists dont care"" [paraphrased]

plain wrong. not much more to say about this. atheists care about as much as religious people in general. we care about the world, people and life in general, because we are life, we are part of the world, and how we act towards life will influence how our fellow humans act towards us.

what we dont care about is ""souls"", since we dont believe in the concept. (i hope im not stepping out of line here, fellow atheists)

I spend zero time talking about religion to people in the real world, it's just not a topic that I ever feel the need to talk about.

I do find it deplorable, and I come by reddit about once a day and am reminded of the horrible things done in the name of religion.

EricTboneJackson,"&gt; ""Atheists aren't like us Catholics. They don't know about the difference
&gt; between right and wrong."" This struck a lot of us odd, as we had just thought
&gt; of Atheism as another religion people believed in.

First, atheism isn't a religion. In fact, it's almost an antonym, given that religion is typically defined [in terms of belief in a deity](http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/religion) and atheism *means* lack of belief in a deity.

Second, our sense of right and wrong comes from the same place *yours* does (hint: not the Bible).

**Q.** What's worse:  
1. Raping and torturing your sister her entire life.  
2. Telling your mother dinner was delicious when it wasn't?   

The Ten Commandments forbids lying (#2), but says *nothing* about kidnapping, slavery, torture or rape (#2). So how is that we *both* know which is worse? How is it that the answer is so self-evident that it sounds absurd to even ask it? Because we have *empathy*. We're aware of the suffering of other human beings. We know that rape and torture inflicts vast pain and suffering on another person and is therefore *wrong*.

You don't get your morals from the Bible any more than we do. Your sense of right and wrong is *how you evaluate* the Bible. It's why you think things like ""love thy neighbor"" are good and try to pretend the parts about murdering disobedient children don't count.

The Bible says that all sins are equal. You *know* this is bullshit. You know that killing babies is worse than working on the wrong day of the week. If you're not careful, you'll end up like your teacher, mindless parroting stuff that in your heart of hearts you know is not true. You're on your first step toward being a free thinker.

&gt; They don't care about themselves or others or life in general. 

Think about this: if people are actually immortal, and this thing we call life is just a dress rehearsal for *eternity*, how important is life? After all, you never *really* die. You go on to a life in paradise that's better than anything here.

But what if you *don't* go on? What if this life is *all there is*. No after life. No eternity. Now precious is life now? That's how atheists feel about life.

I am atheist, but my significant other is a Catholic that has undergone her first communion, and conformation. I have never tried to sway her from her beliefs, despite my contrary thoughts regarding organized religion. 

As someone previously noted, everyone is born atheist and raised with whatever religion their parents believe in. This is especially true in my case; my parents did NOT raise me as an atheist, but they also did not raise me to believe in any gods. It was through my own critical and analytical observation of the ways that my friends were raised that I came to know that which I believe makes more sense than anything else. Still, please know that simply because you refuse to blindly accept that which is taught to you, it is NOT proof that there is no God, it just means your are not an ignorant follower. Also, your teacher does not, in any way, exemplify the true teachings of the Catholic Church, despite the similarities in willful ignorance and disdain for a loving life.

Back to my actual beliefs: ask your teacher how is it that atheists can care about nothing, yet still manage to positively influence our world through scientific progress and the desire to allow access to education for all people? Or more importantly, how do we exist as a species if, by his reasoning, life before Catholicism and Jesus meant nothing to the people of the time, especially if man wantonly killed each other for no reason whatsoever.

MxM111,"OK, I am an atheist, and for me it is strange that what people think what is morally right and wrong is simply because it is written in the book which is older than thousand years, and parts of it are really old (3.5 thousands), instead of trying to understand for yourself what is right and what is wrong. 

It is also strange for me to think that something is moral and right because somebody told me so (priest, for example), because priests are people, and they can make mistakes.

No, for me, right and wrong is result of my thinking about common interests, about humanity. You can read up on humanism, which specifically deals with morals without reference to particular religion. To me religion reflects moral values, not dictates it. Can I make mistake in understanding what is right and what is wrong? Sure. But I will make everything possible to avoid this, by carefully thinking about it, not just referring to the book and removing my responsibility from my decision.

Also, those books (bible if you are a christian) contains lots of stuff of questionable morality. (slavery is OK, inequity between people, men and women, etc), which many people, even if they call themselves Catholics reject. WHAT DO THEY USE TO REJECT THOSE AS IMMORAL? Critical thinking. 

So we, atheists, use critical thinking and feelings to understand what is right and what is wrong. Not an ancient text.

Also, a bit off topic, but may be useful for you to understand where we, atheists, coming from, atheism, strictly speaking, is not belief into absence of God, but it is absence of believe into God. For many of us, there is just not enough evidence to support God's existence in the way it is described in religious text. 

For example, personally for me, while I can easily answer the question ""do you believe into God"" as no, I can not answer the question ""do you think God exists"". Because it is meaningless question for me. I do not know what God is. Ask different people/religions you get different explanation of what god(s) is/are. 

Does god exist as it is described in the bible, with creation of the world in 6 days including humans? Very likely not, since we know from our scientific achievements how the universe was developed, and how humans evolve. 

Can this universe be created by something? Could be. But even in this case, how I distinguish just an alien civilization with power to create universes from God? What makes God to be God, and not advanced civilization?

You see, I honestly can not answer the question ""Does God exist"" since the word God is just not defined. It is meaningless for me. I do not reject God. I do not know what possibly God can be, and I do not have blind faith that something that is called God exists - I just do not see need for that, and I see lots of damage that can be done if people use blind faith.

In shot, we, atheist, do not reject God per say. We reject blind faith and welcome rational thinking about everything, including morals.",null,2,cdmz7do,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,4

LIQUIPOOPS,"One of the things about right and wrong is that overall, most religions agree. There are some things like whether to eat meat or which kinds are okay, festivals, rites, and so on that differ, but overall morality is universal. 

Don't kill people. Don't steal. Don't be an ass. Do things that will improve the lives of others. Bathe regularly. Examine yourself and grow as a person. THINK about actions before doing them. 

Thing is, there are some foul atheists throughout history, and we're statistically just going to get the good with the bad among our numbers. Overall most sane people agree on a common standard of morality without being explicitly told by religion and the things that we disagree on are almost always dictated by religion.

I was raised in the Bible Belt in an atheist (Catholic family historically) but open household. I've read the bible, have tried to read the Koran but it's tough work when it reads like an internet comment with the caps lock on, have read neo-pagan stuff, Buddhist literature, and some Hindu stories. I think in a lot of ways the parables of Jesus are indicative of the Bible as a whole- parables and stories that made it easy for a non-literate population to share a code of laws. 

Overall Jesus (if he were real) seemed like a decent guy. A guy who had some Kanye West-like tendencies like the oil for anointing himself and speech at the last supper, but someone who brought moderation to the highly closed and tribal Jewish society he lived in. He was a reformer who stole a donkey and called himself the son of god. 

That being said, the book of Revelations is just NUTS. I think it's a sign that as an atheist that I *do* care because heck, I can't believe that stuff one bit and I would really rather not have that happen to the world. Also, because I care, I'd rather not believe that someone who was born before Christianity or in a different section of the world would automatically go to hell just for not knowing about it.

&gt;""For example, an Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head. Why?""

Because some people are sick in the head.  You get this with religious people as well.  Sometimes, the crime can be tied directly to their religious instruction, coupled with a sociopathic lack of empathy for others.  Those parents that have been killing their kids because of some religious book on child-rearing, that have come up recently.  They didn't care.  At least, they didn't care about the person.  Any moron could see the damage being done, but they *believed* that it had to be right.  And whether or not they could justify it to themselves only indicates the level of mental problems they had.  They did the damage, of their own will.  They killed children, through negligence, outright denial of necessary care, or even violence.

People are capable of these things.  Motivators like greed and doctrine seem to be the largest perpetrators.  Greed can blind you to all others, making you unfeeling.  Doctrine can blind you, but even those with eyes to see the damage are constantly being told, and telling themselves, that it is worth it.  Because this life doesn't matter.  They are striving for the next life, so all things can be sacrificed on the altar of What We Think God Wants Based On This Book.  And it IS a sacrifice, of blood, of knowledge, of pain.  ""This is my book.  There are many like it, but this one is MINE.""

Confirmation provided me with no answers.  I understood scripture better, but no real answers to the real questions or mysteries.  Occasionally, they'd touch on the buzzwords of the day, but those are the surface symptoms of deeper issues.

The best thing you can do as a believer is avoid religion.  If the truth is manifest in the Bible, then you don't need an establishment to interpret and spoon-feed it to you.  

Read that book from cover to cover.  It will drastically change your outlook on what YOU believe, and why.  You will come across a great many things that you don't agree with.  In times like that, find out why you don't agree with it.  It does help to talk to someone to get a different perspective on the story.  Sometimes, I genuinely didn't understand the moral of a parable.  When I discussed it, I understood the meaning more and then either agreed or disagreed with the moral being expounded.  Either way, it was me judging the book, not the book shaping me.  It is just a book, and can be taken or left at your whim.  But you owe it to yourself to understand why you take it or leave it.  It tells you more about yourself than any religion ever could.  

If someone does not answer your question to your satisfaction, then delve deeper.  Find the source of your dissatisfaction and ask further questions.  If they respond with anger or they try to brush it off, then they don't know why they believe what they believe and are threatened by your questions.  These people are not suitable leaders of any group.  Do not look to them for guidance, because they have no grounds to provide it.

Find your own answers, and don't be afraid to question others.  You will be more at peace about some things and more conflicted about others.  This is good.  Conflict exists in the presence of opposing forces.  These forces are both within you.  They are not external.  They are not God or the Devil fighting over your soul.  They are you, trying to figure yourself out.

There are external forces that will try to drive you into conflict with yourself, and they are most manifest in religion.  The pressure of doctrine, and the sheep-like nature it fosters and requires, is no way for a person to live.  You are not yourself.  You are what someone else is trying to make you.  You will feel it inside.  It will be a sense of unease or discomfort.  Listen to that.  Find out who is wrong and why.

gbuuun,"Well, the most interesting point to me has been how religious people hate atheists more than other people of other religions. 

If atheists have *no* morals, then surely Muslims and Hindus have *false* morals. If I were to believe that my god was the one true god and that everyone else had it wrong, I'd be more suspicious of people who fell for easy-to-spot lies about a doctrine than people who didn't believe one way or another. 

I was also raised Catholic, except my church was fairly liberal and didn't really talk about hating anybody. However, I did ask a lot of questions that, in hindsight, were indicative of my growing skepticism, and my questions were often suppressed or mocked as being incredibly stupid. I feel my intellectual growth was heavily stunted during my most formative years due to constant rejection by others of what I thought to be common sense. 

I'm surprised and happy that some people were put off by this unfair attack. From personal experience, Catholicism in developed nations is like Christianity Lite. Evolution is accepted, nobody really follows the doctrines of birth control, and nobody really believes in the Bible literally. Because Catholic doctrines so rarely matter in real life, Catholics end up falling into two general categories of indifference; one believes its doctrines are true and accepts that while it can't be proved, it cannot be disproved (a lot of apologists are Catholic), and the other cares so little that he/she can be dissuaded of the doctrines of the church much more easily than the standard Baptist, for example. Most people fall into the former, and once you don't care to really apply yourself, it's easier to be nasty to a group of people that you were told are evil than to think for yourself. 

I realized that Catholicism had absolutely nothing to do with morality when my mom said to me in high school that I had to confess my sin of not going to church one Sunday. I was actually helping out by giving food to the homeless that day, and it made me confused that doing some good in the world was still a form of sin. Every confession, I'd have to come up with ""sins"" or make what I did seem even worse so I would have something to say. Once you realize you don't have to feel guilty for just being alive, or that telling your wrongdoings to a priest doesn't absolve you of your responsibilities to other people, you begin to see a glimpse of what it truly means to be moral.

If you're questioning this much now my guess is you will soon discover the information you are looking for and will soon understand why Atheists think religion is silly and harmful to people with certain lines of thinking.

Now this may be problematic in your instructors teachings as if Atheists just don't care about the laws why are they incarcerated on such a smaller % that doesn't line up with the national averages of religion. In fact the census shows that around [23% of Americans](http://religions.pewforum.org/reports) are Catholic meaning that there is a higher statistical average of Catholics in prison than the population. This means if you are Atheist you are more likely to care and follow religion and be a ""good"" person than being a Catholic if you want to go by incarceration numbers with regards to percent based on population. 

This is either that Catholics ""Don't care"" and will commit crimes in abundance, or that they have a belief that no matter what they do they can be forgiven and therefor allowing them to do terrible things with no thought or cause of punishment in their afterlife due to their actions. 

So if Atheists ""don't care"" and Catholics ""care"" then why are Atheists better people on average when it comes to following the laws of the land when in the Bible it specifically says to essentially [obey your rulers for they have been chosen by god](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/romans/13.html).

""I thought you didn't believe in God.  Doesn't that make you an atheist?""  ""Sure.  I'm a Jewish person who just doesn't believe that the guy exists.""  ""Ah, well, first night of Chanukah is Wednesday.""  At this point, I kinda flipped out, because I thought it was Thursday.  The whole Thanksgivukkah thing, right?  I *really* thought it was Thursday.  Nope, Wednesday.  Thursday's the first *day*, not the first night.  She was explaining how holidays start the night before.  Honestly, I'm a little worried, because I obviously know all this, and I don't understand how she wouldn't know that I know.  Maybe *she* didn't know.  Still.  She knows I go to synagogue.  So it was a little strange.

Anyway, the point of that was that people don't understand what atheists are.  It's all really simple, actually: atheists don't believe in gods.  That's it.  They haven't turned away from God, necessarily.  Some have.  I used to believe in God when I was little.  Then I realized that the guy doesn't actually exist.  Did I ""turn away from God""?  I suppose -- but the guy doesn't exist.

Do atheists have souls?  No, we do not.  Neither do Catholics, for what it's worth.

Actually, there was recently on /r/atheism a story of a Chasidic teaching (it was an image of text, presumably so that the OP could get karma for it, so don't bother searching) where the rebbe teaches that everything was created for a purpose, and the talmid (student) asks why atheists were created.  The rebbe answers that atheists are examples of goodness and action.  When an atheist helps someone or gives charity, he does it out of the goodness of his heart and not because God requires it of him, since he doesn't believe that God exists to require it of him.  Therefore, the rebbe continues, you must be an atheist when someone needs help.  Don't say ""I'll pray to God that help comes""; say ""I will help"".  I don't know the origin of the story.  If it's actually Chasidic, then it can't be that old; Chasidim have only been around a few hundred years.

Patently false. I would call this an outright lie. He knows better. The idea that he could say this with a straight face is just astounding to me. He's saying it because he's tribal, us vs. them mentality. In group vs. out group. He's trying to protect his cultural identity, and he identifies as Catholic, as he's an older man and heavily invested. And back in the day, he was invested with a bit of force, which has some strange side effects.

Anyway, *INFANTS* know the difference between right and wrong. Too young to know language, or even be capable of speaking, physically, and psychological tests show they know when they've been cheated, and they know when they see others cheated. Behavior analysis shows they will treat the cheater differently, indicating their awareness.

No one has to be taught murder or theft is wrong. I didn't have to go to school for that. ""Oh boy, thanks, Teach, now that I know murder is Illegal, I'll be sure to avoid it next time!!!"" Just fucking absurd.

You're absolutely correct.

&gt; Again, he turns down any arguing from a bunch of 15-16 year olds and moves on.

Once again demonstrating his argument is indefensible, and he doesn't want to sitck around and lose his ground for sure. In making this kind of retreat from debate, he has guaranteed he has lost all credibility. And that's why you're here. Hi! Welcome.

&gt; They don't care about themselves or others or life in general.

To the contrary, I recognize this is the only life we're all going to get, which makes the life we have the most precious thing we have. It is the religious who believe in an afterlife who diminish the value of this life, because living is just an inconvenient and temporary delay in their journey to eternal bliss. Man, if only such theists could only get to the afterlife faster... And I know theists who feel this way, and are utterly incapable of defending why they need to be alive, or why they fear death. Wouldn't death be the greatest and most celebrated thing? You're finally going to heaven!!! Horay! Finally! Eternal *bliss*!

So why the hell do you care? About anything?

&gt; There. I had said it. I don't agree with what the Church teaches.

You can be a theist and not Catholic. You can be spiritual without theism or religion **at all.** As Neal deGrasse Tyson said in a lecture of his, when he looks through his telescope and contemplates the universe, he's having the same feelings of Bigness as the theists do when they go to church and contemplate their gods. He wants someone to scan his brain and that of a theist, when feeling this way, to see if the same parts of their heads light up, because that's saying something...

And you can, as we all do, fill that need, get that fix for the grandure of existence, wherever you want to find it. I've sat in an autum forest, in the mud, and stared at a dried up creek bed and marveled at the majesty of reality and my perception of it.

I find the reality of the bleeding edge of discovery in physics, that the universe has bends and pockets, the relationship of space and time, and it's far better than any fantasy anyone has ever concocted (except for Doctor Who, I'd totally love a TARDIS).

You're confirmation teacher does not know what the (H E double hockey stick ;D) he/she is talking about.  The sad reality is that the Church often simply waits for any Catholic to volunteer their time to do these things regardless of their background and knowledge.  They do not perform background checks and staff have to go through safe environment training which amounts to mostly watching a video.

This is why the Church has been talking heavily of the New Evanglization.  This term is to attempt to get people to see that reaching out to adults on an adult level.  What we have now are adults who don't understand the faith teaching out of textbooks usually organized by organizations that want to downplay and dilute certain aspects.  And the teachers who recognition that its being diluted tend to take that as an opportunity to preach their misguided opinions.

MartinTheRound,"I'm an atheist, by the definitions in the responses I would be a gnostic atheist.

First of all, I have morals, they come from social instinct as was said in other responses but I also have a simple logical self-interested explanation (rationalization really) for my morals. I live in this world, I would like to live in a nicer world, so I'm trying to make the world a better place. People have helped me without expecting anything and it made be feel good so I decided to return the favour and help people without any expectation. Not to the same people usually. I want to live in a world where people treat each other nicely so I treat people nicely. My observation is that when you treat people with respect they tend to treat you the same way. Simple self interest to rationalize my social instincts. We could get into the biological underpinnings of the social instincts and I understand those as well, I'm sure you can do your googling or start a thread here and you'll learn some. If you start a thread I'm sure you'll get many responses.

Second, consider, you came here to a hangout place of these ""evil despicable atheists"", you declared yourself as different from us, our ""natural enemy"". How were you treated? Would we be treated in an equally welcoming manner in churches? I kind of doubt it.

We atheists are people too, we have friends, families, and you don't hear about us making war on religious people. We might make war on intolerance and stupidity, but we don't take up arms and kill the ones we don't agree with we debate and try to convince people. Christians do burn abortion clinics, we don't burn churches (or catholic soup kitchens). Christians kill doctors we don't kill cardinals or pastors. Muslims kill just about any kind of intellectual, we don't kill mullahs. I don't see how one can make such grandiose claims with no evidence to support it and tremendous amounts of evidence to the contrary. Oh, sorry, I forgot, it's all based on faith. My problem with that is that it promotes ignorance to a virtue. It's not.

We are people, we see the majesty of the world around us the same way as believers do. One of my favourite classical composition is religiously inspired, I like some gospel songs but I don't like them BECAUSE they have a relationship to some deity, I like them because of how they make me feel. We sympathize and empathize. We help our fellow man or woman, and when we do we don't ask them for their church affiliations. We don't pretend to have an authority about other people's lives, I mean we don't tell people whom they can or can't marry, we don't tell people what god they should or shouldn't worship. We do however take an exception to people using their faith to make other people's lives worse. We do take an exception to religious bigotry and intolerance. But we don't try to dictate what you should or shouldn't believe. As you might have noticed.

And most importantly, atheists don't turn away from God (singular, specific), we turn away from unsubstantiated (and very often nonsensical) claims about ALL gods (equally yahew, thor and shiva). To be an atheist all you need to do is look around, consider that there are many religions, consider that they are mutually exclusive, consider that not a single one of them as a better proof than any of the others and conclude logically that ONE you've just witnessed the evidence for human invention of beliefs in the supernatural, TWO there is no indication that any one of them is less invented than any other, THREE they are probably ALL invented and rid yourself of any obligation to live by outdated and unsupported standards.

Oh, and your pastor might remember the ""judge not lest ye be judged"". And yes, I've read your book, and some other books too. In fact, I've faced christians, muslims and buddhists that knew less about their own belief system than I did.

On a personal note, I think (i.e. IMHO) atheism takes more intellectual maturity, but whatever makes you a happy person is worthwhile, and as long as your relations with your fellow mortals are friendly I couldn't care less how you arrange your life. But as a fellow human, despite being a face shooting despicable atheist, I sincerely wish you a happy life.

All Roads Lead to DOPAMINE

Once it was true, all roads lead to Rome. This simple truth is not too dissimilar from the reward circuitry of the brains of Homo sapiens. Numerous experiments have established that the brain’s major reward neurotransmitter pathway, the road to Rome, is indeed dopamine.
Reward circuitry, the cascade of neurotransmission in the brain that leads to the release of dopamine, is kicked off by any pleasurable experience. Everything from eating, to having sex and even skydiving can get it going. The point of the reward circuitry is to positively reinforce actions that promote the survival of the species. During what the brain perceives to be as beneficial actions, dopamine’s release makes our brains “happy,” thus encouraging us to do it again. Though “extreme actions” inherently don’t promote survival, and in fact endanger it, the rush to preserve life causes the release of dopamine and consequently pleasure.
Drugs play on this system and can destroy it with enough use, creating a permanent craving that results in addiction. Pleasure produced from drug abuse occurs because most of these drugs target the brain’s reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine. When some drugs like cocaine are taken, they can release 2-10 times the amount of dopamine as natural responses. The resultant effects on the brain’s pleasure circuit dwarfs those produced by natural rewards such as food and even sex. Just this fact alone strongly motivates people to take drugs again and again, but for about 30% of the population, genetics is also a factor when it comes to the desire to take drugs.
Scientists now know that there are at least two variant forms of the human dopamine D2 receptor gene, (DRD2) which regulates the number of D2 receptors and how much dopamine is naturally fed to our brains. Consequently, DRD2 is the most widely studied gene in psychiatric genetics and what accounts for major aspects of modern human behavior. The DRD2 A2 form, which in today’s world is considered the “normal” variation, is carried by 2/3 of the U.S. population. People carrying this form have properly functioning reward circuitry, thus they won’t inherently crave artificial or alternate ways to induce dopamine release, such as drugs or thrills. Carriers of the DRD2 A1 form represent about one third of today’s U.S. population and have 30-40% lower D2 receptors. These men and women are prone to addiction, a subset of approximately 100 million people.
Given that about 30% of us are born with genetically induced low dopamine brain function how can we overcome this survival variant of human nature and prevent excessive craving behavior? Certainly, the human brain is the most complex organ in the body— a communications center consisting of billions of neurons, or nerve cells. Unfortunately drugs can alter brain areas such as the brain stem that is necessary for sustaining life through motor and sensory control, the limbic system that regulates our ability to feel pleasure, and the cerebral cortex that powers our ability to think. Independent of one’s genetic makeup, if an individual keeps taking drugs, the brain adjusts to the overwhelming surge in dopamine and other neurotransmitters causing a breakdown in the natural process of the brain reward by producing less dopamine or reducing the number of dopamine (D2) receptors. This causes abnormally low dopamine function, high cravings, and reduced ability to perceive pleasure, all contributing to a vicious cycle of addiction.

The Theory of Evolution has been proven to the same standard as the fact that the Earth isn't flat. You can do experiments in your own house that demonstrate it. Someone who denies it is arguing from the same epistemological ground as someone arguing that the Earth is flat or that fire doesn't burn or that ice isn't made of frozen water.

It's possible to ""not believe in Evolution"" if your understanding of the ToE is the hilarious ""dogs giving birth to cats"" strawman perpetuated by creationists. That's an absurd ""theory"" that runs totally contrary to what the ToE actually claims, and you would be totally right in rejecting it. However, it is *not* possible to look at the mountains upon mountains of evidence in favor of evolution, and the absolute lack of any evidence against it, and claim with any intellectual honesty that you still don't believe in it.

When you figure out *why* they claim to believe that, you're well on your way to figuring our if rational discourse with them is even *possible*.


""I don't believe in evolution"" can mean only two things: ""I am woefully misinformed about what 'evolution' means"", or ""I don't give a crap about evidence, and therefore about whether what I believe is *actually true*"". (These two are, naturally, not exclusive).

ktreanor,"The best analogy I ever heard to help explain evolution are how languages change.

French, Spanish, Italian are all romance languages, meaning they all use Latin as their base.  It's easy to imagine how Latin eventual became these different languages.  When the Roman Empire fell different areas, separated by distance or geological barriers, first started having distinct accents, much like how Boston and New York City have very different accents.  These accents continued to change to the point they became dialects (using their own words, grammar and pronunciation).  Finally after enough time has passed these dialects become their own languages.  This is how Latin morphed into Italian over a long period.  What never happened was a Latin speaking mother gave birth to an Italian speaking child.

That's the key...much like Latin changing into Italian by small shifts over a long period, so has life changed by small small amounts over a long period to form all the species we see today.",null,0,cdn3cjl,1rgjae,atheism,hot,3

MartinTheRound,"Well, perhaps first you should ask her how she understands evolution, which is quite probably a flawed understanding. Then you can work to correct her misunderstanding.

One common misunderstanding is that evolution works on individuals, another is that evolution works on entire species. In reality it works on groups of individuals. You take one species, put them in two different environments they'll start diverging separately.

Another common misunderstanding is about mutation rates, many people assume mutations are either good or bad. There are mutations that are inert, and sometimes several inert mutations in combination will produce an effect. So some mutations produce slow changes and others faster changes.

But simply, evolution is inevitable. The logic is this, mutations happen (this is an observed fact, confirmed both in laboratory experiments and in nature), they produce change, whether the changes are good or bad depends on the environment (hot climate, less fur, cold climate more fur), thus changes will produce effects over time. Thus we'll see divergence of populations of organisms. The longer the time the larger the effects.

This is of course a very simplified ""explanation"". Whole books can be and had been written on the topic.

Maybe you can start by watching some of the youtube videos recommended, then watch some of them with her and asking her what she thinks about what was said and engaging in a debate and finding more information when required.

But you should probably start by finding out what her notion of evolution is and go from there. Good luck and keep posting on your progress.",null,0,cdn9qg7,1rgjae,atheism,hot,2
SpHornet,"The theory of evolution:

-1- If traits are inherited by the next generation

-2- If there is variation in those traits

-3- If there is a selection pressure on (one of) those traits

Then;

-4- Those traits selected for will be more abundant in the genepool each generation as long the selection continues.

you can show 1 by pointing out that kids look like their parents, you can show 2 by pointing out that people look different except for identical twins, you can explain 3 by explaining that genes are not passed on if they don't have kids, and 4 follows pretty clear out of 1-3

So in words; if a 5 legged lizard has a higher chance of survival, it will on average get more children. you give your genes to your children, so they will be 5 legged to (all children, 50% or none, depending on the genetics, but it does not matter that much if you look in detail). Because those children have also 5 legs they to will have better survival and thus more children etc, until all lizards of that species have 5 legs or 5 legs no longer give an advantage.

While the basics of evolution may be simple, there are a lot of questions that come up, that require more than just ""looking into it"". Some people dedicate their lifes on studying evolution. And these people are atheists as well as christians, Hindus, muslims or whatever. And they all, (also) after YEARS of study, come to the conclusion that evolution is true.

MartinTheRound,"You say she looked at evolution and it didn't make sense to her. I'm not sure what exactly she missed, but....

Ask her to compare the anatomy of mammals. A comparison of skeletal structures of, for example a mouse, camel, human, bear, tiger and a dolphin might show that either the creator has a severe lack of creativity or that there is a relationship between all of these animals.

Ask her to have a look at the similarity of brain structures in mammals. She will see the same (or similar) degree of similarity (in general) as with the skeletal structures.

Ask her to consider that we've mapped the DNA of many animals, including humans and we see that there is a similarity that matches the previous conclusions about evolution. If humans were created separately from other animals, you would expect no similarity. Indeed if you assume separate creation of every animal you would expect no similarity between any animals.

Ask her to consider that the HIV virus was originally infecting monkeys (SIV) but their bodies were close enough to ours that the virus could jump and evolve into a new virus.

Ask her to consider that actual evolution was observed in laboratory environment (in bacteria) and those experiments can be repeated, but creation wasn't observed in laboratory conditions nor can in explain the diversity of life on this planet. At least not according to the old jewish bible's story (old testament). Consider that according to this story the earth was depopulated by god and the only land animals and only humans to survive were on the same ship, consider how big a ship would have to be just to house every species of spiders. Consider that not many birds can sustain flight for 40 days, so there would have to be a lot of space for birds. And there are numerous snakes that wouldn't survive a flood. It's neither credible nor verifiable. And the evidence for evolution is both credible (if you understand it) and verifiable. You might also tell her to look up the documentary hypothesis. It's not about evolution at all, it's about the literary and historical analysis of the jewish bible (a.k.a. old testament), and it shows that the bible has been edited, many christian religious scholars accept it in one form or another and to be sure there is disagreement about the details, but not about the fact that what's known as the jewish bible/old testament is a composite work edited with an agenda. Ask her to consider how after the great flood all the kangaroos ended up in one place and all the pandas somewhere else. And most importantly, if only Noah and his bunch survived who owed their existence to this god, how come the Incas never heard about him. And how from the same bunch of people we ended up with all black people in africa and india, all white people in europe, asian people in asia etc, etc. And the only people who ever heard about Noah were the people in the same neighborhood. Ask her to consider what's more likely, that people invented different gods in different places or that some forgot remembered their god and many others simultaneously forgot and invented new ones.

I don't know what mental process lead you to stop believing, but you might ask her to consider that there are many religions, some of which must be invented and wrong because they don't agree with each other. So we have a proof that humans create religions (or does god want to have a laugh at our expense?). So when choosing a religion, ask her what standards would she apply if she didn't have her mind made up already. Then ask her if those standards are fair and if her chosen religion passes them and every other religion fails. Then ask her why you should not be allowed to make a choice based on such a comparison and conclude that since many must be invented and you can't see why any would be more true then all are probably invented and decide that living a life without the burden of pleasing a god that isn't willing to show himself in a clear an unambiguous fashion.

This is not an explanation of evolution just some points that might undermine her certainty in the things she beliefs in and have been shown incorrect and maybe make her able to listen to an actual explanation.

eritas_si_siht,"I think the best way to really cut to the heart of it is to point out the difference between the evidence for small changes (micro-evolution &lt;yes I know there is no real difference between micro/macro, just time&gt;) and bigger differences like humans being related to apes.

The kind of evidence for this is different.  Not fruit flies.  While the fruit fly stuff is real, it just isn't very impressive to most people.

Stuff like pseudo-genes, endogenous retroviruses, the fusion of human chromosome #2.

These may sound too in-depth, but they are the best ways of proving that even vastly different animals (including us) are related.

I have an analogy that helps explain one of the things I mentioned. (pseudo-genes)

A judge is hearing a case where the defendant is being accused of copying information for their atlas from the plaintiff's copyrighted atlas.

If there was only *similar* information in the defendants atlas there wouldn't be much of a case. (this is analogous to the defense creationists use to explain similarities between different species.  Such as ""Well, a Creator would use similar genes for similar needs of the animal"")

But what if there were typos in the plaintiffs atlas?  If the defendant really did copy directly from the plaintiff and not just research the same information, then the same typos would appear in the same places as the plaintiff's.

The same scenario is written in our genes.  One example is the loss of the ability to produce vitamin C.

&gt;Vestigial characters should also be found at the molecular level. Humans do not have the capability to synthesize ascorbic acid (otherwise known as Vitamin C), and the unfortunate consequence can be the nutritional deficiency called scurvy. However, the predicted ancestors of humans had this function (as do most other animals except primates and guinea pigs). Therefore, we predict that humans, other primates, and guinea pigs should carry evidence of this lost function as a molecular vestigial character (nota bene: this very prediction was explicitly made by Nishikimi and others and was the impetus for the research detailed below) (Nishikimi et al. 1992; Nishikimi et al. 1994).

&gt;Confirmation:

&gt;Recently, the L-gulano-γ-lactone oxidase gene, the gene required for Vitamin C synthesis, was found in humans and guinea pigs (Nishikimi et al. 1992; Nishikimi et al. 1994). It exists as a pseudogene, present but incapable of functioning (see prediction 4.4 for more about pseudogenes). In fact, since this was originally written the vitamin C pseudogene has been found in other primates, exactly as predicted by evolutionary theory. We now have the DNA sequences for this broken gene in chimpanzees, orangutans, and macaques (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999). And, as predicted, the malfunctioning human and chimpanzee pseudogenes are the most similar, followed by the human and orangutan genes, followed by the human and macaque genes, precisely as predicted by evolutionary theory. Furthermore, all of these genes have accumulated mutations at the exact rate predicted (the background rate of mutation for neutral DNA regions like pseudogenes) (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999).

http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section2.html#mol_vestiges

These sorts of evidences are hard to ignore or dismiss.  Unless they want to claim that ~~God~~ Jehovah designed our and other animals DNA like this *on purpose*.  That would be a pretty deceptive God to worship though.

MartinTheRound,"A few more things to consider.

The question of our existence can be separated into four different areas of study. The emergence of the universe (the big bang theory), the formation of galaxies (cosmology), the emergence of life from non living matter (abiogenesis), the emergence of more complex life from simple life (evolution).

The religious answer to all of these questions is ""god did it"", which doesn't actually explain anything. ""god did it"" doesn't give us any information, where as investigating the chemical properties of life allows us to gain further knowledge.

We have good theories for each of these. A theory in the scientific sense isn't the same as saying we have a definite answer. But IMHO having a good answer is better than having an unsubstantiated claim (no matter how definite it is), especially if that claim doesn't help us in any way.

For example, we know about Newton's laws for a long time, and today we know they are inaccurate, but they are accurate enough to build many of today's structures. Some of our technology requires more accurate theories, like quantum mechanics (micro-electornics), or the theory of relativity (GPS). But others work with less precise theories that have since been falsified (civil engineering, hydraulics).

A scientific theory is a hypothesis that explains the observations and makes testable predictions which can be verified. A theory that makes more accurate predictions is better, a theory that makes predictions that are contradicted by observations is said to be falsified. But as I said a theory that has been falsified may still be useful if the error (difference between its prediction and a superior theory's prediction) is not significant in the specific circumstances and the inferior theory is easier to apply. For example newton's laws of motion break down at speeds comparable to the speed of light and or distances great enough. But for calculating automobiles we don't need the precision that we'd get from using the theory of relativity. Since the distances and speeds are way too small and the errors would be smaller than an atom.

In terms of evolution, the theory of evolution made predictions that were confirmed. For example at the time of Darwin we didn't know about DNA and didn't have the capability to directly compare the DNA of various animals. The theory of evolution predicted that animals that were considered related (for example based on their skeletal anatomy) would have more similar than animals that were considered less related. Also the prediction was that all animals would share some DNA. All of these have been confirmed. The theory of evolution also predicted that if we perform an experiment we'll get a specific result, which was confirmed. The experiment was this, we take the same bacterium, we put it into sealed containers and we regularly add two kinds of ""food"", one of which would be ""edible"" by the bacterium the other wouldn't. We would expect one or more of the jars to have at some later point a strand of bacterium that can digest the other kind of food. And this was confirmed. I may be oversimplifying the experiment, but I'm sure you can look it up.

However the so called theory of creation doesn't make any predictions that were confirmed. The creationists don't make predictions I've heard of. But my interpretation of the ""theory"" would be that there wouldn't be any correspondence between us and any other animal, since we were separately created. But we see anatomical and genetic similarities between us and other animals. So we can't be said to be separately created as some sort of crowning achievement, which is what we're supposed to be. And if the creation ""theory"" is stated as ""intelligent design"" I would ask why an intelligent designer would give some creatures blind eyes. And if we're supposed to be the crowning achievement, I would expect us to have UV and heat vision. And what is the intelligent purpose of nipples on males of the species? So by the standards of scientific inquiry, creation and intelligent design are both uninformative (useless) and falsified.

IMHO science is better because it accepts and welcomes revisions. As I said somewhere before, when you successfully argue with religion you get a new denomination, if you successfully argue with science, you get better science. :-) .... science is not the sum total of our knowledge, it's the method by which we've acquired the existing knowledge and by which we expand the knowledge further. Engineering is how we apply the knowledge and marketing is how we make people pay for it :-) And religion is how we exploit gullible people (scientology is an obvious example).",null,0,cdo37ce,1rgjae,atheism,hot,1

My parents were never married and haven't been together for as long as I can remember, but being a child with a heavily religious extended family I'd always made the assumption that marriage caused pregnancy (logical fallacy much), so I asked mum how dad was my dad if they never got married. She scurried some bullshit story that it's because he was physically present at my birth - like they just chose this random passerby lol (I could've made a better story....).

Fast forward to when I was maybe 9 and knew about sex and babies, I understood completely that a child with unmarried parents simply meant premarital sex. But I never applied that to my mum, just took the original explanation lol. A friend asked me why dad was my dad, and I gave mum's stupid story and then he replied with ""but wouldn't it just mean they had sex""    .....Oh yeah, I thought.

Most people I encounter I think could fall under this ""just never thought about it"" but I do live in a highly uneducated, regional Aussie town.

When something moves our brain screams ""its alive!"" no matter what it is. We see rocks and they are dead. We can throw them, fling them or let them fall. It always acts the way we expect them to. Our brain is comfortable with this and think it is safe because everything is under control.

But as soon as something is unpredictable we assume a mind behind it. This is a consequence of being a social animal. We need to all the time consider and interact with other beings, often with hidden motives and goals. Our biggest fear is someone who is dead, and then he suddenly open his eyes! Our brain freaks out and is clearly not comfortable with being surprised with predicable things suddenly being alive and unpredictable. This would indicate that the brain did a mistake, and need to remember this so it is not repeated. And everyone remember things that freak them out. We often cant sleep for days after being seriously frightened.

But there are a lot of things in nature that is unpredictable. And until we find a pattern or a way to predict it, our brains need to be careful and watch those unpredictable things so they dont surprise us. Weather, earthquakes, accidents, luck, fights. Everything is extremely unpredictable and dangerous. So of course our brains think ""well, something must be behind these weird things."" and then it takes the step to ""well, someONE might be behind it!"". But we cant find that someone. But we know that he is incredibly powerful, he can control earthquakes! He must be magical, just like our shaman that made all those colors appear when we tasted his weird mushrooms last year.

If observation A is evidence for proposition B, then an observation of not-A must be equal and opposite evidence for the proposition not-B.

If you think ""The old lady floats when we throw her in the lake"" is evidence that she's a witch, you must think that ""the old lady sinks"" would be evidence that she's *not* a witch. If you would interpret *either* result as ""she's a witch"", you've already made up your mind, and the test is just meaningless showmanship.

If you think a horribly inefficient and needlessly cruel jury-rigged biosphere that looks exactly like the result of a blind optimization process is evidence of design by an all-knowing and all-loving god, then you must simultaneously argue that a well-designed biosphere without all the needless waste and suffering would be evidence *against* intelligent design.

If you think that both A and not-A would be evidence for B, then you've already decided exactly what you want to end up believing, and the observation is irrelevant.

The problem however, is if you aren't trying to gather evidence of something as hard to miss as migrating birds, it gets iffy. Are your tools up to snuff? Are you looking in the right place? Are you looking in ENOUGH places? 

Anyways, if you have sufficient confidence in your tools and techniques, absence of evidence *IS* evidence of absence. Without the confidence in your tools, you're just scratching your head and giving the best guess you can. 

All that being said, other than 'god', I can't think of anything we look for that we have no evidence for to begin with. After all, if it interacts with the world, it's going to leave some evidence. Maybe some stuff deep in quantum theory and theoretical physics?

taterbizkit,"The existence of Africa is something that's reasonable to accept, for two reasons:

1) There's lots of evidence.  It might not be firsthand evidence, but there's a lot of it, from a wide variety of sources -- including realtime streaming video from space.  The descriptions of it are consistent as well, from a wide variety of sources.

2) (and this is the big thing about knowledge that people just don't get) The nonexistence of Africa (that is, falsification of the evidence of its existence) wouldn't alter the nature of reality all that much.  This means that it's reasonable to ""provisionally accept the proposition as valid for all intents and purposes"".  There's no real opportunity cost in accepting Africa as real.

It's the same argument that it's reasonable to believe in wind, your own brain, or any of the other stupid ""you can't see it!"" arguments Christians make.

They're trying to create a false equivalence between brains, air, continents and ""you can't see god either"".  They're trying to rationalize their own faith.

But, go back to the two reasons why it's reasonable to believe in Africa:

1) There is no evidence for god, except for a) the writings of ancient books b)  *a priori* arguments like teleological, cosmological, ontological arguments -- which don't really count as evidence, since they're not y'know, ""evident"" and c) subjective personal stories and claims of inner knowledge.  There is no widespread consistency in how god is described, and while you can *go to* Africa anytime you feel doubtful, many people spend years trying to find god and never succeed.

2) The truth or falsity of the proposition has world-altering implications.   In fact, its hard to think of any proposition that has a greater impact on the nature of reality.  Science becomes meaningless when an inscrutable agency can alter reality at a whim.  It is in no way reasonable to accept this as ""provisionally valid"", for any purpose.  That's not to say it's untrue, but the need for verification of a proposition like this completely overwhelms any value in accepting it without evidence.

BeakOfTheFinch,"P. Z Meyers handles this question well (explaining to 9 year old girl that asked 'were you there' to a NASA tour guide showing moon rocks):

Dear Emma;

I read your account of seeing a 3.75 billion year old moon rock, and how you asked the person displaying it “Were you there?”, the question that Ken Ham taught you to ask scientists. I’m glad you were asking questions — that’s what scientists are supposed to do — but I have to explain to you that that wasn’t a very good question, and that Ken Ham is a poor teacher. There are better questions you could have asked.

One serious problem with the “Were you there?” question is that it is not very sincere. You knew the answer already! You knew that woman had not been to the moon, and you definitely knew that she had not been around to see the rock forming 3.75 billion years ago. You knew the only answer she could give was “no,” which is not very informative.

Another problem is that if we can only trust what we have seen with our own two eyes in our short lives, then there’s very little we can know at all. You probably know that there are penguins in Antarctica, and that the Civil War was fought in the 1860s, and that there are fish swimming deep in the ocean, and you also believe that Jesus was crucified two thousand years ago, but if I asked you “Were you there?” about each of those facts, you’d also have to answer “no” to each one. Does that mean they are all false?

Of course not. You know those things because you have other kinds of evidence. There are photographs and movies of penguins and fish, there are documents from the time of the Civil War, as well as the fact that in many places you can still find old bullets and cannon balls buried in the ground from the time of the war, and you have a book, the Bible, that tells stories about Jesus. You have evidence other than that you personally witnessed something.

This is important because we live in a big ol’ beautiful world, far older than your 9 years, and there’s so much to learn about it — far more than you’ll ever be able to see for yourself. There’s a gigantic universe beyond South Carolina, and while you probably won’t ever visit a distant star or go inside a cell, there are instruments we can use to see farther and deeper than your eyes can go, and there are books that describe all kinds of wonders. Don’t close yourself off to them simply because you weren’t there.

I’d like to teach you a different easy question, one that is far, far more useful than Ken Ham’s silly “Were you there?” The question you can always ask is, “How do you know that?”

Right away, you should be able to see the difference. You already knew the answer to the “Were you there?” question, but you don’t know the answer to the “How do you know that?” question. That means the person answering it will tell you something you don’t know, and you will learn something new. And that is the coolest thing ever.

You could have asked the lady at the exhibit, “How do you know that moon rock is 3.75 billion years old?”, and she would have explained it to you. Maybe you would disagree with her; maybe you’d think there’s a better answer; maybe you’d still want to believe Ken Ham, who is not a scientist; but the important thing is that you’d have learned why she thought the rock was that old, and why scientists have said that it is that old, and how they worked out the age, even if they weren’t there. And you’d be a little bit more knowledgeable today.

I’ll assume you’re actually interested in knowing how they figured out the age of the rock, so I’ll try to explain it to you.

The technique scientists use is called radiometric dating. It uses the fact that some radioactive elements slowly fall apart, turning into other elements. For instance, a radioactive isotope of potassium will decay over time into an isotope of another element, argon.

One way to think of it is that it’s like an hourglass. You know how they work: you start with all the sand in the top half of the hourglass, and it slowly trickles into the bottom half. If you see an hourglass with all the sand at the top and none at the bottom, you know it was recently flipped over. If you see one with half the sand in the top, and half in the bottom, you know it’s about halfway through the time it will run. And if you look at how quickly the sand moves through the neck of the hourglass, you could even figure out how long until it all runs out.

In radiometric dating, the scientists are looking at how far along all the radioactive potassium is in the process of turning into argon. The amount of potassium is like the amount of sand in the top half of the hourglass, while the amount of argon is like the amount in the bottom half. By measuring the relative amounts of the two elements, and by measuring how fast radioactive potassium turns into argon, we can figure out how long it’s been since the rock solidified.

It takes a very long time for the decay to occur. It takes 1 and a quarter billion years for half the potassium to turn into argon. When they measured those elements in the moon rocks, they found that the radiometric hourglass had mostly run out, so they knew that it was very, very old.

Scientists double-check everything. They also looked at other elements, like how quickly uranium turns into lead, or rubidium into strontium, and they all agree on the date, even though these are decay processes that run at different rates. All the radiometric hourglasses they’ve used give the same answer: 3.75 billion years. None of them say 6,000 years.

I think you’re off to a great start — being brave enough to ask older people to explain themselves is exactly what you need to do to learn more and more, and open up the whole new exciting world of science for yourself. But that means you have to ask good questions to get good answers so that you will learn more.

Don’t use Ken Ham’s bad question, and most importantly, don’t pay attention to Ken Ham’s bad answers. There’s a wealth of wonderful truths that reveal so much more about our universe out there, and you do not want to close your eyes to them. Maybe someday you could be a woman who does go to the moon and sees the rocks there, or a geologist who sees how rocks erode and form here on earth, or the biologist who observes life in exotic parts of the world…but you won’t achieve any of those things if you limit your mind to the dogma of Answers in Genesis.

Best wishes for future learning,

P. Z. Meyers

The best response to such nonsense is to turn it back on them, and then start asking them the same basic questions about their own claims including their religious notions and where everyone goes when they aren't in line of sight.  Do they just vanish, like a ball that is out of the sight of a baby?

Now, chances are, the person posing this is some form of *presupposationalist*.  Presupposationalist Christians literally presuppose that some things are true as axioms, such as Christian dogmatic ideas (often Young Earth Creationism and partial Biblical literalism).

Since they presuppose those as true, when evidence comes up that contradicts those axioms, they toss out that evidence and any conclusions from it as either unimportant or misunderstood.  

(Note: Having axioms is fine, though usually reliable axioms are based on very narrow and focused ideas that are also up to be questioned and not complex structures such as religious dogmas that can never be questioned.)

If you want to see a real asshole pushing presupposational arguments, just look up anything by Sye Bruggencate.  Related to that;

* [A backup of Sye ten Bruggencate's now deleted comment history from AMA (self.atheism)](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ur9vq/a_backup_of_sye_ten_bruggencates_now_deleted/)

That's right.  He did an AMA and then got pissed off and deleted the evidence that he was having his ass handed to him.

&gt; First of all, I think that I would tell them that they need to understand the proper relationship between faith and reason. And my view here is, that the way I know that I know Christianity is true is first and foremost on the basis of the witness of the Holy Spirit, in my heart. And that this gives me a self-authenticating means of knowing that Christianity is true, whole apart from the evidence. And, therefore, if in some historically contingent circumstances, the evidence that I have available to me should turn against Christianity, I don’t think that that controverts the witness of the Holy Spirit. In such a situation, I should regard that as simply a result of the contingent circumstances that I’m in, and that if I were to pursue this with due diligence and with time, I would discover that in fact the evidence, if I could get the correct picture, would support exactly what the witness of the Holy Spirit tells me.

In more fucked-up cases, like this one, a person (not necessarily a believer) can similarly delude themselves and rationalise irresponsible behaviour, such as alcoholism. If they have convinced themselves that it's okay for a number of years, suddenly having that questioned casts a long and dark shadow on their actions, both past and present, and if the person cannot come to terms with being exposed like that, their minds will attempt to compensate for this cognitive dissonance in some other way (such as ridiculing the source of doubt).",null,1,cdnb9jq,1rhga4,atheism,hot,2

The pleasant answer is that some of them are moved by compassion.

As a Christian ex-girlfriend of mine said, ""How could I not?  It'd be like seeing you running toward a cliff, and doing nothing to stop you.""

The less-pleasant answer is that we're a threat.  Here I am, living a happy life, and regularly thumbing my nose in the direction of religion and all of its assumptions and all it implies.  The idea that I could get away with that means that god very likely doesn't exist, which negates the religious folks' entire message -- and also their power structure, and in many cases, cash flow.

No, of course not.
Is the passion for your team heightened by battling a hated rival?
You bet it is.
English soccer hooligans are a great example of this tribal thing getting out of control. It has gotten so bad that every bar in London has to declare loyality to a particular club, or refuse entry for anyone wearing a soccer jersey. For the religious... these competitive tribal ""juices"" combine with complete faith to create dangerously deluded people. The Bible catalogs a long history of this tribal process and the New Testament specifically warns its followers against it in many places. E.g. ""Love your enemies..."" (Luke 6:27), ""Love your neighbor..."" (Mark 12:31), The Good Samaritan Parable (Luke 10:25-37), ""...Judge not, that you be not judged."" (Matthew 7:1-2) ""turn the other cheek"" (Matthew 5:39), etc. These lessons are ignored by the religious fanatics because Tribalism, not God, rules their lives. Early Christians fought bitterly over this tribal issue and the evidence of these disagreements is actually preserved in the Bible.  For example,  even the New Testament states that Jesus declared he ""...was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.""(Mark 7:24) in reply to a poor Canaanite woman asking him for help. Does it get any more tribal than that? Wasn't he sent here to save the whole Earth? Is Jesus lying here because he was annoyed by this woman? Maybe, but the more likely reason this contradiction appears is because the early Christians were still trying to decide if they wanted Christianity open to everyone, or if it was to continue to be restricted by blood.

Hambone3110,"okay... the first argument:

&gt;1: ""Our senses prove that some things are in motion."" **granted**

&gt;2: ""Things move when potential motion becomes actual motion."" **granted**

&gt;3: ""Only an actual motion can convert a potential motion into an actual motion."" **This is a very Newtonian view of the world, but alright...**

&gt;4: ""Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect (i.e., if both actual and potential, it is actual in one respect and potential in another)."" **the existence of the superposition of quantum states proves this assertion to be false**

&gt;5: ""Therefore nothing can move itself."" **not granted. it is not possible for subatomic particles NOT to be moving: the uncertainty principle means that it is physically impossible for any particle's momentum to be zero**

&gt;6: ""Therefore each thing in motion is moved by something else."" **whatever, we'll grant it and get to the conclusion...**

&gt;7: ""The sequence of motion cannot extend ad infinitum."" **granted...**

&gt;8: ""Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone understands to be God."" **the existence of a first cause is obvious - causal chains cannot extend indefinitely because we know the age of the universe to be finite. you cannot fit an infinite causal sequance into a finite universe, ergo a first cause must be present. this ""proof"" is only valid for proving the existence of some form of first cause: It is not valid for proving the existence of a theistic god.**

+++

the second proof... is basically the same argument. Okay, we accept the need for there to be a first cause. Again, this argument fails to prove that first cause = god. There is a non-sequitur involved. It follows that there is a first cause. It does NOT follow that said first cause must be a theistic god.

+++

The third proof is debunked by the existence of evolutionary forces. In a universe in which things can evolve, there is no need for there to be a sentient agent at all times.

+++

the very first premise of the fourth proof is:

&gt;1: ""There is a gradation to be found in things: some are better or worse than others.""

This is not granted. A big stone is not ""better"" than a small stone, nor is up ""better than"" down. humans are not ""better than"" mice, we are simply different. Any evaluation of a thing as being ""better"" than something else is a purely subjective one, and prejudiced. a hotter star is not a better star, it is simply a hotter star. The first premise is completely flawed, I reject it outright, and with it all subsequent reasoning.

+++

The fifth proof is similarly flawed from the outset:

&gt;1: ""We see that natural bodies work toward some goal, and do not do so by chance. ""

This is the teleological argument. 

What is the goal of a mountain? Or of an asteroid? What is the goal of a comet orbiting a distant star in a system containing no worlds with any form of life. What is the goal of a quasar billions of light years away? What is the goal of a hydrogen atom lost in intergalactic space? What is the goal of water, or of solar flares?

Clouds are not ""for"" raining: they don't have the ""goal"" of raining to water crops. The fact that clouds DO rain and that crops are watered as a result, can be explained as an emergent phenomenon of natural forces without having to invoke the notion that this was the cloud's objective.

Aquinas was ignorant to the possibility that natural forces can play out in a sequential, non-random way without the need for conscious direction. An arrow fired from a bow does not fly because the human wishes it - the human is instead exploiting an emergent property of the laws of physics. Aquinas has the relationship between action and intent backwards - humans do not cause the phenomenon, they exploit it.",null,0,cdni317,1rhvy1,atheism,hot,2
Santa_on_a_stick,"1. A twist on the first cause argument. What moved god? Moreover, I'm not sure I accept all of the premises suggested. We have observed spontaneous movement/creation on a subatomic level. 
2. Exact same argument, exact same problems. Complete rejection of a few premises, at least on a technical level (especially in the context of his argument).
3. Misuse of probability and definition. Again, he's saying that something like, oh, a rock is a contingent being, sure, but that's not actually the thing that's popping out of nothing. The atoms of the rock existed prior to the rock and just rearranged. Moreover, one of his premises has the words ""could have"" in it. This is not a proof. 
4. This one is maybe the worst one. He does not define ""better"", or make any attempt to describe a metric to measure these things. Moreover, literally every premise is nothing more than an assertion.

This actually helped to question doctrine, and eventually wean me off of religion altogether.

another positive thing that was brought about thanks to being raised a Baptist is that my particular church was hugely into charity, which was a real eye opener.  the church would often have fundraising events for poor community members, and for Christmas we would do food drives and collect toys for indigenous villages in Mexico.  seeing first-hand the extent of poverty that these people lived in and the effects of this poverty on their culture really gave me insight on the issues that plague our society, and honestly it was humbling.

My school had right around 100 students, which meant teachers had more 1 on 1 time with students that needed it, and lead them to be able to teach a more advanced curriculum. I actually think some of my subjects in 8th grade were more advanced than some I took in HS
Another positive i could take away was I do have a good understanding of the christian faith and the way they think, which makes me more knowledgeable and understanding as an atheist.
Few other things that I could take as a benefit was there was a real sense of community, everyone knew everyone, and for the most part were good people who would give you the shirt off their back. After reading alot of posts on r/atheism I see a lot of hatred and intolerance, and while it exists in every sect of faith or non-faith for that matter, most Christians simply aren't like that.

Aside from those who believe that they have to proselytize, or perhaps physically pray in a certain way or at certain times, all of which would create a potential workplace problem anyway, keeping your beliefs to yourself shouldn't interfere with your ability to practice your faith.

This is always the first thing I think of whenever someone talks about prayer being ""removed"" from someplace like schools or the workplace or government buildings.  Not only is there no way to tell when someone is praying if they're doing it silently, there wouldn't be any way to stop them.

This is separate from admonitions in faiths such as Christianity to keep prayer private and to avoid prideful displays.  Posting your faith on social networks could certainly be interpreted that way.

Hicrayert,"I am a complete atheist but I am also a political science nerd. Now in my personal views, I don't agree with the fact that religious establishments get tax write-offs. But what everyone seems to forget is that its not just the churches but all non-profit organisations. This means red cross, charities across the country, and if the atheist were to unite and create a non-profit group that solely benefits atheist, then that wouldn't be taxed either. This was written in to the bill of rights and is a intertwined with the 1st amendment and will probably never change, and i like that. 

The true problem is when so called non-profit organizations start intermingling with politics. As soon as a penny of their non-taxed, collected money starts lobbying for their favorite (probably catholic) politician then that is where the problem lies. But as far as in general, no I don't have a problem with tax-exempt churches because of the history with the positive outcomes of non-profit organizations.

We are social animals as a result of our evolutionary history. We live and toil together.  We therefore interact. I don't see any need or even reason to have some inchoate, invisible, supernatural being involved in our social interactions (aka interpersonal connections). 

Did you know that [chimps mourn their dead](http://www.livescience.com/6335-chimps-understand-mourn-death-research-suggests.html)?  

&gt;One such instance came with the final hours of Pansy, a chimp more than 50 years old who lived in a Scottish safari park. 

&gt;In the days leading up to the elderly chimp's peaceful demise in 2008, her group was very quiet and moved to sleep near her, the researchers found. Immediately before Pansy died, others groomed and caressed her often. One male chimpanzee, Chippie, apparently tested her for signs of life as she died by closely inspecting her mouth and moving her limbs. 



&gt; ""When the adult male behaved as though he was testing Pansy for signs of life, it struck home that the chimpanzees might indeed have greater awareness of the difference between life and absence of life than we previously thought,"" said researcher James Anderson, a primatologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland. 

&gt;Soon after Pansy died, most of the chimpanzees left, but her daughter Rosie returned and remained by her mother all night.

King-Hell,"There is no agenda in Atheism. There are no additional beliefs necessary beyond the belief that there is no god. That's it. Simple: An atheist is someone who does not believe in God(s). 

We are not expected to endorse evolution (though most do). We do not support, or oppose homosexuality. We are not necessarily liberals. We have no idea how the universe was created, except that we don't see any evidence for it being at the command of a god. We are open to any evidence that contradicts our beliefs. So, if Jehovah, or Shiva, or Allah, or some other omnipotent supernatural entity comes thundering out of the sky tomorrow and makes him/herself known, we'll probably stop being atheists. But we are guessing that, based on the evidence so far, that's not likely to happen. 

We do not try to prove there is no god, because we could not prove a negative - any more than you can prove that the spoof deity the Flying Spaghetti Monster doesn't exist. The burden of proof lies with the people making the extraordinary claims. So when someone witnesses to me and says ""My God is great"", I say ""Show me the evidence and I'll believe you"". 

There is no actual evidence in the Bible or Qu'ran. There is very little outside evidence that corroborates them either. A Christian, or a Muslim, is 99.9 percent as much an atheist as I am. We agree that almost every religion on the planet, and there have been thousands through history, is bogus. False. Made up.

Bigger than myself? I'm on the 19th floor of a 20 floor building. I'm next door to one of the biggest buildings on Earth. I'm on a planet, of which I've seen enough to accept it is bigger than me (it doesn't take much). I accept our science that tells us of stars and distances.

Ending global conflict is more important an accomplishment than anything I have ever personally acheived. Erraticating sicknesses, I like that one. That's more important than the shit I do. Increasing education and literacy? Probably the most important of all.

The main commonality is not believing in *any* gods. That's also important, because so many religious people assume that we're rejecting their god specifically, when we actually reject all of them. In a way, apart from Yaweh, you're an atheist regarding the gods of other religions: I just reject one more than you do. :)

Can there be more than one ""something"", or can there be many ""somethings that are larger""?  Does this ""something larger"" have to be supernatural? Is it something that must exist to make you feel humble? (Knowing that you are weak or unworthy compared to something else). Or is it something to make you feel special?

They tell you to accept their promises that you will get something better in a place beyond our reach, at a time beyond our ken. Yet in the meantime, they take your tithes and use it to buy themselves gold thrones in empires beyond nations.

Is this the work of a forgiving god who loves all his creatures equally?

For me, personally, I am more than willing to accept the belief of god. He knows where to find me, and I'll do anything he asks. If the bible is 100 percent correct, my sin is Pride, and I will burn willingly. Because I am perfect as he made me, and if that's not good enough, fuck him.

But the fact that, all my life, I've had zero signal indicates that either there is no god watching us every moment of every day, or if there is he is so far beyond caring about us and interfering in our lives that he might as well not be present at all.

**atheism**

Pronunciation: /ˈeɪθɪɪz(ə)m/

noun
[mass noun]

    disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods. 

Origin:

late 16th century: from French athéisme, from Greek atheos, from a- 'without' + theos 'god'


&gt; Some way to explain the interpersonal connection we have with others. 

Humans are social animals and altruism and a sense of fairness is inborn to us.

Ihavemyownpizzaoven,"The new pope is a great example of what Nietzsche talked about in The Antichrist:

A criticism of the Christian concept of God leads inevitably to the same conclusion.— A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive, to its virtues—it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make sacrifices.... Religion, within these limits, is a form of gratitude. A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a god.—Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he must be able to play either friend or foe—he is wondered at for the good he does as well as for the evil he does. But the castration, against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone, would be contrary to human inclination. Mankind has just as much need for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn’t have to thank mere tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence.... What would be the value of a god who knew nothing of anger, revenge, envy, scorn, cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous ardeurs of victory and of destruction? No one would understand such a god: why should any one want him?—True enough, when a nation is on the downward path, when it feels itsbelief in its own future, its hope of freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self- preservation, then it must overhaul its god. He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous and demure; he counsels “peace of soul,” hate-no-more, leniency, “love” of friend and foe. He moralizes endlessly; he creeps into every private virtue; he becomes the god of every man; he becomes a private citizen, a cosmopolitan.... Formerly he represented a people, the strength of a people, everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a people; now he is simply the good god.... The truth is that there is no other alternative for gods: either they are the will to power—in which case they are national gods—or incapacity for power—in which case they have to be good....

TL;DR Once people no longer need a god that wars and kills for a specific people, to stay relevant, their god turns into a loving god for the whole world. ",null,8,cdno6v5,1ricbk,atheism,hot,19

""In this context, some people continue to defend religious theories which assume the existence of a heavenly savior, birthed by a virgin, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world after an apocalyptic ending where there are lots of locusts and plagues and shit. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding religious indoctrination power and in the sacralized workings of the various old ass texts that have been re-translated and altered countless times. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting. To sustain a lifestyle which excludes others who do not share our faith or whom we feel are not living according to our lifestyle standards, or to sustain enthusiasm for that self-righteous ideal, a globalization of dogmatism has developed. Almost without being aware of it, we end up being incapable of using logic in developing our beliefs, applying the scientific method, and in general, thinking for ourselves, as though all this were some divine being's responsibility and not our own. The culture of dogma deadens us; we are thrilled if the Church offers us meaningless exhortations; and in the meantime all the overwhelming evidence to the contrary of our dogma seems a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.""

Things seem more messed up because you are older, 25 years ago you were 5 and I was 17. Everything was cool in your world (I assume). At 17, I was aware of the Student Protests in Red China, the tensions in the middle east, the end of the cold war, megachurches, the rise of satanism and daytime talk shows, CGI was in its infancy, and the religious nuts were just as the are today.

Later, as questions did arise, I answered her straight for most stories, but for Santa (and also the Tooth Fairy) I asked her, ""What do you think?"" I wouldn't confirm or deny, but just let her think out loud. 

Eventually -- at age 5/6 -- she really pushed me hard on the Tooth Fairy. ""It really is you and Mommy, isn't it?"" she said. I asked, ""Are you sure you want me to tell you?"" She said yes, and I was honest. (She hasn't pushed that way yet on Santa.)

But she didn't really want to hear the truth, I think, so later, when she talked about the Tooth Fairy some more, I didn't ""correct"" her.

We have an amazing and massive amount of data from such diverse subjects as microbiology, paleontology, ecology, earth sciences, molecular genetics, virology, immunology, and on and on and on. All of the information in each of the diverse fields points to the same conclusion, and all of that information makes up and is contained with the sound and completely supported *theory* of evolution. Note, *theory* is the highest possible idea in science. The one that is best supported.

We have seen evolution happen in front of our own eyes in the laboratory. We have watched ring species evolve. We have seen the outcome in many, many ways through breeding of domestic animals.

The fact of evolution (that it happens - we know because of the above mentioned massive evidence as well as direct observation) is contained within the theory of evolution (ideas about how and why it happens).

SpHornet,"Many organisms have similar genes that differ in sequence in certain unimportant structural/coding regions of that gene. Some of those sequences look more similar then others. So you get clusters of sequences that look more similar and other clusters that are similar within their cluster but more different then other clusters (and some sequences that just are very different from the rest).

this could just be coincidence, when you look at differences in a group you will always find this. But the problem is (for creationists) that we didn't just look at 1 gene, we looked at many, and all those genes showed the same clustering. This shows all organisms are ordered in a specific way, and not because these sequences have slghtly different functions and contribute to small changes that define the groups. Like I said in the beginning these are unimportant parts of the genes; we can change them and nothing changes in the organisms themselfes.

Now the argument; If god (or anyone intelligent) created the DNA he would not use slightly different genes that are also slightly different in unimportant parts in a way that suggested similar animals would have the same changes; we would expect the unimportant DNA to either be all the same or differ at random.

Yet we find that not only that those clusters match in every gene, those clusters also correspond to same evolutionairy tree that was already proposed by morphological analysis of species. (And again, very important; these small differences are not responcible for the morphological differences, because we can change them at will and nothing changes)

For god to have created DNA like this he would have intended to make it appear organisms evolved; So either life evolved or god wanted to make it seem it did; either way, why wouldn't you believe it did?

As used in mathematics infinity is a useful symbol.  That's all, it doesn't _mean_ anything.  When Georg Cantor was fooling around with infinity, developing his theories of transfinite cardinal numbers, he nearly upset the whole mathematics apple cart.  The great David Hilbert, at the first ever international congress of mathematics held at the turn of the 20th century, had a list of top challenges for math in the new century.  High on the list was ""WTF is Cantor on about???""  Not too very long after that Kurt Gödel settled the matter with his completeness and incompleteness theorems.  So again, in mathematics infinity is just a fucking symbol - a damn useful one but nothing more than that. 

Still within the relam of mathematics, there are many actual infinites There are many infinities. And they're not all the same size.  There are infinitely many integers. For each pair of integers there is an infinity or real numbers between them. Some infinities are countable - the integers for example.  Some are uncountable.  

Fractals. The Koch snowflake has finite surface area but the perimeter is infinite. How cool is that?  

In physics, ""infinity"" may be the mathematical symbol or it may be used to describe some charcteristic of the universe.  In which case I think it's probably misused.  I'm pretty sure the universe is finite.  (Discrete too but that's another topic altogether.)  Is the space between two points infinite? Maybe.  Maybe it isn't, maybe it's limited to Planck dimensions.  I'm sure to get anargument here but the point is just to enumerate yet another infinity.

Some people say it's a sense of 'connection', some say it's a 'feeling of peace' or 'awe' or some such other emotion. I always wonder why you don't just call it that.

I don't believe in 'spirits', but I recognize that humans have emotional needs, and often make mental connections between the emotions an event evokes and the event itself, such that they feel like they can re-capture the emotion if they replicate the event. Hence ritual and ceremony.

I consider 'spirituality' to be an ignorant response to otherwise perfectly explicable emotional triggers. Yes, we all feel 'awe' when we look up in to the night sky, it's an atavistic human response. I just don't ascribe any more significance to that emotion than I do to any other. 

To me, 'spirituality' is just a way to make ordinary emotions 'mystical' and 'special', and a very human way to make yet another 'us' vs 'them' division, as in those who are 'spiritual' and those who aren't.",null,0,cdntyf1,1rj3y6,atheism,hot,4

They don't recognize that ""spirit"" has many meanings, most of them having nothing to do with supernatural shit or new age woo. I suppose it's precisely because the word is so often asscoiated with new age woo that the young folks here have such a marked antipathy. 

Spirituality is, to me, one's state of mind and emotions. Attitude, perceptivity, mindfulness.  Sense of wonder, awe, mystery.  Awareness and respect of the natural world and one's place in it. Sense of connectedness, meditative restfulness, etc. etc. etc.   Calling that stuff collectively ""spirituality"" makes perfect sense to me.  And certainly easier than listing all those things out.  

Buddhism - the brand where there are no gods, not the highly supernaturalificated versions - is prety much spirituality in a nutshell.

As to what you label yourself, don't worry about it. One of the things about being an atheist is that all you have to do is not accept the existence of a deity as claimed by others. Some people around here have really strong feelings about labels, but they're just adding on their own baggage. 

The standard advice for young atheists who are still under their parents control is to keep your mouth shut. If the natives rub blue mud into their belly buttons, you go right along and rub that mud.

There's no such thing as magic, and there isn't a god listening, so there is no reason to not participate if it saves you trouble.

Of course, if you're more confident that your family loves them for who you are, and not who they want you to be, ask them the difficult questions. Your dad was using what I believe is called the 'cosmological argument' in the given example. My response to that is 'so everything had to be created by something, with the exception of God?

It's also an idea to ask for evidence for their beliefs, but also read some of Richard Dawkins' books on evolution to understand reality for yourself, and perhaps give them sections to read so they can understand more of the other side, as I can pretty much guarantee that they don't right now!

It really is your choice but unfortunately faith based families tend to demand you remain in the faith. I would recommend that since you are only 14 that you stick it out. If at all possible I would suggest to the parentals that you postpone confirmation until your senior year or something where you may make the appropriate decision of your choosing. I may be confirmed Catholic but I do not practice nor do I care to practice that religion. You will be able to chose your path later but right now you have to remain in your parents house.

Now, I was raised Catholic. I went through Confirmation. I am an Atheist. Just remember, *it means nothing*. It is a stupid ritual that 'confirms' that they've successfully brainwashed you. They haven't, but it doesn't hurt to play along. Go for it, have fun, do whatever, and then walk away with the knowledge that your participation has earned you another 4 years of provisions and protection. 

We give this advice constantly and thankfully the people we give it to mostly listen. Here it is: *Do not endanger your well being just to come out as an atheist.* This means that if your parents are fundies, *don't tell them*. This means that if you can't support yourself without certain religiously devote people, *keep it to yourself*. 

With that said, small victories matter. I made a fairly comprehensive list in an earlier post, but I'll paraphrase here - Take 'god', 'jesus', and 'mother mary' out of your speech. Watch secular programming (bones, house, etc). Decorate with eye towards blasphemy (hang Thor movie posters, for instance) - some of the artwork from other religions/faiths is quite beautiful and the sarcastic edge is always good for an inner chuckle. Pick friends who aren't 'devout' - their silence on religion is enough. Pick sports/activities that encourage free thinking or at least don't have the 'pray before the game' mentality - martial arts are good for this if you need something physical. Get involved with the democratic party - you may not find many openly atheistic people, but their other values will probably coincide with yours.

Red5point1,"As a strong atheist I have to say you need to tread carefully as to why you think people are religious.  
My experience shows that intelligence is not a key factor.  
The main reason people stay religious is that they are no willing to change.  
Humans are habitual by nature and we hate change.  
Religious people use religion as means to justify their current lifestyle. They have been indoctrinate to **think** that their religion guides their lifestyle, however the reality is the opposite their lifestyle guides their religion.  
  
So, it depends on how you get a long with your family which will determine how you see them.  
I love my family so when I became an atheist I saw them not as stupid or crazy. I saw them as indoctrinated victims of a cult that they had not say in it.  That is all they knew, that is how they grew up. I could not fault them for that.  
So, I made it my duty to free them, it took 8 years of energy and patience but I did it.   

I'm not saying you need to do this, but just think about it a little more, than just thinking ""why would they believe in such crazy stories if they are intelligent.""

Suite_up,"Just imagine, 100 years from now, the Sunday assembly is a massive tax exempt community. Billions of individuals from all over attend the Sunday assemblies in their communities. All religions have been abolished and the current generation are all raised without believing in the supernatural. Most everyone attends the Sunday assembly and the head speaker; the "" class 7 - grand dragon"" heads the assembly with words to inspire and preach good behaviour for the sake of being good to one another. A collection plate is passed around and members donate to the cause.

Enter Timmy. Timmy doesn't go to the Sunday assembly, he doesn't see the point, Timmy believes he can be a good person without attending and chooses to spend his Sundays reading or playing Ps26 games. Because of this, Timmy's friends are weary of him. ""How can you be a good person if you dont attend the assembly? Where's your moral compass?"" ""I know right from wrong"" Timmy replies, but his friends are still skeptical of him. ""How can we trust Timmy? he's an unattendee!"" they think to themselves. 

As Timmy grows older, more people come to learn of his being an unattendee. ""I just don't understand why you aren't you an attendee! Where did I go wrong?"" Timmy's mother wails. ""It's okay honey, he'll come to attend sometime, he just needs to figure it out on his own, you'll see"" Says Timmy's dad watching his son slam the bedroom door behind him in anger. 

Timmy's girlfriend has been reconsidering attending the Sunday assembly, but still she holds firm that she must ""But Timmy my dad is very strict about attendee values, if he ever found out you were an unattendee, I think he'd stop talking to me"" ""I just don't see the point, I know how to be a good person without attending the events, look, just the other day I helped an old lady with her groceries, isn't there more merit in doing good things without having it drilled into you at the Sunday assembly?? You know, doing good without being told you must""
""I just don't think I can be with a unattendee... I'm sorry"" 

As the years go by more happens to Timmy, at his job everyone is an attendee and they preach about the values they learnt at the Sunday assembly, it makes Timmy's blood boil that they should think they're so superior to him, he finally snaps and starts talking to them about how unecessary it is to attend the Sunday assembly, and how moral are obtained through empathy and not the teachings of some mega corporation. ""Why are unattendee's so angry all the time"" ""I'm being persecuted for my moral standing!"" his coworkers say.
He is promptly called into his Boss's office and dismissed, Timmy puts it down to his difference of opinion, and it causes his anger to grow.

Later, while surfing the web on his Virtual Reality Pro; Timmy stumbles across a reddit board by accident r/unattendant. Immediately he is taken in by all the posts pertaining to other unattendees who have been persecuted, pushed around and dismissed from their families, SO's and workplaces for their difference of opinion. He smiles, and feels at home with others just like him. Now he has something to look forward to, every day with new posts, different stories and like minded individuals who share his stance on relig- er..

ca3799,"I think it is a fine idea.

I do attend a UU church (as an atheist) and enjoy it. Many of their sermons come down to two big issues: relationship and community- two things missing in the very individualistic, atheist world.

I can see why Atheist Assemblies would appeal to some for those two reasons alone. I would go if there were one near me. I like the UU's but I don't really care for the religious aspects.

I think a good question is ""Why do people attend church?""

Of course, the religious go to worship and/or praise God and to seek eternal life. But there are other reasons as well- to show gratitude and reverence, to belong to a community.

Atheists, humanists, agnostics, skeptics, the 'spiritual but not religious' and even some Christians who don't 'fit in' with the various flavors of Christianity available in their neighborhoods might like to place and time to meet up. Sundays are the traditional time we have done that here in the US, so Sunday it is.

Many people attend church less for the religious aspects and more out of habit, for family, sometimes to hide their non-belief.

But having a secular place where like-, or even unlike-, minded folks can discuss the big ticket issues in life such as 'why are we here' and 'where are we going', seek fellowship, celebrate good fortunes and losses, and garner a sense of support and belonging, to engage with others politically and morally, to express gratitude and/or reverence for this awesome life we have, and to discuss and ponder what it means to be human and consider our obligations to each other.. well, that just can't be a bad idea for those interested.

Someone said ""life is not an individual proposition.""  Sunday Assemblies would be a good place to connect with others. For many of the non-religious, it would be nice to have a group to belong to that doesn't involve fake stuff or faking stuff.",null,0,cdo45cr,1rju35,atheism,hot,2

MisanthropicScott,"Whose death is a good question that should not be ignored.

When dealing with the death of a loved one, there are three possibilities.

1. The person died after a long bout of suffering. Having seen up-close-and-personal that there are indeed fates worth than death, death can sometimes be a relief. Imagine quality of life as a scale from 1 to 10 where 10 is perfect health and 0 is death, hence not part of the quality of life. Quality of life can actually go negative. This is when life is worse than death. In such cases, death is an improvement in condition. Read the lyrics to the theme from MASH (which were never played on the TV show). They're quite uplifting and comforting for those of us who have seen worse than death.

2. An untimely death. These are the worst deaths with which we sometimes must deal. There is precious little comfort to be had from religion or non-religion in such times. Family members of mine have lost faith at times like these. All one can do is cling to the loved ones who are still with us and grieve together. I don't have any great advice here. However, I can say that religion in such times is actually downright scary. Were I to have religion, at this point, I'd be thinking that some god or other actively had it in for me and my family. I'd be looking over my shoulder wondering what was coming next. In a better place? With the sick god who just took my loved one from me? That's not a better place. That's worse.

3. Someone who goes peacefully at an appropriate time. There are times when someone has not suffered unduly, has never had their quality of life go negative, and simply dies, preferably in their sleep. Here, I would grieve the loss of life, of course. And yet, I would honestly feel some hope that I might have the same opportunity when my time comes.

Lastly, there is one's own death. Many people fear death and have trouble dealing with the fact that death means oblivion. To me, I just imagine the way that I felt before I was born or even conceived. Why would I fear that?! As I was for the first 13.8 billion years of the universe, so I shall be again.

I do not fear death.

I do, however, fear fates worse than death. My big fears are always about the road toward death and what it may entail near the end. To that end, I have made a living will. I hope that my lawyer has correctly worded my living will to say the legal equivalent of ""If you're reading my living will, pull the plug.""

The idea of having air pumped through the meat that used to be me for many months or until my money runs out is my own biggest fear. 

I take comfort in the fact that as an insulin dependent diabetic, I have a reasonably painless way out involving a very large dose of insulin, far larger than the one that left Sunny von Bulow in a coma for 20 years. Unfortunately, this requires me to be conscious and in control at the time.

BTW, for atheists writing up advanced directives, talk to your lawyer about the fact that hospitals need not honor them. One extra bit of protection that may or may not help is to put in a clause that if you are ever taken to a hospital that will not honor your directives, you wish to be moved to one that will as soon as possible. This may help give your family some leverage to get you out of a Catholic or other religious hospital that believes in preserving ""life"" at all costs.

Death is always a tough one. I hope I've given a bit of help.

Maybe it helps to believe in an immortal soul. I know that I would feel a lot better if [my brother] had gone away on a trip somewhere, even if he was never coming back. But [my brother] did not ""pass on"". [My brother] is not ""resting in peace"". [My brother] is not coming back. [My brother] doesn't exist any more. [My brother] was absolutely annihilated at the age of nineteen. Yes, that makes me angry. I can't put into words how angry. It would be rage to rend the gates of Heaven and burn down God on Its throne, if any God existed. But there is no God, so my anger burns to tear apart the way-things-are, remake the pattern of a world that permits this.

I wonder at the strength of non-transhumanist atheists, to accept so terrible a darkness without any hope of changing it. But then most atheists also succumb to comforting lies, and make excuses for death even less defensible than the outright lies of religion. They flinch away, refuse to confront the horror of a hundred and fifty thousand sentient beings annihilated every day. One point eight lives per second, fifty-five million lives per year. Convert the units, time to life, life to time. The World Trade Center killed half an hour. As of today, all cryonics organizations together have suspended one minute. This essay took twenty thousand lives to write.

I wonder if there was ever an atheist who accepted the full horror, making no excuses, offering no consolations, who did not also hope for some future dawn. What must it be like to live in this world, seeing it just the way it is, and think that it will never change, never get any better?

gbuuun,"As a former Catholic myself, have you considered the fact that if evolution is true -- and the Catholic Church's official position is that it is -- then there was no ""first"" human, and therefore the entire part about original sin goes out the window, making it so that there was no point in Jesus dying in the first place? I could perhaps understand if you were something like a Southern Baptist, but evolution just demolishes Catholicism without even needing to go further from the first and most important premise.

To answer your question, however, atheism is not a belief. Atheism is a lack of active belief, like not-bowling is not a hobby. There is a tendency for SOME atheists to take their cues from science or philosophy, though this is is not a requirement to be an atheist. Atheists do not exert that there is no god, but that we have no reason to believe one exists. Moral philosophy is quite difficult, and reading Hume, Hobbes, Williams, and a lot of contemporary philosophers shows that there is no consensus there. However, I do think that Sam Harris is spot on on the topic of how we should treat others: we should treat others not the way we'd like to be treated, but how they'd like to be treated. Harris doesn't say this exactly, but I think this is the logical conclusion of what his argument must be. If we lived in a universe with only two people and two types of resources, rocks and paper, and person A liked rocks and person B liked paper, does it make sense for person A to give person B rocks? If person A deprived person B of paper and gave person B rocks, is this a moral society? To be clear once more, this is NOT what Harris says, but an interpretation of the implications. 

All people are different. There are things that make us similar in many ways, but people have different needs and preferences. Some people like jelly donuts, others like cream donuts; some people like video games, and others like books. People are very often biased because they play the game of life in first-person mode. They each feel like the main character, and quite often, they feel that they are not only incapable of making mistakes, but also incapable of not understanding what is good for every single person in the world. Treat each person as an individual, not the caricature of the person you think he is or want him to be.

For example, its position on contraception, abortion, homosexuality, protection of child molesters, outright insistence on maintaining a number of bizarre taboos, and women's ranking within the church. If you were to reject the Church's position on these points then you be a better person by default; no effort required. You may feel the same, you know... there may not be any immediate feedback with your new found beliefs... but because we behave according to our beliefs then intrinsically the affect of your behavior will have a more positive impact on the world than if you were to behave according to the Church's beliefs on these issues.

MartinTheRound,"Atheism is not a belief system, it's the lack of one. If it's a system of any kind, it's a system of rational thinking. The rational conclusion that there is no supernatural entity that demands, forbids, rewards or punishes our attitudes. Calling atheism is like somebody telling you if you eat a lot of junk food you'll get unhealthy, possibly fat, and you replying, wow, that's a nice belief system, I wonder how it compares to major religions. .... What I mean is, we don't see evidence for religions being anything other than man-made cultural constructs and we don't consider them applicable or valuable. Kind of like you wouldn't consider sacrificing a goat to the moon god for the fertility of your wife relevant or valid. It's not a matter of belief, it's a matter of rationality. If there was evidence, but..... Do you want me to tell you in how many ways christianity is flawed? Probably not, and as long as you're treating people well I don't much care what you believe in.

As for being a good person, well, getting out from the dogma of your church would be a start. Then perhaps decide what kind of a good person you think you want to be and can be. Do you think you want to educate people, feed people, make people happy? Think about what you think makes a good person and be that. Not because some church demands it (one having a history of selling god's forgiveness and headed by people that actively protect pedophiles), not because some god demands it, not because that god will reward you, not because you fear that god's punishment, but simply because you choose to be. There are many ways to be a good person. I don't know, make someone smile every day, be kind, be charitable, be there for people when they need a friend, be there for christians and non-christians, be they atheist or hindu or something else. Contribute to the wealth of wisdom, learn and teach. Donate to wikpedia. Something.

If you want to know what makes a good person, try learning a little bit about philosophy, a little bit about psychology, study a bit of ethics. I'm not sure which specific books to recommend, but there is much written over the ages about what it means to be good. Plato wrote some stuff, and many thinkers before and since.

This might be a silly question but why do you want to be a better person? I don't mean it's not a worthwhile goal, IMHO it's a very laudable one, I would like to understand your motivation so I might offer more specific responses.

ScottBerry2,"1) For me, this is not ""pretend,"" but for you it is, and I totally understand that. But pretend there is no God, and that praying doesn't do any good. If it didn't help to pray for a sick family, what would you do? Make them dinner or help them with shopping or chores? Then do that. And if you want to pray too, go ahead: it won't hurt.
2) Try to do something nice for somebody else every day.
3) Especially try to help people who can't do anything for you. Being extra-nice to your boss is being a suck up. Helping the homeless is a nicer thing to do.
4) Target your charity. If you have $50 to give to charity, think about where it will do the most good, and where that money ends up. Yes, the Catholic Church does some charity work with its donations. But, in addition to providing money to things you might not support (*cough* lawyers for pedophiles *cough* (sorry, I couldn't help it), it spreads its money around to different charities. I was once faced with a choice between two charities: one was just a food bank, the other was a food bank that also supplied toys for poor children. Although I think that both of these things are good, I think the just-a-food-bank is a better charity. If I thought supplying toys to children were a better charity, I'd give money to that instead -- I wouldn't want that charity to also be a food bank.

2. Do you give money to the Catholic church?  If yes, and if you really want to be a better person, stop immediately.  I have no problem with religious people (I am married to a practicing christian) and there are a lot of good churches out there, but the catholic church is not one of them.  The church is the epitome of corruption and immorality.  Take that money and give it to a good charity instead; that's what I do.

3. Atheists don't have a 'belief system' because there is no dogma that we subscribe to.  It is simply the rejection of magic and unfounded claims.  I reject your god for the same reason you reject Zeus, Odin, Buddha, etc.  Because of this, every answer you get from us will be different.

4. My perspective: love everyone.  I don't mean love them like a spouse, but love the idea of them, love them for who they are and what the represent, and never deny the freedoms that you so freely enjoy.  It's really that simple.  Unlike your belief, I believe this one life is the only one that we get, so make it count.

------------------------

My main problems with most christian sects, including catholics, is the extreme hypocrisy.  ""Love thy neighbor"" is preached in one breath and in the next breath it is preached that gay people don't deserve to be married.  If you step in the way of people's right to peruse happiness, you do not love them.  There is no such thing as ""loving the sinner, not the sin""; it is complete and utter bullshit.  

Another example is that of contraception.  The church will tell you that it is god's will if you get pregnant and birth control is going against god's will.  Yet they have ZERO problem with viagra.  If it was god's will, he would give you the ability to get a boner and taking viagra is going against god's will the same way that contraception is.

Is it a moral action?
What if your intentions were to get a reward for donating?
What if he will only use the dollar to fuel his crack addiction that is keeping him on the street in the first place?
Does the outcome matter, or the intention?
Should we be following some sort of hard and fast rule to guide our moral actions?  Where would such rules come from anyway?

Since as atheists we lack a cohesive belief system, our moral philosophies tend to be quite varied from person to person.  Perhaps some believe that morality comes from whatever society you are born into, or that there are sets of virtues that contribute most to human happiness, and that your intentions to fulfill these ""duties"" is what counts.  Other might say that we should somehow calculate the outcomes of our actions and choose those which contribute most to human happiness (or at the least cause the least amount of suffering) to find what is the ""right"" thing to do.

I think that, since there are probably no gods that are giving us the hard and fast rules to live our lives by, each of us is free to choose our morals and ethics in a profound way.  The responsibility lies with each person to decide what is moral or not, and there is really no objective standard by which to judge our actions; we must each create our own to our best ability.  In fact, I would say that this is what every person on Earth does anyway, consciously or unconsciously.

Personally, I like Kant's idea that I should always treat other people as ends in themselves, never as means to an end.  As a caveat, I must be very careful when we are choosing to act in somebody else's ""best interests,"" because how can I know what their best interests are anyway?  I need to think about the outcomes of my actions as well as my intentions because my intentions are reflections of who I am as a person.  Above all, I need to be willing to struggle with these moral questions and not rely on some outside force to give me hard and fast rules on what is right or wrong and how I should live my life.

Wingflier,"I've definitely re-thought monogamy since I became an atheist. For many years after I left Christianity, the concept of monogamy never even occurred to me as potentially flawed. It was only after I began to study the divorce rates of industrialized nations that I really began to notice that there was a problem.

To me, the question is whether monogamy actually produces the most happiness and success for the individuals. There is also the question of children, and what is most beneficial for them as well. However, as a person who has no plans on having children, this is not a factor for me. I recently read a study which seems to prove that unmarried couples are happier, in general, than married couples. http://news.health.com/2012/01/23/living-together-may-be-mentally-healthier-than-marriage-study/

There have also been societies in the past which did not put such a strong or mandatory emphasis on ""monogamous relationships"", and which were quite successful in spite of that.

One reason I despise the idea of monogamy in the 1st world is that nobody is truly monogamous anyway. What we have is known in psychology as ""serial monogamy"". In other words, we're monogamous with one person until we're tired of them or they're tired of us, and then we search for someone else to be monogamous with. When you look at it from this perspective, monogamy just seems ridiculous to me. I've seen so many examples of women (men too) who are extremely nice and caring to me, and who I have daily conversations with, until they get a boyfriend, after which they disappear off the face of the Earth. They will continue to avoid contact with me until that relationship with their new boyfriend ends, after which they will come back into my life acting like nothing ever happened. This wouldn't be that concerning if it had happened only once or twice, but it has happened to me countless times. In fact, I think it's a bigger part of our American culture.

As a person who studies and adheres to the Buddhist philosophy, and as a person who is mastering in Psychology, I think that jealousy and possessiveness are two of the worst characteristics any person can display, especially when it comes to their mental and emotional health (and the heath of the relationship). While I also disagree with polygamy, as I feel that it puts women (in most cases) into the position of second-class citizens, I do wish people in America and other 1st world countries would re-evaluate their stances on marriage and monogamy when clearly they do not work exclusively speaking. Perhaps a culture that was more loving, less jealous, and less possessive would be a healthier, happier one.",null,0,cdo6py7,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,2

The Naples of the Age of Exploration is a good example with all the sailors and prostitutes spreading syphilis like wildfire. But there are also other consequences such as changes to social structure (who raises the kids? Do we still need classifications such as father and mother? Will it affect our sense of identity?).

I'm not sure doing away with monogamy will necessarily lower the phenomena you mention. You can still be jealous and stressed in a polygamous relationship. It's true that the dishonesty associated with cheating would disappear, but that could be replaced by, say, a prevalence of dishonesty of whether you have an STD.

Too often I've seen couples get married to feel they get some kind of spiritual insurance together; absurd, folkloric and unnecessary hogwash if you ask me.

IMHO, jealousy and dishonesty are part of the human condition. The only difference between a monogamous relationship and a polyamorous one is, your spouse (if he/she is the jealous type) will be jealous of the other spouse instead of your potential mistress(es). Her ire will be the same, just much more focused.

Now, as for raising kids... Raising a kid isn't a full-time job, but it isn't a hobby either; it's more like a part-time job. And no one person can be expected to be there for his kid whenever he is needed, 24/7, every day of every year: put simply, shit happens. For this reason, I believe that, ideally, every child should have at least two parental figures in his or her life. 

Unfortunately, it isn't an ideal world. Some people marry the wrong person, or find the right person but can't get married to him. Other people get pregnant while single and choose not to get an abortion (or, for whatever reason, can't get one).

I'm not saying that if you're a single, you need to grab the nearest available partner and slap a ring on him. Or if you are in an unhappy/abusive marriage, you must stay together for the sake of your children. What I am saying is, raising a child should be something that you plan for ahead of time, with another person whom you have a stable, long-term relationship with (preferably someone who lives with you).",null,0,cdofsob,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,1

Thorw4w4y4cc0un7,"This is just my opinion on the matter. 

Personally, as far as I'm concerned, I prefer monogamy. Relationships and living together, in general, are complex enough without complicating the equation by adding extra variables. I have a Redhead that's quite devoted and loyal to me, and in exchange, I provide the same. I don't expect anything from anyone I wouldn't expect from myself, so there is that to consider, as well. 

Legally speaking, there are reasons to not allow polygamy. For example, in the case of HIPAA exemptions, imagine 5 wives, all trying to cram into a single exam room, or hospital room to visit their husband in the hospital. The room would be so crowded, the staff wouldn't be able to do their jobs. In the case of Inheritance Laws, consider, 5 wives, each with a child, and the Husband left no Last Will and Testament to bequeath his estate. Who decides who gets what? There would be a massive fight, legally, verbally, and quite possibly physically, over the Estate.

I would disagree with the idea that ""Marriage is Inevitable"", as well as the attendant ideas. I have an atheist friend, who is nearing retirement age, who has gone his entire life single. I see no reason why the idea of marriage, in it's current incarnation, would be considered ideal as a one-size-fits-all. Personally, I think those that cannot/will not commit themselves to monogamy, or at least an ""Open Marriage"", should keep away from the concept. There's nothing wrong, from my viewpoint, with cohabitation, and in fact, would probably be a lot better for society in the long run if more people exercised it. 

If you're happier being a Swinger, or even a ""Serial Monogamist"", then by all means, the legal system allows for such a stance. And it's not like we lack the ability to have multiple women devoted to the same man, or even the other way around.

If you're asking yourself how something can be that beautiful without some higher power making it so, then you're basically discrediting whatever it is you find beautiful. You deny it the ability to be so touching and instead attribute it to something or someone you feel is more worthy of that, regardless of whether that entity actually is worthy of it or even exists in the first place.

I'm wagering once you come to the realisation that landscapes can be that beautiful without outside help, music can be that touching, and events in your life can be that profound, you'll come to really cherish the time you have, your surroundings, your friends and family, and the work of other humans as what it is instead of simply writing it off as ""god did it"".",null,0,cdo3m7s,1rk5zc,atheism,hot,1
MartinTheRound,"Well, you can either just accept you have perfectly natural feelings and enjoy them or try to understand the nature of each feeling and still enjoy them. We have many different feelings, some of which have straightforward evolutionary reasons, others somewhat quirkier ones, some are side effects. Does it matter to you which quirk of evolution gave you the ability to enjoy your time with your lover? Or the ability to look at some nice work of art and wonder in amazement? I can explain some of the feelings and it doesn't detract one bit from them. What's sad in my case is that understanding how my depression works doesn't make it any easier not to feel desperately lonely and want to kill myself. I know it's only chemicals, I know which part of my brain is making it so, but the feeling isn't any less severe. Nor was my enjoyment of love any less powerful when I was loving and loved. Just because I could tell what chemicals were involved didn't make my feelings any less enjoyable and doesn't make my current feelings any less hopeless. And my ability to explain what makes me want to express myself takes away from my wanting to give you a response. So I'd say, other than attributing your feelings to the wrong cause you're doing all right. You are rational and you can realize that majesty can be found all around you even without the majesty being put there for your benefit. And you can just enjoy it when you see it. Majesty is not what's out there, majesty is what you perceive. Just like god, people believe in god, and god isn't out there, it's in their minds. And has real effects on their lives.

* **Mohammed was a coward** (though this is also substantiated by his order, elsewhere, to have hundreds of helpless prisoners beheaded); and even worse,
* **Mohammed didn't have faith in Allah** to bail his ass out, even though elsewhere there are miracles like the flying horse and the cleaving of the moon.

MalakElohim,"As a fellow Australian and Atheist, keep your grades up. Since you're planning on getting a university education and going white collar, don't give a crap about school captain's, student council etc at high school. Employers aren't going to look at what you did in High School if they have 4 years at uni to look at.

This isn't like the states where quality universities will go through your achievements and tut-tut over them. Ensure your ATAR or equivalent is high enough to get into the course you want, or at least a related course, then you should get a CSP and be done with all the religious crap.

That said, if you go to the *right* government school, their education is as good, if not better than the religious schools. I did High School in Victoria, in Bendigo in particular and there were 3 schools in total where I could do my VCE (HSC equivalent). Bendigo Senior Secondary College, Girton Grammar, Catholic College. Girton was Anglican. Girton had by far the best average marks across the board, but their marks were matched by BSSC on raw numbers. Of course, BSSC had far more people and accepted anyone. Catholic College had an average similar to BSSC, but no where near as many high performers.

Do your research, you might be lucky and have a decent government school nearby (or you only have access to shit ones, it's a lottery), but if you do, think about moving there, it sounds like it might be worth it to get away from the bullshit religion.

That said, if you want a high paying job, to improve your chances, go into a STEM degree (especially Engineering or Medicine) or Law. Essentially professional degrees, where they directly qualify you for a job/it's illegal to do the job without the relevant degree. Aim for a Group of 8 University if possible. Will the education be any better than a non-Go8 uni? Probably not if you're dedicated. But that doesn't really matter, for that first job, it's getting in the door and reputations count for a lot.

If you're looking for an Arts/Commerce degree, good luck getting a job, unless you're rocking Acturial studies or are doing it as a double degree, that said Commerce/Arts is GREAT as a double with Engineering, it gives you down-time from Engineering subjects, lessens the stress levels and gives you the opportunity to study things that are interesting to you. 

Also, here's an example, I'm an Engineer, which is why my examples all revolve around it: If you can't get into say an Engineering degree, do a closely related Science degree to the type of Engineering you want to do. It might push your degree back 1 semester, which can be made up over summer breaks, but it gets you in the door. Getting INTO uni is the hardest part of getting into the degree you want. Keep your grades up through the first 6 months to a year and you can transfer unis/courses.

The religion thing being pushed at your school I find really ridiculous. All of your issues were good objections and based on good arguments, so your thinking is in the right place. Keep reading and learning independent of school, it always helps.

I have to agree with MalakElohim (I have no idea how to link users) that your school captain etc stuff is not super important. IF your uni even considers that type of stuff upon entrance, just do something in your local community. Want to go into medicine? Volunteer at the local hospital. Or help at the library or organize something that could really help people out in your local area. What they want to see is that you are capable of engaging and caring in things outside of your own education. So think about what your skills and interests are and challenge yourself to do something fun and interesting with them. I wanted to be a dentist when I started uni, so I went and job shadowed the dentist in town while I was living in Australia. 

If you want to be an engineer, MalakElohim makes a good case for how to approach your studies. If you don't want to be an engineer, then take it as an example of how you can approach your studies if you like, but ignore whatever doesn't interest you and do your thing :).

Santa_on_a_stick,"&gt; I would claim that the burden of proof is on God.

This begs the question being asked. The burden of proof is on the theist who claims the existence of a god. You can't say ""I claim a god exists, and that it is that god's responsibility to prove me right!""

Moreover, 

&gt; Theists say that the burden of proof rests on the non-believer, to explain how our existence could be possible without an intelligent creator. 

The answer ""I don't know"" is perfectly acceptable, because many atheists don't posit a solution to this. We are here, clearly, but we just don't know how (yet).

As for atheists, we make *no claim* as to specific gods. My position has always been, ""There is no evidence of the existence of gods with the properties that theists claim.""

As soon as you have evidence that is incontrovertible, I would have no choice but the believe, as there would be at that time definite evidence that a god exists. Bonus points for you if you can prove *your flavor of deity* is that which exists.

scornucopia,"&gt; Atheists say that the burden of proof lies with the person making a positive claim that something exists. (Again, **many other alternatives**). 

Not really. Whether something exists or not is a purely empirical matter. Either there is evidence that it exists or there is not.

When entertaining such claims, there are essentially only two rules we can apply: either we work on the assumption that an existential claim (*X* exists) is false until we have empirical evidence that it is true, or we assume that it is true until we have empirical evidence that it is false.

If someone says “leprechauns exist”, we assume that's false until someone shows us a leprechaun. If we apply this rule consistently, we don't have to admit the existence of fairies or goblins (or gods) without evidence.

If, however, someone says “God exists”, suddenly the shoe is on the other foot, and we're expected to assume that it's true until we can show evidence that it's not? But if we apply that rule consistently, we then have to admit leprechauns and goblins until we can “disprove” them too. This is untenable.

The only rational rule for existential claims is that we assume that they are false until there is empirical evidence for the claimed thing.

If you apply one rule to leprechauns and goblins, and the other rule to God, you are guilty of [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading).",null,0,cdoget6,1rl7kh,atheism,hot,4

Thestrangeone23,"Once again depends on how you define god. And if you're trying to define god into existence, then it is not begging the question as you had assumed, but rather moving the goalposts. You see we can argue against the bible and it's claims of infallibility, inaccurate historical descriptions and all around just some absolutely awful advice, so if you define god as the bible (or Koran, or book of Mormon or some other holy text) then it is easy to disprove him. But when you define god as a bland and generic 'creator' or 'higher power' that's when moving the goalposts come in. Because a bland creator/higher power does nothing to speak to any of the claims of the bible or any other similar holy text. Also, most if not all of the arguments for the existence of even such a poorly defined and vague god are riddled with logical fallacies. 

If you want to believe in a god, that is your choice, but simply know that it is indeed a choice. It is not a decision made out of a rational consideration of the evidence, but on a purely emotional level and in some cases despite the evidence. You choose the god that is familiar to you, just as the muslim chooses the god that his parents taught him, or the Hindu chooses the gods that were taught to him. Even if you weren't born in a religious family, the supposedly tolerant America tends to have an attitude that Christianity is the only true religion and all others are false. So, if you are in an emotionally vulnerable place, the first person that is going to race to stuff your mind full of nonsense will most likely be a Christian. There's a reason conversion stories often have a 'bottoming out' part. It's the emotionally vulnerable place where intellect is put aside for the sake of pure emotion. So many arguments from the cosmological argument, to the watchmaker argument, to the ontological argument all involve pure appeals to emotion rather then any actual data supporting any one religion.

I rejoice in this.  As a pastor and theologian, I am grateful that the church is moving forward and is inclusive of science.

The only reason he'll finally agree to do it is because his wife will forgive him and tell him to move on, and that their daughter's death wasn't his fault.

Stopped again at the face at 39 seconds in. Is he constipated? Does reading whatever he's reading on his laptop cause such a blockage?  Let's hear his story, hopefully God can provide him such relief. 

Stopped again at 50. Is this really the premise? He's the janitor? I work in a school, so maybe I should doublecheck this, but I'm not sure they count as members of the faculty that can ok student activities. And I'm still lost as to why this should be a religious thing. The kids clearly want to do some sort of play that the school doesn't want them to do, (oh also, no religion either, ya know, like the law says)

Stopped it again at the minute mark.  THERE HE IS! The evil antagonist that is the science teacher! How DARE he care about their education. He's really gonna try to take a stand against the janitor collecting kids after school to help them out with their religious affirmation. That's not creepy or weird in the least.

Made it a good while before the next stop, managing to get past that awkward dance. Cue action music at 1:45. This kid looks like he's about to kick ass for God!

Stopped at 2:10 with the lawyer arguing that it's not establishment of religion, it's just the speech of the students... which technically isn't even really a protected thing, but hey I agree with him.... cuz I still have no idea where the hell religion actually fits in this. Seriously, what play do they want to do? The nativity scene? The crucifixion? What?

Stopped again at 2:16. No real comments, just a lot of laughter about all the locker pushing.  Shit's getting serious.  I guess turn the other cheek means grab a kid by the neck and shove him into the wall. Religion, teaching kids good morals since... well.. never, really.

Essentially, what happens each squadron is given a yearly budget. If you don't meet your budget (you're more effecient than you thought, don't need as much, whatever), are you rewarded?

Nope. You obviously don't need as big a budget. So, your budget for the next fiscal year is cut. Now, this is one thing if you're genuinely being more effecient. However, if that reduction in expendetures is temporary (someone PCS'd to a new base early, for example), you're stuck holding the bag next year. And fun story, getting your budget *increased* is a lot harder than getting it cut.

Now, how do I offset any unexplained non-spending? Why, by blowing through any money on miscellanious crap at the end of the year. Saw it happen nearly every year myself when I was active duty. Not quite enough money to fix the broken shit that needs fixing (test equipment and the like), but more money than you can frankly afford to lose when you're in the military.

It sucks, it's wasteful, and needs to be fixed (immediately, if not sooner), but it's *not* evidence of some christian lie to overtake the military.

You cannot change a religious person's mind, because when it comes to ""faith"" (a word they love throw around) and religious beliefs, ALL logic is thrown out of the window.

And having a debate or discussion is absolutely pointless without logic.
A religious person has to change on his own.

Additionally, if you receive federal funds at all, then you must comply with federal law. I'm referring more to catholic hospitals here.

Basically, they want to let miscarrying women die in the emergency room, if there is still a fetal heartbeat present. Current law requires them to send these women to a different facility for a D&amp;C. It's bad enough that we are sending women, who are hemorrhaging or in sepsis, hours away to another hospital.

""I am a complete atheist but I am also a political science nerd. Now in my personal views, I don't agree with the fact that religious establishments get tax write-offs. But what everyone seems to forget is that its not just the churches but all non-profit organisations. This means red cross, charities across the country, and if the atheist were to unite and create a non-profit group that solely benefits atheist, then that wouldn't be taxed either. This was written in to the bill of rights and is a intertwined with the 1st amendment and will probably never change, and i like that.

The true problem is when so called non-profit organizations start intermingling with politics. As soon as a penny of their non-taxed, collected money starts lobbying for their favorite (probably catholic) politician then that is where the problem lies. But as far as in general, no I don't have a problem with tax-exempt churches because of the history with the positive outcomes of non-profit organizations.

Sit down with her and tell her you appreciate the sentiment, and that while it doesn't coincide with your view, you understand that it was a gift she got for you because she cares for you. While you are atheist, you understand that she loves and wants the best for you. You simply ask that she understand you are trying to find your own understanding and meaning in life, and maybe one day the two of you can have a discussion about religion as simply two adults with different views.

It's difficult to get new ideas across to the elderly some times. Especially when it comes to religion, those who were never raised to question it may be actually incapable of seeing the world any other way.  Remember that the more you have a thought the more it is reinforced in your brain as the neural pathways become stronger for that specific idea. Perhaps your grandma is 80? That would likely mean she has thought of and accepted this idea as truth for 80 years. That would be hard to ""undo."" however, she has likely had her own ideas and dreams which others disagreed with in her days; perhaps trying to relate to her in that regard may let her see that you are simply trying to find your own answers about the universe. Hopefully she can see the importance in that.

If she simply pushes bible quotes and the like at you, ask yourself this: do you still love your grandma? If so, just treat it as her being your crazy old grandma and enjoy everything else you do with her. She will likely not be around for too many more years, and you'll more likely remember fondly the good times you have.

If she still can't see past it, don't toss Dawkins or hitchens books at her (good choice of authors though), as she'll likely see it the same way you think about her sending you bibles. Treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.

I miss my grandma a lot.  Hell, my parents likely won't be around too much longer. I've had the same discussion with them, too. It is okay to teach about the bible, but it is not okay for them to teach the bible.

In this case, I don't care that they're Amish, if they don't want to make their child go through Chemo, then they shouldn't be forced too. I've had a family member go through it and it destroyed her. I wouldn't force that shit on my own child either, if said child did not want it. I'd look for other science-based treatments.

The Earth is most certainly not it and has gone through drastic changes  and causes countless species to go extinct.   The fact that we humans even exist in the manner that we do  with our behaviors often very damaging to environments  which comes back to haunt us  shows that we most certainly are cause disorder ourselves.
In a ""well-ordered"" system we wouldn't exist or at-least do these things.

Part 1

**Neither Veil nor Submission
Maryam Namazie**

The niqab (and burqa) must be banned to protect women’s rights and secularism – and not just out of concern for security. It’s a shroud, strait jacket, and mobile prison for women and girls who are bound and gagged and made invisible. According to Algerian writer Karima Bennoune, the veil represents ‘the ever-encroaching fabric erasure of women’s bodies.’

Calling it a ‘right’ and ‘choice’ is as formal as formal can be when it is often deemed compulsory and imposed and policed by Islamists – often using brute force. Also, let’s not forget, the veil is a tool like many others to control and restrict women and girls. To me, saying it is a right and choice is like saying FGM, the chastity belt, foot-binding, or Suttee are such.

A ban is not a violation of the right to religion. Whilst the right to religion and belief is absolute, the right to manifest and express one’s beliefs can be and is at times restricted for a number of reasons, including protecting public security, health, order, and the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.

Men in Shi’a Islam might have the ‘right’ and ‘choice’ to marry four permanent wives and unlimited temporary wives, for example, but it is nonetheless banned in many places because it is deemed to be exploitative. Uniforms are another way in which the right to dress is restricted in society for health reasons.

The European Court of Human Rights confirmed this when it ruled in favour of Turkey’s right to ban the veil at universities (now under question due to Erdogan’s efforts to Islamicise the country). If dress can be restricted to protect health or public safety, why not to protect women’s rights and secularism?

Moreover, rights often conflict with one another. What about the adverse impact of the niqab and burqa on the rights and choices of unveiled or differently veiled women? It is not as harmless as is often portrayed. In the Shabina Begum case, the House of Lords granted that restricting Shabina from wearing the jilbab to school was permissible in order to protect the rights of others who feared being coerced into veiling. As Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas says: “The ‘right’ to veil is always followed with the right to beat up women who do not.” Clearly, the right to veil has a corresponding right to unveil or not veil at all. The unveiled or improperly veiled woman is always held up adversely in comparison to the chaste, veiled woman.

Moreover, this is more than merely a question of ‘dress.’ It is important to remember that the niqab (as well as the burqa and the veil in general) is a highly contested political and social symbol. Many Muslims or those labelled as such are at the forefront of the fight against the burqa, niqab and veil – often at great risk to themselves.

In Iran, the slogan ‘neither veil nor submission’ has become a rallying cry in the ongoing fight between women and Islamic regime’s morality police. In another recent case in Sudan, Amira Osman Hamed who faces flogging for refusing to wear the hijab says: ‘I’m Sudanese. I’m Muslim, and I’m not going to cover my head.’In this day and age, the veil in general and the burka and niqab in particular are associated with Islamism’s efforts to limit rights and impose Sharia law. The enormous increase of veiled women and girls across the world and in Europe is a direct result of the rise of the contemporary Islamist movement and the ensuing pressure on women and girls to veil. Women are always the first targets of Islamism. And veiling restrictions on women is a particular signifier of things to come. The lawyer putting forth Turkey’s case for restricting the veil at universities said it well: ‘the hijab is not just a dress but a sign of political conviction; it shows near and present danger.’

A good case in point is Madani Free school in Derby where girls as young as 11 have to wear the burqa; all teachers, including non-Muslims, must wear the veil. Those who criticise the fuss over a ‘piece of clothing’ miss the point. The niqab and burqa are the most visible signs of Islamism’s war on women. It also represents sex apartheid and Sharia law and all that follows. In Madani School, burqa-clad girls must sit in the back of the classroom. On school trips, they must give way to boys and male teachers who cut in front of them in queues. Music is banned… (As an aside, child veiling is tantamount to child abuse. In the same way that children are not labelled Conservative or Marxist children because of their parents’ political beliefs, children should also be free of religious labels and faith schools until they are ready to make a choice of their own upon reaching 16.)

Calling for a ban on the niqab or burqa is not about criminalising Muslim women anymore than banning FGM criminalises girls and women who are mutilated. Whilst a ban won’t solve everything (there has yet to be a single prosecution with regards FGM) changes in the law, including bans, are important steps in changing culture and attitudes and defending rights.

Moreover, calling for a ban is not about cultural imperialism or colonialism. Islamist efforts in many places are forms of colonialism too. The burqa and niqab are not traditional forms of dress but newly imposed ones for a majority of contexts. Plus there are bans on the niqab or veil in a number of countries outside of Europe. This is not about East versus West. In Egypt, the Ministry of Health has prohibited the wearing of the niqab by nurses in hospitals. Egypt’s top Islamic school, al-Azhar, has issued a ban on wearing the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes. Al Azhar also obliges women to show their faces in court via a decree issued in 1880. In Iraq, the niqab has been banned by a fatwa. In Kuwait, women wearing the niqab have been banned from driving. In Azerbaijan and Tunisia, veils are banned from public buildings and schools. In Syria, until recently, teachers were banned from wearing the niqab…

Unfortunately, many secularists in Europe have shown a lack of clarity and moral courage when it comes to banning the burqa and niqab. Secularism is a human right (as philosopher AC Grayling says) and one that needs to be actively defended, promoted, and articulated; it is a fundamental precondition for women’s rights and equality.

Secularists have a responsibility to seize the initiative (particularly given the far-Right’s attempts at hijacking the issue to promote their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim bigotry). Calling for a ban is not in and of itself racist though racism and prejudice are very real and need to be opposed on par with sex discrimination.

A ban has nothing to do with a ‘clash of civilisations;’ it has everything to do with a global struggle between secularists, including many Muslims, on the one hand and theocrats and the religious-Right on the other.

A Manifesto against Totalitarianism which I signed in 2006 with 11 others including Salman Rushdie on the Danish cartoon controversy still applies today:

“We reject the ‘cultural relativism’ which implies an acceptance that men and women of Muslim culture are deprived of the right to equality, freedom and secularism in the name of the respect for certain cultures and traditions.

“We refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of ‘Islamophobia,’ a wretched concept that confuses criticism of Islam as a religion and stigmatisation of those who believe in it.”

And to that I must add the wretched concept that confuses a criticism of the niqab, burqa and veil as a stigmatisation of those who believe in it and wear it…

Just because he sees design in a complex universe doesn't mean design exists, that's his assumption. His use of a probability argument is also ridiculous creationist PRATT. Here's a part when I responded to a similar probability argument:

&gt;But this is all trivial, because this argument from likelihood is irrelevant. Let's use poker as an example. With 52 cards, there are 311,875,200 possible 5-card hands, so the probability of getting any one specific hand is 1/311,875,200 = 3.20641 x 10-9 . That probability is the same for a specific royal flush and for a specific hand full of nothing. Now, there are many more ways to get a hand full of nothing than there are to get a royal flush, so it is more probable to get a hand full of nothing than to get a royal flush.

&gt;Specifically, there are four ways to get a royal flush, so the probability of a royal flush (p) is 1.2825643 x 10-8 and the probability against (q) is 0.999999987. Very unlikely that you would deal a royal flush in one single hand. But get 10,000,000 poker players to deal 100 hands each for a total of one billion hands and the probabilities reverse themselves such that p becomes 0.9999973 (almost a dead certainty) while q becomes 2.6908776 x 10-6 (very unlikely).

&gt;Similarly with proteins, there would not be just one single trial, but rather a very large number of trials going on all around the single event you were dealing with.

&gt;But this begs another point: I've just been dealt a hand. What is the probability of my having been dealt that particular hand? 3.20641 x 10-9 ? No, the probability is 1.0, dead certainty. It is a fixed point in time; it has already happened. Nothing can possibly change the fact that that is the hand that I had just been dealt.

Oh, and Hugh Ross has bad credibility within the scientific community. He misunderstands basic concepts of thermodynamics, but that's the kind of thing that happens when you try to make the facts fit your preconceived notion of the nature of the universe. He's a hack.

2) doesn't really answer your question, he's talking about death, not evil. Technically the serpent tempting Adam would be evil, so ultimately he cannot use this argument as the origin of evil, because that would be God.

MartinTheRound,"1. When europeans came to the americas they encountered an entire continent full of people that didn't have the same spiritual connection. They had a different spiritual connection. Some people have a spiritual connection to nature and not gods. Some people have a connection to art that could be called spiritual. That only means that as social animals we have certain needs to feel connected to something. As for the probabilities, he simply doesn't understand what he's talking about. ......... But, when I see many religions each claiming to be the only answer and none of them providing anything better than ""I am right because I have a book that is right that says that the book is right"" what I conclude is that all of them are equally invented. If and when one of them can be verified externally I would reconsider, but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If someone told you ""yesterday I ate grapes"", you wouldn't find it difficult to believe, but if he continued with ""and then I went to the toilet and when I was done what I found out what came out was solid gold"", you would have a hard time to believe it. If someone said ""there was a guy who preached"" I find it easy to believe, and if he continues with ""they killed him and he came back to life"" I find it hard to believe. What would it take for your pastor to believe I excrete gold after eating grapes? If he believes it just based on my claim I have some more claims for him.

2. God could have given Adam a choice without giving him a choice to sin. God could have prevented Adam from sinning, like when he demanded the son's life but at the last moment he made it stop. But god didn't. .... But, wishing there was a nice little story doesn't mean there is one.

3. some of those letters are forgeries, many of the christian traditions were purposely thrown out because of an editing process well after jesus and every of his followers were dead. What about the council of nicea, why was there a council needed to establish what the truth is? What about Marceon, who made his own bible. What he should do is study the history of the bible from a historical point of view and **not** just choosing what he accepts based on what he already believes.

And I believe the bible says somewhere that some of the people around jesus would live to see the kingdom of god. Someone please help me with which passage that is. That verse alone proves that either the bible is wrong, jesus lied, we already live in this kingdom or we have some very old people running around. Which one is it?

We don't have any of the originals. We have copies of copies and translations of copies. No two copies are the same. They all have mistakes as they were copied by hand. The fact that the Dead Sea Scrolls match only means it is a copy of a copy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible

The Gospels were written decades after the events they describe, by unknown authors, none of whom ever actually met Jesus. They were not eyewitnesses. At best the Gospels are hearsay.

The idea that Adam and Eve had a choice is also misleading because they were completely ignorant of the concept of sin until they ate the apple. If someone tells you that you have a choice and then punishes you for not choosing the choice they had already chosen for you then it is not much of a choice. It's like a robber holding a gun to your head. You can choose to get shot by not cooperating but its not much of a choice.

This thing about taking something out of context. When God says it's ok to buy slaves from neighbouring nations, how is that taking it out of context? Some would say that being a slave is better than dying in the desert but there are many examples in the Old Testament where the Israelites killed other tribes and burnt their cities to the ground and took slaves for themselves. In one case, Moses gets angry because they took the women and children and cattle. He told them to kill the non-virgin women, male children and cattle but keep the young virgin girls for themselves. http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+31%3A1-18&amp;version=KJV This is the behaviour of warring tribes and the kind of morals they had.

The Q'uran, Buddhist scripture, Confusus texts, Pythagorean geometry textbook (or something like that) are among the most printed books too. The biblical text changes over time, the dead sea scroll was translated into latin then old English then modern English. In the process, many things were changed (I learnt this from history channel). Even when you grab 2 different language versions of the modern bible, they don't appear to say exactly the same. Cultural differences render meaning variation. That should help with the 99% identical bogus claim.   The second part about evidence of the existence of something prove the creator can be countered with any other diety or a flying spaghetti monster. Ask your friend if the bible (or himself) claims that the evidence of existence proves a god then what about the taoist text that claim Pangu or Vishnu's dream of the universe as the creator. There is an experiment where Lego blocks were put into a washing machine. After many cycles, blocks of certain size and connection were found to form more frequently than others. The formation of things in the universe is not about creating something meaningful but the formation of stable bodies.

Do you believe in God?

What religion?

Why that one, was your choice driven by your emotions (It just felt right, you've felt him in your heart etc)

Do you go to church? If so, how involved are you in it? (give offerings, deacon, pastor, etc)

What is your understanding of the fact of evolution? (If they say it's theory not fact, explain to them that evolution has been proved to the same degree that the earth being round has, and theory doesn't mean hypotheses)
If they say something factually incorrect, or ask you a question about evolution, answer them respectfully.

Now that I've filled you in on how evolution works, what do you think of it?

What drives you *away* from atheism?

Do you think that religion is needed to have morals?

If you want to, and if their minds are open enough, recommend them  (Or if you're generous enough, buy some copies to give) these books:

Richard Dawkins - The Greatest Show on Earth

Jerry A. Coyne - Why Evolution is True

Nunleft,"First off my I suggest having a look at several political leaning documentaries (Bowling for Columbine [Michael Moore], Expelled [Ben Stien] or Zeitgeist.) Analyze them carefully, look at how they craft a story, uses juxtaposition and highlights certain aspects. You may not agree with their message or think it is objectionable. But, take notes how they try to lead the discussion any sway viewers.

Secondly, What are you focusing on? The amount of topics covered by the topic ""religion"" is to many. Pick a focus and build a story. Hypothetically here is a documentary I would make:

Topic: Religion impacting Politics:

* Title sequence, display clips of politicians claiming religious views
* Interview a secularist
* give a history lesson on a religious swing (McCarthy)
* Show Religious activists in action (interview them at a rally if possible)
* Monolog on the harm religion has done, transition
* Interview several religious leaders on the role of religion. juxtapose with footage of right wing pastors
* Return to the first interview to give the secular person a response
* closing monolog with an appeal to secular values.
* credits

It is simple and shows why you believe religion is harmful, the questions you raise would be worded in a particular way. There would be someone leading the documentary and the discussion. I would edit it to have a grim feel to it, to try to convey how serious some of the people are.

Here are some aspects which you should be able to get a decent documentary out of:

* Women (Either in or outside the Church)
* Sex
* Multiculturalism (Both Ethnically and Religiously)
* Abortion
* Secularism/Dominion-ism
* Education (The battle over Good Science in schools)
* Religious Home Schooling
* Vaccination/Religious exemptions in medicine

Finally, Please do not do what ~~Ray Comfort~~ Most documentaries with political/social leanings do, edit interviews. Give full context, let people speak. Let them make their own points, instead of you twisting their words and changing their meaning.

I assume this statement meant that they had a policy of only allowing shared bedrooms to couples that are married.

I don't see anywhere stated in the article the the gay couple were in fact married, refer ""his civil partner"".

If instead of the gay couple, a straight man and a woman were turned away for not being married (only a civil union) , is it still a discrimination case?

Is it a discrimination case based on the fact they personally don't consider a civil union a marriage? (assuming the court didn't show that previously they had no issues with straight civil union couples).

While they do state that ""We’re just ordinary Christians who believe in the importance of marriage as the union of one man and one woman."" (which is a discriminatory statement)

Almost as strange as the bible.,null,1,cdpbjbo,1roasf,atheism,hot,39
AcademGreen,"AA has been ruled religious in two district courts.

It is based off of the Christian Oxford groups.

The big book is holy and treats agnostics as being in need of conversion to join the AA way.  Atheists are just called savage by the literature.

The preamble to each meeting says that AA believes only god can remove our desire to drink.  Each meeting ends with the Lord's Prayer.

Top it off with work that shows AA is as affective as doing nothing, and you end up with a pseudo-civil religious church.

I am forced to go to meetings for my first DUI.  The constant god thing gets on my nerves.  I don't pray or believe in the supernatural, so it feels like I am an outsider or not doing the program ""right"".  

Overall it is a cult with bad recovery rates that courts force people into.  The people may be nice sand helpful... but the program is 70 year old Christ-light dogma about identifying your sins and repenting.",null,0,cdpc2u1,1roasf,atheism,hot,30
xpass,"For me it was the only thing that actually worked. I'm an atheist, and I particularly like the later steps which no one really talks about, and they have to do with figuring out my own mistakes, making sure I don't make them again, and trying to mend my relationships with other people. 

All other treatments I tried left me with no clue what to do with myself after I stop drinking and blasting through drugs.

Another huge benefit is the abundance of meetings. I am all up for options, but I don't think I can find anything else with the sheer amount of support that AA gives me.

What would really make me happy is if there were other options for people. Seems everyone only bitches about AA and ""god"". That's easy enough.

wuollett,"From the Article cited by the article OP cited:  

&gt; Support from a husband or wife was important in sustaining the resolution. **(In reference to people that quit on their own)**
*Treatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction — Part III, The Harvard Mental Health Letter, Volume 12, Number 4, October 1995, page 3. 
(See Aug. (Part I), Sept. (Part II), Oct. 1995 (Part III).)*
So much for the sayings that ""Everybody needs a support group"" and ""Nobody can do it alone"". Most successful people do. 

**(This is a contradictory statement, having the support of a husband or wife isn't ""doing it alone"")**  


&gt; Nothing could be further from the truth. Even the most ardent true believers who will be honest about it recognize that A.A. and N.A. have at least 90% failure rates. And the real numbers are more like 95% or 98% or 100% failure rates. It depends on who is doing the counting, how they are counting, and what they are counting or measuring.

In 2001-2002 a different study the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) conducted the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC). found data from a survey of 43093 people where 1441 responded that they had been in an AA-type meeting, a 35.2% continuance rate was shown after 1 year of AA. *(Cited from Wikipedia as:  L. A. Kaskutas, Y. Ye, T. K. Greenfield, J. Witbrodt &amp; J. Bond (2008). ""Epidemiology or Alcoholics Anonymous Participation."" Recent Developments in Alcoholism, Vol 18: Research on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery. 261-282)* 
 
From the article itself:

&gt;I believe that whatever successes AA can claim are due the the dedication and tireless efforts of the volunteer sponsors. That is a life-affirming, positive way to help someone in the grips of alcohol or drugs. 

So the article OP linked cites an article that states a support group doesn't work, but in the article itself it clearly states that the sponsor system, which is a form of support group, is a good way to help. And with a group like AA to bring them all together, how would addicts find these sponsors?

Furthermore, studies have proven that more studies are needed to properly determine the effectiveness of AA. *(Cited from Wikpedia as:  Ferri M, Amato L, Davoli M. Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes for alcohol dependence. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3)*

Both articles make the statement that Christians elements in AA make the program have a negative effect by citing data that doesn't really study the actually effectiveness of AA. Nothing is said in regards to time it takes for spontaneous remission to occur, and at that point the effects of constant alcoholism may be much more pronounced.

What needs to happen is a long study that shows the effectiveness of AA versus non-treatment and alcohol addiction specialty centers, and the differences in health between the three groups, as well as the amount of people who stay completely and utterly sober (as opposed to 1 or 2 beers every now and then and being considered ""not an alcoholic anymore""), whether the alcoholism had any pronounced medical or personal effects and the amount of time between when they started drinking and when they stopped and if AA was more effective in reducing this time. 

If you can provide data showing that people who were turned away by the God aspect of AA quit completely by themselves in the same or less amount of time those that stayed in AA did, and stayed sober longer, I will believe that AA has a negative effect, but until you can produce this data, I highly recommend not citing inconclusive sources, since all of this is really not comprehensive enough to make the statement that the God aspect of AA makes it negatively effective.

Small group sessions and counselor sessions helped as did a ton of free time for me to write and do self-reflection.

I do agree that religious indoctrination of those who have an inclination towards the one side is wrong, as is any other outside pressure on the development of the Self, but if I really wanted to, I am sure I could be attracted to a man. 

Would have to be the perfect man, but still, it is possible. This thinking in black or white is hurtful to those who discover they are Bi after first choosing one orientation over the other. Practically Everyone is Bi, but you would obviously choose to associate closer to the side where you are more likely to find a mate. Thus, I consider myself straight.

Then on the other hand, if someone is 40% straight and 60% gay, then social stigma would probably force him or her to align with Heterosexuality. Easier that way, as long as they dont actually fall in love, and have it reciprocated by a member of the same sex. This is also wrong. 

IMHO

Hetero: 100% Hetero to 75% Hetero

Gay: 100% Gay to 75% Gay

Bi: 75% Gay to 75% Hetero

And what the fuck does it matter anyway? That is noones business, unless they are in love with someone with a definite different sexual orientation. If they are, well that sucks. I am not attracted to very fat people, idiots or boring people either. 

In short. the whole gay-straight discussion is pointless and hurtful to everyone involved.

if you are 60% gay, then obviously it is a choice. just ignore whatever lust you feel for the same sex, and live on 40% of your sexuality. If you do, however, then you are a chicken and not living your life in full. I would feel sorry for such a person.",null,1,cdphog6,1robbw,atheism,hot,3

BuccaneerRex,"Your first problem is this:

&gt;As atheists, we can proudly say that we have questioned the existence of God and certainly religion itself. We have used our critical thinking skills and curiosity to look beyond what others have told us.

This is not the case for everyone. Some people never accepted the existence of a deity in the first place, therefore have nothing to question. Some of us have never been a member of a religion. And as annoying as it is, some people are atheists merely because nobody ever taught them religion; they never reasoned their way into or out of anything.

You do not require a deity to have a religion, this is true. But your definition of religion is more of a definition of Abrahamic religion, not all possible religions. Not all religions include afterlives. Not all have a central text. Not all believe their deity is the creator. They do all generally include moral prescripts, so that's one. Not all include eternal punishments of the ones that do include afterlives. And some do not believe that any deities intervene.

It's a good start, and defining terms should really be the first effort of any intellectual activity.

But religion is an extremely broad catch-all term, and you can't really define all possible members of the category in five bullet points.",null,0,cdp9sre,1roh7u,atheism,hot,6

Everything In the universe pretty much works the same way. 

If it can persist and we can observe it then it is energetically favorable that it exists for the moment. That goes for a neutrino to a religious text. If you think of the existence of a droplet of water in the same context as a discussion in a church about the bible, then ones model for the universe encompasses belief systems (We all have them even if we are atheist). 

However we are terrible observers, we are trapped in a snapshot of time and space and our perceptions are geared to survival in the context of our genetic code.

we get pissed when you pretend to know who the deity hates. Then we start demanding you give us his phone number so we can check for ourselves.

also people are in a bad habit of doing what you just did.. not chastising because it is human nature people dont think of it this way. But especially for some atheists when you say 

&gt;Belief that a deity may or may not exist

we are going to say, well that is all and good, but you have to remember then, that there is an infinite number of things that might be, picking a deity makes no more sense than all the other things.

If someone demands that their is no way you can prove there is or isnt a deity, so i should be open to that. Then i demand you be open to the idea that, that deity is the spaghetti monster, or you have to be open to teh idea that all of life is just a hologram on a surface(and some science thinks that).

For me it is just spin, religion loves to live in the infinite unknown, no matter how much the ""known"" grows that infinite unknown is sanctuary for them. Your talking about agnostics but religions do it all the time with more specific claims. It was initially religion that rejected the idea of an earth going around the sun.. when they were proven wrong, they just move to other unknowns and say ""therefore god"".. well when it is unknown it can be ""therefore anything possible and even things we dont know if they are possible"" 

so when you say there may be or may not be a god, i say there may be or may not be an advanced civilization that made a computer and we think we are alive. its meaningless conjecture and really serves little purpose outside of philosophy. nothing in the info about it might or might not exist can tell you anything about your life, how you should live it or anything at all.

Keep in mind that in a lot of ways- if they do have trouble with the idea of you going somewhere else for worship time, it is because they are probably feeling dejected- church is what they used for a sense of connection with you and others around them. the social bonds that can be created in church are not to be scoffed at.

First you tell her the story we all know of Santa, a nice bearded jolly man who brings gifts to children in the Christmas for being nice. you tell her how Santa keeps tally of children's behavior and tell her how he always sees everything, even when the kid thinks she is alone. Tell her how Santa will judge her and if she does not meet his standards of a perfect obedient child Santa will leave her without gifts, or even worse gives something awful for her just to rub it in.

Now that she is all shocked to hear this and reflects on her behavior, you tell her ""and this is what many children believe because their parents told them this lie without any regard on how it would feel to the person who is being lied to"" and then you say ""but it is not true, Santa is not really judging you, Santa does not see everything, because there is no Santa. Santa is a lie everyone has agreed upon to tell to the children who still are not in on the joke to control them better and to make them feel like there's something magical about being obedient and good **because** they do not trust their children to know right from wrong, and to be able to reflect their own actions without such threats""

The historical Jesus of Nazareth was an [apocalyptic Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature) preacher who was charismatic enough to gain a bit of a following. I believe he may have thought of himself as a [Jewish messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_messianism) of sorts, and that he would raise an army of his fellow Jews to fight and defeat the Roman occupiers, thus establishing God's kingdom in Judea. After entering Jerusalem and attempting to provoke the authorities, however, he was arrested for claiming to be the King of the Jews. This was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of Caesar and was a crime punishable by death. As a result, he was crucified by the Romans.

As for the mythical Jesus Christ, we can't really say what, if anything, written in the New Testament is true. The earliest books in that canon are those of Paul, who never personally knew Jesus. The earliest gospel is Mark, written sometime after 72 c.e. by someone who could not have known Jesus. Consider also that the writings of the New Testament have been changed and edited countless times since they were written and that none of the original copies exist. The bottom line here is that we simply do not know what this character named Jesus actually said or taught, other than that it was probably apocalyptic in nature.

If you consider his teachings to be socialistic in nature, as the teachings in Matthew suggest, then they are really no different than those of most other ""great teachers"" throughout history.

The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence.

You see, everything we know, everything we can determine about anything, it's all based on *evidence.* Empirical, repeatable, testable *evidence.*

That's part of rational, skeptical, and critical thinking.

Many (though not all) atheists have come to the conclusion of atheism due to this rational, skeptical, logical, and critical thinking.

Quite simply, there is absolutely no evidence anywhere, whatsoever, at all, for deities of any kind.

Thus, there is no reason to suppose such things exist.

You are, no doubt, no different in most areas of your life. I suspect you don't believe in leprachauns. Or fairies or unicorns. Because we know there's no evidence at all that such things exist. We also know a lot of where, how, and why these stories were made up.

If you ask me why I reject the god of the bible (which I assume the title of Christianity means that specific god) I would first ask you why you reject Allah, or Vishnu, or Xenu, or Zues. Because if your answer has anything to do with faith, let me tell you something, there are people out there who have the exact same amount of faith and certainty that you do, in fact some of them even more, that believe that one of these gods are real. So now the question becomes how do you determine which is true. Because that is what would matter, if it mattered at all. I mean if the bible is wrong and Islam was true, then you could see where calling yourself a Christian could become a problem for you.

Think about the radical muslims who engage in acts of terror. How much faith do you have to have in order to strap a bomb to your chest and detonate it? I bet you that guy is pretty damn convinced that his religion is true. And if it is true, and yours is wrong, once again, you can see where you might end up running into a problem somewhere. 

You see the thing that you don't understand is that you are actually an atheist as well. You do not believe in Allah, you do not believe in Zues, you do not believe in Vishnu. I'm betting you know pretty much next to nothing about hinduism, yet you instantly reject it without knowing a single thing about it. Back in the Roman times the christians were the athiests as they were denying the deistic claims of the emperor. All Christians are actually atheists as they deny many many deistic claims, often without ever considering them. There is only one difference between you and me, and that is I deny  one more god then you do. 

By the way nondenominational, many Christians would view you no better then an atheist as they would believe you to have just another one of the wrong religions. Some Christians take those denominations very seriously to the point that they view everyone who doesn't agree with them as heritics (see baptists and catholics) 

and going back to your point about seeing no problem with science, that doesn't actually tell me anything. I know another christian that tells me that same thing, yet he also believes in a literal 6 day creation along with the idea that Noah's flood actually happened, and all of the other supernatural events of the bible actually happened. So, I'm going to need a little more than that. 

So I'd like to know your position first, in order to properly explain my position, as I cannot explain something if I don't know what you actually know yet. You are coming in with some very clear and obvious misconceptions and I need to know what those are before we end up having a big misunderstanding about what we actually think. A nondenominational christian who sees no problem with science really doesn't tell me that much about what you actually think or why you think it. And I need to know that. I need to know what your methods are for determining truth and whether or not you care if what you believe is true

I was hanging out at Starbucks last week having my morning coffee when this guy comes up to me, 30ish, kinda hippy looking but a pleasant enough guy.
Hi, my name’s Larry, I’m the son of God and I perform miracles” he says.
“Really? When and where did this happen” I asked.
“About 70 years ago in a town you probably never heard of”, Larry says.
“What did you do?” I ask, warming to his story.
“You know, walk on water, make the blind to see, rise from the dead, that sort of thing.” he tells me.
“That’s a pretty big claim Larry. Got any evidence, any proof that this happened”? I asked.
“Of course, I wouldn’t make such a claim without proof. Look some of my buddies wrote down last week.” he says.
“Last week?  Why didn’t they write it down when it happened?” I ask.
“Ah, none of them could write and, you know, one thing leads to another, you get busy and before you know it, seventy years have gone by” Larry says with a shrug.
“Hmm, okay, let’s see it”.
“Here, see, four of my buds describe it all right here, a whole BUNCH of miracles”, he says handing me a stack of papers.
 “This isn’t evidence Larry, this is just CLAIMS that something happened. “ I point out.
“Look, five hundred people saw it! ” Larry says.
“No, Larry, one of your friends SAYS five hundred people saw it. That isn’t the same as five hundred people actually seeing it”.
OH…..oh, I know where you’re going wrong.” Larry tells me. “You have to KNOW it’s true before you’ll know it’s true. It also works if you feeeeel it’s true”. He tells me.
“Larry, that's NOT evidence.” I say, making sure Larry’s not between me and the door.
The conversation ends when Larry tells me that the problem is that I’ve “Hardened my heart against him.” and as I walk out the door Larry asks in a loud voice “And, why do you hate my Dad?”

In the same vein, would you say that children who believe Santa brings gifts and children who believe their eyes when they see the gifts bought, wrapped and placed by their parents, are the same kind of belief?

As was pointed out, you also reject many gods you know about and countless gods you have never heard of.

As for christianity, christianity came from judaism, jesus promised a kingdom of god on earth and bodily resurrection but people seem to believe these days about heaven which jesus never mentioned, it was also promised to come around his time, and it's quite overdue. Judaism has evolved from polytheism by first elevating one of the god of their pantheon to a major position, then to the exclusive position, look at the language of the first commandment, or better yet, study the history of the jewish bible (old testament). And Santa Claus (reindeer, tree, gifts) is made up too, I assume you don't need my reasoning for that.

As you can see, it's not much of a choice not to believe in Santa when you saw the gifts tucked away a month before Christmas year after year. The same way it's not much of a choice not to believe in gods when you know how these belief systems evolve (cultural anthropology) and how they affect people (psychology) and how they're exploited (just look around).

I'd evaluate the claim that gods exist the same way one evaluates the claim Higgs particle exists, or cosmic inflation happened in the early history of the universe, or supersymmetry exists or luminiferous aether exists or that a china teapot currently orbits the sun in a long and elliptical orbit. Those hypothesis are respectively - solidly proven, possible and indicated by evidence but unproven, possible but unproven and under increasing tension with the evidence, solidly rejected and finally worse than wrong, ie unscientific for not offering no empirical tests.

Aberu,"I will spare the common answer to this, which isn't the answer you are seeking. The whole ""we didn't choose atheism"" kind of thing.

To answer the question, how did I become an atheist (which is the implication of your question), it was because I wanted to rationalize the things I believed. I was raised Southern Baptist. Moved around to many non-denominational churches, seeking answers for conflicts that I saw in each branch that I had arrived at previously. I converted Mormon since a good friend of mine was Mormon and opened me up to listening to the missionaries. They had answers for why the bible seemed conflicting, edited for power and profit grabs, etc... Then the next logical step was to question the Mormon church (after being baptised for some reason, my skepticism wasn't honed fully yet). 

I found it difficult to question the Mormon church without every source being tainted by Christian apologist writers and their criticisms, or Mormon apologists and their responsese of those criticisms. I couldn't find a verifiable independent source. I don't remember what I found since it's been about 9 years, but I found a pretty independent source and it opened me up to thinking very critically about what I believed. I used to wear a religion like a badge amongst many badges on my vest, and I never felt like it was the most important thing to know anything about. Just one of many things I felt I was expected to have an opinion on and expected to have a belief in something. And I thought it was a given to believe in God but I always assumed everyone else believed in God in some form or another.

After questioning Mormonism I approached a kind of Deism, and was firmly opposed to religious institution. I had a deist friend bridge that gap comfortably for me, in the same circle of friends as the Mormon friend. Then I discussed my ideas with a coworker who I respected greatly, a british born, Californian punk rock bassist who was there washing dishes with me at the pizza place as a fellow delivery driver. He got me to the point to ask myself ""How do I know what I think I know?"". In other words he was requiring me to rationally justify the existence of a deistic god to him through logic. I couldn't, and I started sliding slowly into becoming an Atheist over the next year. First time I admitted I was an atheist was after hearing a debate that Christopher Hitchens did (I don't remember who it was against, it was a while ago) and he just made very good arguments to embrace what I had already been feeling, that I was an atheist. He was a brave voice that made me much more comfortable with being outspoken about it, and outspoken publically against irrational beliefs. That was my introduction to me ""enlightenment"" (I don't like calling it this, but I don't know a bettter word).

You likely already do this for a great many things: you care that the medicine you take is effective and has been tested to meet standards, you care that in a car accident your seat belt and other safety devices will function. You likely have an interest in the fact that if you use a map to drive somewhere, the places on the map actually exist when you arrive.

As a skeptic, I try to *consciously* be aware of my beliefs and whether I have good reasons for having them. If I discover I believe something without good reasons, I'll be honest and say ""I'm not confident enough to be reasonably sure."" You see good scientists do this all the time: if you ask them a tough question that's even slightly outside their area of expertise, they are very careful and admit that someone else would likely have better answers.

gidikh,"Mine started with the 10 commandments.  The one thing in the bible that god supposedly wrote himself.  He starts off by saying ""...for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me...""  then proceeds to wrap up the commandments by telling us not to be jealous/envious of our neighbors.


The first thing that struck me was that this supposedly perfect being gets jealous?  I don't get jealous beyond thinking someone is a d-bag for hitting on my wife in front of me.  But this all powerful, all benevolent god gets jealous enough that he punishes children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren if someone doesn't love him?

I then proceeded to start reading the bible objectively and wow, the god of the old testament is such a dick.  Even if you skip all the parts where god is helping his chosen people (btw choosing a small tribe of illiterate nomads out of the entire world as your favorite seems a little weird to me, but whatever floods your planet) kill, rape, and pillage their neighbors, you still have stories of god screwing people over for no other reason that to prove how 'great' he is.  Read exodus, pharaoh is ready to give up and let everyone go, but god hardens pharaoh's heart just so god can unless his plagues and get the credit for freeing the slaves.  Those plagues, by the way, include slaughtering the first born of each family (include babies), unless of course you painted your door with lambs blood, because god apparently couldn't tell the difference between his people and the egyptians.  This is just one example of many.

Then we move into the new testament and suddenly god isn't as much as a dick any more.  If god is perfect, why would he have a mid-eternity crisis and suddenly become the cool dad?  Jesus shows up and has some pretty good things to say, but then they have to throw in some pretty pathetic 'miracles'.   Your average doctor has cured more diseases and saved more lives by several orders of magnitude greater than jesus did.  My favorite was using his omnipotent powers to save a run to the liquor store during a wedding.

So after being thoroughly disenfranchised, I started looking at some of the other major religions, and found flaws with those as well.  I then came to the realization that if there was an all powerful deity that cared whether or not we knew of it and worshiped it, there wouldn't be any sort of doubt.  It could easily come up with a way to get all it's laws and such distributed to it's creations that doesn't include having a bunch of illiterate desert dwellers witness something that takes them several decades before they find someone to actually write it down.

This lead me to the conclusion that if there is a super powerful intelligent being that created everything, it doesn't care about us. Or much more likely, we are just a random fluke of natural processes.

When you examine evidence, you are getting reality's statement of what it does in a certain situation. When you use something else besides evidence, you find that reality doesn't give one pitiless shit what you thought, wanted, wished, or preferred to have happened instead. Science is the method of systematically constructing questions to ask of reality, and applying a methodology which forces reality to answer.

Deductive logic starts from a few assumptions (for example, we assume that inference works, that modus ponens holds etc., and there are other axioms that can be adopted for various purposes), and then under those assumptions we can prove things with certainty. The weakness of this system is that it relies on our rejection of absurdity. Our axioms are considered strongest when the negation is most absurd.

Scientific reasoning is a bit different, in scientific reasoning we come up with the simplest possible explanation, then expand the field of testing as widely as possible. In science, we accept things tentatively, and do our best to get them thrown out. Each real test a theory passes strengthens it. But again, this is based on the rejection of absurdity, and also on a more practical usability.

When it comes down to it, the only two modes of reasoning that I've seen make any sense rely on rejecting absurdity.

titscum,"&gt;I considered one of the alternatives to be divine revelation or inspiration, and am discounting it as useless because it's not testable/verifiable and indistinguishable from insanity or deception.

Interestingly, though, no epistemic system could ever escape from insanity or deception. The fundamental problem many people on this subreddit seem to ignore when they profess themselves radical followers of scientific realism, is that you have to assume as axiomatic the (at least partial) reliability of your own senses as well as the method of verification you derived from them. Since sensory input is the only source of human knowledge, it must also be the foundation of our techniques of natural deduction and verification. Therefore, no proof of soundness or completeness could ever be given with regard to the senses; our very source of knowledge is inherently unreliable, and any workaround to that fact (e.g. Kant's ""a priori"" knowledge, instrumentalism, pragmatism, structuralism, etc...) can only attempt to convince you through examples of its practical success, not some sort of formal irrefutable proof.

Its about the phenomena of people who are deeply involved in some social role who then leave that role and their lives after they've left are mainly defined by the fact that they are an ex. The ex itself becomes a social role. The author herself is an ex-nun and has a strong identity as an ex-nun and argues that the deeper the role, the deeper their identity as an ex will be after they've left that role.

I think this is similar to the fact that the more religious a person's upbringing, the more they have to rebel against and the more they define themselves as members of an atheist sub-culture.

That's it. That's it about our ""beliefs"". 

As for your question, I will answer not as an atheist, since the question has nothing to do with my nonbelief in god(s), but as someone with a little bit of knowledge about science.

A theory, in science, means that the idea has a LOT of evidence, and NO evidence that contradicts it. A hypothesis is an idea that does NOT have a lot of evidence for it. If evidence is gathered for the hypothesis, it eventually becomes a theory, if all evidence shows it to be correct. However, people usually use the word ""theory"" to mean ""any old guess or idea that explains something"". As you can see, the word ""theory"" means two different things.

Therefore, it is unfair to use the word ""theory"" in one sentence, with two separate meanings. ""Theory"" for scientists is NOT the same as ""theory"" in the common vernacular. The Flying Spaghetti Monster is NOT a scientific theory. At best, it's an unproven hypothesis. Just like any other religion. 

If scientists and mathematicians are looking for a grand unified theory, it means that they have some reason(evidence) to believe that it MIGHT exist. And to determine whether it really exists or not, they are doing experiments and such, looking for evidence.

Comparing scientists who are experimenting and figuring out how reality works and trying to determine the truth of whether a certain concept exists or not, is NOT the same as believing an idea with absolutely zero evidence that it's true. 

So, no, believing that a unified field theory may exist and looking for it,  is NOT the same as believing in a supernatural being.",null,0,cdpq05e,1rq2pi,atheism,hot,3

Zamboniman,"&gt;There are many theories

No, wrong use of this word.

There is the theory of gravity. This theory (as the word means) encompasses our understanding, facts, knowledge, and ideas about gravity.

This theory provides us with an absolutely amazing and incredible amount of knowledge. For example, we can slingshot spacecraft around the planets and moons like a mad cosmic pinball machine, and get where we plan to go with a very small margin of error. We can put satellites where we need them. We can land probes on other planets. And on and on.

Of course, like with many things, there's a lot to learn. We don't have enough knowledge yet to really understand details for the question, ""Why gravity?""

Obviously making wild assumptions without evidence is pointless. That way leads to horrendous and useless results.


This does not in any way impact or cause errors in our detailed knowledge about its effects.

B) Only cause tension in your relationship
C) Further you away from accepting any sort of religion

Smart theists should know their is a time and place to try to ""convert people"" , not just whenever. This subreddit often complains about religious people 'forcing their values' onto others and trying to cram religion down other peoples throats, and now you are complaining that your friends are not doing that?

Or perhaps they know they are unequipped to try to persuade you

JimDixon,"I suppose a lot of ""religious"" people don't really believe the dogma so much as they want to simply go through the motions enough to avoid being criticized. If you challenge them, they might argue with you, but otherwise, they never think about it.

I say, let sleeping dogs lie. If they're not causing you any trouble, leave them alone. If you don't leave them alone, they might start causing trouble. ",null,0,cdpve3j,1rqk47,atheism,hot,1

tomatojam,"At the Catholic funerals I've attended, when the sacraments are brought up several important/sentimental items of the deceased are also brought up and laid by the casket.  For instance, my grandfather had this beautiful hand carved cane that was brought up with the sacraments. Does your family's church do this? If so, maybe you can switch with someone to bring up a non-sacrament. If not, maybe they'll like the idea.

I always thought this was nice because it brings the mass back to the person for whom the mass is being said.

Brokenshatner,"As several others have said, funerals aren't really the place to pick bones with family. 

I say, explain to the priest where you stand, if you feel it's that important. Otherwise, just ask him specifically what's expected of you, then show up on time and perform. 

Have you ever been in a wedding held in a church? This is no different. Sure, you're there to console a grieving widow, rather than fulfill the whims of a bride, but essentially, it's the same. Ask the priest where you should stand, what you should wear, and if you have any lines when you hand off the bread and grapejuice. Even if your only line is ""Amen,"" stand and deliver.

The thought you're giving this shows that you're a person of conviction, even if faith isn't really your thing. If putting on this kind of act is more theatre than you care to engage in, just let the priest know, and I'm sure they can find somebody else. If you feel that doing so could alienate family though, well, if that's priority one, you'll just have to bite the bullet I'm afraid. 

Good luck though, either way!

rabit1,"Don't worry, reasonable minds will eventually make the connection that there is no connection with reality.

Most likely outcome, the already religious become more religious after the film, but the rest will probably lean more toward atheism after the film.

Zimmer602,"It's always weird seeing how religious parents raise their children and the dynamics involved, weird in the sense of I don't exactly know how I should feel about it.  

I can agree that the parent, as in this situation, is making an honorable decision that the child drew the picture. However, I still judge that parent for not accepting the same bullshit they feed their children.  

Sometimes I wonder how anyone will know if Jesus actually comes back again as some claim. I've seen a lot of dudes who look like Jesus and I've seen a lot of media on guys who claim to be Jesus while also looking like Jesus. The way God wants to test Christians faith, that bum on the street claiming to be Jesus seems to correlate well of how it would actually happen. I start to get really deep in thought about all of this and then I remember it's all a hoax and go fap.",null,0,cdpzdxu,1rqn1l,atheism,hot,3
