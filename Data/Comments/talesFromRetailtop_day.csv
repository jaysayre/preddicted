morgueanna,"I had this happen all the time.

One, I worked at Goth store in the mall, so most of our clientele were young people who weren't that good at keeping track of where they bought stuff (if they bought it themselves, sometimes Mom did and told them the wrong store).

Two, the reputation that Goth store had in the 90's and 00's for appealing to drug oriented youth seems to be well earned, if my customers were any indication.

Three, people seem to think that Goth store and That Store That Sells Knockoff Crap Jewelry and Dildos To Frat Boys are the same store. Even though Goth store had a policy of no drug or alcohol references. I had people bring in body jewelry with pot leaf designs, beer logo tee shirts, all sorts of crazy stuff and swear up and down that it was from my store.

Best story: My district manager was helping me with some paperwork at the desk. This kid comes up to the desk with a band tee shirt that had, guess what, a pot leaf in the design. I politely explained to them that we didn't carry that particular shirt and told them to check out Crappy Frat Party Store instead. The kid started losing his mind, cursing, screaming, waving his finger in my face.

I actually didn't mind. My family did the big dinner the night before, and Thanksgiving isn't nuts up here. Besides, holiday pay does not suck.

However, our store (despite being purely Canadian) is having a Black Friday sale, and I'm working that evening. Oh, and no holiday pay for that...

There's always those customers who I'll have great conversations with and they're laughing and loving being here and then they invite me to go to church with them. I don't have a problem with church, I go with my devote Christian mother whenever I visit, but I have no interest in religion. I go because it makes her happy and I love spending time with my family. 

So they invite me to church and I'll try and brush it off with ""Maybe, yeah. I might make it out there."" Some people drop it there, but about half keep pushing. They then ask me where I go to church and then keep pressuring me to come to church with them. They'll offer to pick me up from my house and I can come over and they make me lunch and all sorts of things. It usually devolves into a really awkward conversation at this point so I usually just tell them I have to work every Sunday and most of them understand and leave it alone.

While the evidence does show that most of our Founding Fathers were Christian, not all of them were (source:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States#Religion).  Not once in the Declaration of Independence does it mention religion nor Christianity.  In the actual Constitution of the United States, not once is Christianity mentioned, but also religion is only mentioned in Article 6, paragraph 3.  Later in the Bill of Rights, Christianity isn't mentioned and religion is only mentioned once, and that is in Amendment 1.

Tell him you are quite capable of handling the intrusion yourself, so he doesn't need to be involved in a conflict that he wants no part of. Assure him that you are looking out for both him and the store. He wouldn't want his business to suffer because of an employee's private affairs, and he shouldn't let his own get in the way, either.

So last year, I went to 5 grocery stores and everyone was out. At my favorite store, I did ask the produce guy if they had any ""in the back"" and to his credit, he told me they had them first thing in the morning, but they were long gone.

Last night I stopped at a small local grocer, and they not only had a giant bin of loose ones, they had the stalks. There were stalks piled up with the rest of the vegetables, there were stalks on a special 6' shelving unit by the front door, and there were stalks on another unit at the end of the aisle. 

When I was checking out, I thanked the cashier for thinking ahead and stocking so much. She looked at me like I was crazy.  From now on, I'm just paying for my sprouts and leaving.

mrshosey,I love that you made commission on the ruined mattresses. Icing on the cake,null,1,cdn6nob,1rg853,talesFromRetail,top_day,8
jay_sin,"For a point of reference. Its NOT illegal to sell a preowned mattress in NC. Look it up. However it must be state regulated. They have specific guidelines of what must happen and how it must be sanitized before it can be resold, and not following those steps would be illegal. But reselling a mattress that has gone through state regulated and inspected sanitation processing is NOT illegal, it just adds more cost and time to the process so most companies don't choose to do it.

Just some perspective. ",null,1,cdndsih,1rg853,talesFromRetail,top_day,6

mrussell48,"&gt;I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Even if he wanted to stand up for you it was in his and your best interest not to. 

First he has to live with her so even if she is wrong... she is right.

Second if he did defend you then by the time the ride home was over his pregnant wife would have had it in her head that you were his mistress and he has been sleeping with you for weeks since she is fat bloated and carrying his unborn demand spawn child.
