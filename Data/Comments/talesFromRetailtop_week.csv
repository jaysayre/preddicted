My manager listened to her tell him how amazing of a salesperson I was and that she wanted to tip me. My manager then informed her that, I was correct, it is against policy for me to accept any of it, and if I found it, I'd be expected to turn it in.

Get9,"During the weekend freshmen were to move into my university, they were looking for people to help move boxes, furniture, etc. This paid a slight amount through the work study program budget.

A van full of stuff in the back and on the roof pulled up across the street and I walked across with a dolly to help. A guy got out of the vehicle with his wife and daughter. This must've been the most stuff I saw all day. A lot of the time, I'll hear people say, ""What, are you taking your entire room with you to college!?"" Well, this time it *definitely* applied: large television, a slightly-smaller-than-usual couch, another desk, and a ton of large, plastic containers full of who-knows-what. 

This particular girl took about half an hour to get her stuff from outside to her room, and it was a lot of work. The dad tried to tip me $20, and I refused it (if we were caught taking money, we weren't allowed to do it anymore). He asked again and I said I really couldn't. 

Then, he asked, ""Well, what if I commanded you take my money?"" I just gave a slight nod of ""I guess."" So he proceeded to yell, ""Look! I work hard for my money and so did you! Take this tip NOW!""

I was visiting Australia, and we went to a wildlife park thing, and they had a big fenced area where you could walk around with the roos, and feed them if you bought a bag of food. So of course, I bought a bag, a small brown paper bag, like a lunch sack size.

So I'm feeding these kangaroos, and there's a bigger one and smaller one. So I feel bad for the smaller one and turn towards him, and I'm just in cuteness overload because he grabbed my hand with both his little paws, and while I'm distracted with him, the bigger one comes over and takes the bag right out of my other hand and starts chowing down. The photo my friend snapped at that moment was absolutely priceless.

Metalhead2881,"I got mugged by a pair of kangaroos once.

I was visiting Australia, and we went to a wildlife park thing, and they had a big fenced area where you could walk around with the roos, and feed them if you bought a bag of food. So of course, I bought a bag, a small brown paper bag, like a lunch sack size.

So I'm feeding these kangaroos, and there's a bigger one and smaller one. So I feel bad for the smaller one and turn towards him, and I'm just in cuteness overload because he grabbed my hand with both his little paws, and while I'm distracted with him, the bigger one comes over and takes the bag right out of my other hand and starts chowing down. The photo my friend snapped at that moment was absolutely priceless.

superspeck,"Heh. Actually, that reminds me of a time when I *did* school a cashier. I wasn't trying to get a discount or anything, he was just having a problem with a POS system at a place that I'd worked at while in high school. It was a regional camera store and is now national. This is about ten years ago, several years after I'd stopped working for them. 

I was buying up their stock of a slide film that had been discontinued. He was having a problem getting the machine to ring it up, because when looking up by the UPC barcode, the POS insisted that the product had been discontinued... yet it was obviously sitting right there on the counter, which meant it was probably in inventory, but under the retailer part number and not the UPC. I told him to hit the key that escaped to the manager menu, and walked him through looking it up by name. When it worked, he said that he had to go get his manager to make sure he'd done it correctly. Fine, I'll wait. 

Fatty McManager came stomping out of the back room with each step shaking the carefully plan-o-grammed displays and a cloud of steam coming from each ear. He asked me who the heck I was to tell his employee how to access HIS manager menu, and what was I trying to pull with having his employee ring up stuff that wasn't in inventory, and how the heck did I know anything about their system. I just said ""Yeah, I used to work at (low numbered store) back when the POS system was released, and y'all probably do it differently these days, but we had to use those menus because things were pretty broken when they were first installed."" That didn't appease Fatty McManager, though -- he said it was VERY irregular, and pompously declared that I should give him my associate number if I was indeed an employee. 

This company's POS system assigned a number to each associate for life. They were sequential, so you could tell when someone had been hired by how low their associate number was. 

I gave it to him, told him ""You can look me up in the computer (F8, menu 41), here's my driver's license. Address is obviously different but the name's the same, and so's the cell phone number. Oh, and what's your associate number?"" His was well up past a quarter million. I asked him if a particular district manager still worked for the company, and confided that his associate number was in the double digits. 

I got my film, and after Mr. McManager deflated, he actually gave me the employee discount, even though I didn't ask for it.

devoidz,"In my store the managers have said that corporate wants us to use only self check outs at night. Funny that it happened the day after a customer service supervisor mentioned that is what they did in her store she transferred from. 

We used to keep one register open all night, and would open more when it got busy. We get weird rushes at 3am. 

So now, usually a few times a night I get an asshole customer that absolutely refuses to use them. At first managers still wanted us to push them to use them, and try not to use the other registers. When I say assholes, usually old white customers, for some reason they feel entitiled, and will not use them.  Not, I really don't want to do this, can you help me ? But the YOU ARE GOING TO RING THIS UP FOR ME !!! RIGHT ?!!! 

The other day I had a woman go to the register we used to keep open and start piling her shit on it. I was straightening up stuff near the registers, and mentioned that it was closed. Her head started spinning, telling me she has been through this with management before, and they told her it was OPEN. No matter what, no matter what time, it was open. I started explaining the new thing, we started a month or so out, and No it is open. I don't know what I am talking about it is open. I can either sell her stuff or not. Well not seemed to be an option, so I was like, um ok. And went back to what I was doing. a few minutes later she tracked me down, and asked if I was going to find someone to ring her up. Well no, that register is closed. I want to see a supervisor, I want a manager, this is ridiculous, omg, the is fucking crazy. Rant rant rant. I said ok, fine, I will ring you up. But for future reference, the managers have made us shut down that register at 1:30 and after that, only self check out is open. As I was ringer her up one of the managers decided to show up, and talk to the supervisor, that had also just showed up. She wanted to speak to them. After I finished her order, I went back to what I was doing. She apparently complained to them, then called to complain to my store manager, then came in the next night to bitch at my other supervisor. I had the next two days off, so I mentioned it to my other super. She told me about her coming in and calling the other manager. After she complained to the first manager, he walked by me without saying anything. I never got in any trouble. If I see that woman in my store again, fuck her, I am not doing anything for her. If she asks me to, sorry I refuse to help you. You went way beyond trying to get me in trouble, talk to someone else.

MagpieChristine,"The grocery self-checkouts here seem really poorly designed. When they first came in, you needed to get the attendant to override for you when you started, because putting your bags in the bagging error would trigger the scale. (It's not bad that the scale is that sensitive, but the ""add bags"" button is an entirely necessary feature.) 

I think they might even let you take bags off and add new ones these days (I never buy that much at the self checkout, because every time it burps I have to wait for the overworked attendant). 

My biggest beef with them is that the grocery store in the mall has ONLY self-checkouts at the mall entrance. Sure, I get that it's not really feasible to have two sets of conventional checkouts, but I hate having to carry my bags of groceries back through the store, past the self-checkout, to be able to leave.

devoidz,"In my store the managers have said that corporate wants us to use only self check outs at night. Funny that it happened the day after a customer service supervisor mentioned that is what they did in her store she transferred from. 

We used to keep one register open all night, and would open more when it got busy. We get weird rushes at 3am. 

So now, usually a few times a night I get an asshole customer that absolutely refuses to use them. At first managers still wanted us to push them to use them, and try not to use the other registers. When I say assholes, usually old white customers, for some reason they feel entitiled, and will not use them.  Not, I really don't want to do this, can you help me ? But the YOU ARE GOING TO RING THIS UP FOR ME !!! RIGHT ?!!! 

The other day I had a woman go to the register we used to keep open and start piling her shit on it. I was straightening up stuff near the registers, and mentioned that it was closed. Her head started spinning, telling me she has been through this with management before, and they told her it was OPEN. No matter what, no matter what time, it was open. I started explaining the new thing, we started a month or so out, and No it is open. I don't know what I am talking about it is open. I can either sell her stuff or not. Well not seemed to be an option, so I was like, um ok. And went back to what I was doing. a few minutes later she tracked me down, and asked if I was going to find someone to ring her up. Well no, that register is closed. I want to see a supervisor, I want a manager, this is ridiculous, omg, the is fucking crazy. Rant rant rant. I said ok, fine, I will ring you up. But for future reference, the managers have made us shut down that register at 1:30 and after that, only self check out is open. As I was ringer her up one of the managers decided to show up, and talk to the supervisor, that had also just showed up. She wanted to speak to them. After I finished her order, I went back to what I was doing. She apparently complained to them, then called to complain to my store manager, then came in the next night to bitch at my other supervisor. I had the next two days off, so I mentioned it to my other super. She told me about her coming in and calling the other manager. After she complained to the first manager, he walked by me without saying anything. I never got in any trouble. If I see that woman in my store again, fuck her, I am not doing anything for her. If she asks me to, sorry I refuse to help you. You went way beyond trying to get me in trouble, talk to someone else. 

tldr, stupid bitch, wanted stuff rung up, did it anyway. and btw how fucking hard is it to scan something and put it in a fucking bag ?",null,4,cdls22f,1rbn62,talesFromRetail,top_week,6

MagpieChristine,"The grocery self-checkouts here seem really poorly designed. When they first came in, you needed to get the attendant to override for you when you started, because putting your bags in the bagging error would trigger the scale. (It's not bad that the scale is that sensitive, but the ""add bags"" button is an entirely necessary feature.) 

I think they might even let you take bags off and add new ones these days (I never buy that much at the self checkout, because every time it burps I have to wait for the overworked attendant). 

My biggest beef with them is that the grocery store in the mall has ONLY self-checkouts at the mall entrance. Sure, I get that it's not really feasible to have two sets of conventional checkouts, but I hate having to carry my bags of groceries back through the store, past the self-checkout, to be able to leave.

HungryHungryKirbys,"Before I did retail I was working at an art gallery at my school and my boss and I had this conversation every time we switched over exhibits. There were at least 10 other work-study students on the payroll, but I was always, without fail, the one who wasn't allowed to say, ""I have homework/class/a test"" and get away with it. 

I figured out this was because I was the most lenient when it came to scheduling and was always filling in for other people. Being nice sucks. ",null,1,cdm6l4z,1rd8r0,talesFromRetail,top_week,5
Patient000,"I've had similar experiences. I started my second job/first long-term position in May; I quit a little while ago. Summer went like this: I turned into the general back-up, asked to cover most people's shifts and often saving my shift switches for the coming school year. Worked for everyone, and I still got to have a life. Ran into a few problems and all the crazy shit seemed to happen when there were barely more than 3 of us in the building at any time, but it was ok.

September went like this: ramped up my studying for an entrance exam in October, trying to keep up with 2 very high-level classes and a senior course load, and dealing with long work hours. LONG work hours--hours I should never have been pulling every day, but everybody else would be hard to reach between 12-8 am. Our night shift lady would be left without backup unless she called me, so she called me and we formed an alliance; she was the only person who had/has my back from that place, which was a godsend in that environment. I was sleeping &lt;4 hours ~5 nights every week, eating irregularly, barely scraping by in my classes and ended up having 3 nervous breakdowns from the stress.     

Did that stop anyone from asking me to cover for them or trying to guilt-trip and lie to me about their reasons? No. They all knew I was stressed and depressed; the staff ""joke"" was that I never slept. My boss said she was praying for me, which was probably the only thing she ever really did on my behalf. She did decide to schedule me to work a shift that started 8pm 11/28--8am 11/30, because ""nobody else can do it, and you get paid for day duty [8a-4p] friday!"" Yeah... real helpful. She loved playing therapist with me as practice for her future career; you could see her calculating her textbook ""active listening"" responses and seeing how much experience we could give her, instead of acting like a team leader and taking initiative.

My favorite was one of the girls who asked me to cover 6 shifts for her in a row. I declined when she asked me 4 hours before her first shift: ""I would, but I have something going on right now [i.e. a life]."" Her: ""Well do you know when your ""something"" is going to end?"" Turns out I was busy until she stopped asking...which was the day I quit, a week later.

I doubt my GPA will remain untouched from what that job did to me.

Later, the system got upgraded, and now needed a key and a bar code. This time, they gave bar codes to 'supervisors' (they had special powers on the computer, but no authority in reality). These 'supervisors' were day shift workers, and we rarely had one on nights or weekends. We ended up having to hard reset a register a few times since it got stuck.

 - I work in a jewelry store and we are coming to one of the biggest times of the year (christmas), we have our Nov/Dec catalogue out with amazing deals so people have been shopping like mad.

To start off, the day had been going pretty **badly** from the start, people bitching 'cause they can't get a better deal, bargains not being big enough, seeing our brand merchandise in a competitive store for a cheaper price, etc. However, the day really started doing horribly when I got a sale stolen from me. 

Two guys walked in to buy a heap of christmas present, the two of them together (brothers) dropped nearly 13 grand on various things (mostly 3-5 grand chains, rings etc.), I was serving them for about an hour, biggest single sale of the day but still about 10 grand behind the months best. These two gentleman were about too pay, we were at the register and one of the other sales assistants came over and said that Our manager wanted her to ***take*** ***over***. 

I reluctantly said ok, I asked if I could go talk  to said manager after sale but she said no, so I told the customers I would be back in a jiffy (minute or so I was back) and serve them. The other sales assistant stated she would stay by the merchandise and the customers while I was with the manager, I come back and the two guys are all bagged up, there merchandise boxed and a near 14 grand sale gone through this other girls ID giving her the sale and a hefty commission (just over $2500) which should have been mine. 

The thing was, the manager was just asking if I could give her, her keys back as she gave them to me to look after as she needed to use the toilet. I had a bit of a rant at the other sales assistant, the manager asked what was going on, I explained the situation, the other sales assistant said ""she could make the sale as I said to do so, and that even if I didn't she has been there longer than me so she had the right, she also stated they needed to leave but even so she can still allocate the sale to me on the sales program we use. 

The two customers heard what happened, made a formal complaint, asked to see the manager, thanked me for my happiness and service and left. The other sales person still got the sale etc, but I have the satisfaction of knowing she was in the wrong and that she got the shit grilled out of her, still want my 2500 back though.",null,8,cdmmfke,1rew30,talesFromRetail,top_week,12

Luckily, there's so many display cases that you can easily slip off down there for over an hour and not work. We usually only do this on the slowest shifts, where we could technically afford to send one of the three of us home early.",null,0,cdnb83z,1rflgk,talesFromRetail,top_week,1
Kanotari,"Classroom calls. I work in tech support for a major university. Most of our calls are just silly things like, ""How do I log in to my email?"" and ""I forgot my password."" But every once in a while, some teacher needs something in the middle of class. We have to hop in our van and drive over there with everything we think we need (Which is challenging when you haven't diagnosed the problem yet because all the no-so-tech-savvy teacher will tell you is that it's 'broken'.). We have to drive through campus and college kids are oblivious. I can stalk them for half a mile doing 3mph in my van because they can't be arsed to move to the side of the sidewalk... So anyway, we usually show up late and poorly equipped with the expectation that we can wave our hands and solve the problem. Sometimes we can, like when the professor forgets to say... turn on the computer (Which happens more than you'd think), but other times, it's a complex problem and will take a while. Naturally, this fact has to be explained to the class, and no one likes to hear it. They give you this death glare that clearly tells you that you're incompetent. Man... those glares give me nightmares.",null,0,cdngb3v,1rflgk,talesFromRetail,top_week,1
adelajoy,"Over the summer, I worked at a day camp for kids. At the end of summer, someone else had to go through all my reports, which put the whole thing in perspective. Reports included: 

* A child threw up, and I scrubbed their vomit off the floor, at one point throwing up myself, and I had to clean that up too. 
* A child peed on the playground, and I had to call maintenance to clean the slide.
* Two little boys peed in the garbage can in the washroom (a foot away from the urinal). I definitely wasn't equipped to handle that one.
* One morning, I found human feces on the playground - smeared from the top of the slide to bottom with a stick. The stick was stuck in another piece of equipment. Playground stunk to high heaven until maintenance showed up. (Truly the *shittiest* day I've ever worked.)
* Another child physically attacked me, at one point picking up a large metal wrench to hit me with. I disarmed him and restrained him in a chair until police arrived. Yes, I had to call the police on a six-year-old child.
* One of the seven-year-olds swore at me, and when I called his parents, I got, ""Oh no no no no, he would never say that. We told him only parents are allowed to say that.""

Even if he wanted to stand up for you it was in his and your best interest not to. 

First he has to live with her so even if she is wrong... she is right.

Second if he did defend you then by the time the ride home was over his pregnant wife would have had it in her head that you were his mistress and he has been sleeping with you for weeks since she is fat bloated and carrying his unborn demand spawn child.

Another incident with them had them making a fort on the toilet paper shelf and hiding behind the toilet paper. I walked over and told them they had found a great hiding spot.

carriegood,"Last year, I was going to make my special brussels sprouts for Thanksgiving. But recently, the veggie has been getting very popular, even trendy.  So last year, I went to 5 grocery stores and everyone was out. At my favorite store, I did ask the produce guy if they had any ""in the back"" and to his credit, he told me they had them first thing in the morning, but they were long gone.

Last night I stopped at a small local grocer, and they not only had a giant bin of loose ones, they had the stalks. There were stalks piled up with the rest of the vegetables, there were stalks on a special 6' shelving unit by the front door, and there were stalks on another unit at the end of the aisle. 

When I was checking out, I thanked the cashier for thinking ahead and stocking so much. She looked at me like I was crazy.  From now on, I'm just paying for my sprouts and leaving.

Getting management involved - not a bad idea, let them do stupid stuff and return when customers are playing games. Your store doesn't take a big loss on any paint returns, don't let them trick you into thinking you have to do loss-prevention. (The manufacturers eat most of the returns, except for Rustoleum and stuff that isn't paint. Seriously.) 

Pretty much any vaguely manager sort of person - can start the paperwork and take a hazmat off your plate - you just put it in the right barrel or whatevs. The receiving clerk will still be stuck with the eventual whatever happens to it. It's a win-win.

One, I worked at Goth store in the mall, so most of our clientele were young people who weren't that good at keeping track of where they bought stuff (if they bought it themselves, sometimes Mom did and told them the wrong store).

Three, people seem to think that Goth store and That Store That Sells Knockoff Crap Jewelry and Dildos To Frat Boys are the same store. Even though Goth store had a policy of no drug or alcohol references. I had people bring in body jewelry with pot leaf designs, beer logo tee shirts, all sorts of crazy stuff and swear up and down that it was from my store.

Best story: My district manager was helping me with some paperwork at the desk. This kid comes up to the desk with a band tee shirt that had, guess what, a pot leaf in the design. I politely explained to them that we didn't carry that particular shirt and told them to check out Crappy Frat Party Store instead. The kid started losing his mind, cursing, screaming, waving his finger in my face. My district manager could see I was one inch from smacking this guy so he smoothly came over and leaned in and said in a conspiratorial whisper, ""I'll give you five bucks for it, man.""

I work at a fast food restraunt known the world over.
Our breaks are 30 minutes put on a schedule days in advance and we are required to take the breaks when they are put down on schedule. This never happens, some days I never get a break at all.

If a manager/supervisor tells you to take a break, you take that break. If they complain, refer them to said manager. IF said manager said they ""didnt understand your question"" but said yes anyways to a question they didnt understand/hear I would make note of this complaint and bring it up to someone higher than your supervisor/manager such as an Assistant Store Manager or Store Manager (even as high as a district manager)

I cannot understand how someone can be a keyholder or in a position of power if they cannot handle employee questions and say ""yes"" to something they didnt understand. Would they do the same to customers too? Your DM will not like that. Nor would corporate.

Me: Yes I just started working here last month. Can I help you with something?

Every single time I saw him he'd emphasize my name in a way that made me feel dirty. While I don't remember any exact conversations, he'd start asking to see me outside of work, or if I rode the bus so he could walk me to my stop. Eventually I noticed that he was never ready to order until I was available to help him. One day I went home really upset about something he said and my mom told me to let my manager know. (First job ever, I was scared of getting fired for every little thing and didn't know my rights.)

So I told my manager and she said the next time it happens to let her or the second in command know. The next day he shows up and I let the assistant manager know. While he was taking care of it, one of my coworkers told me that that guy has been kicked out multiple times for stealing.

-My managers who schedule me to work alone with no training for the job they scheduled me to do.

-My managers for firing a bunch of people when we were already short handed, and then not hiring new ones.

-My managers for fucking up our orders, that thing that never sells is still not selling (shocking, right?) and we do not need five more cases to add to the fifteen already in the freezer.

-My managers for making stupid rules that are impossible to follow and even breaking them themselves but bitching at anyone who dares question it or suggest a better option.

Yes, bitch, I *am* sorry. I don't want you to have to go through this. I take pride in making sure that my customers get what they want, because it's my job. Happy customers make for a smooth shift, meaning me and my co-workers will be happy too. Plus, it's no fun seeing someone get screwed over by corporate policy or stupid employees when I myself could be in that situation.

I'm a human being too; I understand that what you're going through is not fun. And if you treat me with that understanding, I will do my best to move mountains for you and get your problem fixed. But if you treat me like retail scum, you better fucking believe I will act like it.

Techsupportvictim,"We have mall alarms that go off all the time. And internal ones for our store, if both go off we clear the store right away.

The other fun though is that we deal with soft cell batteries. Easy to puncture if you aren't trained to deal with them. You literally have to take a week long course in how to handle them, safety rules etc. Anyone comes back to so a battery replacement they are right next to a fire extinguisher and open fire safe. These are lithium based batteries and yes if they are torn they can explode. 

Guy comes in griping about how his phone gets really hot, smells funny. Slams it down on the counter in front of me. I pull up the serial since it was turning on, preparing to start trouble shooting etc. I notice it's rather warm and that the display seems off, lifted up even. His comment about the smell makes me nervous so I say I'm going to go to the back and have a look at it.

Now I'm happen to be the only tech on duty trained to handle batteries (the other two were on lunch). Once I'm out of the customers sight I radio the mangers to stand by as we have a potential battery fire risk. Yep, we are code orange boys and girls. 

I clear the room as my manager comes in and grabs the fire extinguisher. Warehouse has been alerted and all runs to the floor are paused and they are standing by to clear out. Floor managers are standing by clear the sales floor without alerting the customers just yet. 

Fire safe is open. Tongs at the ready. Neutralizer is in tray. Safety goggles, face mask and apron on (yeah seriously). Manager also has safety gear on

Deep breath, unscrew the bottom. Generally attach suction and lift up the tray. 

Two things catch my eye, one the battery casing is white (ours are black. Two, there is a freaking screw embedded in the middle of the battery.

Split second later the smell is worse. The mask is basically one if those dust things so I can still smell some of it. 

It's like a scene out of a movie. I hear Sam Jackson ""oh hell no"" in my head as a grab the tongs, phone into the tray, tray into the safe and slam the door and lock it. My manager is on the radio at the same time basically screaming ""thermal event this is NOT a drill"". Warehouse manager hits the fire alarm for our store which also alerts the mall. 

End of the story, mall is cleared out, fire department called, took two hours to clear the store for anyone to go back in and we couldn't go into repair room for like 12 hours until the neutralizer absorbed the fumes and the safe could be opened. I was sent home with pay and I got to have to go to doctor and cleared to come to work because I might have been exposed. phone actually caught fire in the safe and was a charred mess. Company was nice enough to let the guy pay for a service swap with the understanding that the third party battery actually voided the warranty etc

WishfulOne,"I find it scary that no one was evacuated at least until it was discovered that there was no fire.  


I was shopping in a store in a plaza one day when the fire alarms started going off.  No one seemed concerned about this.  The two employees were at the counter looking totally lost and confused and the customers were shopping like nothing was happening (typical customers).  

I asked one employee if that was the fire alarm.  She said she wasn't sure but that it sounded like one.  I told her to get the customers out just in case something was wrong.  She told me that the fire alarm was connected to all the stores in the plaza and the fire mightn't be in this store.  I told her it didn't matter, to get everyone out and to ask her boss about the procedure for a fire alarm so she would know in  the future.

As everyone left the store, people were coming out of the other stores in the plaza and I could hear fire trucks in the distance.  I had other shopping to do so I left.  I don't think there was a real fire, if there was it was never mentioned in the local news.  It scares me when no one evacuates an area when fire alarms are going off.

Techsupportvictim,"Holiday shopping season is a bit like trench warfare for us workers. Some things that drive us crazy anyway but make this season hell:

No jokes about it being free if it doesn't scan

Don't shop. Buy, sure, but don't shop. Especially this weekend. Do your homework online etc and keep the questions to a minimum. We have a shirt ton of folks to help and being caught up for half an hour by someone with a million questions and no real intention to buy is not cool

You will have to wait. Get over it or buy online. 

Don't get mad if we don't know the answer to your random and obscure question. It doesn't make us morons, we just have to remember a ton of things about a ton of stuff. If you ask nicely we will try to find the answer and then we will both know

Know the rules about when you need your id for what things and don't give us crap about it. Yes you need it to buy liquor, yes you need it to pick up your prepaid order, yes you need it to pay by check. 

If you are going to a shop that price matches have the damn flyer with you and don't give us crap when we say we have to verify the online sale or sorry but that was a door buster and since you can't get it now at 2pm because it was only good until 10am. Same with items we had as door busters. See that big sign that says no rain checks. That means no. 

Leave the purse pup and kids at home. If you must bring the kids make sure they are military grade behaved. Nothing is worse this time of year than a dog in a store or kids running around like maniacs and the parents think it's cute. It's not.

Don't give us shit if the corporate office decided to send Christmas decorations or that Santa is satan and we should have baby jesus on things. Or that we say happy holidays to be 'inclusive'

Don't demand special treatment because of who you are,how much you are spending etc. If the rule is one per customer don't ask us to ring up ten separate transactions. If you want things bagged a certain way,do it yourself. And tell us before we start that you need a gift receipt. If you forget don't get pissy with us that it takes time to reprint or we ask you to go to the service desk 

Pay attention to closed signs or if I am ringing someone and I have turned out my light and tell you I am closed then I am closed. Don't give me crap. I told you before you started piling your stuff up. I likely legally have to take my meal break or it's the end of my shift and my rat bastard boss allows zero overtime. I will walk away and leave you standing there.

Stay off they damn phone. Seriously if someone is trying to help you don't be yacking in your phone. Don't hold up my line while I'm waiting for you to swipe your card so you can take about little foofoo's poop issue or whatever. If we are on the sales floor and you just need to call your husband because you can't decide, fine.but don't expect me to stand there for 20 minutes with you for moral support. I have folks waiting. My boss demands that I walk away. And yes that means you might have to wait a moment once you are off the call. But I promise I'll get back to you ask quickly as I can. 

Don't give us shit about our warranties etc. We have to pitch it or we aren't doing our jobs. Just zone out for ten seconds if you like. But don't tell us to shut up, yell at us for scamming folks etc. If you really think that then find a lawyer and deal with corporate.

Tell them a story about the same situation. It doesn't even have to be true.

Try this out.

""I'm sorry madam, but our manager accidentally sold to someone underage last week and got a $10,000 fine! We have to ID everyone. Rules is rules.""

It takes the focus off their transaction and big pictures it for them. Suddenly they don't think they have to convince you to drop your silly little rule... they realise they are actually trying to convince you to risk a $10k fine; and who is going to risk that just for someone else's smokes? Friggin' NO-ONE that's who.

I used to use this on people who wanted to pay by cheque.

""Sorry, we can't accept cheques as cash. You can let it clear and then come pick your stuff up. I'll call you when it clears.""

""BUT MY CHEQUES NEVER BOUNCE! Are you accusing me of writing dodgy cheques?!!!""

""No, sorry. The manager gave in and took a cheque last week and we got screwed for $1800. No more risks.""

""Oh, OK. I guess I'll just go to the bank and come back with cash.""

Tell them a story about the same situation. It doesn't even have to be true.

Try this out.

""I'm sorry madam, but our manager accidentally sold to someone underage last week and got a $10,000 fine! We have to ID everyone. Rules is rules.""

It takes the focus off their transaction and big pictures it for them. Suddenly they don't think they have to convince you to drop your silly little rule... they realise they are actually trying to convince you to risk a $10k fine; and who is going to risk that just for someone else's smokes? Friggin' NO-ONE that's who.

I used to use this on people who wanted to pay by cheque.

""Sorry, we can't accept cheques as cash. You can let it clear and then come pick your stuff up. I'll call you when it clears.""

""BUT MY CHEQUES NEVER BOUNCE! Are you accusing me of writing dodgy cheques?!!!""

""No, sorry. The manager gave in and took a cheque last week and we got screwed for $1800. No more risks.""

""Oh, OK. I guess I'll just go to the bank and come back with cash.""

It's a clever, polite way of saying ""Nice try. But we JUUUST got fucked over by this exact thing and there's no way in hell I'm bending the rules for you.""",null,4,cdojpe5,1rla4l,talesFromRetail,top_week,41

Techsupportvictim,"I worked in a similar shop when I was in high school. Only it was coffee. I was freshly 16, a girl. My job was basically stocking and weighing out bags of coffee beans and our few loose teas and bagging them up. Then when folks got coffee they could take it home in beans or we would grind it for them. When things would get busy I would help grind so I got real good and knowing how to figured out the best grind from the worse descriptions. 

Had a woman not unlike yours one day, chatted me up so she knew my age and no I'm not family (small family run shop) just friend of the owners kid. Asking tons of questions wouldn't take my answers, unless Bert said the same thing. Finally got her sorted out and she hollers over from the bakery display (owners wife makes cookies, fudge etc) asking if Janelle was around cause she wanted to order a cock cake for her nieces wedding brunch. I lived in a kind of rural area so I wasn't really wondering why someone would want a cake shaped like a rooster but no ma'am Janelle wasn't in would she like to leave a note etc.

After she left I happened to be stocking near the register and asked the daughter playing cashier if said lady was also so rude. Yes. But I handled her pretty well. Then Kasey wanted to know what the note was all about. When I said rooster cake she busted out laughing. Needless to say she corrected me and I turned bright red, particularly at the thought of this 70 year old woman baking dirty cakes etc. ",null,3,cdp0a23,1rmmz2,talesFromRetail,top_week,8

She told me about a customer who tried to come behind the counter and how her manager saw and responded quickly. The event, nonetheless, left her shaking and she had to take her break early due to a panic attack. Fortunately she had an understanding manager.

I told her that if something like that happens again and the customer DOES touch her, to scream. Scream loud, scream with all the panic in her shy, anxious soul. No words, just noise. They did not have a right to touch her and this is nature's signal that the other person is out of line and send help quickly.

Cousin did as advised. According to her sister (who also worked there as an asst. manager) it was the howl of a thousand banshees. EVERYONE came running to see this large woman gripping my tiny cousin's wrist in an apparent death vice. Later, cousin said she wasn't actually hurt, just scared. 

Customer was ejected immediately and is banned from the store. Cousin said that she actually felt better from the scream and the aftermath was not as bad as other occasions.

llama_delrey,"Hi OP! Based off your story (and a pervious one), I am pretty positive that I used to work at the same craft store you do (assuming it's a chain?).

First off, those coupons are the worst things ever. I one time had a woman who didn't understand why her coupon for $15 off a purchase $45-$74.99 didn't automatically bring her purchase down to $30, when she had spent $65. Holy shit. She literally did not understand how subtraction and addition worked, and there was no way for me to explain it to her without being condescending, which only pissed her off more.

Second off, the fact that we could not delete coupons after scanning them nearly made me cry on several occasions, i.e., psycho coupon lady hands me a 50% off coupon after I've scanned a stack of 40% off coupon and it screws up the entire order. I would usually just smile and enter it as a special discount it by hand so that they didn't try to murder me.

Third off, if a customer came behind my register, I would have called the manager up immediately and told the customer to get out from behind the register, even if they hadn't touched me. My store was not in the safest area, and there had been several stores that were robbed at gunpoint within a couple blocks.

It's a really terrible thing, but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization. And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hired.

I don't know how I would have reacted. I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place, but I'm not sure. In times like that, it's hard to say how any of us would really have reacted. I've had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years, and I've never reacted completely how I would have expected.

Either way, I'm sorry you had this happen to you, OP. Nobody has a right to put their hands on you. Next time, the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation, call a manager, and fill out an incident report. Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary.

She told me about a customer who tried to come behind the counter and how her manager saw and responded quickly. The event, nonetheless, left her shaking and she had to take her break early due to a panic attack. Fortunately she had an understanding manager.

I told her that if something like that happens again and the customer DOES touch her, to scream. Scream loud, scream with all the panic in her shy, anxious soul. No words, just noise. They did not have a right to touch her and this is nature's signal that the other person is out of line and send help quickly.

A few months go by and I get a call out of the blue. My cousin thanked me for the advice saying it was the best she'd ever gotten. She's a cashier at a grocery store and occasionally manages those sample kiosks. Same customer (large, rotund woman) had the same issue (cousin is only allowed to give 2 samples per person, customer wanted moar) and grabbed her wrist when cousin said ""no"" politely.

Cousin did as advised. According to her sister (who also worked there as an asst. manager) it was the howl of a thousand banshees. EVERYONE came running to see this large woman gripping my tiny cousin's wrist in an apparent death vice. Later, cousin said she wasn't actually hurt, just scared. 

Customer was ejected immediately and is banned from the store. Cousin said that she actually felt better from the scream and the aftermath was not as bad as other occasions. She also said she wasn't likely to do it again as she was mortified by everyone coming around.

llama_delrey,"Hi OP! Based off your story (and a pervious one), I am pretty positive that I used to work at the same craft store you do (assuming it's a chain?).

First off, those coupons are the worst things ever. I one time had a woman who didn't understand why her coupon for $15 off a purchase $45-$74.99 didn't automatically bring her purchase down to $30, when she had spent $65. Holy shit. She literally did not understand how subtraction and addition worked, and there was no way for me to explain it to her without being condescending, which only pissed her off more.

Second off, the fact that we could not delete coupons after scanning them nearly made me cry on several occasions, i.e., psycho coupon lady hands me a 50% off coupon after I've scanned a stack of 40% off coupon and it screws up the entire order. I would usually just smile and enter it as a special discount it by hand so that they didn't try to murder me.

Third off, if a customer came behind my register, I would have called the manager up immediately and told the customer to get out from behind the register, even if they hadn't touched me. My store was not in the safest area, and there had been several stores that were robbed at gunpoint within a couple blocks. So they were very big on not letting customers behind the counters, because god knows what those nutjobs will do.

etterboce,"To everyone who keeps saying she should file criminal charges against the customer, I agree in theory. However, even if OP knows who the customer is, simply calling the police could result in her termination depending on the company. 

It's a really terrible thing, but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization. And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hired.

I don't know how I would have reacted. I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place, but I'm not sure. In times like that, it's hard to say how any of us would really have reacted. I've had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years, and I've never reacted completely how I would have expected.

Either way, I'm sorry you had this happen to you, OP. Nobody has a right to put their hands on you. Next time, the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation, call a manager, and fill out an incident report. Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary.

I thanked him and asked him to pull around for a wait on his food. Before he goes he hands me a couple bucks, saying that I had amazing customer service. Tried to refuse, oh no take it! Accept the money and he pulls around. 

I was pretty embarrassed at this point, for working in customer service I'm pretty freaked out by strangers. His kindness was appreciated, but gave me a bit of a panic attack. Asked my manager to take out the food, and he agrees. He returns with more money from this guy, saying he had nothing but nice words to say about me. We then hear a beep in the drive-thru, go to the window to say we're closed and guess who it is? It's him again! With a tip from his girlfriend this time.

The replacement crown turned into an additional $1600 procedure called a crown lengthening to give the dentist access to a spot he needed to fill first.  All told, I've put about $5500 into this *one* tooth. The one behind it, which had a second root canal and ended up needing an implant, has had probably closer to $10,000 of work done on it.

zalloy,"People do it all the time at fast food places. I guess they figure the job isn't bad enough, so they crap all over the place like a bunch of animals, so that the min-wage slaves have to clean their poop up. I think I've found more crap smeared on the walls, and in the sinks and urinals, than what made it into the toilet. 

That's why I don't clean restrooms. Some of these people must have been raised in a zoo. Or, maybe they're mentally ill. 

It's disgusting!",null,0,cdq7il5,1rqg7q,talesFromRetail,top_week,1
