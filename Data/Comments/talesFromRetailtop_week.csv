morgueanna,"I had this happen all the time.

One, I worked at Goth store in the mall, so most of our clientele were young people who weren't that good at keeping track of where they bought stuff (if they bought it themselves, sometimes Mom did and told them the wrong store).

Two, the reputation that Goth store had in the 90's and 00's for appealing to drug oriented youth seems to be well earned, if my customers were any indication. Some of them were lucky to remember their own names and complete a sentence, let alone figure out where they bought their merchandise from.

Three, people seem to think that Goth store and That Store That Sells Knockoff Crap Jewelry and Dildos To Frat Boys are the same store. Even though Goth store had a policy of no drug or alcohol references. I had people bring in body jewelry with pot leaf designs, beer logo tee shirts, all sorts of crazy stuff and swear up and down that it was from my store.

Best story: My district manager was helping me with some paperwork at the desk. This kid comes up to the desk with a band tee shirt that had, guess what, a pot leaf in the design. I politely explained to them that we didn't carry that particular shirt and told them to check out Crappy Frat Party Store instead. The kid started losing his mind, cursing, screaming, waving his finger in my face. My district manager could see I was one inch from smacking this guy so he smoothly came over and leaned in and said in a conspiratorial whisper, ""I'll give you five bucks for it, man."" The kid's demeanor instantly changed and he said ""Deal!""  O.o

My DM pulled five bucks out of his pocket, handed it to the kid, and when the kid was gone, threw the shirt in the trash. Then he went back to paperwork like it never happened. ",null,10,cdnlh10,1riaxl,talesFromRetail,top_week,81

""But it's in your bag.""

""Yes it is. Because your friend saved the bag when she got a gift from someone else, bought you this pen, probably at a cheap variety store, and put it in my bag to pass it off as something nice from my store.""

I occasionally made the mistake of coming out from behind my pharmacy counter to help in our small pharmacy, which also sold durable medical equipment. Inevitably I would have to measure and fit a diabetic man like described above for compression hosiery. (Ummm too little too late, gangrenous gentleman...) I gloved up every single time I ever measured, let alone for these guys with their blood and skin falling off. Some would get insulted at the gloves!

But once in a great while... One of those kinds.... Once he walked out in his new hosiery.... He walks back in three days later, with his unwashed hose in hand, saying they're ""too tight I want a refund"".  NO WAY JOSE!! They're compression hose, they're supposed to be tight!

Christmas is December 25th. The Christmas season lasts from Christmas to the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord (Jan 12th this year). If you're non-mainline Protestant, well, I guess Christmas is just on the 25th. If you're a fundamentalists...erm...happy December 25th?

There are *other* holidays between Halloween and Christmas that people celebrate, and some that aren't Christian, so ""Happy Holidays"" ain't too shabby. Hell, if you're Catholic, there's tons of holidays between Thanksgiving and Christmas (St. Nick's Day, anyone? Immaculate Conception?), so again, ""Happy Holidays!""

If you're Christian, it is now *Advent*. Not Christmas. Not the Christmas season. It's frickin' Advent. A solemn period of expectation. 

Quit bitchin' about Happy Holidays. Be happy anyone is trying to be cordial with you at all, because if you're this bitter over it, you might be lucky to have that much friendly interaction.

When the Samsung Galaxy SIII came out, I was up for a new phone. I went to my local cell shop. It was a privately owned shop that did prepaid (boost, virgin mobile) and my contracted carrier, or so I thought.

I walk down to the store, open the door and continue to walk in. There is a line so I find an appropriate spot to wait, happened to be a rather comfy chair. I look at all the people, try to eavesdrop on various conversations, just general people watching. A reasonable amount of time passes, and I am able to start my transaction.

Me: ""I'd like to purchase a new phone""

Cashier: ""I'm sorry sir. I can't help you as we aren't affiliated with Sprint 
anymore""

Me: ""What?!""

Gift is basically a suburban soccer mom's wet dream. It's a section down at the end of our already niche store that the owner's wife has taken over for her own purposes.

Not only is it full of statues, but a wide variety of WAY over-priced knick-knacks. Like the $759.99 model ship. Or the $299.99 **PRINT** of some painting no one's ever heard of.

Nothing sells. Ever. Like, there's stock down there that's been there since before I was born. And I'm going on 19. It's a waste of money. That we're required to dust and vacuum. If you're sent to gift, you've either pissed off a manager or there's NOTHING for us to do in the rest of the store.

We have to drive through campus and college kids are oblivious. I can stalk them for half a mile doing 3mph in my van because they can't be arsed to move to the side of the sidewalk... So anyway, we usually show up late and poorly equipped with the expectation that we can wave our hands and solve the problem.

My coworker doesn't go to college and she is telling him that he has her confused with someone else. He keeps insisting it was her and continues making comments about her body. She was too uncomfortable to even speak at this point so I step in immediately. I said to him, ""Sir, you are harassing my coworker and she has told you that she is not the woman you speak of. She is clearly uncomfortable and your comments are obviously unwelcome. Leave your item on the counter and leave my store immediately. You are no longer welcome here"". He responded by saying that he was merely complimenting her, but at this point I have had enough and my coworker was shaking. I escorted him to the front and closed the door. I sent my coworker to the back to cool off and relax for a bit. Then later on that night he returns and asks to speak with her because he wanted to apologize.

It was an average day, not too fast or too slow when an overweight man in his 30s came in. I was with another customer at the moment so he went to my coworker. As soon as I finished, I went to help out another when I hear him tell her that he remembers her from college and how she got so much sexier with time. My coworker doesn't go to college and she is telling him that he has her confused with someone else. He keeps insisting it was her and continues making comments about her body. She was too uncomfortable to even speak at this point so I step in immediately. I said to him, ""Sir, you are harassing my coworker and she has told you that she is not the woman you speak of. She is clearly uncomfortable and your comments are obviously unwelcome. Leave your item on the counter and leave my store immediately. You are no longer welcome here"". He responded by saying that he was merely complimenting her, but at this point I have had enough and my coworker was shaking. I escorted him to the front and closed the door. I sent my coworker to the back to cool off and relax for a bit. Then later on that night he returns and asks to speak with her because he wanted to apologize. I did not allow him to and once again escorted him out while warning that if he returned he would have to be escorted out in handcuffs by the police. Yeah, he never came back.

 - I work in a jewelry store and we are coming to one of the biggest times of the year (christmas), we have our Nov/Dec catalogue out with amazing deals so people have been shopping like mad.

To start off, the day had been going pretty **badly** from the start, people bitching 'cause they can't get a better deal, bargains not being big enough, seeing our brand merchandise in a competitive store for a cheaper price, etc. However, the day really started doing horribly when I got a sale stolen from me. 

Two guys walked in to buy a heap of christmas present, the two of them together (brothers) dropped nearly 13 grand on various things (mostly 3-5 grand chains, rings etc.), I was serving them for about an hour, biggest single sale of the day but still about 10 grand behind the months best. These two gentleman were about too pay, we were at the register and one of the other sales assistants came over and said that Our manager wanted her to ***take*** ***over***. 

I reluctantly said ok, I asked if I could go talk  to said manager after sale but she said no, so I told the customers I would be back in a jiffy (minute or so I was back) and serve them. The other sales assistant stated she would stay by the merchandise and the customers while I was with the manager, I come back and the two guys are all bagged up, there merchandise boxed and a near 14 grand sale gone through this other girls ID giving her the sale and a hefty commission (just over $2500) which should have been mine. 

The thing was, the manager was just asking if I could give her, her keys back as she gave them to me to look after as she needed to use the toilet. I had a bit of a rant at the other sales assistant, the manager asked what was going on, I explained the situation, the other sales assistant said ""she could make the sale as I said to do so, and that even if I didn't she has been there longer than me so she had the right, she also stated they needed to leave but even so she can still allocate the sale to me on the sales program we use. 

The two customers heard what happened, made a formal complaint, asked to see the manager, thanked me for my happiness and service and left. The other sales person still got the sale etc, but I have the satisfaction of knowing she was in the wrong and that she got the shit grilled out of her, still want my 2500 back though.",null,8,cdmmfke,1rew30,talesFromRetail,top_week,12

There was a bakery in the store, which was one of the first departments to totally shut down, so we were nice enough to transfer all the cake orders to one of our competitors down the street.

There were at least 10 other work-study students on the payroll, but I was always, without fail, the one who wasn't allowed to say, ""I have homework/class/a test"" and get away with it.

Patient000,"I've had similar experiences. I started my second job/first long-term position in May; I quit a little while ago. Summer went like this: I turned into the general back-up, asked to cover most people's shifts and often saving my shift switches for the coming school year. Worked for everyone, and I still got to have a life. Ran into a few problems and all the crazy shit seemed to happen when there were barely more than 3 of us in the building at any time, but it was ok.

September went like this: ramped up my studying for an entrance exam in October, trying to keep up with 2 very high-level classes and a senior course load, and dealing with long work hours. LONG work hours--hours I should never have been pulling every day, but everybody else would be hard to reach between 12-8 am. Our night shift lady would be left without backup unless she called me, so she called me and we formed an alliance; she was the only person who had/has my back from that place, which was a godsend in that environment. I was sleeping &lt;4 hours ~5 nights every week, eating irregularly, barely scraping by in my classes and ended up having 3 nervous breakdowns from the stress.     

Did that stop anyone from asking me to cover for them or trying to guilt-trip and lie to me about their reasons? No. They all knew I was stressed and depressed; the staff ""joke"" was that I never slept. My boss said she was praying for me, which was probably the only thing she ever really did on my behalf. She did decide to schedule me to work a shift that started 8pm 11/28--8am 11/30, because ""nobody else can do it, and you get paid for day duty [8a-4p] friday!"" Yeah... real helpful. She loved playing therapist with me as practice for her future career; you could see her calculating her textbook ""active listening"" responses and seeing how much experience we could give her, instead of acting like a team leader and taking initiative.

My favorite was one of the girls who asked me to cover 6 shifts for her in a row. I declined when she asked me 4 hours before her first shift: ""I would, but I have something going on right now [i.e. a life]."" Her: ""Well do you know when your ""something"" is going to end?"" Turns out I was busy until she stopped asking...which was the day I quit, a week later.

I doubt my GPA will remain untouched from what that job did to me.

I worked as a server and short order cook when needed, and my tips were miniscule in comparison to the bartenders'. Eventually the higher-ups noticed a substantial amount of money missing from the bar and that the inventory didn't match the sales. I was on medical leave when they were busted. One by one they were questioned, and each gave a similar account saying that I was the one pocketing the money. Little did they know the GM had spy cameras installed in the bar that caught their day to day operation. I come back to work to find new bartenders and servers and whatnot. Corporate policy back then was that when something like what I described ever happened, the current employees had to be terminated and a new staff hired on and trained...Including yours truly.

We used to keep one register open all night, and would open more when it got busy. We get weird rushes at 3am. 

So now, usually a few times a night I get an asshole customer that absolutely refuses to use them. At first managers still wanted us to push them to use them, and try not to use the other registers. When I say assholes, usually old white customers, for some reason they feel entitiled, and will not use them.  Not, I really don't want to do this, can you help me ? But the YOU ARE GOING TO RING THIS UP FOR ME !!! RIGHT ?!!! 

The other day I had a woman go to the register we used to keep open and start piling her shit on it. I was straightening up stuff near the registers, and mentioned that it was closed. Her head started spinning, telling me she has been through this with management before, and they told her it was OPEN. No matter what, no matter what time, it was open. I started explaining the new thing, we started a month or so out, and No it is open. I don't know what I am talking about it is open. I can either sell her stuff or not. Well not seemed to be an option, so I was like, um ok. And went back to what I was doing. a few minutes later she tracked me down, and asked if I was going to find someone to ring her up. Well no, that register is closed. I want to see a supervisor, I want a manager, this is ridiculous, omg, the is fucking crazy. Rant rant rant. I said ok, fine, I will ring you up. But for future reference, the managers have made us shut down that register at 1:30 and after that, only self check out is open. As I was ringer her up one of the managers decided to show up, and talk to the supervisor, that had also just showed up. She wanted to speak to them. After I finished her order, I went back to what I was doing. She apparently complained to them, then called to complain to my store manager, then came in the next night to bitch at my other supervisor. I had the next two days off, so I mentioned it to my other super. She told me about her coming in and calling the other manager. After she complained to the first manager, he walked by me without saying anything. I never got in any trouble. If I see that woman in my store again, fuck her, I am not doing anything for her. If she asks me to, sorry I refuse to help you. You went way beyond trying to get me in trouble, talk to someone else.

I think they might even let you take bags off and add new ones these days (I never buy that much at the self checkout, because every time it burps I have to wait for the overworked attendant). 

My biggest beef with them is that the grocery store in the mall has ONLY self-checkouts at the mall entrance.

I started explaining the new thing, we started a month or so out, and No it is open. I don't know what I am talking about it is open. I can either sell her stuff or not. Well not seemed to be an option, so I was like, um ok. And went back to what I was doing. a few minutes later she tracked me down, and asked if I was going to find someone to ring her up. Well no, that register is closed. I want to see a supervisor, I want a manager, this is ridiculous, omg, the is fucking crazy. Rant rant rant. I said ok, fine, I will ring you up. But for future reference, the managers have made us shut down that register at 1:30 and after that, only self check out is open. As I was ringer her up one of the managers decided to show up, and talk to the supervisor, that had also just showed up. She wanted to speak to them. After I finished her order, I went back to what I was doing. She apparently complained to them, then called to complain to my store manager, then came in the next night to bitch at my other supervisor. I had the next two days off, so I mentioned it to my other super. She told me about her coming in and calling the other manager. After she complained to the first manager, he walked by me without saying anything. I never got in any trouble. If I see that woman in my store again, fuck her, I am not doing anything for her. If she asks me to, sorry I refuse to help you. You went way beyond trying to get me in trouble, talk to someone else. 

tldr, stupid bitch, wanted stuff rung up, did it anyway. and btw how fucking hard is it to scan something and put it in a fucking bag ?",null,4,cdls22f,1rbn62,talesFromRetail,top_week,6

MagpieChristine,"The grocery self-checkouts here seem really poorly designed. When they first came in, you needed to get the attendant to override for you when you started, because putting your bags in the bagging error would trigger the scale. (It's not bad that the scale is that sensitive, but the ""add bags"" button is an entirely necessary feature.) 

I think they might even let you take bags off and add new ones these days (I never buy that much at the self checkout, because every time it burps I have to wait for the overworked attendant). 

My biggest beef with them is that the grocery store in the mall has ONLY self-checkouts at the mall entrance. Sure, I get that it's not really feasible to have two sets of conventional checkouts, but I hate having to carry my bags of groceries back through the store, past the self-checkout, to be able to leave.

I wasn't trying to get a discount or anything, he was just having a problem with a POS system at a place that I'd worked at while in high school. It was a regional camera store and is now national. This is about ten years ago, several years after I'd stopped working for them. 

I was buying up their stock of a slide film that had been discontinued. He was having a problem getting the machine to ring it up, because when looking up by the UPC barcode, the POS insisted that the product had been discontinued... yet it was obviously sitting right there on the counter, which meant it was probably in inventory, but under the retailer part number and not the UPC. I told him to hit the key that escaped to the manager menu, and walked him through looking it up by name. When it worked, he said that he had to go get his manager to make sure he'd done it correctly. Fine, I'll wait. 

Fatty McManager came stomping out of the back room with each step shaking the carefully plan-o-grammed displays and a cloud of steam coming from each ear. He asked me who the heck I was to tell his employee how to access HIS manager menu, and what was I trying to pull with having his employee ring up stuff that wasn't in inventory, and how the heck did I know anything about their system. I just said ""Yeah, I used to work at (low numbered store) back when the POS system was released, and y'all probably do it differently these days, but we had to use those menus because things were pretty broken when they were first installed."" That didn't appease Fatty McManager, though -- he said it was VERY irregular, and pompously declared that I should give him my associate number if I was indeed an employee. 

This company's POS system assigned a number to each associate for life. They were sequential, so you could tell when someone had been hired by how low their associate number was. 

I gave it to him, told him ""You can look me up in the computer (F8, menu 41), here's my driver's license. Address is obviously different but the name's the same, and so's the cell phone number. Oh, and what's your associate number?"" His was well up past a quarter million. I asked him if a particular district manager still worked for the company, and confided that his associate number was in the double digits. 

I got my film, and after Mr. McManager deflated, he actually gave me the employee discount, even though I didn't ask for it.

A van full of stuff in the back and on the roof pulled up across the street and I walked across with a dolly to help. A guy got out of the vehicle with his wife and daughter. This must've been the most stuff I saw all day. A lot of the time, I'll hear people say, ""What, are you taking your entire room with you to college!?"" Well, this time it *definitely* applied: large television, a slightly-smaller-than-usual couch, another desk, and a ton of large, plastic containers full of who-knows-what. 

This particular girl took about half an hour to get her stuff from outside to her room, and it was a lot of work. The dad tried to tip me $20, and I refused it (if we were caught taking money, we weren't allowed to do it anymore). He asked again and I said I really couldn't. 

Then, he asked, ""Well, what if I commanded you take my money?"" I just gave a slight nod of ""I guess."" So he proceeded to yell, ""Look! I work hard for my money and so did you! Take this tip NOW!""

If you need your glasses to see things up close, then they are reading glasses, in which case your prescription may be wrong, and you're entitled to get them checked.

If you need your glasses to see things far away you are short sighted. This means your glasses correct your vision for far away things, but not close up, because you don't need your close up vision corrected. If you're now squinting to read things that means you now need reading glasses (so if you need glasses to see things far away and now you need reading glasses as well, then that means you'll need to get bifocals, or you can keep your current pair and get another pair of glasses especially for reading).

This is just a simplified explanation, I'm in no way clinically trained, but I do work for an opticians so this is the sort of troubleshooting I do on a daily basis.

Her response, I shit you not, was ""Well you don't have a sign on the door. I checked. If dogs aren't allowed you should have a sign on the door."" 

The barista and her go back and forth a bit, him insisting that he cannot let the dog stay as it is a food service establishment and it's clearly not a service dog, and her insisting that it's not fair because there's no sign on the door.

The resolution? The barista said ""Fine, why don't you tell me what you want and then you can take the dog outside and I'll bring it to you."" To which she happily responded ""Ok!"" and got to skip to the front of the line. What. The. Fuck.

Blerg_ShutItDown,"Ohhh I have a related story, if you don't mind my telling it...

I was a customer in this story, but actually I have worked at this establishment as well. I was in a well known coffee shop chain, standing in line, and a girl walked in and got in line behind me. She apparently knew the two guys in line ahead of me, and started loudly talking over me to them. I look at her, because she's being super annoying, talking in that nasal-Kardashian-type voice about how she just wants to ""raaaage this weekend! Liiiiike, just get waaasted!"" Ugh. She was probably in her mid-late 20's. She was also holding a tiny dog.

Since she's being super loud, a barista notices her and calls out ""Miss, you can't have a dog in here! It's against food safety laws.""

Her response, I shit you not, was ""Well you don't have a sign on the door. I checked. If dogs aren't allowed you should have a sign on the door."" 

The barista and her go back and forth a bit, him insisting that he cannot let the dog stay as it is a food service establishment and it's clearly not a service dog, and her insisting that it's not fair because there's no sign on the door.

The resolution? The barista said ""Fine, why don't you tell me what you want and then you can take the dog outside and I'll bring it to you."" To which she happily responded ""Ok!"" and got to skip to the front of the line. What. The. Fuck. 

When I got to the front I said ""Well there's no sign on the door that says I can't rob you, so I guess I'm allowed to have all the money in the cash register?"" ",null,6,cdkpu5z,1r84yx,talesFromRetail,top_week,36

I'm definitely not saying you're not delivering a perfectly logical and appropriate response... Just saying maybe a different approach might make your days a little less awful. 

Of course, I don't work there &amp; don't know all the details, but at another holiday-driven retail store I worked at, I often took an approach something like, ""I understand that you shop here often, and we truly appreciate your loyalty. The purpose of the $25 minimum purchase condition is to incentivise purchasing ALL of your thanksgiving items earlier, to avoid the list minute holiday rush. It's generally a win-win for our customers and for us."" 

The main point I'm making is that (in my experience), customers appreciate being educated, as opposed to, ""that's what the coupon says, so do it, or you don't get the discount."" 

The other way to handle it is, when they say they're buying a turkey &amp; want to use the coupon, say, ""Ok, great! I'll be right over here if you have any questions!"" and let the cashiers deal with it. I know... It's a shitty solution if you give two craps about the cashiers.

ZennerThanYou,"The key with these kinds of promotions (the kind that commonly elicit a negative or frustrated response from customers) is in the explanation. I'm definitely not saying you're not delivering a perfectly logical and appropriate response... Just saying maybe a different approach might make your days a little less awful. 

Of course, I don't work there &amp; don't know all the details, but at another holiday-driven retail store I worked at, I often took an approach something like, ""I understand that you shop here often, and we truly appreciate your loyalty. The purpose of the $25 minimum purchase condition is to incentivise purchasing ALL of your thanksgiving items earlier, to avoid the list minute holiday rush. It's generally a win-win for our customers and for us."" 

The main point I'm making is that (in my experience), customers appreciate being educated, as opposed to, ""that's what the coupon says, so do it, or you don't get the discount."" 

The other way to handle it is, when they say they're buying a turkey &amp; want to use the coupon, say, ""Ok, great! I'll be right over here if you have any questions!"" and let the cashiers deal with it. I know... It's a shitty solution if you give two craps about the cashiers.

Also, we when we ask a question, we put on a little act for an associate. Sure it's great you want to help but my level of caring about the answer is a 2 out of 10 and if I say never mind halfway through then you're still gonna try to help, like my sister's boyfriend who absolutely had to pay for his share of the bill when my family invited him to join us for dinner. 

So anyway, about 30 seconds after you leave to find help, I'm gone too because I can now gracefully exit and get the hell out of Dodge. And next time, no I don't have any questions. Thanks anyway though.

perfectdrug659,"My first job ever was in a small Italian pizzeria. I worked there for 8 months, and they shut down for some unfortunate reasons. After that, I got a job at another locally-owned pizza/sub place. 

When I handed in my resume, I was 18 with multiple facial piercings, blue and pink hair, and my clothing consisted highly of fishnet things. I was hired on the spot, yay! I've been with them for over 5 years, on and off since it does get stressful, and I'm not currently there, but my boyfriend is.

PROS

-Customer rude to me? I can tell them to fuck right off. No questions asked.

-I actually know the owner, he's a friend, I can talk to HIM about things, not have to jump through ropes to fix things.

-I can wear what I want, no real dresscode. Much more relaxed.

-I can get things ""on credit"" and take advances on my paycheck as I please.

-Everyone gets along great, and we've all known each other for years. For a while, there were 4 couples working, many family members, close friends, ect. I've been to every single one of my coworkers houses, and they've been to mine.

-Job security. Over 5 years, I've walked out, pissed off mid-shift at least 4 times now. I'm always welcome back, they love me and know that I'm human and can only handle so much stress.

-Awesome regulars. My store has been open almost 30 years, and there's many customers who have been regulars over a decade, which is cool. There's people who order every single day, which is crazy, but they love us.

-No one will ever rob us. We don't have corporate rules, we have a steal baseball bat. One guy found out the hard way, work got out I guess.

CONS

-Customers think that because we're a ""small business"" they are regulars if they order once or twice a month, and can get pissy when we don't remember things like their entire address or phone number

-Again, with the customers, they think we're dead with few customers. They give me their address which is a large apartment building, and when I ask for the unit number, they say ""the guys been here before"" Well, we have 8 different drivers, and at least 10 different apartments in your building order regularly! 

-People try to scam us like you wouldn't believe! They never get away with it though, but they do keep trying. And then we ban them!

-Owners/mangers family that SUCK and should be fired. I've had to deal with the previous owners daughter, and then the managers daughter. They were terrible workers, but they kept their jobs for as long as they wanted.

All in all, I'd much rather work for a small business! I've been with a big franchised company the past 3 months, and I'm going crazy being nice to people because I have to be. And uniforms...uggghhhh. I want to go back sometimes, but that place gets super crazy and stressful.

morgueanna,"I worked for a company that is now a large national chain but when I started it was pretty small. The pros were all the things you mentioned- very laid back atmosphere, regular customers, etc.

But I started to realize those were also cons as well. The laid back atmosphere lead to employees who were lazy and never got fired, so I had a lot more work on my hands because no one would make them do anything. Most of the regular customers were great, but then there were the ones you literally wanted to run and hide from but couldn't. 

When the chain got larger and more rules were implemented, it honestly improved the work environment. Sure, there was more paperwork and supervisor visits, but being able to hold people accountable for their actions took a lot of stress off me. And the regulars I didn't like so much came around less and less as the store became more 'corporate.'

Everyone's experience is different, but that was mine.

I have customers all the time tell me that they are so glad we exist, because we are faster, nicer, and generally more helpful than a ""regular"" post office.

For the most part, I agree with a lot of your pros. 

*No weird itchy company polo-- I can wear what I want. 

*if I have to leave early, it's cool-- someone will cover for me. We have a lot of regulars that are awesome and give us presentts at Christmas time, baked goods, etc.

*I know all of my coworkers... Really chill, fun to be around, and very comfortable with each other

*the bosses/owners are in and out frequently. They know me, and I never feel like just a number like I did when I worked large retail

SamNextDoor,"I've worked in a small, family owned grocery store for my first job for two years and currently work for a large corporate retailer that is easily identifiable in red. 

Small grocery store PROS:
- I knew everyone who came in and what their usual order was (bakery/barista). I would do my usual ""Hi, LadyWhoGetsRedVelvetCupcakes!"" Or ""Hi, ManWhoGetsBlackCoffee!"" They usually got the same thing every time. 
- I learned how to write on cakes and how to make latte art. Art is a hobby of mine and was excited to learn a new edible form. 
- I got in through a friend and was able to work with her and make all new friends. They only hired people close to my personality which can best be described as happy-go-lucky and friendly. 
- I was trusted with new tasks every week and became a jack of all trades in a matter of months from cashing to latte making to cake baking and sometimes other departments. 

Small grocery store CONS:
- was usually left alone on super busy nights where I had a line of 10+ people deep to work my department built for 3 people minimum. 
- the owner was a tyrant that was known to fire people without warning for a minor mistake. Once fired a close coworker that was there 7 years out of the blue because he was on break too long by 10 minutes, on the phone with his wife. 
- I was well under appreciated, I learned new tasks myself to help out the store and met with a measly ""they'll do for now"" when I made well over 200 cupcakes by myself, no instruction. Just seen it done across the way (5 meters) only a handful of times. 
- I was stuck with tasks I was not equipped to do nor thought was sanitary (ie. forced to change the women's bathroom toilet paper when I informed the manager it was out) he literally just have me the rolls of toilet paper and told me to ""take care of it"". 
- the customers in this particular area were absolutely horrid. They were as entitled as the stereotypical Beverly Hills trophy wives. They looks down at you as if you were gum on their brand new coach shoes or what ever expensive shit they had. It wasn't uncommon to see a Mercedes or a jaguar pull up and spray tanned stay at home mom stroll in with a little girl in ballet outfit (ballet studio next door) and she's holding a brand new iphone when she can barely spell phone. Not only that, they were idiots and very hostile. One seriously asked me what kind of cake was the ""death by chocolate"" cake, and there was a piece missing so you can see inside! Then he got mad when I flatly said chocolate and turned away. 
- and finally the one thing that made me turn in my two weeks notice: the entire two years I was there, I can count on one hand how many lunch breaks I received.

He gave them verbal permission to search the car saying they wouldn't find any booze etc. But forgot about the trunk full of stolen goods.

Techsupportvictim,"We had a guy, when I was bookstore, we were sure was jacking hundreds in DVDs from us and our competition. But he was really good. We never saw him in the act etc. Just we'd see him come in and later notice stuff missing that hadn't sold.

Found out later from a workers husband that was a cop about this guy pulled over for speeding. Busted tail light as well. Ran his id and found out it was suspended. And he was acting a little drunk so they pulled him out to do a field test. He gave them verbal permission to search the car saying they wouldn't find any booze etc. But forgot about the trunk full of stolen goods. All with our tags etc. We were able to make several titles to ones we were missing as could four other stores (another of ours and two from the other company). 

Since no one had tape showing him taking it the stuff or even a witness that didn't stick. But the driving with a suspended license violated his probation and triggered a third strike law.

I came across a lady and her son (~12 years old) trying to push a land-yacht (ancient Buick or something) off the road in the rain. It had broken down at a fairly large intersection on the north side. If it was the south side it wouldn't have been a huge deal, but the north side was backing up and people were beeping/yelling. It was, of course, rush hour.

I pulled my truck in front of her car and jumped out with my emergency tow strap. I told her to take it out of gear and try not to rear end me. I hooked it to and looped it around the hitch on my truck and found a nice sturdy piece of frame to hook it to on her car.

Popped the truck into 4WD high and waited for the light to turn green. Pulled her across the street and got her into a parking lot with a grocery store. 

It turned out that she'd left her lights on the night before and ran a fairly new (well under a year old) battery down to nothing. She'd gotten a jump and accidentally stalled at the light. She hadn't, however, let the car run long enough for the alternator to charge the battery back up.

My V8 truck struggled to get that battery a charge, so I can only imagine what they jumped it with in the first place, but after about 15 minutes we had the car running again. I sat with her and her son and talked for a little just to make sure it had the charge then I followed them to their destination to make sure everything was OK.

She tried to give me a $20 bill, and I told her ""Ma'am, I got to use my tow strap **AND** 4WD in the same day for the same thing (we live in Florida so this is rare), so believe it or not that's the most fun my truck's had in a while.""

I pulled my truck in front of her car and jumped out with my emergency tow strap. I told her to take it out of gear and try not to rear end me. I hooked it to and looped it around the hitch on my truck and found a nice sturdy piece of frame to hook it to on her car.

Popped the truck into 4WD high and waited for the light to turn green. Pulled her across the street and got her into a parking lot with a grocery store. 

It turned out that she'd left her lights on the night before and ran a fairly new (well under a year old) battery down to nothing. She'd gotten a jump and accidentally stalled at the light. She hadn't, however, let the car run long enough for the alternator to charge the battery back up.

My V8 truck struggled to get that battery a charge, so I can only imagine what they jumped it with in the first place, but after about 15 minutes we had the car running again. I sat with her and her son and talked for a little just to make sure it had the charge then I followed them to their destination to make sure everything was OK.

She tried to give me a $20 bill, and I told her ""Ma'am, I got to use my tow strap **AND** 4WD in the same day for the same thing (we live in Florida so this is rare), so believe it or not that's the most fun my truck's had in a while.""

They were going to the sons karate class.

It really was fun TBH. It's nice to help people when you can, and it really was fun to actually **USE** my truck.",null,2,cdjv9j8,1r4jqn,talesFromRetail,top_week,13

lilyofthealley,"An 18 wheeler blew past my car, forcing me to pull over in a flash or get crushed.  Scraped my tire on the raised curb, blew it out.  My mom and I limped the car into a parking lot and were still there lamenting the damage when a kid of about 17 pulled up.  We hardly had to do a thing, though we kept trying to.  My mom and I both know HOW to change a tire, but neither of us is particularly strong.  The kid chatted cheerfully about cars, nascar, and how his daddy had taught him all about cars and helping out when he could.  My mom tried to give him fifty dollars, and he repeatedly refused, saying he didn't stop for a reward.  Finally, she told him to take his daddy out to dinner or buy him something nice to thank him for her for raising such a good kid.  The kid busted out in this big smile and finally took the money.

She rolled in the station, nervously started asking me if she could drive home on a flat(think it was 2-3 miles). Kinda shrugged, she might have made it, but asked her if she had a spare she could toss on. Well, she's got a bad back, and her daughter with her just had knee surgery, so couldn't change it. It was slow enough that I offered to help, but told her I'd have to stop for any customer that came in.

Well, 45 minutes later, and five or six breaks for customers, I got that spare on, inflated it, sent them on their way. Felt good to help out, even though my hands were freezing, and my cheapo gloves were ruined.

Savet,"That isn't the law.

The universal acceptance agreement that your employer agreed to as a stipulation of being able to accept credit cards says they cannot require ID to complete a credit card transaction.  If the card is not signed, the procedure is to ask them to sign it or use a card that is signed.

Visa and Mastercard each have their own.  If you are making up your own regulations, you are creating a customer service problem for your company.  Huge companies don't like that.

Instead of downvoting, you can read the agreement...

Or the wikipedia page, which states:
""Unlike MasterCard, Visa does permit merchants to ask for photo ID, although the merchant rule book states that this practice is ""discouraged"". As long as the Visa card is signed, a merchant may not deny a transaction because a cardholder refuses to show a photo ID.[63]""

However, having someone come in and make drastic changes right off the bat isn't necessarily indicative of a bad manager. Sometimes it is the fresh perspective that is needed in an environment where stagnation reigns. The changes just have to be implemented in a way that is clear and consistent. 

My advice to you, even though you didn't ask for one, is play ball and don't become a resistor. As long as the policies he is implementing are going to make things better, don't fear change. And with that, help the other employees understand this, and help your new boss get the store to where he wants it go.

As a result, the employees do not qualify for medical insurance and the company saves a ton of money. There are also tax benefits. It is extra bad for the employees. They get lower pay, no insurance, lower pension, lower/shorter unemployment benefits, lower credit checks, etc. Combing 2 part-time jobs does not give you the same finance as 1 full-time job.

I've crushed several kids dreams while working at a certain California-based box retailer by explaining to parents how game ratings essentially break down. 

Now I know theses aren't exact, and there are exceptions to every rule, but I would tell parents that generally game ratings break down like so: 

* E rated game = G rated movie 

* T rated game = usually closer to PG-13 movie 

* M rated game = R rated movie

* AO rated game = probably NC-17 or higher.

Before she bought it, I decided to speak up and told her the TRUTH. Both the employee and the kid glared daggers at me. The mother was DISGUSTED that both of them lied to her and she drug the kid out of the store by his ear.

I spent a couple more minutes browsing the store and said employee says in a shitty tone ""Can I help you?"". I just replied ""Nope! Just looking!"" and left the store.

BloodBride,"Y'know, there's been something bothering me about video game age ratings and movie age ratings for a while, and this topic is what made me realise exactly what that is. 

The ""with parental consent"" part. 

If a parent wandered into a liquor store, or came to a tobacconist and asked their kid what they wanted, or there was any suggestion that the age restricted product was for the under-age person, even if by a mere day, we would have to legally restrict that sale because it's for a minor, and we could still be in trouble should someone report that case. 

The parent's consent doesn't factor in. There is no degree of being almost the right side of proper. Not old enough, no knowledgeable sale. 

However, with movies, video games and other items of media, the parent can tell you to shut the fuck up and sell their darling little turd a copy of whatever violent entertainment they want. 

That's what's odd to me. The video game doesn't suddenly become less violent or have less graphic content because the parent says it's okay. It's the same media as it always was, the same as alcohol and other age restricted products - they don't change in property because the parent says it's okay.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of all sorts, was shown age restricted media as a kid, and I'm aware that kids can handle it, that isn't my issue here.

My issue is that age restrictions are handled that differently. 

That it's okay for media that can effect psychological development to be just okayed in by a parent even if you know it's for an under-age person and you cannot be caught out by the law for selling it that way, but if you accidentally let slip a pack of cigs to a minor via a parent, you can lose your job and earn a fine.",null,1,cdiqj84,1r14xk,talesFromRetail,top_week,3

themikebrown,"Man, I've been there. The funny thing is that the same parents who would NEVER take their kids to see an R-Rated movie have no problem giving them an M-Rated game. I've crushed several kids dreams while working at a certain California-based box retailer by explaining to parents how game ratings essentially break down. 

Now I know theses aren't exact, and there are exceptions to every rule, but I would tell parents that generally game ratings break down like so: 

* E rated game = G rated movie 

* T rated game = usually closer to PG-13 movie 

* M rated game = R rated movie

* AO rated game = probably NC-17 or higher. 


Ok, why can't little Timmy play the newest Call of Duty? It's a realistic war simulator. 

What about GTA? Would you let your kid see Scarface, Goodfellas, or another ""rags to riches violent type movie?""

Shortly after Grand Theft Auto Sand Andreas released, I was in an EB Games just browsing. When a kid and his mother came in.

The kid wanted San Andreas. The mother actually looked at the rating and questioned it. but he was LYING HIS ASS OFF to get it. Pulled every trick in the book ""Oh, that was a mistake. Didn't you hear about that?"" ""What? Nudity? There's nothing like that. That was a mislabeled"", etc, etc. The mother actually seemed to buy into it. But what didn't help matters was that the employee behind the counter was making up his own bull shit and agreeing with the kid. Anything to make a sale I guess...

Before she bought it, I decided to speak up and told her the TRUTH. Both the employee and the kid glared daggers at me. The mother was DISGUSTED that both of them lied to her and she drug the kid out of the store by his ear.

I spent a couple more minutes browsing the store and said employee says in a shitty tone ""Can I help you?"". I just replied ""Nope! Just looking!"" and left the store.

BloodBride,"Y'know, there's been something bothering me about video game age ratings and movie age ratings for a while, and this topic is what made me realise exactly what that is. 

The ""with parental consent"" part. 

If a parent wandered into a liquor store, or came to a tobacconist and asked their kid what they wanted, or there was any suggestion that the age restricted product was for the under-age person, even if by a mere day, we would have to legally restrict that sale because it's for a minor, and we could still be in trouble should someone report that case. 

The parent's consent doesn't factor in. There is no degree of being almost the right side of proper. Not old enough, no knowledgeable sale. 

However, with movies, video games and other items of media, the parent can tell you to shut the fuck up and sell their darling little turd a copy of whatever violent entertainment they want. 

That's what's odd to me. The video game doesn't suddenly become less violent or have less graphic content because the parent says it's okay. It's the same media as it always was, the same as alcohol and other age restricted products - they don't change in property because the parent says it's okay.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of all sorts, was shown age restricted media as a kid, and I'm aware that kids can handle it, that isn't my issue here.

My issue is that age restrictions are handled that differently. 

That it's okay for media that can effect psychological development to be just okayed in by a parent even if you know it's for an under-age person and you cannot be caught out by the law for selling it that way, but if you accidentally let slip a pack of cigs to a minor via a parent, you can lose your job and earn a fine.",null,1,cdiqj84,1r14xk,talesFromRetail,top_week,3

I know it as Dirty Old Woman Syndrome. Old women in nursing homes should not be allowed to have dildos. When it's time for anything that requires them to be naked, if they own one, without fail, they'll have it inserted when you need to bathe them. You have to pull it out because it's a yeast infection risk. Often times, they'll ask if you, as a male, would mind just taking it out and putting it back in a few times, or sometimes, they will grab you by the shirt, pull against you, and ask what you plan to replace it with.

Four women in that nursing home owned dildos. All four of them would harass the male staff endlessly. I took to wearing a cup because one of them no longer had fine motor control, so when she grabbed my package, she'd squeeze way too hard. I'm glad they weren't bad enough that they'd threaten us with sexual harassment charges if we refused their advances. I cannot, however, forgive them for their habit of smearing their dildos on my bare skin, or touching my face with them, leaving... stuff... on my face, even my lips.
