She ended up having me call my manager over.  He handled the transaction, but could tell she wasn't being helpful.  So, he intentionally took as long as possible to process her exchange (returning two items and buying two others) and kept stopping to call back to the department the items were in and verify prices.  All in all, he made a transaction that should have taken about 30 seconds take about 15 minutes.

Even better than just wasting the lady's time is that she was supposed to get a $10 giftcard with the purchase of the two new items.

Once she was gone, he showed me the giftcard, asked if I was hungry, and went over to the food court to buy me food to snack on for the rest of my shift. It made my day.

After 24 hours, I logged on to find that my name had not been changed on my profile. I figured it just didn't go through, and went to change my name again, only to find a message that said I was banned from using the name change feature because they had determined that the name I wanted to change to (My real name) was clearly a fake name.

k-squid,"My mom had an issue with her name being spelled wrong. I don't remember what, specifically, it was for, but it was screwing her over because she was coming up as a fraud risk. She found out while searching for jobs.
Anyway, her name is Margaret. The wrongly spelled name? Contaret.

Wat

I also had a minor issue on Facebook of all places. When I had started on FB, I used my nickname (A silly one, too, definitely not something that looks like a real name. Let's pretend it was ""Purple"") and last initial. When I got to college, I figured it would be better to use my real name (Let's pretend it is Jane Doe), and put in the name change request. After 24 hours, I logged on to find that my name had not been changed on my profile. I figured it just didn't go through, and went to change my name again, only to find a message that said I was banned from using the name change feature because they had determined that the name I wanted to change to (My real name) was clearly a fake name. I sent a message to their support and said something like, ""I don't understand how Jane Doe is clearly a fake name, but Purple is a perfectly normal name. Last I checked, my name has been Jane Doe for the last 19 years.""

My name was changed within hours.",null,2,cdl0nw4,1r8lwy,pettyrevenge,top_week,18

I'm sure you are in reality, but that should get someone on their end to have a mini freak out and get it fixed quickly.

Good job on the name thing. I've done that myself once or twice when my name has been misspelled consistently. After the second time I'll purposely misspell your name and call it an accident.

gohomecatyouaredrunk,"Hate to rain on your parade, but calling the cops will most likely only result in a dispatcher giving out the vehicle descriptions you provided and the last known direction of travel over the radio. In my area it would be Something along the lines of:

""Radio to all units, standby for 78s (descriptions/bolo) reference signal 72 (traffic violations).""

Pause

""Radio to all units, 78s reference signal 72: 78s on a blue van, Florida tag XYY 555, last scene northbound on main street from 2nd ave. Single call complaint no further information, 2124 hours.""

If a unit on the road happens to be in the area and sees the van, they can't just stop the vehicle because someone called in to complain, they have to observe a violation themselves. 

If someone is following you like this, put your flashers on and call 911. Advise them you are being followed. Give them a description of the vehicle and driver and do what the dispatcher advises you to do.

Just to clear up, and I think in the context, ""got"" is accurate, but I might say ""received"" - since you received it at your ceremony, where you hammered the asshat ASM with his just desserts. 

But in the future, make sure that you refer to your ""earning"" the award. Because you earned it. Using the word ""earned"" is better to all scouts, past, present and future. You're part of the club, welcome to it, happy to have you - now - make sure you give back. ;) You'll have gotten something from the earning of the award, there will be a time to give back.

Maybe he had to work late and was rushing to get to a parent-teacher conference. Maybe he forgot he was supposed to pick his kid up after soccer practice. 

You were in no rush to get anywhere, and wasted 25 minutes playing games with three other motorists, two of whom had done nothing wrong. 

In doing so, you created an unsafe situation for yourself, the two vehicles behind you, and the unwitting truck driver, who likely had multiple vehicles pass him on the right as you clogged the passing lane. 

And why, really? Because a fellow motorist followed too closely behind you momentarily? 

Listen, I've gotten upset and spiteful on the highway before. I've hit the windshield washers to mist a car riding my ass, for sure. But I try to be more zen these days. The road belongs to all of us, it's incredibly important in our day-to-day lives, and it should be treated as something to share.

BTW, in most states, it's against the law to not yield the passing lane for faster vehicles. Seen those ""slower traffic keep right"" signs? It doesn't matter if he was speeding.
