A path where the Executive ignores the will of Congress, regardless of what the President's party is and the majority stampedes over the minority.

It started under Bush, but Obama has really taken Executive orders to the next level, so much so that I fear what the next President will do.

delphium226,"What we're witnessing with deniers a bug in human psychology.

They think that ‘alarmists’ operate the same way they do, i.e. that the alarmists ‘believe’ in some sort of dogma handed out by the high priests of climate science. And that these high-priests have a self-interest in perpetuating and propagating this belief to keep themselves in a job.
Because they operate in a world of beliefs and dogma themselves, a lot of deniers completely fail to understand that people can be persuaded by facts and hard evidence. They fail to see that ‘beliefs’ have got nothing to do with it – it’s the scientific method. It’s the facts. The scientific method is designed to discover the truth, regardless of what that may be. 

If tomorrow the science was suddenly shown to be fundamentally flawed and the scientific consensus moved to an opinion of ‘there is no man-made warming’, billions of so-called ‘alarmists’ would shift their position to match – not because of their belief – but because the science has moved on and there are new facts on the table.

Deniers cannot understand this concept. Deniers would not be capable of shifting their position to match the facts. All because they operate their lives within in frameworks of beliefs. 

Very few of them can be actually persuaded by hard facts - it's just not psychologically possible for them.

arguingwithmymonkey,"I have been reading a lot of articles about Blackstone.  Just because they have deep pockets, doesn't mean they know what they are doing.

The idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous.  They can't maintain those properties properly.  Each house has its own set of unique issues, because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves.  

The people who cooked up this plan, should have taken those billions of dollars and just bought large apartment complexes.  Oversight would be easier, the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently.

1. Blackstone isn't ""owned"" by any of those banks listed.  The fancy sounding SEC filing is just a list of who owns Blackstone's common stock (ticker: BX).  The list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage, which means if you as a normal person buy for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Value Mutual Fund, you own a portion of those BX shares, which gets aggregated in that list.  Not so evil...

2. The reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter, and safer.  There are no more zero money down purchases.  If you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans, then you can't also blame them for now *not* giving these loans.

3.  The ""besuited businessmen"" paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close.  These companies like Blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks, or at large auctions.  Not so evil.

4.  After buying the houses, they are hiring property management companies, contractors, and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible (within 90 days).  That's literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most.

5.  Blackstone isn't ""speculating on housing prices"", looking to quickly flip them, or creating another housing bubble.  The key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties.  These are all houses that already exist, and they are simply fixing them back up, and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way.

6.  Most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now.  They don't have 20% savings to put down, they are probably living check to check.  But their family and kids are used to living in a house, in a neighborhood.  They don't want to move into a 1 bedroom apartment building.  Now Blackstone comes in, and offers the opportunity to stay in a house, with the same schools, etc.  This isn't predatory.  People are paying rent, but now they have the option to do so while living in a house.

7.  Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone, they are in no hurry to ""flip"" them for profit, because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them.  The new boilers, new roof, and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability.  Most leases are 2 years, so there isn't constant turnover, and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect.  

8.  Eventually, the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company, and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work (See the recent IPO of SilverBay:SBY).  The company will continue to own and operate the homes, pay income to shareholders, and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do.  The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multi-family apartment real estate investing.  Not so evil.

Ultimately, this is actually making it *easier* for lower income people to live in homes.  While renting they can continue to save, and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budget.

Hopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what Blackstone and other institutional investors are doing, rather than just shake their fists and yell ""Damn Wall Street, Republicans, and Obama!"".

Why are they more worried about the drug use that would stem from marijuana (a less addictive drug than alcohol) yet blatantly ignore both the alcoholism and drug use that can come from early drinking. Maybe its because there isn't as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking.

Fartikus,"I had to drop my medication from epilepsy about a year or two ago, because the side effects were too severe. I started to have my hair fall out, an example would be; if I pulled on my hair lightly, at least 20 strands would come out instead of 1 or 2. I'd feel like an emotionless zombie, feeling like every word was on the tip of my tongue; having to contemplate on a sentence for what seemed like at least 5 - 10 minutes just because of the fact that I was taking 2 big horse pills, 250MG each, Depakote. 

When I ended up weening myself off of Depakote about a year or two ago; I had no alternative to replace it. I went from having a seizure every year, to every 4 months; now it's every month, and has been every month for about 2 or 3 months. I'm unable to get a job, or even drive a car because I could just randomly shut off at any moment.

The only alternative so far that I've been able to trust is marijuana. All  of these pharmaceuticals have too dire side effects, and I'm tired of having to deal with them when there's something that can help me, or other people without little to any side effects. But it's too expensive since it's illegal to use medicinally. If it were legal, I'd probably have a lot less seizures than I am now; and it upsets me people are stubborn enough to keep it illegal when it can help people substantially because of ignorance. 

And this is only one of the positive things that marijuana can affect; there are other disabilities that it can help, not to mention hemp can be mass produced for paper, or clothes, and [other various materials.

The law would clearly state the the persons would need to be 21 to buy it just like the case is with alcohol. Why are they more worried about the drug use that would stem from marijuana (a less addictive drug than alcohol) yet blatantly ignore both the alcoholism and drug use that can come from early drinking. Maybe its because there isn't as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking.

Fartikus,"I had to drop my medication from epilepsy about a year or two ago, because the side effects were too severe. I started to have my hair fall out, an example would be; if I pulled on my hair lightly, at least 20 strands would come out instead of 1 or 2. I'd feel like an emotionless zombie, feeling like every word was on the tip of my tongue; having to contemplate on a sentence for what seemed like at least 5 - 10 minutes just because of the fact that I was taking 2 big horse pills, 250MG each, Depakote. 

When I ended up weening myself off of Depakote about a year or two ago; I had no alternative to replace it. I went from having a seizure every year, to every 4 months; now it's every month, and has been every month for about 2 or 3 months. I'm unable to get a job, or even drive a car because I could just randomly shut off at any moment.

The only alternative so far that I've been able to trust is marijuana. All  of these pharmaceuticals have too dire side effects, and I'm tired of having to deal with them when there's something that can help me, or other people without little to any side effects. But it's too expensive since it's illegal to use medicinally. If it were legal, I'd probably have a lot less seizures than I am now; and it upsets me people are stubborn enough to keep it illegal when it can help people substantially because of ignorance. 

And this is only one of the positive things that marijuana can affect; there are other disabilities that it can help, not to mention hemp can be mass produced for paper, or clothes, and [other various materials.

Rednblu777,"The whole Obama experience is a case study for training the next generation of Presidents.

Summary items from the case study of the Obama experience include the following.

* The purpose of the President is to get the people to do real work on their own problems.
* When the people face their most important problems, they will blame the President.  That is their human nature; you have to accept it, have compassion with it, and allow it to heckle you without repression--even from your allies in front of the real-time news cameras.
* The President must be able to maintain calm while the people rave against her (I use the gender-neutral pronoun here) in the people's attempt to avoid the disturbing, upsetting, and frightening work that they avoid doing on their important problems--threatening and tough problems such as affordable healthcare, fairness and public fact-finding on ""fairness,"" keeping the rogue nations contained while teaching everyone ""fairness,"" . . . .
* The President has to expect the people to Disapprove with vehemence against her (gender-neutral again) when they, as the moral children that they are, become manipulated by the President's power and rule-bending to have to face their own problems.  (You have to see Spielberg's *Lincoln* to see how the ""Disapproval with vehemence"" works, repeatedly and expectedly and naturally.)
* Since the purpose of the President is to get the people to do real work on their own problems, the re-election of the President becomes critical in getting the people to face individually their own overall set of problems.  (You have to see the Congressional voting in Spielberg's *Lincoln* to get it--the individual experience of being on the spot and having to decide ""Yes or No."")
* Accordingly, American democracy would be greatly improved right now if Mr. Obama as presidential candidate for 2016 could force the people for a third time to face their own personal universe of problems and Vote--Up or down.
* The outcome of Mr. Obama's third election would not matter.  What matters for the success of democracy is getting the people to individually face as much as they are capable their own personal universe of problems and Vote--Up or down.

I keep feeding into the Republican network when I can the following suggestions.

* If you want to recall the Affordable Care Act, then pass a Constitutional amendment to allow just Mr. Obama and no President after him to run for a third term.  The people, if you are right, will defeat Mr. Obama and thereby empower you Republicans to dismantle what you think is an inefficient and ineffective approach to healthcare.
* You Republicans have very effectively tagged all of the healthcare problem on Mr. Obama.  If you allow a successor Democrat to run in the next election, you will have wasted all of your capital of having tagged all of the healthcare problem onto Mr. Obama.

&gt; #### Your best Republican shot at repealing all of the evil that you see is to put Mr. Obama out there for a third time for the voters to express their Disapproval with vehemence.  Look at it is an ""altar call""; God will do the rest.  Have faith!

* Hence, you Republicans should propose and pass a Constitutional amendment to allow Mr. Obama to run for a third time.  Just think of all the wonderful coke money disinformation with which you can hook and turn those millennials that you need toward you for the continued prosperity of the Republican cause!

Yes. Human beings have the mental capacity to empathize with somewhere between 100 and 250 people (it varies, person to person).

You don't feel any empathy at all for strangers. Those who claim to do so are lying because appearing to be empathetic connotes some sort of moral/social status.

Asking us to be empathetic is stupid. We can't be. We don't have the capacity. And, ultimately, I think, even if we could be it wouldn't do any good... poor people don't need empathy, they need to be treated fairly. I can do that without feeling any empathy for them at all.

&gt;Lies about Homosexuality

&gt;LIE #1: Some people are born homosexual.

&gt;FACT:  There is no conclusive scientific evidence for any genetic trait causing homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgendered desires.

&gt;LIE #2: Homosexual activity is harmless, so no one should criticize it.

&gt;FACT:  The consequences of homosexual behavior are devastating. The rate of sexually transmitted diseases among homosexuals remains very high, despite a tolerant climate. Suicide attempts are much higher among homosexuals.

&gt;LIE #3: No one chooses to be homosexual, so it must be inborn.

&gt;FACT:  While homosexual desire may feel very natural to some people, this does not mean it is inborn, positive or unchangeable. There is overwhelming evidence that homosexual desire arises from traumatic childhood experiences, such as sexual abuse.

&gt;LIE #4: A homosexual can never change to become a heterosexual.

&gt;FACT:  Thousands of people have overcome homosexual desire. A network of ex-homosexual organizations and psychologists can help homosexuals overcome homosexual desire. Many ex-homosexuals go on to marry and have children.

&gt;LIE #5: The Bible doesn’t condemn homosexuality.

Rednblu777,"&gt; Chester Sansbury . . . .

Maybe this author is a real person.

If he or she is a real person, then I am very interested in finding out why this ""person"" thinks of herself or himself as ""an old-fashioned conservative"" and an ""active Republican.""

Within my personal experience of every ""old-fashioned conservative"" that is at the same time an ""active Republican"", each and every one, at some moment in a heart-to-heart discussion about ""what to do about the problems of the world"" will balk at acknowledging the flaws in the system that must be fixed.  In my personal experience, each and every ""old-fashioned conservative"" that is also an ""active Republican"" will balk at either flaws in the 1) market or the flaws in the Almighty 2) God and everything that he, she, or it touched, physically or figuratively.

Specifically, the ""old-fashioned conservative"" that is at the same time an ""active Republican"" will balk at the flaws in the

* Market, where the most universal flaws and easiest to see have to do with evaluating realistically a woman's work.  For example, without being forced by governmental law, no market system will compensate a mother's work in bringing up a child to be a productive contributor to the ""market"".  That is, without being forced by governmental law, ""markets"" externalize costs wherever allowed, including externalizing the costs of bringing up the ""labor force"" on which the ""markets"" depend; women take the brunt of the externalized costs and become involuntary slaves--because women are flawed in that women, unlike most men, put up with being turned into slaves.

* Alternatively and sometimes concurrently, the ""old-fashioned conservative"" and at the same time ""active Republican"" will balk at dealing realistically with what is required to correct and fix “this magical planet God gave us.”  First of all, there is no way in Hell that God or any other non-physical entity had anything to do with this planet and what is wrong with it.  What is wrong with people derives mainly from the genetic defects that we humans inherited from the ancestors of the chimpanzees.  So in a very real sense, God and all the other comforting escapes from reality are merely mental blockades against people working together to fix what is wrong with this wonderful blue planet that we have; God and similar gods are only false solutions and false premises and get us only the kinds of Darkness and dimness that the whole of Genesis and every other Book contradicting science exemplifies from beginning to end.

Now the ""Progressives,"" shall we call them, have an entirely different set of balkings at dealing forthrightly with the flaws in reality.  But that is a different discussion.

So my question is:  What mental blocks keep Chester Sansbury from working with the Progressives to correct the Progressive approaches for getting the others, including the ""old-time conservatives"" and ""active Republicans"", to deal with reality?

Despite the success that the protesters have had in damaging Republicans, no one expects the GOP to lose control of either house in next year’s election. The party’s 2010 victory allowed it to control the state’s redistricting process the following year.

FortHouston,"It is very doubtful that this complainer is the first person targeted with an audit due to criticisms of *Obama Cares*.

Also, this man's insurance claims are shady.  Accordingly, it is fair to discern that he may be shady about the reason he earned that audit.

From another site:

&gt;He later reveals that his old plan cost him about $170, and the one his “insurance guy” offered would cost him $1500 a month, with a $13,500 deductible. However, the most expensive Obamacare plan offered to individuals over 50 on the exchange for South Carolina is $796.87 a month, for the most expensive Gold plan, and Bronze plans in the state start at $255.35 a month. Kelly didn’t ask him, but Mr. Elliott might qualify for federal subsidies as well. For example, if he makes $26,000 a year, that Bronze plan would be $163.42 /mo., less than what he was paying before.

&gt;He also said “Now with Obamacare, the man that I’ve got looked into it, they are not going to pay for pharmaceuticals or medical devices.”

&gt;But under Obamacare, both of those categories are mandated as essential health benefits.Either Mr. Elliott’s insurance man is giving him a bum steer, or something is being lost in translation. I’ve tried to get in touch with Mr. Elliott, but have thus far been unsuccessful.
