I believed there were people were trapped in my walls for most of my childhood... I heard them, after all. But if my grandmother came in for any reason, it would all stop.

Sometimes it still happens, and my doctor believes that both the shrinking/expanding and the music/whispers are a neurological phenomenon related to my migraines.

I believed there were people were trapped in my walls for most of my childhood... I heard them, after all. But if my grandmother came in for any reason, it would all stop.

Sometimes it still happens, and my doctor believes that both the shrinking/expanding and the music/whispers are a neurological phenomenon related to my migraines. He calls it ""Alice-in-Wonderland-Syndrome Aura"" or ""lilliputian hallucinations"" that cause the feeling of the room warping, and that sometimes children experience this but grow out of it.

I found it more fascinating than scary, though, and would often watch my hands or my toys and feel them holding still and staying the same as I see them change and move in front of me.  Usually it would go away awhile after I focused on it intently.  I grew out of it around the time I started kindergarten.

NarwhalBanana,ahh wow. It seems to mee it was attached to you. Well if the most of the incidents happened to you so it must of. Plus you grew up basically there so you were growing up. While we are young we see things. Things that are always around but as we grow older we either keep this sight or we loose it and forget. If she was humming tip toe through the tulips then i say burning the house down would be a valid option. That point you said you saw things from the corner of your eye interested me. I have no doubt that you did in fact see things and that's plain old creepy.,null,0,cdq04da,1rqd1h,nosleep,top_day,2
