As far as the past life regression goes, there are techniques that involve being hypnotized and some that do not. Usually hypnosis is only done one on one for past life regression not in a group setting. The other way is basically just like a guided meditation where you relax to a point where your mind is clear and then slowly recall vivid memories from your past going backward to the beginning of your life. Past life regression happens after you recall your earliest memories from this life then keep going and recalling memories from someone else's (or your past) life. You can find guided meditations for past life regression on YouTube.

I will be working with Steven king on a nut cutter book to be published and it's gonna take a while, I've already gone into discussion and we're going through the entire nut cutters past but I can't say too much. In short it's gonna be a while before we see a nut cutter 5 hope you enjoyed it!!!",null,2,cdn4isr,1rgwb5,nosleep,top_day,2

As for this message, who knows? the beings who you have previously encountered seemed to have no intention of harming you.  The membrane? maybe its the vale that keeps these beings out of our world.  The one part of this message that does bother me is ""to prevent further damage to your world"", implying that there is already damage which we cannot see..yet?

Before I moved into this apt (14 or so years ago) I had an incident where my landlord's son came in to my apt when I was sleeping ""to close the window in case it rained"" (not a cloud in the sky).  I slept with a golf club at the time, nearly brained the bastard.  

I'm happy now that my small apt building is mostly occupied by one family broken up into mulriple apts (the kids are adults mostly and they each have their own apt and kids as well).
