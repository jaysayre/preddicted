Rednblu777,"&gt; . . . that atheists Gaylor and Barker could “conceivably” qualify as “ministers of the gospel.”

Hee!  That one made me laugh!

A biker vet with long, flowing white hair and wire-rimmed glasses and combat boots--you know the type--gave me the best definition for ""atheist.""

""An atheist,"" he said, ""is someone committed to the political point-of-view that whenever God or any other supernatural stands in the town square and demands that the people bow down *to Me; thou shalt have no other Gods before Me, Me, Me,* the atheist is the one who will bring radiographs and X-ray machines to scan the innards of the Tyrant to find out His vulnerabilities so that we can put Him in chains and force Him through a criminal rehabilitation program to civilize Him; if He won't go back to where He came from or alternatively won't learn to act like a civilized human being and stop acting like a Tyrant, then execute the Son of a Bitch!""

Thus, now I have a secular definition for what is an *atheist.*

&gt; The Freedom From Religion Foundation, based in Madison, Wis., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational charity . . . .

So now I am looking for a secular definition for the *religion* from which the Freedom From Religion Foundation seeks to be ""free.""  Searching . . . .  Searching . . . .

I can see that my secular atheist, by my biker vet's definition, would certainly bring his radiograph and X-ray scanning machine if God or any other supernatural stood on the steps of the Madison, Wis. Episcopalian church and started twisting the shoppers at the Saturday Farmer's Market into prayer contortions against their will.

Freedom from *religion*?  What a waste of time!

How about something practical?  --like seeking Freedom From Republicanism?  Zeroing out the tax-exempt status of the destructive and superstitious Republican Party!  Now *there* would be a noble cause!

The acronym FFRF would still be the same--Freedom From Republicanism Foundation.

I think there is a legitimate place for the use of filibuster to block a nominee, if the president insists on trying to force through a choice that is extreme. But the key word is ""extreme,"" and filibusters should accordingly be rare because extremes (theoretically) are rare.

Democrats during the Bush Jr. years increased the use of the filibuster on presidential nominees above historic norms. Republicans — most noisily and notoriously wanted to change Senate rules to abolish filibusters.
When their turn came in the minority, Republicans not only reciprocated but escalated — to the point that half of the filibustered nominations in US history have come in just the past 5 years.

I think it's fair to call what has happened a perversion of the intent of those who originally passed the filibuster rule.

That doesn't mean I think it's right to make it almost impossible to filibuster presidential nominees.
The Republicans have a point in saying that they will use this new weapon to the fullest extent when they have a chance. Once they have the power, they'll forget that they're calling it a power grab today.
The Democrats have a point in saying they reasonably suspect that the Republicans would have exercised the ""nuclear option"" once they regain the majority, no matter what the Democrats did today. Maybe they're wrong, but given the way things are these days, I can't blame them for their suspicion.

Isellmacs,"Mobile re-direct warning. Text below for easier viewing:

A federal district court judge has declared “unconstitutional” a portion of U.S. law that allows “a minister of the gospel” to not pay income tax on a specific portion of their compensation.

U.S. District Court Judge Barbara B. Crabb of the Western District of Wisconsin ruled that the so-called “parish exemption,” which allows religious ministers to avoid paying taxes on the value of their housing granted to them by their religious employers, “violates the establishment clause” of the U.S. Constitution and must be discontinued.

The law, 26 U.S. C. § 107(2), has been on the books since 1954.

The tax exemption was estimated to cost U.S. taxpayers $2.3 billion from 2002-2007 alone, likely more in the years since.

Heralding it as a “major federal court victory,” the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which brought the lawsuit along with their co-presidents, Annie Laurie Gaylor and Dan Barker, offered an explanation of yesterday’s ruling.

&gt;Ministers may, for instance, use the untaxed income to purchase a home, and, in a practice known as “double dipping,” may then deduct interest paid on the mortgage and property taxes.

&gt;“The Court’s decision does not evince hostility to religion — nor should it even seem controversial,” commented Richard L. Bolton, FFRF’s attorney in the case. “The Court has simply recognized the reality that a tax free housing allowance available only to ministers is a significant benefit from the government unconstitutionally provided on the basis of religion.”

&gt;Crabb wrote: “Some might view a rule against preferential treatment as exhibiting hostility toward religion, but equality should never be mistaken for hostility. It is important to remember that the establishment clause protects the religious and nonreligious alike.”

&gt;The 1954 bill’s sponsor, Rep. Peter Mack, argued ministers should be rewarded for “carrying on such a courageous fight against this [godless and anti-religious world movement].”

&gt;“I agree with plaintiffs that §107(2) does not have a secular purpose or effect,” wrote Crabb, adding that a reasonable observer would view it “as an endorsement of religion.”

&gt;Crabb wrote that “the exemption provides a benefit to religious persons and no one else, even though doing so is not necessary to alleviate a special burden on religious exercise.”

&gt;All taxpayers are burdened by taxes, Crabb noted. “Defendants do not identify any reason why a requirement on ministers to pay taxes on a housing allowance is more burdensome for them than for the many millions of others who must pay taxes on income used for housing expenses.”

One study has estimated that in total, combined religious tax exemptions cost American taxpayers $71 billion each year.

The Foundation sued Jacob Lew, Secretary of the Treasury Department, and Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Daniel Werfel.

The ruling, which you can read in full, below, notes:

&gt;It is DECLARED that 26 U.S.C. § 107(2) violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

&gt;Defendants [the government] are ENJOINED from enforcing § 107(2). The injunction shall take effect at the conclusion of any appeals filed by defendants or the expiration of defendants’ deadline for filing an appeal, whichever is later.

In other words, the ruling right now is on hold until the appeals process is complete.

In April, when our convention was supposed to be held, he realized he was going to lose his bid for re-election to Chairman of the LPN and he post-poned the convention to avoid that happening. Pressure from both the state members and the National Organization (which couldn't get involved but was willing to hear arguments for disaffiliation) got Joe to hold the convention last weekend - but he knew he was going to lose as his months leading up to this were fraught with controversy, so he decided to make it look like ""I meant to do that"".

dweeegs,"An underlying point that the article kind of passes by at the end is the insane amount of money going towards athletics and spending in general.

[23 athletic programs in 2012 actually posted a profit, 16 of which were also subsidized.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2013/05/07/ncaa-finances-subsidies/2142443). On top of that, the increase in subsidies from 2011 to 2012 was $200,000,000 across colleges in the US (also from article).

Sports scholarships can be a great way to give young men and women the chance to get a college education. It should also be noted that most of the time, the big sports program (usually football, maybe basketball for certain schools) use their profits to fund the other sports programs at that school.

But, there's a point at which we have to step back and ask ourselves when enough is enough. Colleges should prioritize academics, period. There's no discussion to that. [Lavish spending projects are becoming the new trend in colleges](http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/sites/default/files/ssn_key_findings_eaton_and_habinek_on_public_universities_wall_street_problem.pdf):

&gt;“Public research universities have increased their institutional debt dramatically over the last decade, and the money is not being used to make up for shortfalls in instructional budgets caused by reduced public funding,” the report says. “Instead, many universities borrow to invest in ‘auxiliary services’—the umbrella term for expensive facilities like dorms, dining halls, stadiums, and recreation centers.”

And another view of the [grimness that is the ludicrous college spending fad](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/business/colleges-debt-falls-on-students-after-construction-binges.html?_r=0)

&gt;But some colleges and universities have also borrowed heavily, spending money on vast expansions and amenities aimed at luring better students: student unions with movie theaters and wine bars; workout facilities with climbing walls and “lazy rivers”; and dormitories with single rooms and private baths. Spending on instruction has grown at a much slower pace, studies have shown. Students end up covering some, if not most, of the debt payments in the form of higher tuition, room and board and special assessments, while in some instances state taxpayers pick up the costs.

&gt;...

&gt;The pile of debt — $205 billion outstanding in 2011 at the colleges rated by Moody’s — comes at a time of increasing uncertainty in academia. After years of robust growth, enrollment is flat or declining at many institutions, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. 

&gt;...

&gt;Still, higher debt payments and other expenses have contributed to the runaway inflation of college costs, and the impact on students is real and often substantial. New financial realities on campuses are imposing conflicting demands on college administrators: do they make their institution more affordable, or continue to spend money to make their campus more attractive? 


The spending is insane. I've seen it personally at my own university (UMD): $50,000,000 for renovations to a football stadium that added box seats (which, by the way, remain completely empty); $50,000,000 to leave the ACC conference and join the Big10; $60,000,000 planned to renovate a diner that has nothing wrong with it; $8,000,000 to renovate the president's mansion on campus... all this coming with threats of major tuition hikes. Thankfully UMD hasn't had anywhere near the level of tuition hikes of the rest of the country, but it is coming in the foreseeable future.

I don't know what the solution is. How can we 'force' the higher-ups to actually give a shit about student tuition instead of giving the fake ""we really care about student prices"" crap while making actions that show it's quite the opposite. Having campus votes on what projects to undertake? Who knows. But what is certain is that this has to stop.",null,2,cdlcjun,1raarh,politics,top_week,4

Da_Kahuna,"The idea of the filibuster is to lesson the ""tyranny of the majority""
Just because 51% of voters think that all left-handed people should be subject to a special tax doesn't mean it is proper.

Just because there aren't enough left-handed people to vote down such a law doesn't mean they should have to accept it.

The filibuster is one of many methods that are used to give the minority some protection.

After all when Reid was in the minority party he felt the Filibuster was one of the most important powers that existed and that without it the [US Senate would cease to exist.](http://washingtonexaminer.com/harry-reid-then-and-now/article/2539587)

And of course, much as Reid's opinion was different when his party was in the minority all those praising this action will vilify when the republicans have a majority. Oh, they will justify the hypocrisy by claiming that the democrats are only using the filibuster for truth, justice, and the American Way, but it will still be hypocritical.",null,7,cdl70ip,1raei7,politics,top_week,3

The company invests capital in automation and new technology. Worker is now more efficient due to said technology investment by the company.

Who should reap the reward? The worker is directly responsible for the output, but they are doing a job of the same skill as last year - yet producing more.

So the real question is do you value workers for the skills they bring to the table (in which case they should not get a raise for a capital investment by the company) or by their labor output (in which case they should).

Free market says the former - until workers are able to bring in higher level skills, they do not get paid at a higher level. ",null,14,cdlbr46,1rahqt,politics,top_week,34

**Average cost to insure a family**

Of course, the big difference is - In Canada - EVERYONE is covered.

* No co-pay

* No out-of-pocket expenses, which can still cost Americans thousands of dollars even *with* insurance.

When you look at how few Americans buy into COBRA with its far more generous subsidies and group plans (inherently far less expensive base cost in group plans) I think Obamacare is going to be too expensive for all but the wealthy- the 2nd poorest fifth get partial subsidies but those partial subsides are only on the premiums which is just a portion of the cost of healthcare. 

On the bronze plans the deductibles and co pays in many cases can be as high as an additional $1000 a month! Poor people don't have that kind of money.  

So, I think its not going to be the radical change people are saying.. Not enough of the poor who have health issues, are going to be able to afford the whole cost of for-profit insurance, not with the high deductibles and co-pays. **They ALL are lying about its cost, hugely understating the cost of adequate health insurance. Buy cheap insurance and you pay ten times as much if you get sick.**

The vast majority of tax provisions that help to bolster the bottom line of oil companies are actually tax breaks available to all industries.

ian80,"I'm more in favor of a higher minimum wage and a decrease of the 40 hour work week.

As jobs become more scarce and products/services become cheaper to provide, the value of the working hour needs to increase. The minimum wage also needs to adjust to a lower average work week, making jobs more available.

We need not live to work. It is, to me, a waste of a short and valuable life. Certainly it is a necessity, but the advent of automation never delivered on its promise: more free time. In a culture that defines itself by productiveness, this can seem a scary concept. There are richer ways to find meaning, though. 

That said, if one finds true meaning in their work, I'm not against someone working 60 hours/week *and* reaping the financial benefits. However, most don't find deep meaning in their work and would be happy to work less and still survive comfortably.

creepy_doll,"&gt; That’s the risk, I suppose. There is an alternative way to look at all this: an increasing number of economists are beginning to worry that technological change may make large numbers of people completely unemployable. In short, the robots are coming to take our jobs. 

We've been constantly advancing technology to make our jobs more efficent and productive. Eventually  significant parts of the workforces won't and shouldn't be needed. To have people living in squalor when we have enough to feed them and provide some basic luxuries is quite absurd.

Different countries deal with this in different ways. Here in Japan a lot of unnecessary jobs are created. At every roadworks there is two or three guys digging and a bunch more just showing pedestrians around/directing traffic(things that are really more of a formality than needed). It's a job commonly performed by elderly people who should be retired but don't get enough income from it so have to rejoin the workforce.

Placing this basic income we could tax employers more and they could somewhat reduce their salaries. With lower demand for jobs employers could no longer treat employees as shit. We don't also need to be as afraid of the loss of jobs(which is really a bit of an absurd prospect when you think about it).

Can someone please explain to me how this nice sounding idea on paper is even remotely fisable mathematically and economically.
We currently spend **3.8 TRILLION** each year, while this amount is decreasing, our revenue, which is **2.9 TRILLION** isnt increasing that much.

So please tell me how in the world we will be able to afford to spend **4.7 TRILLION ON UNIVERSAL INCOME** each year, where would the money come from.

And this 4.7 Trillion will mean that this is the only function of government, no other departments of government can function, we already spend over 3 Trillion on government right now.

Please before we have wet dreams about Universal Income look at the math and the economics, its unfeasable

[Money as Debt](http://youtu.be/jqvKjsIxT_8)

The problem with government issuing money directly is deflation, considering that currently banks create 9 dollars for every 1 dollar US government borrows (via treasury bonds). To address deflation the government would have to pay everyone a basic minimum income.  It's the upside-down of what we have now. To understand this paradox one has to examine the process of money creation... When a bank creates a loan out of borrower’s collateral (like a house) nothing new is added (or created) in the economy.  The bank does not print the money it simply makes an electronic entry.   (This is why real money represents less than 5% of the total money supply in circulation.  Also note that the bank did not create the amount of money corresponding to the interest on the loan which now has to come from the physical world.) What the bank did is add new money to the existing supply without backing the new money with corresponding value.  The excess in money supply vs. goods and services causes inflation.  On the other hand, when a government creates money to buy goods and services, the new money are created along with newly created goods and services so there is no disbalance.",null,11,cdlzmmw,1rci35,politics,top_week,8

Aren't those two separate things? It's still horrible and those bills sound helpful, but the title doesn't seem accurate. I thought rules were changed recently to prevent filibustering but nothing was changed that would require 60 votes.

Linked on the same page is [this](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/majority-rule-in-the-senate), which I thought was what was passed to stop filibustering.

Also, I don't think republicans require a 60 vote threshold, I thought that's what it was for any bill. Someone please fill me in if I'm wrong, I'm not too knowledgeable about these things.

As long as you ignore Detroit, Cleveland, and numerous other places where left wing policies have crashed and burned - not to mention the failure of the Stimulus on a national level - and also ignore the majority of economic thought over the last 50 years, then left wing policies look great!!!

On a serious note though; the right wing economic policy is focused on the long-term; the left wing policy focuses on the short. The mistakes Republicans make is in arguing on the left wing's grounds. Republicans, perhaps out of ignorance, always try to sell the stimulative effect of tax cuts. That shouldn't be the focus of the policy. The focus should be on keeping a low tax burden to encourage long-term growth and prosperity. Same with regulation. Republicans try to sell this idea of ""less regulation, and we will get an immediate boost in jobs. We will ""create"" jobs"" - no. Keep a low regulatory burden so as to not dampen private enterprise. It is not immediate - it's for the long term. 

Left wing policy looks good for a little while - but it is unsustainable. Detroit is a good example of that. The left wing policies worked fine for Detroit many decades ago - but it caught up to them. It always does. ",null,8,cdm3w4y,1rd3sw,politics,top_week,7

Both of my parents were born at home in 1936 (mother) and in 1939 (father).  Neither ever had a birth certificate issued.  Up until the mid '70s, people could use the baptismal record of their church (if Catholic) as a form of ID, but the government stopped recognizing those.  Non-Catholics had to rely on something else.

Both of my parents had Social Security cards that they used for ID in place of birth certificates for many years, but when my father had his identity stolen in 1992 by someone he presented his SS# to as part of ""proving his identity"" they ceased this practice.

My father passed in 2005 so he no longer has to worry about such things, but my mother has learned that she cannot renew her driver's licence at all because she has no birth certificate.

pcar773,"I had to work a job once down in south-central LA.  Not as bad as you think, but definitely sketchy after dark.  We were setting up a temp office in an area that was both industrial, and residential and we needed high-speed internet setup.  I literally called every cable company and none offered high-speed internet.  AT&amp;T offered base DSL for over $200 a month because we also needed to run lines to the building and setup a phone service.  A contractor came out to see if it was even possible to get cable internet and he said we were about 4500 ft too far away from the nearest connection (we went with Clear).  

I'm not from south-central so to be in a place where you can't get affordable internet was kind of a shock.  It sounds funny even to me, but access to information is really a basic human right.  Every single person deserves to know at least who they are, what they're made of, and why it's good to keep asking why.  

Many of the communities without internet access are also those without information access. Poor-performing or no schools at all.  Not just in the US but across the world.  Without access to information and education, the world becomes very small.  Down to the neighborhood and the block.  And as the world gets smaller, so do the opportunities and the ideas for the future.  And without a future, selling crack or robbing a convenience store doesn't seem like such a big deal.

Prisons cost taxpayers more than $32 billion a year. Every year that an inmate spends in prison costs $22,000. An individual sentenced to five years for a $300 theft costs the public more than $100,000. The cost of a life term averages $1.5 million.  Over the course of the last 20 years, the amount of money spent on prisons was increased by 570% while that spent on elementary and secondary education was increased by only 33%.

One is that to fight gang violence, we must increase the use of police force, and reduce the availability of guns in the neighborhoods. This is not cheap, but that's one way to approach it.

Another way is to reduce police and *increase* gun availability. Mathematical modeling of the behavior shows that if gang members shoot one another more often, there will be simply fewer gang members, until one gang wins over or they reach some kind of truce.

The American manufacturing base is gone.  Communist China is flooding American markets with poorly made and sometimes outright dangerous goods.  

Do you have any idea how much of our food comes from communist China?  There are no food safety regulations in communist China.  The FDA inspects only 1% of the food communist China imports into America.  Communist China is undergoing a process of rapid militarization the world hasn't seen since the 1930s.  How many components of American warplanes are made in communist China?  Does it sit well with you that an adversary is building parts of our weapons?  

You know those Christmas lights you got for so cheap at Walmart?  Odds are a child slave in communist China assembled them during his or her 16 hour work day.

And don't think calling your representatives in Washington is going to change anything.  The same people who paid Clinton and the Republican controlled Congress at the time to ""open up trade with communist China"" are paying to maintain the losing position America has in the economic war against communist China.

CheesewithWhine,"The difference is that liberals (or progressives, however you want to call them) want government to work better through political action.

Conservatives and libertarians don't want government to work better. They see politics as a war against ""them"": socialists, ""welfare queens"", lazy union workers, feminists, gays, abortionists, urban hippies, left wing intellectuals, tree huggers, atheists, the ACLU, ""statists"", ""collectivists"", basically the ""evil"" side. This sentiment was exaggerated 1000% after Obama's election, as Obama represented basically everything they hate and fear - at least only on style, because on policy, Obama is a moderately conservative Republican. Expect to see parallels between conservative/libertarian reaction to Wendy Davis - think about the threat she represents against ""real America"".

To them, when liberals win, they lose. Governing takes a back seat, as they do everything they can to ""defeat the enemy"". Who cares if government is paralyzed and the whole country suffers? They can turn around and say ""government is the problem"" anyway.

Nothing is out of bounds. Astronomically record breaking filibusters of legislation. Publicly bragging about refusing to let Obama fill judicial seats. Voter suppression. Unlimited money in politics. Coordinated satobage of Obamacare.  Think of what would have happened if during the height of the Iraq War, Nancy Pelosi publicly stated she plans to sabotage the war effort she she can win politically - because that's what the Republicans are proudly doing now.

As the GOP's voter base is the rural white south, I highly recommend this [Salon article](http://www.salon.com/2012/11/05/why_cant_progressives_reach_white_southern_men/) about Southern pride.

They are on the losing end of demographics as the young, minority population, who doesn't share their culture of ""rugged individualism, God, Country, Guns"", continues to grow. Their pride has been hurt. Think about how Romney repeatedly accused Obama of ""apologizing for America"". Because to a culture that prides on religion, guns, and the military, that resonates. To them, Obama and the liberals are making them apologize again. If they don't fight, their numbers are going to continue to shrink and they risk permanent irrelevancy.

    7.) It takes longer to fire you than the average killer spends on death row.
    6.) The worse you do your job, the more your boss avoids you.
    5.) You think the French are working themselves to death.
    4.) You know by having a copy of the Holy Koran on your desk your job is 100% safe.

1000000students,"A sampling of the over 347 bills blocked by the GOP senate or not moved on by the Teapublican house since Obama took office

**HR 12** – Paycheck Fairness Act – While the Lily 
Ledbetter Act was a good start, this bill would have mandated pay 
fairness and prohibited pay discrimination based on sex. In other words, 
while Lily’s Bill made it easier for women to sue, this would have 
created fair workplace system with regard to pay. In other words, 
Republicans voted in favor of paying women less money for the same job. 

**H.R. 466** – Wounded Veteran Job Security Act – 
This bill would actually provide job security for veterans who are 
receiving medical treatment for injuries suffered while fighting in 
defense of their country. It would prohibit employers from terminating 
employees who miss work while receiving treatment for a service-related 
disability. Guess that answers that question; they don’t care about the 
troops, either. This isn't the only bill they have blocked having to do 
with the troops, either.

**H.R. 515** – Radioactive Import Deterrence Act – 
This one has to make you scratch your head. Basically, this bill would 
prohibit the issuance of licenses to import of low-level nuclear 
material and waste to this country. It specifically exempts nuclear 
waste belonging to the United States, and it allows the president to 
make exceptions where necessary.

**H.R. 1168** -- Veterans Retraining Act – This 
bill would provide for assistance to help veterans who are currently 
unemployed with their expenses while retraining for the current job 
market.

**H.R. 1171** – Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program Reauthorization 
– Once again, you have to wonder; what do Republicans have against 
those who have served our country? This bill would reauthorize programs 
in support of homeless veterans, to assist them with job training, 
counseling, and placement services through the Department of Veterans 
Affairs through 2014. 

**H.R. 1262**, Water Quality Investment Act – This 
bill would not only invest needed funds into improving water quality in 
areas where it’s needed, but it would also create jobs for those who 
work in that industry, 

**H.R. 1293** -- Disabled Veterans Home Improvement and Structural Alteration Grant Increase Act of 2009 – Here’s another 
bill in support of those who have fought for their country, passed by 
House Democrats and blocked from becoming law by Republicans. Clearly, 
Republicans hate the troops, because there is no other reason to be 
against this bill. This would increase the amount paid by the VA to 
disabled veterans for necessary home structural improvements from $4,100 
to $6,800 for those who are more than 50% disabled, and from $1,200 to

&gt;Then, when Israel moved to thaw its own cold war with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yitzhak Rabin assumed the Chamberlain role. “Earlier in this century, Neville Chamberlain thought he could buy ‘peace in our time’ by handing over the mountain defenses of Czechoslovakia to Hitler, who promised to accept a deal of ‘land for peace,” wrote Netanyahu in The New York Times in 1993. “The Rabin government is now betting the security of Israel on Yasser Arafat’s promises.” 

The peace talks did collapse (an Israeli assassinated Rabin, Arafat was blamed for the subsequent talks collapsing.)  By 2000, there was the Second Intifada.  Not that Netanyahu would have fared better, but he was right.  I hadn't really thought of that before, but it must have dramatically shaped his worldview.  

This is Bibi's (mostly histrionic) Times Op-Ed from 93 that's being referred to: http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/opinion/peace-in-our-time.html?scp=2&amp;sq=peace+in+our+time+netanyahu&amp;st=nyt

&gt;What will happen when terrorists attack Israelis in Jerusalem and return to nearby P.L.O. land? Or fire rockets from hills above Tel Aviv? The Israeli Army will have no right to enter the territory and root them out. This, believe it or not, is the ""internal"" responsibility of Yasir Arafat.

&gt;Astonishingly, this bizarre proposal that would result in Lebanese-style terror havens alongside Israel's cities was negotiated without carefully consulting Israel's military command. Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak was first shown the plan only minutes before it was brought to the Cabinet for approval. Chief of Staff Ehud Barak confesses that it poses ""grave security problems"" for Israel.

This came to pass and caused huge human suffering, in both attacks and reprisals.

Again, I don't think he's a good PM.  I don't think he'd have fared any better in the mid-90's (in fact, he didn't when he became PM for the first time), but Beinart is citing Netanyahu incorrectly.

kosherpoultry,"No one seems to have actually read this article.  It spends considerable time discussing how the word ""profit"" can be misleading due to the unusual accounting methods required by federal budgetary rules.  Without going into detail about those methods (about which I am hardly an expert), let me explain why it is mathematically impossible for the government to have earned $41.3B in ""profit"" from student loans in one year:

The total amount of student debt outstanding in this country, according to the article, is 1.2T.  Assuming the average interest rate on this debt is 6% (which is almost certainly too high given how many old loans carry a lower rate, but which is a conservative estimate for the purposes of my argument), the total interest earned on the debt is 72B.  However, the government's 10-year borrowing cost is currently 2.75%, which translates to a cost of 33B, for a gross profit of 39B (72B - 33B).  

This amount, which is already less than the 41.3B noted in the article, does not take into account several important factors:  

First, the government does not hold the entire 1.2T pool of loans.  It liquidates approximately half of the loans generated each year by issuing asset-backed securities (ABS) through Sallie Mae.  The government captures a portion of the gross spread value (the amount calculated above) through the sale of these securities, but the portion captured is always be smaller than the full amount. Otherwise, no one would purchase the securities.

Second, the gross figure does not account for defaults.  The lifetime default rate on student loans is expected to be a shocking ~17%, and the 2009 3-year cohort default rate (the actual 3-year default rate for loans that entered repayment in 2009) was 13.4%  (http://www.ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/attachments/DefaultRates.pdf).  A conservative, slapdash combination of these figures suggests that annual defaults on the entire pool are roughly 1.5%, translating to an annual loss of 18B, bringing us down to a total ""profit"" of 21B.  However, this figure does not account for the discounts on sales of the ABSs, or losses due to late payments (timing really matters when you finance using ABSs).

Some of you are now crying, ""But student loans are not dischargeable in bankrupcty, so defaults don't cost the governemnt anything!""  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  Just because the obligations aren't discharged doesn't mean the government gets paid.  If the borrower is bankrupt, the government isn't going to see its loan repaid, even if the legal obligation survives.

Third, and most difficult to quantify, is the embedded cost of the subsidized rate.  If the market/third-parties provided rates lower than the government's, then students would be flocking to borrow from the other parties.  They are not.  If I recall correctly, more than 90% of student loan value is initiated by the government.  This means that the government must be providing below-market rates and terms to most borrowers (even at the high rates that they currently offer), and is assuming an uncompensated risk-cost that is not accounted for in this analysis.  A certain amount of this ends up being captured through default rates, but given that the default-related figureds above are based largely on actual results, the true degree of uncertainty is unknown.

In the end, these articles are designed to inflame and give people a scapegoat for the state of their personal finances.  I take them with a massive grain of salt.

Yes students can default on student loans, it's called not paying, lots of loans simply go unpaid.

- You can defer loan payments easily without defaulting
- If you are in a seriously bad spot (like you're 21-25, independant, without a job and trying to get an education with zero parental support or in a bad neighborhood) a large portion of your principal is simply wiped off, so it's like a grant.

Disproportionate Share Payments (DSH) which does indeed subsidize hospitals for reimbursed care, is cut under the ACA...[starting in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disproportionate_share_hospital).

The theory behind this article is sound - without DSH and without Medicaid expansion there will be a gap in coverage (people under 100% of the poverty line who also don't qualify for Medicaid - this will vary greatly by State). This *will* hurt hospitals because they basically won't be compensated for providing care to these patients. However, *these* hospitals didn't close because of that - the expansion hasn't occurred yet and their payments haven't yet been cut. *These* hospitals were probably going to close anyway - if they were public it seems like the local governments are trying to pass off the buck onto a scapegoat because they didn't fund their county hospitals.

Of course it won't be billed as an attack on state's rights. But allowing insurers to sell across states lines is the purest form of ignoring states rights.

If a state wants to set a level of quality in their insurance? Too bad. The company can just go to a more agreeable state and still sell in yours. Is that not defying the rights of states?

Not only that but instead of people having to learn one set of rules: That of their states, they now need to understand 50. But really, we all know they only need to know one or two. Whatever state has the most relaxed rules.

That's another thing. Selling across states lines inevitably creates a race to the bottom. New politicians wanting to put 'jobs numbers' to paper will change laws to be more and more lax trying to pull insurance companies to their state, at the cost of regulation and fairness to customers.

Seriously, why is this not shown for what it is? An all out assault on state's rights to govern their healthcare.

Ok. How is one man expected to have a solution? Just because he knows what we have now isn't really working out, doesn't mean it's on him to come up with something better. It took legions of people to come up with the ACA. We passed it without even reading it! ""We have to pass the bill to see what's in it!"" We seem to be moving forward with the ACA, save for some delays in implementation of certain clauses. The argument that ""unless you have something better, don't knock what we have"" doesn't really work here. It's OK to stop going in a bad direction without having a plan, rather than heading further down the bad path.

Most people complaining about the ""stand your ground"" law have on idea what's in it.
There is no ""shoot first law"" and ""I felt threatened"" is not justification for deadly force.

That said, after flipping through several college majors, I've only seen business/accounting and engineering/science majors to be heavy hit by the cost of textbooks. I don't necessarily agree that the most modern edition is the best written edition, when so much of the science has been ""flattened"" by the mid 1960's - esp regarding chemistry. Some of the best written work, remains to the original genitors. Some theses works are collected by Dover Publications (for math, physics), University Science Books (for chemistry), and other small houses (Hackett Publishing for political philosophy). Comp Sci to an extent has their classics (Little Schemer, LISP, Ritchie, Design Patterns, Dragon book, Knuth, etc) that are belong to their publishing houses and be found affordably.

Instead of a government initiative of basically reinventing the wheel (of rewriting classic texts), I say universities should be pressured into offering one of the classic works to be used as full supplement to the class, on top of the mainline brand new publishers.

For example. *Calculus Made Easy* by Silvanus P. Thompson should be in every single high school.

That said, I'm not against modern new textbooks. While some of the new material is unnecessarily and garbage, there's an absolute list of terrible engineering textbooks (signals and systems). There should be an incentive to write a new version of those textbooks.

That said. Accounting will never be ""flattened"" out, due the changes in regulation. Publishers will churn out a new edition every year, which easily cost $300/pop.",null,0,cdn7exz,1rfc6d,politics,top_week,1

Whether they run their own bookstores, or if they are run by a third party like Barnes &amp; noble, the university is marking up the cost of the books and pocketing the margin. For stores run by B&amp;N and others, it can be as much as 15%.  This is on top of the wholesale cost of the books, overhead, etc. Think abut that for a minute: the school you pay thousands of dollars to each semester extracts even more cash from you by controlling your access to the educational materials you need to do well in those classes. This is why companies like Chegg have sprung up- they can offer cheaper prices through lower overhead (no physical bookstore) nor do they pay commission to the school.

Also, this bill seems to give grant money to colleges that use open source publications, and I see that as a giveaway to universities, which have been raising tuition prices every chance they can get.

Savita Halappanavar (31), a dentist, presented with back pain at the hospital on October 21st, was found to be miscarrying, and died of septicaemia a week later.

Her husband, Praveen Halappanavar (34), an engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, says she asked several times over a three-day period that the pregnancy be terminated. He says that, having been told she was miscarrying, and after one day in severe pain, Ms Halappanavar asked for a medical termination.

This was refused, he says, because the foetal heartbeat was still present and they were told, “this is a Catholic country”.

She spent a further 2½ days “in agony” until the foetal heartbeat stopped.

The dead foetus was removed and Savita was taken to the high dependency unit and then the intensive care unit, where she died of septicaemia on the 28th.

Does universal insurance address this as theyll now be paying for their hospital bill and have to rake those costs into consideration?  I'd rather not factor in abortion as a health risk if it's such a controversial moral issue.

Contraception and educational outreach should be adequate I think.  And even if it isn't hopefully it will spur us to increase the capability and efficiency of the our social safety net.  When half the population thinks it's tantamount to murder, we shouldn't make it hard for them to make the choice to not subsidize it.  Currently few plans in the exchanges are offered that don't cover elective abortions, so the remaining plans force those consumers to pick plans that are otherwise inferior for their needs.

To make a more concise point - Quality education, a stronger safety net that enables parents to provide that, and universal health coverage (including contraceptives) should be adequate in addressing  the issue of unwanted pregnancies.

It's also interesting to see how usually reddit is very pro-science, they tend to ignore the advancements in knowledge with regard to this topic.

Morally it's really hard to argue that a pro choice slant is the morally superior side, the science has taught us too much about the process of life, so much that a pro-life oriented position seems to be morally superior.

I'm not suggesting that we go balls deep and ban every single instance of abortion, but it seems morally we would want to have a pro life slant to our laws and processes to protect our future generation of the species.

There is no perfect answer to this problem, and its a mockery for people to suggest that your position on the issue can be boiled down to a catch phrase like ""I'm Pro Choice or Pro Life"" it's far more complicated than that and don't denigrate it by making it so shorthanded. 

We as humans should be doing as much as we can to protect the lives of our future generations, improving sex ed and condom access to prevent as many unwanted pregnancies as possible, having as much charity and assistance for children in poverty as possible(I can tell you the Michigan Right to Life does this, including setting up daycares and helping single mothers finish their college degrees) And as a last resort having the abortion option.

I'm all for womens rights and them having a choice, but we also need to be protecting the life of the child who didn't chose this either, however as I said, this problem should be being addressed before someone is getting pregnant in the first place.

Also anyone who compares the US abortion laws to Haiti or the Dominican, should be ridiculed and shunned, that's ridiculously blown out of proportion and is a byproduct of the notorious circle jerk of the liberal slanted reddit here, and no intelligent person should respect a post like that.",null,5,cdmsysp,1rfeng,politics,top_week,2

Holland: What kind of specific activities did you find these private ‘spooks,’ if you will, doing to disrupt activist groups — or is disrupt even the right word?

Ruskin: I think “disrupt,” “surveil” and “conduct espionage” are all quite correct. They conducted a wide variety of espionage activities. One thing that they did to Greenpeace was they conducted more than 120 efforts at “dumpster diving,” where they would go onto Greenpeace’s property and essentially trespass and obtain the group’s thrown-out memos and the like.

BBI also had on its retainer an active duty police officer in Washington, D.C., who could help them get onto Greenpeace’s property. They did a wide variety of physical surveillance and intrusion and infiltration activities. And it appears that they did wiretapping, as well as hiring an NSA contractor who specialized in computer intrusion and electronic surveillance and that was all used against Greenpeace. Theft of a wide variety of Greenpeace memos — it’s a very long and complicated list of espionage activities.

Holland: And have you found instances where they actually infiltrated these groups, where they posed as activists themselves to get on the inside?

Ruskin: We found that that was the most common form of espionage, where a company would hire an intelligence person, who would then either pose as a volunteer or as a journalist and then vacuum up a lot of information.",null,0,cdn3gs8,1rfftf,politics,top_week,1

Policy led to shipping the middle-class jobs abroad and turning them into slave labor class jobs in developing nations, leaving the middle class nothing but the cheap jobs at home, while simultaneously all checks and balances on the banks were removed so they could gouge everybody and create housing bubbles and the like to really drive the wealth inequality to its absolute historical peak.

But that said, those jobs aren't coming back. Ever. Because the next step, after exploiting the poor abroad becomes unfeasible, will definitely be machinery. Even Foxconn has famously bought 1 million robots to jack up their production speed and quality. 

And with that said, capitalism is done.

I [posted this to /r/politics a while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1nidvl/unionization_reduces_working_poverty_for_both/) but it seems relevant here as well.

Full text is available for free: 

Abstract:

&gt; Although the working poor are a much larger population than the unemployed poor, U.S. poverty research devotes much more attention to joblessness than to working poverty. Research that does exist on working poverty concentrates on demographics and economic performance and neglects institutions. Building on literatures on comparative institutions, unionization, and states as polities, we examine the influence of a potentially important labor market institution for working poverty: the level of unionization in a state. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) for the United States, we estimate (1) multi-level logit models of poverty among employed households in 2010; and (2) two-way fixed-effects models of working poverty across seven waves of data from 1991 to 2010. Further, we replicate the analyses with the Current Population Survey while controlling for household unionization, and assess unionization’s potential influence on selection into employment. Across all models, state-level unionization is robustly significantly negative for working poverty. The effects of unionization are larger than the effects of states’ economic performance and social policies. Unionization reduces working poverty for both unionized and non-union households and does not appear to discourage employment. We conclude that U.S. poverty research can advance by devoting greater attention to working poverty, and by incorporating insights from the comparative literature on institutions.

ralphslate,"Don't discount the role of super-sized corporations.

I asked my daughter what she wanted to be when she grew up. She told me she wanted to own a pet store. 30 years ago that would have been an admirable trade. Today it is near impossible because of the big specialty guys like PetCo, and the big boxes like Wal-Mart, plus, of course, internet shopping.

I can't think of very many small business ventures that are a solid bet for a middle class life. Bookstore owner? Nope, Barnes &amp; Noble, then Amazon killed them. Toy store owner? Nope, Toys-R-Us, Wal-Mart, Target, etc. killed them. Sporting Goods? Nope, Dicks and Modells killed them. Hardware store? Nope, Home Depot and Lowe's killed them.

I won't argue that the shopping experience in those stores can be superior than what a local store could provide, but is somewhat more variety and somewhat lower prices a necessity, one that we should trade our middle class for?

The main issue is that a small business has to support an owner with a middle-class salary, let's say $75k. If your margin is 25%, then you must do $300k in gross receipts to earn that. $4,100 per day, 365 days per year. That's a lot of books, or toys, or even hardware. At $8/book, that means you have to move 500 books per day, or 42 books per hour in a 12-hour day.

Thing is, Amazon can replace tens of thousands of bookstores by taking a margin of just 1%. That is their actual margin. How can anyone compete with that? Plus, Amazon can subsidize across product lines if they want to, using profit from toys to take less margin on books. Amazon doesn't have to pay an owner a middle-class salary - it only has to provide a decent return on investment to their shareholders, shareholders who aren't being paid a dividend, shareholders who just need to stock to go up in value.

fluidmsc,"The author of this article is presenting the findings of an economic study by [CEPR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Economic_and_Policy_Research) that claims to dispute the common explanation for social inequality in the US. While most people think inequality is the result of technology replacing low-skilled workers, the study argues that this explanation is inadequate. 

Here's the [abstract](http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/dont-blame-the-robots):

&gt;Many economists contend that technology is the primary driver of the increase in wage inequality since the late 1970s, as technology-induced job skill requirements have outpaced the growing education levels of the workforce. The influential “skill-biased technological change” (SBTC) explanation claims that technology raises demand for educated workers, thus allowing them to command higher wages—which in turn increases wage inequality. A more recent SBTC explanation focuses on computerization’s role in increasing employment in both higher-wage and lower-wage occupations, resulting in “job polarization.” This paper contends that current SBTC models—such as the education-focused “canonical model” and the more recent “tasks framework” or “job polarization” approach mentioned above—do not adequately account for key wage patterns (namely, rising wage inequality) over the last three decades.",null,4,cdmt42o,1rfftl,politics,top_week,12

I considered the war in Vietnam already lost.""[19] In an interview, Bolton discussed his comment in the reunion book, explaining that he decided to avoid service in Vietnam because ""by the time I was about to graduate in 1970, it was clear to me that opponents of the Vietnam War had made it certain we could not prevail, and that I had no great interest in going there to have Teddy Kennedy give it back to the people I might die to take it away from.""

Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), an 11-year veteran of the institution and the second most powerful Republican in the chamber, immediately turned to Twitter: “Amazing what WH will do to distract attention from O-care.” I kept waiting for the “just kidding, folks” follow-up, which never came. The Republican leader wasn’t mocking the caricature of unhinged GOP lawmakers; he’d become the caricature of unhinged GOP lawmakers.

She is taxed only on the $30,000 salary, and the only justification for that tax benefit is that in addition to the counseling and other activities that don't look that different from what the social worker does, her job also involves preaching, leading the congregation in prayer, and maybe proselytizing.""",null,3,cdmv8uo,1rg1pn,politics,top_week,14

RantsAtClouds,"There are a number of reasons why Iran hasn't achieved nuclear fruition. First and foremost is international pressure. They paused their program from 2003-2005 in the wake of US military action in Iraq. It was restarted again when it became obvious that the US was not willing to risk another major venture into the Middle East quagmire. This upset the Israelis because they had constantly said that Iran was the true danger in the Middle East and not Iraq (despite Saddam's bankrolling of Palestinian terrorism). 

Because of the fact that military action was not possible at that time the Israelis and the Americans used far more covert means to stop Iran's acquisition of nuclear weaponry. This took the form of the funding of opposition groups in Iran (and training them how to use weapons) including exiles. They would take them over to Kurdistan and teach them a number of different tricks of the trade. 

When it was believed that this was taking too long the Israelis began to take a far more hands-on approach. They began to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists. This began in 2007 and has continued to this day. That being said assassinations in Iran are often blamed on Israel and sometimes may be the work merely of opposition groups. 

Whilst all of this was going on the NSA (or CIA but most likely the NSA) was working with an Israeli army unit called 8200. This army unit specialises in SIGINT and attracts the brightest computer minds that Israel has to offer (a huge amount of hi-tech startups in Israel have been formed by ex-8200 soldiers). Over the course of a period of several years they developed a piece of malware called Stuxnet. Stuxnet was one of the most complex pieces of malicious code ever assembled. It also had a huge number of safeguards. It would only activate if it was on a machine that had the specific operating system, connected to specific hardware and was part of a specific network. One computer security expert stated that [""The attackers took great care to make sure that only their designated targets were hit...It was a marksman’s job""](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html?_r=2&amp;ref=general&amp;src=me&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;). All of this had the hallmarks of a professional, state-sponsored attack. The worm was designed to spin centrifuges incredibly quickly whilst showing normal operations to the person who was looking over it. 

However what OP (and several commentators) is implying is that conservatives have simply brought out Iran as a way to scare people into military action. There's some truth to that. However there's also quite a bit of truth to the fact that Iran is heading towards nuclear weapons. 

[Iran has often said one thing and done another. It has deceived the IAEA and openly acquired materials whose only use could be nuclear weaponry](http://www.isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/IAEA_Iran_8Nov2011.pdf)

Along with this Iran's continued sponsorship of proxy terror forces, their relationship with [AQ Khan](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/13/AR2010031302258.html) and their role in the Syrian nuclear program (along with North Korea) means that the immediate neighbours (Israel and Saudi Arabia) are becoming nervous at this deal. They believe that with the sanctions lifted Iran will simply go ahead and continue working towards nuclear weaponry. 

TL;DR: There's truth that Iran is 'one more year' away from nuclear weapons. Covert actions in the form of assassinations and cyber-war have delayed the effort by several years. Iran's nuclear weapons program is far more likely to be an actual nuclear weapons program than Saddam's. ",null,7,cdna52j,1rgebz,politics,top_week,12

Iran *is* a year away from a bomb, quite likely less now, and has been for years.  Japan is also a year to five away from a bomb, and has been for decades.  And we're okay with both.

What ""being a year away"" means is that **if** the Supreme Leader gives the final go-ahead (and he has not), and Iran raced full speed for a bomb, they could have one in a year.  Iran is currently building up stockpiles of 20% enriched uranium and other materials that could potentially be used for a weapon- the process is not linear, and it takes much less time for the final enrichment steps.  Based on their stockpiles and available facilities, we know how long it would take them to reach those points of no return.  If Iran maintained current stockpiles and added no new facilities, they will *always* be one year or so away from building a bomb.

If they increase stockpiles or capacity, this time will be reduced.  If they have more centrifuges and material available, then they could reduce the ""breakout"" time to a month or weeks.  And they could maintain that posture- no bomb, but have the ability to produce one if desired within a month.  Our media would then say ""Iran is a month away from a bomb!"" for a few years- and they would be right.

So, yeah.  Even though they are scaremongering, it isn't contradictory to say they are a year away from a bomb for years on end.  It's a statement of how quickly Iran *could* produce a bomb *if* they chose to race for one at full speed.

JoshTheGoat,"As someone that's actually attended a BLM Lease Sale,  this is good news. If you're not aware of the process, here's how it basically works:

* The BLM, as the federal government, owns lots of land. 
* Someone (oil company, mining company, etc.) submits a request to lease a tract of land from the government. 
* BLM submits the tract of land for a public auction, posts notices of all of the upcoming tracts so other people can either prepare for the auction or submit a protest. 
* Protests are typically for concerns regarding conservation issues. 
* BLM evaluates protests before the auction and will pull some properties based on whether or not they agree with the protest to conduct studies on the property (I'm not really sure what they use to make this determination). 
* Auction takes place and companies pay a one time bonus per acre for the property. Active oil and gas plays were selling for $3,000 per acre when I went. 
* Auction winner receives the lease for the property and pays a royalty in production. 

Protests are a good thing, but in areas that have been delayed production due to frivolous protests, it's only costing Americans. We're paying more people at the BLM to review these protests and we're delayed in production which increases gas prices over time.

This is not about paying $5000 to protest or demonstrate/whatever.  Thats nearly impossible to put a fee on.  This is talking about contractual protests or basically when multiple companies are bidding to use the land and one company wins if one of the losing company wants to protest this result (think filing an appeal in court) it will cost them $5000 to do so.  

The logic and rational behind this fee (and the fee to even submit an application if read the full quote) is that it prevents a losing company from indefinitely hamstringing a project by filing continual contractual protests or if they do they are paying for each protest to the tune of $5000 meaning it quickly becomes unprofitable if there is no realistic chance of winning the protest.

The $5000 part of the bill is an amendment to another bill which regulates permits for leasing of public lands known or believed to contain oil deposits. At the end of the document, before where the proposed amendment would fit, it is talking about scheduling, requirements, and reasons for denial of permits to use public lands for energy extraction:
&gt; ""Section 17(p) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 226(p)) is 
&gt; further amended by adding at the end the following:
&gt;             ``(4) Protest fee.--
&gt;                     ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall collect a 
&gt;                 $5,000 documentation fee to accompany each protest for 
&gt;                 a lease, right of way, or application for permit to 
&gt;                 drill.
&gt;                     ``(B) Treatment of fees.--Of all fees collected 
&gt;                 under this paragraph, 50 percent shall remain in the 
&gt;                 field office where they are collected and used to 
&gt;                 process protests subject to appropriation.''.

Now I'm pretty far from a lawyer, but my attempt at reading the amendment in context leads me to believe that the controversial $5,000 bit applies to companies who get denied use of public lands and want to dispute the ruling. $2,500 of it goes to the local office, to fund the increased enforcement manpower also called for in the bill.

**In short, it looks like it's disincentivising energy companies from badgering the government over bad applications to use public land to extract oil.**

Charging a fee that would be substantial to the overwhelming majority of the public to protest their government is such an enormous, blindingly obvious violation of First Amendment rights, I suspect it's just an issue of sloppy writing that fails to properly define the scope of a reasonable, deficit friendly bit of legislation.

Some basic financial goals:

* reduce expenses (ex tighten your budget, downsize your living situation)
* increase income (ex better job, nights &amp; weekends, second job)
* save an emergency fund.  usually 3-6 months living expenses.  for EMERGENCIES - broken limbs, getting laid off, severe car trouble you must fix quick, etc.
* pay off debt.  you need a plan to stop accumulating debt, and start reducing it.  Paying off a 12% interest credit card debt is EXACTLY the same as investing with a *guarunteed* 12% return - something investors would kill for.

If you have, or are safely working towards, the above, you should start saving in tax beneficial ways.

* put into an employer's 401k to get the maximum match.  This is free money!  Take it!
* put into a ROTH IRA.
* if your ROTH is maxed out for the year, start maxing out your 401k.
* look into HSA medical expense savings

START NOW.  Even if you are saving $20 per paycheck, that is SOMETHING.   It WILL make a difference for you!  If all of the above sounds like lala-richie-rich-fantasyland, please find $20 to put away.  Get into the habit of saving *something*.

The expenditures are inspected, approved, tracked, and recorded.  The problem is that the financial systems of the DoD are largely fragmented and as the money flows from system to system, visibility from the point or origin is lost.  The spending within each system is tracked, but the fact that the money can not be traced in whole is what makes the system unauditable.


I get sick of seeing this crap journalism where reporters completely bury their head in the ground and ignore the highly if not overly regulated procurement process, and say that all the money is being flushed away because it can't be accounted for in a wholistic audit of disparate systems.


Its really just a bunch senseless pot-stirring anyways because the DoD has already poured a bunch of resources into being [audit compliant by CY 2014 under FIAR](http://comptroller.defense.gov/fiar/overview.html).  They're already working on it.


Furthermore, it is hilarious how many people don't understand this in the article comments and the comments here, but that unaccounted for $8.5 Trillion that the author had to reach all the way back to 1996 to find (which as a % of total DoD spending over that period is very small) isn't just sitting in a box somewhere that we can unlock and throw at public infastructure projects.

Former DoD analyst Franklin C. Spinney 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_C._Spinney

Sun Tzu, the Art of War

http://classics.mit.edu/Tzu/artwar.html

&gt;- ""There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.""



&gt;- ""It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.""


&gt;- ""Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated;""


Beyond Vietnam, Martin Luther King Jr., speech given exactly one year before assassination 

http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_beyond_vietnam/


&gt;""A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor, both black and white, through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and I watched this program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything on a society gone mad on war. And I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic, destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such...

&gt; As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they asked, and rightly so, “What about Vietnam?” They asked if our own nation wasn’t using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent...

&gt;A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death...

&gt;It is with such activity that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said, “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.” [applause] I am convinced that if we are to get on to the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin [applause], we must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.

George Orwell: (1903-1950)

http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_(film)

&gt;""It does not matter if the war is not real, or when it is, that victory is not possible. The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be continuous. The essential act of modern warfare is the destruction of the produce of human labour. A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. In principle, the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects, and its object is not victory over Eurasia or Eastasia, but to keep the very structure of society intact.""

War is a Racket, Major General Smedley Butler

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket

&gt;War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. ***Only a small 'inside' group knows what it is about***. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.""

James Madison, ""Political Observations"" (1795-04-20); 

http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=875&amp;chapter=63919&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27

&gt;""Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed ***debts and taxes***; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of ***fraud***, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.

So this guy who was held hostage in Iran for 444 days has some trust issues with the Iranian government. HOW SHOCKING. Notice how the only thing we're supposed to take away from this is ""Iranians are not to be trusted"" with no nuance or explanation. 

&gt;Sgt. Rodney “Rocky” Sickmann, 56, of St. Louis, then a Marine sergeant, remembers clearly being told by his captors that their goal was to use the hostages to humiliate the American government, and **he suspects this interim deal is in that vein.**

LOL yeah, it's pretty much exactly the same as the hostage situation you were in, except there are no hostages, it's a completely different government, and *you weren't fucking there*.

&gt;“It just hurts. We negotiated for 444 days and not one time did they agree to anything … and here they beg for us to negotiate and we do,” 

OMG why would the US negotiate for 444 days in 1980, then turn around and NEGOTIATE when Iran wants us to in 2013? It's MADNESS!

&gt;“**It’s hard to swallow.** We negotiate with our enemies and stab our allies in the back. That doesn’t seem good.”

Change always is, you old fuck. ",null,1,cdne2ek,1rhtuo,politics,top_week,5
dbcspace,"&gt;“It’s kind of like Jimmy Carter all over again,” said Clair Cortland Barnes, now retired and living in Leland, N.C., after a career at the CIA and elsewhere.

The irony of a career CIA guy complaining about Iran's government, that *his agency is essentially responsible for creating*, being untrustworthy, is thick and hot.

Further, Clair's analogy of the current situation being ""just like Carter"" is complete and utter bullshit- since, you know, *THEY* don't hold us over the barrel here- *WE* hold them- unless he has inside information that once again the GOP is negotiating with the Iranians behind everybody's backs...

Make no mistake- this deal is the result of several years of pressure through US and international sanctions on Iran. People on the right will not stop issuing baseless complaints because they see this as another feather in Obama's cap and not *a good thing for literally everybody in the world except the few Iranians who would actually build a nuclear weapon.* Evoking Carter simply reveals the blind political leaning that drives this dickhole's low information ""opinion"".

SomethingImpromptu,"The military harbors rapists like the Catholic church has harbored pedophiles. Why should a priest who fucks a child (or a soldier who rapes one- or more- of their fellow soldiers) be protected by ""keeping it within [the organizations in question."" That strategy has previously resulted only in the leadership of both institutions attempting to cover it up, rather than punishing the motherfuckers. If you rape another human being, whether they are an alterboy or a US marine or anyone else, you should go to trial and see jail time. 

Being a member of an archaic and powerful organization should never be enough to protect you from justice. I really hope that this reform makes a difference, because I feel for the many, many women who put themselves in harms way and are injured- not by a roadside bomb or an insurgent, but by the people who are labelled their comrades. The idea that so many of these poor women have slipped through the cracks because a few primarily old, powerful, white men didnt want to recognize what was happening right under their noses and who were too proud or too hardened to go after the bastards sickens me. 

They seem to think there is some shame in going after these rapists- that it's bad press for their institution or that it turns public opinion against soldiers...

Tasty_Yams,"&gt;If we're going to see something like single-payer in our lifetimes, chances are it will come not from a grand reform but through a series of smaller adjustments to the current system. For instance, under the ACA millions of people will be moving into Medicaid. Perhaps one day we could see some sort of merger between Medicaid and Medicare, which could be justified on efficiency grounds and could get the support of doctors and hospitals if they could get Medicare-level reimbursements for their current Medicaid patients (Medicaid's payments are lower). Then you might be able to find ways to allow people to buy in to Medicare—maybe first people over 55, and if that works, maybe more people. Perhaps you could offer a public option (!) to people on the individual market but not to those with employer plans. Eventually, through a series of incremental steps, you might be able to widen the part of our system that already resembles single-payer and ratchet toward it taking over the entire system.

I find this to be a pretty convincing argument.

That being said restaurants can afford to lose money on interesting foods, glasses breaking, dishes breaking because all they are required to pay servers is enough to cover taxes for the pay week. 
This will hurt those living in smaller towns because the restaurant will put profits before employees. Two something an hour stings that much more. In order to do automatic grat, the restaurant will have to do more work. They will have to put tips on the pay check instead of giving cash at the end of the night. They will have to upgrade the POS system. 
I've served large tables both good and bad service before. It happens. Human error on the kitchen or from me. But if a restaurant doesn't have to money to pay its servers a fair minimum wage I think they should bend over backwards to implement the new system.

And if you forgot something you needed for dinner, you would have to, god forbid, ask one of your neighbors to borrow something.  EVERYTHING was closed.  Today, I have customers who come in to my store like it's just a regular day of the week to buy lottery tickets or a candy bar or cup of coffee, then have he nerve to tell me they think it sucks that I have to work on a holiday!  Then they give me the stink-eye when I tell them that if customers like them thought ahead and bought what they needed the previous day, I wouldn't have to be there.  When they realize THEIR PRECIOUS CONVENIENCE is at stake, suddenly all their sympathy goes out the window.

They could have slow motion footage of families eating meals and throwing the pigskin in the yard. Really hammer the point home.

The story and the commercial itself would go viral and be picked up by all the news folks. It would get re aired over and over for free. It's go viral on the net and on Facebook walls. People would naturally fall for its message because EVERYONE knows what a hassle it is to go try to find good deals. And, since we are all lazy at heart, we'd love to be part of a movement to help out retail workers simply by doing what we love anyway (eating) rather than going out into the mad house that is holiday shopping, day 0.

""While they cannot give money directly to a candidate, social-welfare groups can run ads or get-out-the-vote drives.  **They also can pass on money to other outside groups, like Super PACs,** that face fewer restrictions on their activities"".  

**Representative Darrell Issa** seems to confirm that the social-welfare groups **give political advantage** to one side by arguing that taking them away will disproportionately effect their interests.

""The fact that the administration's new effort only affects **social welfare organizations** - and not powerful unions or business groups - underscores that this is **a crass political effort by the administration to get what political advantage** they can, when they can"".

The irony is that  **social-welfare** is only socialism if it is given directly to citizens and not **trickled-down** through private groups. 

People should take note and introduce the biggest social welfare bill possible and call it the **small government and big business bill** to reduce the amount of government contractors (companies) needed to provide essential services (social needs) to citizens. 

Big business can then focus on creating those jobs through innovation that we hear about.

State legislatures in a number of states have refused to 'expand' Medicaid eligibility. True.

Apparently, state Medicaid expansion is the only way *on the face of the planet, in the history of the world*, to get the Federal money to the patients who need it. False.

The Federal money is available. If President Obama and Kathleen Sibelius really, truly wanted to pay for the medical care of those who would be eligible for 'expanded' medicaid, they could do so. It might take an executive order. It might take a Presidential 'waiver' for some. It might take a Sibelius ACA rule-change ""...as the Seceretary shall prescribe..."". 

This is a savvy political ruse on the part of the Administration to play helpless, hapless victim of state legislatures, while a pile of Federal money sits ready to pay for medical care. 

Have no doubt - if payment for medical care were truly the top priority of the Administration, they would find a way to spend this money, earmarked for state Medicaid, and pay the medical expenses of those victimized by state intransigence.

Foresight42,"I've always doubted how effective this would be as blackmail or a form of attack. How would you release the data?

I would imagine as long as it's nothing illegal, the average person would be far more concerned with the side of the story where NSA spied on someone's personal computer usage rather than what that person was into. Besides, as a victim, you could always deny it, and it would be very hard for someone to provide proof without damning themselves of what most would likely consider a much worse action. 

In this story, they were going after radical Muslims. How would this even work as a plan to discredit?

Kryzath,"The top byte of rhetoric currently floating around reddit seems to be
that 'The NSA is the big bad.' I'm sure for some it seems nice to
throw around these types of arguments to perpetuate an us versus them
mentality, but that's only going to hurt the US as a nation, the
American people, and even, quite literally, the rest of the world, if
the power of an unregulated intelligence network continues to
exponentially grow. And as it is, the dissension about a clear
strategy isn't helping the discussion any, because there are only
three major viewpoints that people keep throwing out.

**Viewpoint 1:** Voting 3rd Party will change something.

 **Viability: Unlikely.** The problem with voting third party is that
at best, any independent candidate is susceptible to blackmail or
manipulation by the Intelligence Community. If that happens, all you
get is a different face, and still the same symptoms of the previous
office. At worst, the candidate -does not want- the current status quo
to change, and supports the current powers of the NSA, for whatever
reason.

**Viewpoint 2:** 'Take the money out of politics'

**Viability: Possibly viable.** Taking money out of politics to make
the industrial-intelligence complex wither will only temporarily and
publicly stop the problem. If you have a organization capable of
blackmailing elected officials to support their organization, it
doesn't seem like it could be much of a stretch to say that the NSA
could blackmail say, Apple or Google to force them to donate to
Senators or Representatives, who in turn support bills strengthening
the NSA's powers because of that money.

**Viewpoint 3:** Defund the NSA/Some variation of weakening the body.

**Viability: Nigh hopeless.** The NSA is going to be a permanent fact
of American life. HOWEVER, that's not to say that 'we need to get used
to the idea of spying on Americans', only that 'spying will always be
a part of the government. Taking control of the NSA and using it as an
actual force for good is in the United State's true best interests to
keep our people safe. But a bill to remove the body would never be
considered by any elected official. It would be a political and social
death wish.

**American society needs to change.**

* Stop this partisan discussion, and encourage an open forum on these
kinds of topics. You can already see the outrage people on Reddit
have, but we alone have no hope of changing that. So instead, we can't
go at it alone. **Shout it from the rooftops, write publications, make
it known to -every- household in the country the true powers of the
Intelligence Community, and don't stop until the message is heard the
world over.**

* Re-imagine the idea of 'ending the NSA.' Instead of doing that,
propose new solutions. Call your representatives about proposing a
bill that slowly ramps down the domestic surveillance abilities of the NSA, but also eliminates the abilities of technology companies to distribute your personal information, and makes it a fineable offense to include ""metadata"" transmitting devices in our consumer electronics. Work on making information -truly- free, and don't allow partisanship in the media to divide us into factions and perpetuate fighting between us while the rich suits in Washington keep funneling our information to NSA servers.

* Make EVERY level of Government remember who they work for. As long as the idea of money, the lifestyle, and the office of Congress are worth more in a Senator or Representative's mind, rather then the respect and gratitude of the people for improving their lives, elected officials will always prioritize things like supporting the MIC to keep getting their checks over supporting the states, counties, and cities they're elected to support, and organizations like the NSA, or the FISC will continue for many more years.

* If nothing else, consider the idea of true, NON-VIOLENT, revolution. Organize en masse, and shut down the gears that keep these programs being supported with the wealth of billionaires.

Waiting until this reaches a peak will only allow organizations like the NSA to keep encroaching in on our personal lives, while we fight amongst ourselves about the best way to stop it.",null,2,cdodqal,1rkcq7,politics,top_week,5

Its about your government protecting itself and it's interests from YOU, and so long as there is reasonable access to education and the free exchange of ideas on the internet you will always be a threat to power.

They won't stop until they have a monopoly on the dissemination of information or the people are too fat/dumb/scared/all of the above to be a threat to them anymore.

If employers can use their religious sentiment to gut parts of their healthcare they provide for employees then what's to stop exceptions for religious employers providing spousal benefits to same-sex couples?  Here we're talking about maybe $20 dollars in birth-control a month but in my hypothetical the stakes are much, much higher.  

The bottom line is I don't feel comfortable allowing regular businesses to be imbued with the essence of the religion of their founders.  If these are truly separate legal entities that live in perpetuity then it doesn't make sense to give them the religious beliefs of their founders.  It's one thing if the organization is truly religious, like say a massive Christian soup drive, but it's entirely another matter if it merely sells glue and model trains (like Hobby Lobby).  

People will argue that employees are free to move around the marketplace but most reasonable thinkers will recognize that in today's world workers do not have a litany of options.

As a libertarian, I oppose Right-To-Work laws because they infringe on the liberty of 2 parties to engage in a contract.  If a business or industry is stupid enough to grant monopoly power to a union, that's not place for the government to intervene.  That being said, I also (by and large) oppose many aspects of the Wagner Act, part of which is the issue here.

The fact that you can't be fired for striking and that even if you strike for long period of time, your employer has to hire you back is pure BS.  To me, one outweighs the other.

&gt;**U.S. campaign finance law prohibits Google from making direct contributions to federal political candidates.** But Google has many employees who want to support an open Internet. So, in 2006, we created the Google NetPAC, a Political Action Committee. **The NetPAC is a transparent, regulated system that allows Googlers to join together and support candidates who share our common values.** Additionally, NetPAC campaign contributions are never made in return for, or in anticipation of, an official act.

and

&gt;**The Google NetPAC Board of Directors—a bipartisan group of senior Googlers—takes all the final decisions about the contributions made by NetPAC.**

&gt;While U.S. federal law doesn’t allow corporate political contributions, many states do. In states where laws permit these contributions, Google may participate with the sole goal of promoting what’s good for an open Internet. Again, these contributions are closely overseen by Google’s VP of Public Policy &amp; Government Affairs, along with Google’s Director of State Public Policy, and are also reviewed by Google’s Ethics &amp; Compliance team and outside ethics counsel. The private political preferences of Google executives, directors and employees do not influence political contributions in any way.

It also looks like they offer support to these organizations not money. You know there are a lot of people are google with different political views. In fact many techies consider themselves Libertarians.

&gt;Google’s Public Policy and Government Affairs team interacts with government and elected officials to explain our products and promote the growth of the web. In the United States, this team is led by Susan Molinari, Google’s VP of Public Policy &amp; Government Affairs, who works directly with Google’s Chief Legal Officer, who reports to Google’s CEO.

* The Dems can't lose the white house.  And, Obama still has veto power.

* The worst case scenario for the Senate is a 1 seat lead for the GOP for 2 years.  Not enough to really do much of anything.


* Republican gerrymandering has created safe republican districts, But, in doing so, they have also conversely created  safe democratic districts. There are about 5 swing districts left now.  So the House is unlikely to change much, no matter what happens.  


*Even if they pick up seats, it's unlikely to have any real practical results.  The House only requires a simple majority to pass bills.  They already have that.  Adding more, doesn't much change things.

It seems to me that simply giving people money without any conditions would only serve to validate this argument. 

It makes the government much less accountable. If instead the government had some conditions attached, they would simultaneously be pressured to ensure that these conditions could be met. If a condition is that people have to do something productive, such as getting a degree or apprenticeship, the government would have to ensure that those things are available to the welfare recipient.

Author writes:
*"" Many welfare recipients are required to undergo drug tests... If employed professionals are able to fulfil their duties at work while also maintaining a recreational drug habit, why should welfare recipients be treated differently?""*

In many professions workers are tested for drugs: doctors, nurses, any type of commercial driver, equipment operator, etc. Any job where the employee handles or sells controlled pharmaceuticals (eg pharmacist). any job where worker controls equipment or vehicle that may harm others. Security jobs.  Jobs where applicant handles lots of cash. Even working somewhere as mundane as home depot requires drug testing. 



*"" In fact, in the last year welfare recipients in Utah were found to test positive for illegal drugs at rates less than the national average, ""*

This is more likely explained in one of two ways:
It motived some people to give up recreational drugs.  This is a win because if the person is in such dire straights to qualify for welfare, they can't afford the luxury of recreational drugs.    This is more money for them to spend $ on essentials, a win for their family.

Or, because people knew about the tests,  those who preferred to use drugs made a choice of the drug recreation over government help.  Perhaps they didn't need government help that much to begin with?


*""Perhaps the best example of the demeaning nature of the current welfare system  is SNAP....Alcohol, tobacco, pet food, and vitamins are only some of the products that those on food stamps cannot buy because the powers that be have determined that they know what is the best lifestyle for food stamp recipients.""*

No, it's not that a bureaucrat in some office somewhere is making more judgements on a person asking for government help.  The author needs to look up what SNAP stands for: Supplemental Nutrition.  The program is designed to supplement the family's food.   Alcohol and smokes are not a food.   Food is a necessity.  Beer and plastic cups and dog treats are not.   How can you fault a food program when it was only meant for food?

I am not weighing in on whether drug testing welfare recipients is good or bad here. But the above statement is ridiculous.

The author states that welfare recipients are less likely to test positive for illegal drugs than the population on average, as if the illegal drug tests would be run identically on welfare and non-welfare people alike. A welfare recipient in an area where those recipients are drug tested is going to use illegal drugs less BECAUSE they are tested. However, the population at large does not expect to be tested so of course they are more likely to take and test positive for illegal drugs.

Yet somehow the conclusion becomes... see they test positive way less than the population at large. Therefore, it was bad to begin with. Serious causality flaws present in this article.",null,1,cdou1yb,1rkxmr,politics,top_week,3

God, why can't anyone ever write about what actually caused the recalls?  It isn't because they voted for gun control, it's because they arrogantly *refused to listen* to, let alone represent, their constituency on the issue.

I'm part of Evie Hudak's district, and the fact is that she needed only 18,000 petition signatures to initiate a recall vote, while in her election, she received over 34,000 votes in her favor.  Her primary competitor also received more than 34,000 votes. [source](http://data.denverpost.com/election/results/state-senate/2012/)

So, all a political opponent needs to do is successfully get the signatures of half of the people that voted for them on a petition, and then force a lower turnout, less representative election to go forth.  [The Daily Show did a segment on it](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-november-11-2013/not-so-angry-voters), which is a pretty solid representation of what actually happened out here.

Now, with that said, there were certainly some issues with Senator Hudak, and some issues with how the gun control issues were debated, and enacted.  The other posters on this subject mentioned how the gun control bills were quickly moved through the legislature, without giving a voice to everyone, specifically those opposed to the bills.  The outside influences on the subject turned it into a nationwide political move by our governor, with him likely to try and make a move onto the national scene within the next few years.  Finally, the levels of control that were implemented in such a short order were very controversial, and probably crossed the line in a state that tends to lean towards libertarian ideals on these types of subjects.

The other major problem is the perception of rural vs urban Colorado is growing.  Colorado has a little over 5 million people in it.  The Denver metro area has about 3 million people in it, and while a few of the districts are comfortably right, or major swing districts (Senator Hudak's being one of them), the Denver area tends to lean left, while the rural areas are almost always very comfortably right.  This creates a scenario where the conservative minority in the rural areas feel like they're being governed by a bunch of people that don't care about their concerns and their ideals.

3) Only a few young and healthy people will pay more – for most people, they will keep their plans or have something better.

4) The pre-Obamacare health insurance market was a “free market” full of “junk” insurance plans, which screwed people over and dropped their insurance when they got sick.

5) Obamacare is already controlling health care costs and it’ll eventually control premium costs.

6) Once you’re able to get onto the website, you’ll have plenty of cheaper/better choices and be able to qualify for a subsidy.

7) When people get covered under Obamacare, they’ll start liking the new system because they’ll get the same health care, but cheaper.

8) The Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which only neo-Confederates oppose, is giving millions of people access to affordable health care.

In fact, according to this metric, the United States has pretty much the same level of pre-tax inequality as Sweden and Denmark, two countries that are usually thought of as highly egalitarian. The United Kingdom, Ireland, and several other countries have pre-tax levels of inequality that are considerably higher than the level seen in the United States.

&gt; Where the United States does stand out is in the level of inequality after taxes and transfers. Judged by this metric, the United States is the most unequal of all the twenty-two countries. As Gornick said at the conference, what this means is that, contrary to popular perception, our system of taxes and transfers does less to ameliorate inequality than the systems other countries have. Take Ireland, for example, where government interventions reduce the level of inequality from 0.63 to 0.35, a reduction of 0.28. In the United States, the comparable figures are 0.57 and 0.42, a reduction of just 0.15. ",null,1,cdogtzq,1rlnq3,politics,top_week,2

The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard

20 “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 2 He agreed to pay them a denarius[a] for the day and sent them into his vineyard.

3 “About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. 4 He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ 5 So they went.

“He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing. 6 About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’

7 “‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered.

“He said to them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard.’

8 “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’

9 “The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. 10 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 11 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12 ‘These who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.’

13 “But he answered one of them, ‘I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius? 14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15 Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?’

16 “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”

* According to one (admittedly questionable) source, Walmart covers [48% of its employees, paying 67% of those employees' premiums](http://reclaimdemocracy.org/walmart-health-insurance-program/) (Sorry, I couldn't find a better source for this data)
* Back of the napkin math: We can estimate that Walmart is covering contraceptive costs for roughly 480,000 women, costing the company roughly $8.4 million/year. 

Walmart (somehow) does a great job of selling themselves as a Christian company. Think they won't try to save $8.4 million a year by ""defending their rights"" (it's a drop in the bucket, to be sure, but you don't get to $30 billion a quarter without pinching a few pennies)?

steveryans,"1) I don't think saying ""AIDS is God's punishment for gays and promiscuous - expressed by some of the most prominent right wingers"" (paraphrased) is accurate. I suppose if you meant ""prominent"" meaning well known as in - ""the Westboro Baptist Church are prominent and considered right wing"" I'd agree with you but other than nutjobs like them, I've never heard this argument made seriously or agreed with by any significant proportion of the right. I, myself and many people I know/talk to on a frequent basis are right wing and I can guarantee you not one of us thinks this. 

2) WHEN did Hobby Lobby have this insurance plan and was mandated coverage why they cancelled it in the first place originally? If they last had a plan that covered B.C. in 1977 and cancelled that plan BECAUSE they were forced to cover contraception then they're being consistent. If they had a plan that covered it for 40 years and then cancelled it in 2008 so they could make a stink about Obama afterwards, then yeah they're being assholes. The article's missing this crucial piece of information. Because at one point, many corporations weren't fans of women voting or working, but you couldn't cite that now as it'd be 90 years out of date.

3) Going against the slippery slope argument that seems to be pervasive: ""well if HOBBY LOBBY gets to deny it then who's to say what will happen!!?"" The public will along with legislation. Again, I'm right wing, I'm against the current format of the ACA as it is, but I think there IS a way to make healthcare universal. What that is, I'm unsure, maybe leave it to each individual state to tweak it to fit its constituency, I dunno, I don't pretend to know. BUT, hopping from one small company that's always been based in religion not offering birth control coverage to across-the-board passes on every extremist group and company won't happen. One, people generally don't work/shop at places that are extremist. For example, instead of hobby lobby, there's michael's, jo ann fabrics, tons of other local hobby shops that you can go to. If people vote with their wallets, these places will knock it off. It's the same logic as humane euthanasia: I don't for one second believe that if we allow the sick and infirm to euthanize themselves as they see fit, we'll suddenly have doctors snuffing out high school quarterbacks because they can. Doesn't add up.

coolbern,"Don McCanne Comment:  The new health plans to be offered in the exchanges are avoiding excessive premium increases by using narrow networks of physicians and by lowering payment rates for health services. The leaders of our nation’s leading organizations of health care professionals are concerned enough about what this might do to patient access that they met with Obama administration officials at the White House.
The administration officials were already ""acutely aware"" of these problems. Of course, they were. They result from fundamental design flaws in the financing model of the Affordable Care Act. The model was designed by and for the private insurance industry.
It is likely that members of these professional organizations are not only concerned about the patients, narrow networks and lower payments have a direct effect on their livelihoods. In a well designed system, patients must always come first, but the professionals taking care of the patients should be content as well. Grumpy doctors and nurses detract from an optimal patient care environment.
There will be more discontentment as the Obamacare model of high-deductibles, narrow networks, and payment restrictions extend to employer-sponsored private plans. These trends will no doubt expand with the proliferation of private insurance exchanges catering to employers - exchanges outside of the government-operated Obamacare exchanges. Even the private Medicare Advantage plans are being modified in response to their overpayments being pared back. UnitedHealth, the nation’s largest private insurer, has notified thousands of physicians that they are being dropped from their Medicare Advantage network.
Do we really want to keep headed in this direction?
The traditional Medicare program does not use narrow networks. Patients have their choice of their health care professionals. Medicare payment rates are higher than the rates expected to be offered by most of the exchange plans. It would not take much to improve Medicare, and then it would be an ideal program for covering everyone.
You can bet that the representatives of these professional groups didn't ask for single payer to be put on the table. Too bad.

WalkingShadow,"&gt;On August 2, 2011, the City of Camden and Camden County announced that the city police department would be disbanded in favor of a new county police force. Well-known law enforcement executive John Timoney was retained to develop an organizational and functional plan for the department.

&gt;The creation of the county police force in place of the city force was expected to save between $14 and $16 million annually out of the $60 million budget of the city police department. Unlike the city police department it replaces, the new county department is not unionized. Savings were expected to come from reducing the fringe benefits that had been required under the city's union contract.

&gt;The move was endorsed by the Mayor of Camden, Dana Redd, who indicated that the new police department would be more cost-effective, and that the high absentee rate of city officers had affected the former department's ability to keep the city safe. An official of the Camden Fraternal Order of Police, which represented city police officers, described the plan as ""union busting"" and called it ""a recipe for disaster"" that would replace experienced city officers with new personnel unfamiliar with the city. A community group known as the Citizens' Community Committee for Public Safety, along with the Camden Fraternal Order of Police, criticized the plan as being political, not practical. The mayor's political opponents also criticized the disbandment of the city's department.

&gt;The new department took over primary responsibility for policing the City of Camden on May 1, 2013. It reached its full complement of 401 sworn officers on June 7, 2013, when 92 recruits were commissioned.

&gt;On October 1, 2013, the results of a vote by County Police officers to unionize were announced. By a margin of two votes, the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police (NJFOP) was selected to represent the officers. The previous month, superior officers voted to be represented by the NJFOP.

However, some data suggest it also does not inhibit implantation.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/health/research/morning-after-pills-dont-block-implantation-science-suggests.html?_r=0)  

[Intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been proven to have strong spermicidal and ovicidal effects; the current medical consensus is that this is the only way in which they work. Still, a few physicians have suggested they may have a secondary effect of interfering with the development of pre-implanted embryos; this secondary effect is considered more plausible when the IUD is used as emergency contraception.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beginning_of_pregnancy_controversy)  [Even without the use of birth control, between 50% and 70% of zygotes never result in established pregnancies, much less birth.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beginning_of_pregnancy_controversy)

But the US budget is actually nothing like a household budget and its scary how many people think it is. That's not to say we shouldn't try and cut back where we can but more importantly we should be looking for ways to invest in the future like education and infrastructure spending. We used to build big infrastructure projects in times like this that not only spurred growth now but paid off for decades (TVA, Hoover Damn, LA aqueduct, highways, subways) but we do nothing like that now. Then you look at education and it starts to get scary. When we passed NAFTA everyone knew we'd lose tons of jobs especially in manufacturing since one day it was not profitable to build factories in Mexico where you could pay workers a fraction of what they were paying workers then NAFTA passed and the next day it was enourmous lay profitable to build in Mexico. We got some good things out of NAFTA, but the whole key was we'd be transitioning to a new economy which meant new skills were needed for millions so we were going to build up education spending to meet those needs, that never happened. Instead now to get those skills you either have to already be rich or willing to go a hundred thousand or so in debt. That has to change. On top of that, we need to keep up about 3% growth to say the economy is doing good, when was the last time we had 3% growth that wasn't really just a bubble?

harbison215,"Austrian economists claim ""you can't spend your way out of debt.""  Actually, you can.  It's call ""investment.""  You can't ""not spend"" your way to prosperity.  That's the only truth.

To make this easy for the simpletons to understand, let's use the household analogy.  Say your household is $10,000 in debt.  In order to get out if this debt, you stop paying your car payment, stop paying your bills, you don't any investment in stocks or anything of significant return, and you bury your cash in the backyard.  How the hell are you ever supposed to pay down the debt... Especially considering you lost your job because you no longer have a vehicle. This is what Austrians want to do with our economy's he debt.

Now, as for spending your way out of debt, let's use the same household example.  You current have $10,000 in debt, you net $4000 a month but you're spending $5000.  You make ends meet by using credit (borrowing money) which is further increasing your debt.  Common knowledge says that if you spend more on crap and junk, you will never get out if debt.  However, if you were to borrow a loan of $1000 to make an investment, for simplicity say a 'paper route.'  It's costs you $1000 of borrowed money to start this paper route, but the original $1000 investment enabled you to start this business that nets you $100 a week profit.  After a short time, that $1000 is paid off, and you are now making an extra $400 a month because YOU ORIGINALLY SPENT A BORROWED $1000.  THIS IS WHATS KNOWN AS INVESTMENT.

Investment starts as SPENDING.  Good investments generate returns eventually greater than the originally money spent.  IT IS BY THIS CONCEPT THAT ALL BUSINESSES ORIGINATE.  This is how you ""spend your way out if debt.""  ",null,7,cdp4l3s,1rnia3,politics,top_week,14

And the answer to that question is that unfortunately it is not possible for a Government to invest in truly profitable businesses, because all the profitable ones are taken by the private sector, which does not let itself be taxed properly.

So, Government spending will only result in more and more debt, simply because the printed money cannot be invested in profitable businesses.

What we have here is a difference of scale. The macroscopic world and the sub-macroscopic world (say, tiny insects and such) appear to work differently. Surface tension, square-cube, and so forth give us illusions that different principles are at play... but the physics remains unchanged. Bugs still have to obey gravity.

Government budgets and household budgets have a similar difference of scale. And it looks as if they obey different economics... but they do not. 

Saying ""the government can perpetually be in debt"" because the GDP growth offsets this is like a household saying it can remain in debt forever because the primary earner expects to get raises every 6 months forever. Such a person would be a fool. Turns out, such a government would be a fool, or whatever the government-equivalent of a fool is. Growth can't continue forever.

Saying the government can print its way out of a debt crisis is the same as the primary earner saying that he can put it all on the credit cards. Sure, it works at first, but pretty soon no one will accept this. You get to keep whatever loot you defrauded away from your creditors (mostly) but when they extend you no credit at all you're fucked. The household gets to live in a shelter, and the government... well, it gets to become whatever the equivalent of that miserable existence is.

The only noticeable difference to people like you and me is that size causes these budgets to act on different timescales. What takes weeks or months for the household takes decades and maybe centuries for governments. This makes it easy to become delusional, because you don't see the effects of bad choices quite so quickly.

All the fallacious arguments are the same for both though. The household of fools has someone (or several someones) talking about how they really need the things they want to buy (hell, it might even be true) and how you have to spend money to make money and so forth. But their ""investments"" are all shams. They have more to do with short term comfort than cultivating long term opportunity.

Such is the case for two of community psychology’s core values: promoting contexts that are likely to increase respect diversity and promoting contexts that are likely to increase a sense of community (Townley et al. 2011). Results of our model suggest that this community-diversity dialectic can result from common behavioral tendencies toward homophily and proximity. Moreover, given the universality of these behavioral tendencies, it is unlikely that community psychologists can shift them sufficiently to simultaneously promote respect for diversity and sense of community.

HetzerHetzesHetzly,"Common misconception seems to be that if wages go up a dollar prices will go up a dollar. This is possible if an employer is 1) stupid and 2) petty. The truth is:

**Labor is not 100% of a company's overhead.**

Assuming that prices will skyrocket from the cost of labor going up is fucking stupid.

Here's a simplified way of looking at it:

Overhead:

Power

Rent

Raw Materials


Manufacturing

Machinery

Maintenance Costs


Parts

Taxes

Legal Fees

Inspections

**Labor**



--

Subdivisions of Labor:

Management

Contractors

Temps

Line Workers

Min. Wage Workers


Of these, assuming minimum wage goes up, you'd likely see pay increases to the minimum wage workers, the line workers, and the temps - since all of them are at or close enough to minimum wage that they'd need a raise. Management is high enough above min. wage that while they might want a raise, you don't risk massive dissatisfaction if the min wage jumps from 12k to 15k and management doesn't jump from 75k to 78k.

So on the whole, you're raising the cost of A PART OF A PART of your overhead. The increase in price would be proportionate to the percent of your overhead that went up, not proportionate to the direct dollar amount that wages increased.


People like to conveniently ignore this because it requires thinking and not simply knee-jerk reactions.

The underlying problem of CCS is not with the standards themselves, or their implementation, but rather WHY states find adopting them appealing... and that's to get the federal money.

aradil,"My biggest problem with this conversation is that no one ever mentions whether or not they are talking about anthropogenic climate change or not. Presumably that's what this conversation is about. 

There is a scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is taking place, and that climate change is largely related to the greenhouse effect (which I was taught about in grade 6-7 in the mid 90s). But in these conversations with conservatives, it's never mentioned. 

I have spoken with folks who believe that there is a current change in climate (including overall warming of the planet), but aren't convinced we have enough evidence to determine the cause.  There are many of possible alternate explanations: solar cycles, natural atmospheric changes, volcanoes, etc. The article discusses in the first paragraph a Democrat who has made statements about Republicans (and others) who:

&gt; say that the planet is not warming or, if it is, the warming isn't caused by human activity.

Yet, the study discussed in the article (something that isn't mentioned until the summary of the article) may have some problems:

&gt; That term can also include people who acknowledge that climate change is occurring but don't believe it’s caused by humans. Whitehouse is making a leap by suggesting that the League survey is a gauge of how all ""deniers"" are regarded by younger Republicans.

So what this means is that we, as a group discussing this topic (including the OP of this thread), need to be clear what we are talking about. And what we are talking about is anthropogenic climate change.

On the other hand, I believe that whether or not climate change is occurring through anthropogenic means and is causing harm and suffering to fellow humans it is our responsibility to study, research, and act in any manner we can to prevent or at least mitigate it.",null,19,cdpecip,1ro8nt,politics,top_week,66

&gt;One important caveat should be noted.

&gt;The poll asked respondents to classify people who argue that climate change is not really happening. But that's only the most extreme type of climate change ""denier,"" a word never used in the survey. Other people sometimes saddled with that label acknowledge that the climate is changing, but they argue that it's due to natural variability, not human activity.

&gt;So the League poll only characterized the deniers with the most extreme -- and scientifically untenable -- position.

&gt;That's an important distinction, which can be seen in the Pew Research Center's recent national survey on climate change, conducted Oct. 9-13, among 1,504 adults.

&gt;A hefty 46 percent of all Republicans said there is solid evidence that Earth is warming. But the percentage drops to half that amount (23 percent) when Republicans were asked if the warming is mostly due to human activity. Nineteen percent of the GOP respondents said it's due to natural patterns.

delphium226,"What we're witnessing with deniers a bug in human psychology.

They think that ‘alarmists’ operate the same way they do, i.e. that the alarmists ‘believe’ in some sort of dogma handed out by the high priests of climate science. And that these high-priests have a self-interest in perpetuating and propagating this belief to keep themselves in a job.
Because they operate in a world of beliefs and dogma themselves, a lot of deniers completely fail to understand that people can be persuaded by facts and hard evidence. They fail to see that ‘beliefs’ have got nothing to do with it – it’s the scientific method. It’s the facts. The scientific method is designed to discover the truth, regardless of what that may be. 

If tomorrow the science was suddenly shown to be fundamentally flawed and the scientific consensus moved to an opinion of ‘there is no man-made warming’, billions of so-called ‘alarmists’ would shift their position to match – not because of their belief – but because the science has moved on and there are new facts on the table.

Deniers cannot understand this concept. Deniers would not be capable of shifting their position to match the facts. All because they operate their lives within in frameworks of beliefs. 

Very few of them can be actually persuaded by hard facts - it's just not psychologically possible for them.

Under the prerogative, both home-state senators must sign off on a blue slip allowing a confirmation hearing for a nominee.

He's not a very good politician.

If a sheriff decided that everyone in his county would be issued concealed carry permit, regardless of eligibility, that would be wrong and illegal. It would need to be stopped.

The fight is whether county officials have the authority to act in violation of state law.

Oversight would be easier, the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently.  For all we know the reason they didn't go that route is because they knew they could write their own rules with individual properties.

ctjwa,"Its not surprising that this article takes an anti-investor stance, and is chock full of misleading information.  It's a slow day at work today, so I thought I'd write a few bullet points as I was reading through it:

1. Blackstone isn't ""owned"" by any of those banks listed.  The fancy sounding SEC filing is just a list of who owns Blackstone's common stock (ticker: BX).  The list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage, which means if you as a normal person buy for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Value Mutual Fund, you own a portion of those BX shares, which gets aggregated in that list.  Not so evil...

2. The reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter, and safer.  There are no more zero money down purchases.  If you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans, then you can't also blame them for now *not* giving these loans.

3.  The ""besuited businessmen"" paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close.  These companies like Blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks, or at large auctions.  Not so evil.

4.  After buying the houses, they are hiring property management companies, contractors, and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible (within 90 days).  That's literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most.

5.  Blackstone isn't ""speculating on housing prices"", looking to quickly flip them, or creating another housing bubble.  The key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties.  These are all houses that already exist, and they are simply fixing them back up, and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way.

6.  Most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now.  They don't have 20% savings to put down, they are probably living check to check.  But their family and kids are used to living in a house, in a neighborhood.  They don't want to move into a 1 bedroom apartment building.  Now Blackstone comes in, and offers the opportunity to stay in a house, with the same schools, etc.  This isn't predatory.  People are paying rent, but now they have the option to do so while living in a house.

7.  Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone, they are in no hurry to ""flip"" them for profit, because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them.  The new boilers, new roof, and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability.  Most leases are 2 years, so there isn't constant turnover, and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect.  

8.  Eventually, the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company, and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work (See the recent IPO of SilverBay:SBY).  The company will continue to own and operate the homes, pay income to shareholders, and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do.  The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multi-family apartment real estate investing.  Not so evil.

Ultimately, this is actually making it *easier* for lower income people to live in homes.  While renting they can continue to save, and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budget.

Hopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what Blackstone and other institutional investors are doing, rather than just shake their fists and yell ""Damn Wall Street, Republicans, and Obama!"".

easwaran,"I'm a bit confused by this article. Normally I like what I read in Mother Jones, but this article doesn't really explain the systemic risk of rent-backed securities. With both mortgage-backed securities and rent-backed securities, if the foreclosure rate or vacancy rate go up in a coordinated way higher than the investors planned, then supposedly safer tranches of the investment can get hit. Let's assume that the investors are just as bad at evaluating the risks of these products this time as they were last time. If the investment goes bad, that means that some of the investors get to claim the collateral from the owner, which means that title of the home transfers to a new company. How does that evict anyone? As I understand, in most jurisdictions, just because your landlord has sold the house doesn't mean that you have to move out, and in fact the new owner normally has to allow you to stay as long as the existing lease lasts.

As far as I can tell, what these companies are doing is allowing ordinary people to keep living in houses, even when ownership is out of reach, or not desired. The article seems to start from the premise that owning a home is a good or important thing, but it seems to me that this is actually the attitude that led to past trouble, more than securitization.",null,0,cdpxvv1,1rpgir,politics,top_week,1

I used to work in code enforcement  in one of  the worst inner cities  in the US.   everyone knows about how suburban  sprawl  and  white  flight  had  major  impacts  on inner  cities  but  something I  never  see  get talked  about  is  black  flight.   we  are currently  seeing blacks  leaving  the  inner cities in record numbers for suburbs  for  the  lower  crime  rates and  better  schools. this is leaving the  problem of when the  banks  have  been foreclosing  on tons  of inner city  homes  during  the  housing crisis  is that  there  was no demand  for  these  houses.   I've  seen houses sell  for $2k-$10k USD.   these banks  are seeing  that  many of these houses  can only  be sold  for $10k so they  are betting  that if they hold onto  these properties  for a  few  years  that  the  market  will recover  abd  they  will be able  to sell  the  houses  for $30k  for  example  to a  potential  homeowner  or flipper  who  will  still  need  to drop 10s  of  thousands  into  these  to make  them livable after  they  have sat vavant  for  years.   the  copper  thieves  dont  take  long  to  figure  out  when a  house  is vacant  so most  inner  city  homes  owned  by  out  of  state  banks  are stripped of wiring, ac coils, pipes, etc  that  can  be  sold as scrap because  these  banks  aren't  investing  in any  security.  my city  saw the  problem of the out  of town banks owning  these  properties  which  is they  are sitting unlivable killing land values even more  on  top  of  the  black  flight  that is already  wrecking  values  in these  areas  and they  have  quit  selling  homes taken  for  back  taxes  to out  of  area  owners.   they  are  now  selling to locals who will renovate  the  properties and  they  are spending  more  on  demolishing  homes  because a vacant  lot  is better  than a  house  filed with crackheads.   another  issue  that doesn't  get  talked about  is that  the inner  cities  are  becoming a  much  older  population  because of the black  flight  issue  so  when these older  home owners die  they  are leaving  nearly worthless  homes  to  their  kids  who have  left  for  the burbs  and  I  have  seen many  leave  the  house  to get  taken  back  by  the  bank  or  for  back  taxes.   the  issue  is  very  complicated  but  unless  cities  can make  these  areas  more  desirable  then  the  problem isn't  going  to get  better.",null,1,cdpml9w,1rpgir,politics,top_week,2

I'd feel like an emotionless zombie, feeling like every word was on the tip of my tongue; having to contemplate on a sentence for what seemed like at least 5 - 10 minutes just because of the fact that I was taking 2 big horse pills, 250MG each, Depakote. 

When I ended up weening myself off of Depakote about a year or two ago; I had no alternative to replace it. I went from having a seizure every year, to every 4 months; now it's every month, and has been every month for about 2 or 3 months. I'm unable to get a job, or even drive a car because I could just randomly shut off at any moment.

The only alternative so far that I've been able to trust is marijuana. All  of these pharmaceuticals have too dire side effects, and I'm tired of having to deal with them when there's something that can help me, or other people without little to any side effects. But it's too expensive since it's illegal to use medicinally. If it were legal, I'd probably have a lot less seizures than I am now; and it upsets me people are stubborn enough to keep it illegal when it can help people substantially because of ignorance.

You don't feel any empathy at all for strangers. Those who claim to do so are lying because appearing to be empathetic connotes some sort of moral/social status.

&gt;Lies about Homosexuality

&gt;LIE #1: Some people are born homosexual.

&gt;FACT:  There is no conclusive scientific evidence for any genetic trait causing homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgendered desires.

&gt;LIE #2: Homosexual activity is harmless, so no one should criticize it.

&gt;FACT:  The consequences of homosexual behavior are devastating. The rate of sexually transmitted diseases among homosexuals remains very high, despite a tolerant climate. Suicide attempts are much higher among homosexuals.

&gt;LIE #3: No one chooses to be homosexual, so it must be inborn.

&gt;FACT:  While homosexual desire may feel very natural to some people, this does not mean it is inborn, positive or unchangeable. There is overwhelming evidence that homosexual desire arises from traumatic childhood experiences, such as sexual abuse.

&gt;LIE #4: A homosexual can never change to become a heterosexual.

&gt;FACT:  Thousands of people have overcome homosexual desire. A network of ex-homosexual organizations and psychologists can help homosexuals overcome homosexual desire. Many ex-homosexuals go on to marry and have children.

&gt;LIE #5: The Bible doesn’t condemn homosexuality.

Maybe this author is a real person.

If he or she is a real person, then I am very interested in finding out why this ""person"" thinks of herself or himself as ""an old-fashioned conservative"" and an ""active Republican.""

Within my personal experience of every ""old-fashioned conservative"" that is at the same time an ""active Republican"", each and every one, at some moment in a heart-to-heart discussion about ""what to do about the problems of the world"" will balk at acknowledging the flaws in the system that must be fixed.  In my personal experience, each and every ""old-fashioned conservative"" that is also an ""active Republican"" will balk at either flaws in the 1) market or the flaws in the Almighty 2) God and everything that he, she, or it touched, physically or figuratively.

Specifically, the ""old-fashioned conservative"" that is at the same time an ""active Republican"" will balk at the flaws in the

* Market, where the most universal flaws and easiest to see have to do with evaluating realistically a woman's work.  For example, without being forced by governmental law, no market system will compensate a mother's work in bringing up a child to be a productive contributor to the ""market"".  That is, without being forced by governmental law, ""markets"" externalize costs wherever allowed, including externalizing the costs of bringing up the ""labor force"" on which the ""markets"" depend; women take the brunt of the externalized costs and become involuntary slaves--because women are flawed in that women, unlike most men, put up with being turned into slaves.

* Alternatively and sometimes concurrently, the ""old-fashioned conservative"" and at the same time ""active Republican"" will balk at dealing realistically with what is required to correct and fix “this magical planet God gave us.”  First of all, there is no way in Hell that God or any other non-physical entity had anything to do with this planet and what is wrong with it.  What is wrong with people derives mainly from the genetic defects that we humans inherited from the ancestors of the chimpanzees.  So in a very real sense, God and all the other comforting escapes from reality are merely mental blockades against people working together to fix what is wrong with this wonderful blue planet that we have; God and similar gods are only false solutions and false premises and get us only the kinds of Darkness and dimness that the whole of Genesis and every other Book contradicting science exemplifies from beginning to end.

Now the ""Progressives,"" shall we call them, have an entirely different set of balkings at dealing forthrightly with the flaws in reality.  But that is a different discussion.

So my question is:  What mental blocks keep Chester Sansbury from working with the Progressives to correct the Progressive approaches for getting the others, including the ""old-time conservatives"" and ""active Republicans"", to deal with reality?

Despite the success that the protesters have had in damaging Republicans, no one expects the GOP to lose control of either house in next year’s election. The party’s 2010 victory allowed it to control the state’s redistricting process the following year. The result: In 2012, North Carolina Republicans won 54% of votes cast for state Senate candidates, but over 64% of state Senate seats, giving them super-majorities in both houses.

“This is one of the most severely gerrymandered states in the country,” Chris Fitzsimon, the executive director of NC Policy Watch, a progressive group based in Raleigh, told msnbc. “So they’re taking what is a small electoral mandate and, because of the gerrymandering, turning it into a radical restructuring of North Carolina.”

FortHouston,"It is very doubtful that this complainer is the first person targeted with an audit due to criticisms of *Obama Cares*.

Also, this man's insurance claims are shady.  Accordingly, it is fair to discern that he may be shady about the reason he earned that audit.

From another site:

&gt;He later reveals that his old plan cost him about $170, and the one his “insurance guy” offered would cost him $1500 a month, with a $13,500 deductible. However, the most expensive Obamacare plan offered to individuals over 50 on the exchange for South Carolina is $796.87 a month, for the most expensive Gold plan, and Bronze plans in the state start at $255.35 a month. Kelly didn’t ask him, but Mr. Elliott might qualify for federal subsidies as well. For example, if he makes $26,000 a year, that Bronze plan would be $163.42 /mo., less than what he was paying before.

&gt;He also said “Now with Obamacare, the man that I’ve got looked into it, they are not going to pay for pharmaceuticals or medical devices.”

&gt;But under Obamacare, both of those categories are mandated as essential health benefits.Either Mr. Elliott’s insurance man is giving him a bum steer, or something is being lost in translation. I’ve tried to get in touch with Mr. Elliott, but have thus far been unsuccessful.
