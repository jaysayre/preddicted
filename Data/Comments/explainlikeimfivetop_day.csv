Amaterasu-omikami,"* General international politics: why? Alright, bad question, the US has gone to war for less and Japan/the Republic of Korea (ROK) are pretty pissed off by having their citizens abducted and the occasional ""Woops, almost hit you with a rocket. Say, how about a bit of food for us?"" attitude, amonst other things like ""coal tunnels"" under the demilitarized zone.  
Still, what entitles anyone to screw with a souvereign nation just because they don't like their way of handling things?

* China. China doesn't want war for several reasons, the least of those is because they actually like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They have actually told the US ambassador how annoyed they are by the childish sabre-rattling of then still Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il, as illustrated in correspondence somewhere in the Wikileaks documents. It is highly unlikely China would actually perform a military intervention if the DPRK started hostile actions, their main focus is having a buffer zone between them and the pro-US ROK, even if it means occasionally supporting a crazy dictatorship at huge losses. China wouldn't mind a change of regime as long as the two Koreas stay apart.

* The DPRK basically has held Seoul hostage for decades. They have hundreds of long-range artilleries and rocket artilleries aimed at the city constantly ready to fire. The ROK knows basically every bunker's position and can retaliate and destroy them but that still means several volleys hitting a major population centre, even if said city is riddled with bunkers. Although Seoul is full of Chinese diplomats, CEOs, important politicians and their kids so the DPRK probably screws itself over with that bombardment.

* War. War is hell. The DPRK may be under-equipped, under-trained, with fuel reserves for a few months at best and material mostly made up of handed-down Soviet stuff and some of their own but that doesn't mean they can't drag it out into bloody genocide before they surrender. Their Navy is crap from the 60s and in direct battle could probably be dealt with by a single Ohio-class sub, their pilots get about 20 hours of flight training a year in old equipment because of constant fuel shortage, conscriptees and partly even professional soldiers can't be properly equipped because they lack enough weapons for everyone and their supply chain is so ineffective and train-reliant it's ridiculously easy to completely obliterate.  
*But* they have vast hidden bunker systems, thousands of defensive structures with well-equipped artillery bunkers and hidden explosive charges all over their south border, territorial advantage and a big pool of dedicated and indoctrinated infantry (plus 5-10 times that in general population reserves) that will fight to the last man if necessary. And even if they don't use nukes, which would be foolish as even China would immediately get to business on them, they have one of the biggest arsenals of chemical and biological weaponry in the world and are quite capable of deploying it via rocket artillery over several hundred kilometres.

Pandashriek,"This pretty much depends on the spaceship.Usually, those rocket engines contain not only fuel, but oxygen also as this allows a detonation to take place and power the rocket in the respective direction. Technically, if you take a shuttle with its rocket engines still attached to its hull, teleport it into deep space, tore open the rocket engines and light the match you will witness some great fireworks. Those tanks will provide enough oxygen for the fuel to ignite and explode.

As for implosions - those are impossible to occur on a space ship. The fact that the Cosmos is a vacuum means that there is no pressure, which means that there is no force being exerted on the ship, making it implode. Actually, the main force being exerted on the ship is coming not from the outside, but the inside. The ship is actually a pressurized container and all that pressured air tries to escape in space. This is the reason why when a rupture occurs, everything is sucked out into space - you should've seen it in the movies and that is actually true.

Anthropophagite,"You have to remember, most things in the movies are using technology far more advanced than our own. The Death Star was a massive space station the size of a moon. The power core was large enough for ships to fly in. Most things in the movies use exotic means of power. Take Star Trek for instance, they use anti-matter generators, warp cores, singularity cores, and other exotic things like that. It's not unlikely that the explosions seen in Star Trek are realistic to some point. Most explosions are caused by either a warp core breach, self-destruct, or from the detonation of a photon/quantum torpedo. For comparison a quantum torpedo is rated at roughly 1380 gigatons; a asteroid that passed at 38 lunar distances yesterday had 231 gigatons of energy. The secondary means of self-destruct on a Federation ship is the detonation of explosives around the ship. This is equivalent to 1,500 photon torpedoes, or roughly 42000 gigatons. Strangely enough, a warp core breach is rated at 100 megatons. One would think such an advanced engine capable to bend space would create a larger explosion. One would only need to look at our own test of nuclear devices in space to imagine what would a much larger one would look like. Without the shock wave, most of the energy would most likely vaporize everything within the explosive radius.

As for your second question it becomes trickier to use sci-fi as a resource. Assuming a hull breach occurs then the atmosphere in the section would vent and assuming the section seals itself, not much else would happen. You would merely have a section of the ship that was exposed to space. I believe most of the explosions seen in sci-fi is caused by a hull breach occurring in a place near a critical (explosive) component, such that whatever has pierced the ship has also pierced and compromised the component. Explosive decompression is also a possibility, but how likely it is I don't know.

The weak force is tougher to explain, but one thing that it does is keep a quark 'stable'. Quarks can change 'color', which can in turn change a proton into a neutron, or a neutron into a proton. In doing so it will release energy in the form of an electron or positron, which is ejected from the nucleus as radiation.",null,1,cdnmpfi,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3
Infinite_Ambiguity,"The strong and weak nuclear forces are two of the four fundamental universal forces.  As you mentioned, the other two fundamental,universal forces are electromagnetism and gravitation.  There are many interesting theories about why we have four and how they started, including that they all,started as one combined fundamental force and separated over time after the Big Bang.  

In any event, the strong nuclear force allows for the otherwise counter-intuitive formation and integrity of an atomic nucleus.  An atomic nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons, but gravitation doesn't operate a sub-atomic scales (and is a very weak force in any event) while electromagnetism says that protons should repel each other in such close proximity and prevent any atomic nuclei from forming.  Obviously, without atomic nuclei forming, we would not have anything we see, including life forms. So, the strong nuclear force is what overcomes electromagnetic repulsion among protons and allows atomic nuclei to maintain structural integrity and thereby for atoms, molecules, and things we see.  The strong nuclear force is very strong, but only within very short distances (such as atomic scales).  So, in summary, the strong nuclear force is what holds atomic nuclei together allowing the formation of atoms and obviously molecules by extension.  

The weak nuclear force allows for radioactive decay. It is different from and weaker than the strong nuclear force.  The crucial practical effect of the weak nuclear force is that it allows for nuclear fusion within stars. Nuclear fusion within stars is essential for fueling the stars and for ultimately allowing for the formation of the higher elements.  ",null,1,cdnn7on,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3

Chances are that if you are arrested and want to bring up entrapment, its going to be very situation specific, taking into account a lot of context and investigation to figure out if the police/agents involved in the arrest provided too much pressure, to the point where the intent was more strongly influenced by the government, rather than the accused's actual predisposition to commit the crime.

Edit Edit Edit: Lots of scenarios - guys, look, when it comes down to it, if you are arrested by an undercover cop, its going be centered around how you defend yourself in trial. You have to prove that you simply would not have done it if it were not for the pressure on you, and it has to be believable. You have to convince the judge, or the jury, or both, that you were coerced. Whatever scenario, tip, trick that you have, when it comes down to it, if you're arrested, then its all up to how you defend yourself and how much proof you can bring to the table.

I'm going to explain this like you're all 5, so please hold onto your hats folks. 

**What is entrapment?**

Entrapment is an illegal act by authority figures to MAKE people do bad things (Illegal). An example of this would be: An undercover Police Officer begging a person (Not a drug dealer in this case, just for example's sake) to sell them drugs. This person, who actually just so happens to have drugs, repeatedly refuses the Officer's requests, until he finally gives in just to shut him up. The Police Officer then arrests the person for drug trafficking, takes the ""offender"" to court, and then has to duck as a Judge throws his little mallet at him for entrapping some poor person. 

**Entrapment is the act of reasonably forcing a person to commit a criminal act they would not have otherwise done.**

Understand that so far? Good. Now. What the general problem is, people don't have a basic grasp of what entrapment isn't. Entrapment IS NOT:

- Being an undercover hooker.

- Operating a child porn website

- Being a drug dealer. 

""But why, internet anon? Surely, the Police are luring these poor, innocent people to their doom!"" LOL. No. See. Get this: People suck, and actively seek these things out. And when they do, it's no longer entrapment. That John looking to get his dick wet with undercover Suzie? He willingly tried to solicit her. Yes, she could have asked, and all he had to do is say no and go on his merry way, and he wouldn't be handcuffed. Uncle Robert getting his door knocked down in the middle of the night by the FBI? No one FORCED him to watch little kids get fucked on the internet, he was looking for it. Your dumbass friend Marley who asked the wrong guy for drugs? He shouldn't have been asking ANYONE for drugs. Nor should he have accepted any offers.

**ENTRAPMENT IS: LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCING SOMEONE TO COMMIT AN ILLEGAL ACT, OR PRESSURING THEM INTO AN ILLEGAL ACT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE COMMITTED.**

**ENTRAPMENT IS NOT: PLAYING UNDERCOVER HOOKER ARRESTING EVERY JOHN, DICK, AND JOE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR POON. IF PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO COMMIT CRIMES AND THEY STUMBLE ACROSS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER, THEY'RE SHIT OUT OF LUCK**.

Additional fun fact: Undercover officers can do nearly anything to keep their cover, just short of killing someone (Presumably, they might actually). No, they don't have to admit they're cops just because you asked. Yes, they will deal drugs and kick you in the face. With undercover agencies, the ends justify the means.

- Speed...the whole gamut.

The lawyer for x had a ton of evidence of the under cover engaging in countless illegal activities, all trying to earn the trust of x to move up to the dealers identity. This put a lot of holds on basically 90% of the ""evidence"" gathered over the years and in the end the verdict was

*# years good behaviour* or something like that. x is still on it today and if x is caught in a house with drugs xs old charges will become re-looked at and the sentence will be worse than the new charges.

Great visual aid to understand the concept more thoroughly.

Edit Edit: A few people have commented on various scenarios, but when it comes down to it, its only going to be entrapment if the Officer(s) involved create a situation in which the person *has no choice but to commit the act*, with degrees of variance depending on context.

/u/CornellBigRed posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rimmo/eli5_how_come_undercover_police_operations/cdnv6qx) that [this court case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._United_States#Majority), which shows that there is a line that is drawn - but it will likely be drawn in court where more evidence can be presented

Chances are that if you are arrested and want to bring up entrapment, its going to be very situation specific, taking into account a lot of context and investigation to figure out if the police/agents involved in the arrest provided too much pressure, to the point where the intent was more strongly influenced by the government, rather than the accused's actual predisposition to commit the crime.

Edit Edit Edit: Lots of scenarios - guys, look, when it comes down to it, if you are arrested by an undercover cop, its going be centered around how you defend yourself in trial. You have to prove that you simply would not have done it if it were not for the pressure on you, and it has to be believable. You have to convince the judge, or the jury, or both, that you were coerced. Whatever scenario, tip, trick that you have, when it comes down to it, if you're arrested, then its all up to how you defend yourself and how much proof you can bring to the table. I do not believe you saying that you were coerced is going to be enough - you want enough proof to make it such that the prosecution cannot mount a good argument for why you did it willingly.

I'm going to explain this like you're all 5, so please hold onto your hats folks. 

**What is entrapment?**

Entrapment is an illegal act by authority figures to MAKE people do bad things (Illegal). An example of this would be: An undercover Police Officer begging a person (Not a drug dealer in this case, just for example's sake) to sell them drugs. This person, who actually just so happens to have drugs, repeatedly refuses the Officer's requests, until he finally gives in just to shut him up. The Police Officer then arrests the person for drug trafficking, takes the ""offender"" to court, and then has to duck as a Judge throws his little mallet at him for entrapping some poor person. 

**Entrapment is the act of reasonably forcing a person to commit a criminal act they would not have otherwise done.**

Understand that so far? Good. Now. What the general problem is, people don't have a basic grasp of what entrapment isn't. Entrapment IS NOT:

- Being an undercover hooker.

- Operating a child porn website

- Being a drug dealer. 

""But why, internet anon? Surely, the Police are luring these poor, innocent people to their doom!"" LOL. No. See. Get this: People suck, and actively seek these things out. And when they do, it's no longer entrapment. That John looking to get his dick wet with undercover Suzie? He willingly tried to solicit her. Yes, she could have asked, and all he had to do is say no and go on his merry way, and he wouldn't be handcuffed. Uncle Robert getting his door knocked down in the middle of the night by the FBI? No one FORCED him to watch little kids get fucked on the internet, he was looking for it. Your dumbass friend Marley who asked the wrong guy for drugs? He shouldn't have been asking ANYONE for drugs. Nor should he have accepted any offers.

**ENTRAPMENT IS: LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCING SOMEONE TO COMMIT AN ILLEGAL ACT, OR PRESSURING THEM INTO AN ILLEGAL ACT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE COMMITTED.**

**ENTRAPMENT IS NOT: PLAYING UNDERCOVER HOOKER ARRESTING EVERY JOHN, DICK, AND JOE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR POON. IF PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO COMMIT CRIMES AND THEY STUMBLE ACROSS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER, THEY'RE SHIT OUT OF LUCK**.

Additional fun fact: Undercover officers can do nearly anything to keep their cover, just short of killing someone (Presumably, they might actually). No, they don't have to admit they're cops just because you asked. Yes, they will deal drugs and kick you in the face. With undercover agencies, the ends justify the means.

Drugs are no different. But it always seems to be the victimless crimes that are pursued the hardest.
It's probably the puritanical heritage thing. Nobody is allowed to have any pleasure.

I'm also a big fan of This American Life, and I'd love to know how this isn't entrapment: http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/486/transcript (scroll down to Act Two: 21 Chump St).

That's not as valuable for a desktop PC, although it does help with thermal management. Different cores can also be run at different frequencies, which also helps with power management.

Those that succeed make more organisms that repeat the process. So far, that incredibly branching process has formed a vast number of organisms alive today, each one of which has found a way to survive and reproduce in its own unique way.

asdfkook,"Magnetism is generated by a moving electrical charge. One can do this by simply using a battery and wire, electro-magnet. Or a relative moving charge can occur if all the poles of an atom align, permanent magnet.

Each atom has electrons in orbit about it, while they actually exist in a cloud of probability, they have a magnetic property as if the electron was actually spinning about. If all the atoms line up, you get a permanent magnet. All atoms are basically tiny magnets, in most materials, they don't line up. You can make one by taking iron, melting it, putting a strong magnetic field through the molten iron, this causes the atoms to line up, then when it re-solidifies you have a permanent magnet.

Why do moving charges produce a magnetic field? The answer actually involves relativity. When things travel near the speed of light, their lengths contract. While electrons move rather slow in a wire, the charge itself is actually moving near the speed of light. A positive charge going one way and a negative going the other. The charges already have an electric field that repels like charges and attracts opposites, due to length contractions, these fields grow stronger, but only relative to the direction of their motion.  Thus if you put two wires side by side, each with a current running in the same direction. The positives charges in one have zero relative motion to the positive in the other, but near light speed motion relative to the negative in the other. Thus the two wires will attract as the electric fields are condensed between opposite charges but not like charges by relativistic effects. If you flip one wire around so that it's charges are traveling the opposite direction the reverse happens. The positive charges in one are moving with zero relative speed to the negative charges in the other wire, while the positive in one compared to the positive in the other are moving at near light speed, thus the positive fields become stronger (also the negatives as well but in the opposite direction), thus the two wires repel each other.

That's the theory I was taught at least. I've never seen it mention before in anything else I read so I'm not sure how widely the Relativistic effect of electromagnetism is accepted. It's hard to swallow, because the electrons are barely moving at all in wires, and the protons not moving at all, it's just the perceived charge that's moving. It's like the motion of toppling dominos, the dominos don't really move much, but you can see a different motion going on, that isn't really the dominos moving, it is a wave of energy traveling through them. That's what actually moves in electrical wires and it's that near light speed motion that's causing the weird phenomenon of magnetism. Thus a magnetic field is the same thing as an electric field, it's just that it's under the effect of relativity such that if a charge isn't moving in the field, nothing happens, but as soon as the charge starts to move, the electric fields it experiences changes depending on it's direction of motion. It would be as if gravity pulled you to earth when walking east, but pushed you away when walking west, but didn't effect you at all if you stood still.

QuickSpore,"Because ""realism"" wasn't necessarily the goal. If you look at medieval European Christian art, one thing you will notice is that individuals are all different sizes. Why? The Romans and Greeks were capable of using perspective. And so were the Italian renaissance painters. So why would a 10th century painter screw up and paint a picture where Christ is twice the size of the Apostles and four times the size of some Roman guard. The answer in this case was because the painter wouldn't be trying to recreate a realistic rendition of the scene. He would be trying to create an interpretive version of the scene. And in that time and place, the size of a person represents power and majesty of the individual.

It is a relatively rare idea that art is supposed to be a reproduction of the world as it is. Even today I would say various forms of abstract and impressionist art are more common than ""realistic"" art.

And that was true historically as well. We have Egyptian art both statues and drawn that is petty realistic. But most the art we see from Egypt isn't. Why? Because it was traditional. There was all sorts of meaning attached to various poses and styles. Left foot forward meant one thing, right foot another. One eye visible also meant something different than two eyes visible. So following that convention communicates meaning to the viewer.

And as a final thought, most artists weren't very good. Professional artists have been fairly rare in history. It is significant that we can name a lot of the painters who were working in Italy in the 1400s. There weren't that many. A lot of the art we have from Egypt and the like were done by untrained priests and the like. If you were to bury all the ""art"" produced this year, most of it would be pictionary style doodles. Well the same is true historically. We have a lot of crap, because most of it was crap done by amateurs.",null,0,cdnqxng,1riixj,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3

Stage 2 astrocytoma comes with a  median survival time of 4 years. 

The scariest case, stage 4 (which is thankfully not too common), is also known by the term glioblastoma multiforme.

Schnutzel,"**Stack overflow**

Whenever you call a function, memory for that function is allocated in a place called the call stack. When the function completes its run, that memory is released. A stack overflow happens if too many functions are called, and there's not enough room in the stack (which has a hard size limit) to allocate more memory.

How can this happen? Look at the following code for example:

    int foo() {
        return foo();
    }

When you execute foo() for the first time, memory for it is allocated on the stack. But then the function calls itself - so memory is allocated again. The 2nd invocation of the function calls itself a 3rd time - and so on, to infinity (and beyond). Eventually the stack will run out of memory and the program will crash.",null,3,cdnm8mi,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_day,18
Schnutzel,"**Buffer overflow**

A buffer overflow when you try to write data into a buffer (an array), and the data exceeds the size of the array. For example:

    char buffer[8];
    scanf(""%s"", buffer);

The function scanf reads a string from the user into the buffer, which is 8 bytes long. However, scanf doesn't limit how many characters will be read - it will read until it's done (until a whitespace character is reached). So what happens if the user enters ""helloworld""? The first 8 bytes are written into the buffer, but the rest are written just outside the boundaries of the array.

Now one of three things can happen:

1. The overwritten memory can be unimportant, and nothing bad will happen (for example, the memory could have been used previously in the function but not anymore).
2. The program is not allowed to write to this memory, so it will report an error (and probably crash).
3. The worst case is that the memory being overwritten is important, but the program continues running. This allows the user to change parts of the memory they shouldn't normally have access to, which is a security flaw (thanks /u/BrQQQ for expanding on this!).",null,3,cdnmsqz,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_day,14

MEaster,"Buffer Overflow: Any random piece of data has a certain size. For example, an ASCII character is 1 byte. So if you have a string of 10 characters, you would need 10 bytes to store it. A buffer overflow would be when you write data past the end of this string overwriting other data.

Stack overflows are a bit more complicated. Firstly, a stack is a way of storing a list of data. It's what's known as a last-in-first-out list. Basically think of it as a stack of plates. You add data to the list by putting it on top of the stack, and then remove data by taking it off the top.

Another thing to explain is that in programming your code will generally be separated into subroutines. A subroutine will generally be things you want to do multiple times without having to rewrite it every time.

When a program enters a subroutine, it needs to keep track of where it came from so it can return. It does this by adding the current address to the stack before entering the subroutine. If you keep going into subroutines without returning the stack gets bigger.

In an operating system such as Windows, I believe each program has its own stack of limited size. If the operating system detects that the stack is full when the program tries to add something to it, then it will halt the program with a ""stack overflow"" error to prevent the program from causing problems.",null,1,cdnmnhf,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
RandomRobot,"The two can be combined or independent, depending on the context. A buffer overflow is very common in the C/C++ languages. It just means that you try to fit more data into a buffer than what it can holds. In those languages, you can access memory directly, so a string can be shown as 

    char myString[10];

If you try to copy more than 10 chars into it, then it will overflow. A stack overflow means that the data was on the stack when it overflowed, like in the previous example. However if you dynamically allocate memory, that memory will be on the heap, a large chunk of RAM that your program has access to. 

    char* myString = new char[10];

This string will be stored on the heap so when you overflow it, it will not be a stack overflow but a heap overflow, which is handled slightly differently by the program.

Overflowing the stack is especially bad since the program stores a lot of useful addresses on the stack, such as return addresses. If you carefully craft your 10+x chars, then you can potentially control the execution of the program. If your buffer was large enough, say... char[1000], then you could embed assembly code in the buffer and control the return address to execute the buffer. Those assembly codes are usually called shellcodes, because what an attacker want(ed, back in the days), was to get a shell, or a command line to the infected computer. There are whole books dedicated to this, how to write them and how to detect them.

Another way to generate a stack overflow is to call too many functions. The stack is a limited place, with around 1M (depending on tons of factors, such as your OS, your language, your compiler...). Recursion is a common mistake to generate a stack overflow like this.

    void func(){
      func();
    }

Those kinds of overflow are not as dangerous as the previous ones, first because they are easy to detect, even by just reading the code. The first execution will also crash fast. Secondly, the first kind of buffer overflow is more tricky to detect and an overflown buffer might not cause any problem to the execution of the program, while leading an attacker to complete control of your machine.

There is a very good tutorial about buffer overflows and how to execute arbitrary code with it called [Smashing the stack for fun and profit, by Aleph One](http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=49&amp;id=14).

Modern OS such as Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 have built in protections against those attacks, since they are so dangerous and difficult to avoid. A common protection is a canary on the stack. It means that the OS puts a special, magic value at strategic places on the stack. After some instructions, the OS checks if the magic value has changed. If it has, then the stack was smashed and some kind of error is returned to the user.

There are other kinds of attacks that are directed toward the heap overflows, but they are more difficult to execute properly.",null,0,cdnv0ez,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1
kyz,"The implications:

""The stack"" is some memory that keeps track of where you are in the computer program. Every time you call another function, it saves your current state on the stack, and where to come back to.

The called function runs, and when it finishes, it restores the state to before you made the call (stored on the stack) and jumps back to just after the call instruction (also saved on the stack).

If you *run out* of stack, the program simply has to stop running. Where can you store the details of the next function call? Nowhere, you're outta space! The OS has to abort the program.

However, there's something worse. Imagine you take input from the user, and put it into space located *on the stack*. What if the user tricks you into putting more data there than there is space for?

... it means that the end user gets to control what's on your stack. They get to overwrite it with whatever they like. They now control the *state* of your program. They get to control *where your program will go to* once the next function returns.

If it's easy enough to guess *where* the stack is (if it's at a predictable location, like it used to be before [address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) was promulgated), you can tell the program to jump to... the stack data itself, which is something you, the attacker, have control of thanks to the buffer overflow. This is called **[smashing the stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smashing_the_stack)** (for fun and profit). The stack data which is actually code is called ""[shellcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode)"".

So now you have *complete* control of the program. Just from supplying input to a program, you have made it start running your own code, and you get to take on the privileges it had and access the resources it has.

One fix against this (as well as ASLR and not writing exploitable code) is to mark the stack memory as ""[No eXecute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit)"", which means that if the CPU is told to run code on the stack, it will immediately end your program.

&gt;The Switchblade Knife Act, (Pub.L. 85–623, 72 Stat. 562, enacted on August 12, 1958, and codified in 15 U.S.C. §§ 1241–1245), prohibits the manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, and sale of switchblade knives in commercial transactions substantially affecting interstate commerce[60] between any state, territory, possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, and any place outside that state, territory, U.S. possession, or the District of Columbia. The Act also prohibits possession of such knives on federal or Indian lands or on lands subject to federal jurisdiction. It does not prohibit the ownership or carrying of automatic knives or switchblades inside a state while not on federal property, nor does it prohibit the acquisition or disposition of such knives in an intrastate transaction or an interstate transaction that is noncommercial and/or does not substantially affect interstate commerce (as defined by recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court).

Switchblades are illegal in lots of jurisdictions, but not all. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade#State_laws

I went into a knife store in Arizona and saw a boatload of knives they would happily have taken my money for, but that would have been illegal for me to carry at home.

I have heard, but can't prove, that in California, the legal definition of a switchblade includes a length (maybe 2""). So it's illegal to buy, sell, possess, carry, etc., an automatic knife over 2"", but knives under that length by definition are not illegal. Apparently there is a whole subculture of people who make, sell, trade, and collect these little miniature switchblades - in-state only, since interstate sale is illegal.",null,0,cdnkvz2,1rigkq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

lumpy_potato,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it probably has a lot to do with the regulations required for each industry - there are numerous health and safety each factory has to undergo. Every additional piece you add complicates the ability for the business to operate. Complexity is typically not good for manufacturing - simplicity is almost always cheaper.

In India, my grandfather has ownership of a steel mill. The mill used to have a forge area, a cutting area, a chemical treatment area, and an assembly area. All in a single compound. The chemical fumes from the area where they nickle plated piping would float all around the factory floor, so that the guys who were grinding and cutting away at the metal pieces would get a good strong whiff of it themselves.

There were minimal safety features involved (not uncommon for manufacturing work in India), but that is what made it possible - if you applied U.S. Health and Safety standards, every worker in the factory would need chemical protection for hands, body, feet, eyes, they would need masks, etc. This is huge expense for the guy whose only job is to cut the metal sheets as they come down the line.

That doesn't mean that chemical/processing/manufacturing plants don't have such agreements to move waste material around - they probably do, especially if there is a financial advantage to it. But I imagine there are regulations on that as well, and trying to sell the byproduct of factory 1 to factory 2 might end up complicated so much so by regulation that its cheaper to dump it than it is to sell/transfer it.",null,0,cdnk340,1rif4q,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
H335,"In addition the EPA regs now usually mandate that any infrastructure changes that are over a certain percentage of square footage, or dollar market value (or any of several criteria) require full environmental review and permitting and are treated as entirely new facilities. 

So essentially this means that to raze a smelter and combine it with a coke production facility would require them to get a full environmental review, permits, and mitigation plan for razing the smelter - which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars (to ELIMINATE a facility). Then to add on to the production facility the EPA and other agencies would treat it as new construction of BOTH plants, and require the full process for each. Again running into multiple millions of dollars for EACH facility.

This is why there haven't been hardly any new refineries built in decades, and why there are so many shuttered and abandoned industrial facilities rather than selling off the land.

A sociopath is one who is affected with a personality disorder marked by antisocial behavior. A psychopath is a person with an antisocial personality disorder, manifested in aggressive, perverted, criminal, or amoral behavior without empathy or remorse. The two might sound the same to some, however the differences between sociopaths and psychopaths are very real.

Characteristics of a sociopath are as followed :

    Sociopaths are very charming.
    Sociopaths can be extremely manipulative and will try to con you whenever possible.
    Sociopaths feel that they are entitled to everything.
    Sociopaths will lie continuously to get what they want. They can even sometimes manipulate a lie detector.
    Sociopaths have no remorse, shame or guilt.
    Sociopaths will show love and happiness only when it serves their purpose. None of the feelings are genuine.
    Sociopaths have no room for love in their life.
    Sociopaths need to have excitement in their lives or live on the edge.
    Sociopaths have lack of empathy hen their victims suffer pain that they have caused.
    Sociopaths believe that they are all mightier than tho, there is no concern on how their behavior impacts others.
    Sociopaths usually have a long history of juvenile delinquency as well as behavior problems.
    Sociopaths will never take blame for anything they have done to anyone no matter if it is family or friend.
    Sociopaths have many sexual partners and tend to act out many sexual acts.
    Sociopaths rarely stay in one place for a long time (home/work).
    Sociopaths will change themselves if they know it will keep them from being found out.

Characteristics of a psychopath are as followed:

    Psychopaths use superficial charm to lure their victims.
    Psychopaths are extremely self-centered.
    Psychopaths must always do something to keep themselves from boredom.
    Psychopaths are very deceptive and tend to lie continuously.
    Psychopaths show no remorse of guilt towards their victims.
    Psychopaths are very predatory and usually will live off other people.
    Psychopaths have many sexual partners in their lifetime.
    Psychopaths are very impulsive with their lifestyle.
    Psychopaths are always blaming other people for their actions.
    Psychopaths never have a realistic view of their lives. (king of the world or from another planet)
    Psychopaths always want psychological gratification in sexual and criminal activities.

This is not included in the DSM but was created as a test for psychopathy. Each criterion gets a score from 0-2 and all are added up to determine psychopathy.

Additionally, the following is a direct excerpt from an interview I did with Dr. Peter Langman for a research paper of mine about active shooters (Cho, James Holmes, Columbine shooters). He is the author of ""Why Kids Kill"" and is a leading expert on school shooters. He has an interesting perspective.

I asked:
Psychopathy has not been included in the DSM-IV. If you were to include psychopathy as a personality disorder in the new DSM-V, what would the criteria be? 

It's hard to say. In some ways, psychopathy seems like an extreme version of narcissistic personality disorder. One thing I might add as a possible criterion would be sadism, though this is not one of the traits Robert Hare includes in the Psychopathy Check List. Possible criteria might be extreme narcissism; disregard for rules, laws, social norms, the feelings of others, etc.; lack of guilt/remorse; meeting own needs at the expense of others; inability to engage in mutual relationships. Violence and criminal behavior would not be necessary for the diagnosis, but are often part of the picture.

HeighwayDragon,"The words can be used interchangeably. The word ""psychopath"" tends to be more clearly defined in accordance with [Dr. Hare's checklist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_Psychopathy_Checklist), while ""sociopath"" is more up for grabs, so, while both words can be used differently by different groups, sociopathy tends to be the one more liable to a given groups own interpretation. There is no official definition for ""sociopath"" while there (kind of) is an official definition for psychopath, laid out by Robert Hare. 

Different groups will make their own distinctions but these distinctions are not official or universally accepted. A common one is to say that psychopathy is rooted in abnormalities of the brain while sociopathy is rooted in environmental causes. Sometimes a field or group will prefer one term and simply not use or define the other term. More often than not the terms can be and are used interchangeably.

While we're at it, sometimes both terms are used to refer to someone with Anti-social Personality Disorder, though this disorder is not synonymous with psychopathy in the sense that Robert Hare conceived it. ADP's criteria have been criticized as being essentially synonymous with criminal behavior making it useless as a disorder. However ADP is in the DSM while psychopathy and sociopathy are not.

OrangeCrack,"A cell phone is actually a radio -- an extremely sophisticated radio, but a radio nonetheless. 

Before cell phones, trucks would talk to each other using CBs, however, this was limited to the number of people that could talk at the same time due to the  range and the fact these typically only had about 25 channels. 

The genius of the cellular system is the division of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously.

In a typical analog cell-phone system in the United States, the cell-phone carrier receives about 800 frequencies to use across the city. The carrier chops up the city into cells. Each cell is typically sized at about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers).

Because cell phones and base stations use low-power transmitters, the same frequencies can be reused in non-adjacent cells. 

Here are the basics:

 - As you drive through the city areas are divided into cells
 - The cells read a unique ID on your phone to identify you and what carrier you are with.
 - If your ID matches that of the tower, you will be considered in your home network.
 -  Along with your ID, your phone also transmits a registration request, and the cell tower keeps track of your phone's location in a database -- this way, the tower knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone.
 - The cell tower gets the call, and it tries to find you. It looks in its database to see which cell you are in.
 - The cell tower picks a frequency pair that your phone will use in that cell to take the call.
 - The cell tower communicates with your phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use, and once your phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected. Now, you are talking by two-way radio to a friend.
 - As you move toward the edge of your cell, your cell's base station notes that your signal strength is diminishing. Meanwhile, the base station in the cell you are moving toward (which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies, not just its own one-seventh) sees your phone's signal strength increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each other through the cell tower, and at some point, your phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies. This hand off switches your phone to the new cell.

tl;dr - Your phone acts as a radio and cell towers communicate with your phone and each other to automatically transfer your call.",null,1,cdnjtsw,1rid4r,explainlikeimfive,top_day,9
classicsat,"Cell phones don't ""find"" each other, at their radio level, all they need to do is find the best tower associated with their service, or a roaming partner if need be, and communicate with that.

afcagroo,"When a CPU reads an instruction, it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer. It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips ""Give me the information at this address"". It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus - high voltage means 1, low voltage means 0. The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion. It toggles some control pins to say ""Here ya go"" and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the 1s and 0s corresponding to that binary data. The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory. (This description is actually vastly simplified, but hopefully gets the idea across.)  
  
Similarly, the CPU (or other devices) can move data/instructions from the HDD into DRAM, or to/from network interface chips, etc. One thing asks for data stored in a particular set of locations, the other thing says ""OK, here it is"" and sends it, and the first thing (sometimes) says ""Thanks, got it!"". Or, something says ""I'm going to send you some information to store/work on"" and a similar handshaking goes on.  
  
All of this communication is built up in layers. The lowest layer that I described above, where voltages change to represent something, is called Layer 1, the physical layer.  Sometimes a ""1"" is sent via a high voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage simultaneously on two different wires.  There are lots of different ways to do it, and some are better for some uses than others.   
   
Higher layers define the protocol for decoding that information and deciding what it means and how to use it.   

These generic layers are described in the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). But there are various different bus protocols (SATA, PCIe, Ethernet, etc.), and to understand any one of them you'd need to read up on its specifics.   
  
Processors tend to have their own proprietary or semi-proprietary bus protocols for some things; this has been a recurring issue for companies like AMD who are trying to compete with the 500 pound gorilla in PCs, Intel. For other things (like DRAM) they tend to use protocols that the industry has agreed upon (like DDR3).  
   
Wireless communication adds a bit more complexity. Since things aren't connected with wires, information must be sent by modulating a radio signal. There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
One simple way is to use signalling. You can pulse the light on and off like [Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code, you can transmit information.  This is actually done in some fiber optic systems. (They don't use Morse code, and it is much much faster than a human could do. But it's the same general idea.) This technique isn't really used with radio broadcasts, though. 
  
Another way is to *modulate* the signal.  If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.    ",null,0,cdnjdst,1ricgj,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
lumpy_potato,"Depends. Are we talking wired or wireless?

Wired, its all just electrical signals representing binary digits, 0 and 1.

Lets say I have a chip that has 1 input and two outputs. The two outputs go to a red light and a green light.

When the input is off (0, no current) the red light stays on. When the input is on (1, current) the red light turns off and the green light turns on.

Electronics, when you get down to it, are a lot of red-light-green-light sort of operations, turning things on and off until you get the required output from a particular input.

With wireless, its the same thing, only you use some form of wireless medium - e.g. radio waves. You take your binary 0s and 1s and transmit it via radio, the same way you transmit music from an antenna to your car radio.

The receiver picks up the signal, decodes it, and turns it back into electrical 1s and 0s.

TheRockefellers,"There are about a million ways of scoring tennis, but I'm assuming you're talking about what you see in the pros. Here's the big picture:

To win a tennis match, you must:

* Win a majority of the **sets** (best of 3 for women, best of 5 for men);

* To win a **set**, you must be the first to win **6 games**, and you must win by two; or if both sides are tied at 6 games each, they play a **tiebreaker** (a specific type of game) to win the set;

* To win a **game**, you must win four (or more) points, and **you must win by two points.**

Now, as for game scoring:

* 0 points = love

* 1 point = 15 (or sometimes called ""5"")

* 2 points = 30

* 3 points = 40

* A tie at 3 points or more = deuce

If both players reach deuce, we kind of stop keeping track of the total number of points, since all that matters at this point is winning by 2.  So at this time, you abandon your numbers. Instead, the score is:

* Deuce, if the players are tied (as noted above)

* ""Ad in"" or ""advantage in"" if the **server** has one more point than the receiver (in which case the server wins the game if he wins the next point)

* ""Ad out"" or ""advantage out"" if the **receiver** has one more point than the server(in which case the receiver wins the game if he wins the next point)

Also, before each point serve, the score will be announced. The order of the numbers matters; the first is the server's score, and the second is the receiver's.  So if you hear ""30-15,"" you know that the server has two points to the receiver's one.

So here's an example of a single game being scored between S (who's serving) and R:

* Game starts at 0 (love) all
* S wins the point; 15-0
* S wins the point; 30-0
* R wins the point; 30-15
* R wins the point; 30 all
* R wins the point; 30-40
* S wins the point; deuce
* S wins the point; Ad-In or Advantage S
* R wins the point; deuce
* R wins the point; Ad-Out or Advantage R
* R wins the point; R wins the game

Also within these rules there are a few aberrations.  For example, in Wimbledon, there is no tiebreaker in the final set of a match. You have to win by two games. This can result in some loooong matches, like the championship a few years ago, which lasted something like 11 hours.

TurtleHerder_,"Tennis is broken down into 3 components; These are points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games(usually 6), and games consist of points. It takes 4 points to win a game. The points however, have different names.
0 points= love
1 point=15
2 points=30
3 points=40
4 points=60
Once a player reaches 4 points, the game is over, unless the game was tied at 3 points a piece beforehand(ex:40-40). This occurance is referred to as 'deuce'. In this case you can only win this game by becoming 2 points ahead of them. Once a game reaches 'deuce', it stays in deuce until the 2 point margin is reached.
An example of an in-progress game score would be:
Player A has 3 points and Player has 2 points. Therefore, Game score=(A)40-(B)30.
If the game is tied, the score is followed by 'up'. Ex:15-up

Overall tennis matches are usually played best of 3(women) and best of 5(men) sets. In order to win a set, the player must win 6 games by at least a 2 game margin. Ex. 6-4.

Consider the first bacteria that changed the world by using photosynthesis to make our planet have so much oxygen.

The environment is always changing. The environment we want to keep is one that ensures humans can live in it.

So what we want to do is eliminate things that can change the environment. Pets produce many environmental waste just as making pencils do. The idea behind it is to eliminate as much as we can slowly over time. Pets do not produce that much of a concern to the ecosphere as coal burning does. If we changed green house emissions,. Suddenly we need to learn how to clean up these landfills. If we learn how to get rid of landfill waste, suddenly we need to learn how to incorporate our society and cities from being invasive to other species. The list will always go on. Someday we might get to pets, and if we ever get to that point, it just means that pets will be the number 1 on the list of changing our environment in a way we don't want.

Remember that climate change and environmental impact isn't necessary black and white. What we are really doing when we tell people to be green and conserve, is just try and manipulate the change of the ecosphere in a way that is beneficial to human society. We are really worried about things that could really impact our ecosphere and change it in ways we don't want, and those factors are much larger than the pet industry.

Now each time this signal hits a satellite, it's bounced back down at the earth as a broad range radio frequency that blankets an area.  The same principle applies to normal FM radio. The only difference is the antenna that's broadcasting and relaying the signal is in space, so it can hit a much, much wider area with little to no interruption. GPS uses a similar technology.

Some companies might pay lower wage workers more, others pay higher wage workers less, others try to have their lower paid employees not technically be 'employees', etc.  If this regulation is enforced, then changes will happen.  However, if the regulation is poorly written, it *might* be easy to get around so that its intended effect fails to happen, or there are unintended negative effects.  This can happen often with hastily written or politically motivated legislation.  

While there may always be some incentive to get around the rules, sometimes compliance is easier.  Maximum work hours, child labor laws, minimum wage laws, etc. are generally complied with.  In fact, large powerful corporations are generally better at complying with those laws than small businesses, because they are a bigger target for enforcement, class action lawsuits, etc.  Often the regulations themselves are not the only thing that results in compliance, but a shift in cultural standards and norms can also help (e.g. non-discrimination laws).

Federal law enforcement officers cannot enforce state/town/city ordinances or laws. The opposite is true for local officers and federal laws. Additionally, most police officers enforce only criminal (statutory) laws, which is a small portion of the law as a whole. 

The laws that are enforced are usually agency and division specific. This means that the San Francisco Police direct the majority of their patrols to fight San Francisco-specific crime, whereas the California Highway Patrol focus on the highways that run through San Francisco and California, and the BART Police focus on crime occurring on the transportation systems of the San Francisco/Bay Area. Furthermore, different divisions of different agencies have different focuses. Examples are drug enforcement units, gang units, alcohol licensing units, etc. Individuals of those divisions will know their specific areas better than they would other laws.

For the most part you only need to identify that a crime has or is occurring. For example, if you see someone snatching a purse and running away, you don't need to know the specifics of the law that was broken to respond, you know that a law was broken (don't get me wrong, you SHOULD). You can stop that individual/deal with the situation, and look up the most-specific charge afterwards.

You have to consider the kind of signal you're sending, how far it has to go, how many signals, their voltage, their amperage, how to avoid cross talk in the wires, how to shield them from external electrical noise, from heat, from cold, you have to consider costs, and wear. What about optics?

And then you have the problem with the connectors. If I have a universal cable that can plug into anything, I'm in the danger of two different, incompatible ends plugging into one another. The equipment on either end will not appreciate a punch to the face that is some sort of electrical signal at some level or frequency it wasn't designed to withstand.

And the cost... Dear god, the cost.

Different, purposeful cables are actually an advantage. They're purpose built and are extremely good at their job. Often, when you wire something, that wire is going to be there for the long haul. That universalty is only useful up to the moment you plug both ends in, and it works. Now that the wire is there, all that extra ability is going to waste.

And if you're can do everything, you usually suck at all of it.

There is a desire for universal interfaces, and we're getting there for things that make sense: USB is by definition Universal, as is the first letter.

For example: the bandwidth of an Ethernet cable is dependent on the amount of twists per inch the cable has, but the more twists you have; the more cable length is traversed; and the less distance the signal will travel.  The bottom line is that the different technologies use different cable specs such as length, twists, gauge, etc. making it difficult to make a universal cable.  Another aspect is that many cables, like USB, also provide power along with signaling.

OrangeCrack,"The original word for the garment covering the legs of men was pantaloon. The word pant was often used as a synonym for pantleg, that is, the covering of only one leg. In this case the complete garment would have two pants, or better, a pair. Pantaloon as a garment could be used in the singular, but most often the plural was preferred. 

In the U.S. in particular, the single word ""pant"" came be used in the retail clothing industry (late 19th c. onward) to represent what every one else would call either ""pants"" or ""a pair of pants,"" e.g., "" A practical and well made pant for general sportswear"" (L.L. Bean Catalogue, 1962). 

Sometimes clerks would use pant alone as a part-for-the-whole expression, meaning a garment with pantlegs. But ""pants"" as we know them really got their start as a colloquialism in the U.S. in the 19th century. There is still a widespread feeling that ""pants"" are not quite as dignified as ""trousers."" 

I mentioned pantaloon. The word has an interesting history, which I'll only touch on. It was orginally the name of a character in the Italian commedia dell'arte. He represented a Venetian type and spoke in Venetian dialect (as did the Zanni character), and wore close-fitting trousers down to the foot. (Most commedia characters were known not only by their name, their calling, their dialect, and their manner, but also by their costume.) 

The French picked up on the name Pantalon (their version of Pantaleone), and passed it to the English as Pantaloon, both of which were used both for pants and for the character. Pantaloon is an old fool, whether in Italian, French or English. 

This does not answer the question about using the plural for a singular garment. This is also the case with shorts (that is, short pants). After the term ""pants"" came to be accepted for female attire, we had also pantaloons and panties, the latter being used both in the singular and in the plural, mostly in the plural. In a panty-raid, one steals panties. If a girl on spring break accidentally drops her bikini bottom you may say, ""She dropped her panties."" I don't know if anyone would ever say, ""She lost her panty,"" but I don't think so. (Panty in the singular is used mostly in trade language, like pant.) 

In any case, it's a garment with holes for the legs. This is also true of short shorts and tighty whities and briefs. But the actual covering of the legs is omitted altogether, unless you dignify the origin of the legs, or stump, as a pair of legs. When you don't even get the stump, as in a thong, no one uses the plural.

That said, the death of one party to a contract *usually* doesn't release the other party from the contract. I'd expect that to be the case for virtually any lease.

restricteddata,"[The same question came up on here a day or two ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rf3m3/eli5_why_can_some_countries_decide_who_can_and/); here's what I wrote there:

In the early 1960s, the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb. Maoist China had just set one off, and was considered a pretty looney ""rogue state"" at the time (Cultural Revolution and all that), and was a mutual enemy to both. Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism, there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future, as opposed to the five that then existed (US, USSR, UK, France, China). They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence (e.g. once China has nukes, you can't threaten China with nukes without being threatened back), and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to all-out nuclear war (which neither the US or the USSR wanted).

But the problem is that they didn't want to give up their own nukes. They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation. Once a country has nukes, a whole new (potentially stabilizing) political order emerges. They didn't want to give that up, they just wanted to stop _new_ political orders (which they saw as destabilizing) from cropping up elsewhere. 

The countries without nukes, of course, were like, wait, you guys get nukes, but we don't? Lame. So they made the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) include sections that said that the so-called Nuclear States (the ones that already had them) would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well. This is Article VI, which states:

&gt; Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.

Well that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding. All of them are willing to say, ""sure, we'll get rid of our nukes if everyone else does"" but they all know that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So why would a non-nuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is? Not so much because of the disarmament clause, but more because the NPT also says that non-nuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of ""peaceful"" nuclear energy as well. So they get help with reactors and things like that, as long as they agree to safeguards that won't let them weaponize any of it. It's also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region — if everyone in, say, South America agrees to not get the bomb (and this is enforced by means of the NPT), then that means you don't have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get one.

In practice things have always been messier than that. For one reason, not everybody signed the treaty. There were _many_ non-signatories/non-ratifiers until the end of the Cold War. Among them were two of the named nuclear states (France and China, both of whom did help other states proliferate), and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear (Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa), as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear (i.e. Egypt, Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil).

restricteddata,"[The same question came up on here a day or two ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rf3m3/eli5_why_can_some_countries_decide_who_can_and/); here's what I wrote there:

In the early 1960s, the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb. Maoist China had just set one off, and was considered a pretty looney ""rogue state"" at the time (Cultural Revolution and all that), and was a mutual enemy to both. Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism, there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future, as opposed to the five that then existed (US, USSR, UK, France, China). They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence (e.g. once China has nukes, you can't threaten China with nukes without being threatened back), and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to all-out nuclear war (which neither the US or the USSR wanted).

But the problem is that they didn't want to give up their own nukes. They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation. Once a country has nukes, a whole new (potentially stabilizing) political order emerges. They didn't want to give that up, they just wanted to stop _new_ political orders (which they saw as destabilizing) from cropping up elsewhere. 

The countries without nukes, of course, were like, wait, you guys get nukes, but we don't? Lame. So they made the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) include sections that said that the so-called Nuclear States (the ones that already had them) would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well. This is Article VI, which states:

&gt; Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.

Well that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding. All of them are willing to say, ""sure, we'll get rid of our nukes if everyone else does"" but they all know that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So why would a non-nuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is? Not so much because of the disarmament clause, but more because the NPT also says that non-nuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of ""peaceful"" nuclear energy as well. So they get help with reactors and things like that, as long as they agree to safeguards that won't let them weaponize any of it. It's also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region — if everyone in, say, South America agrees to not get the bomb (and this is enforced by means of the NPT), then that means you don't have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get one.

In practice things have always been messier than that. For one reason, not everybody signed the treaty. There were _many_ non-signatories/non-ratifiers until the end of the Cold War. Among them were two of the named nuclear states (France and China, both of whom did help other states proliferate), and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear (Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa), as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear (i.e. Egypt, Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil).

upvoter222,"You can probably find a more technical definition elsewhere, but basically, intentional grounding is a penalty committed when a passer (generally the quarterback) throws an incomplete pass to avoid being sacked (tackled behind where the play started).  There are specific rules dictating what qualifies as intentional grounding.

For example, it's not intentional grounding if the incomplete pass was headed towards an eligible receiver.  In other words, even if it's really obvious that the QB threw the ball knowing it would bounce or end up out of bounds, it's still legal if there's a receiver nearby.  Throwing near an eligible receiver is only required if the QB is in the ""pocket"".  The pocket, in ELI5-terms, can be thought of as the part of the field directly behind the linemen or big blockers up front.  

If the QB is outside the pocket (ie. scrambling around the field), he does not have to throw the ball near a receiver.  However, the ball has to be thrown beyond the line of scrimmage, further forward than where the ball was snapped.  

If a player is penalized for intentional grounding, the offense moves back either to the location of the throw or 10 yards backward, whichever is longer.  There is also a loss of down associated with this penalty, so if you intentionally ground the ball on 1st and 10, it can become 2nd and 20.  Also note that although it looks like it should be called, the rules do allow a QB to immediately spike the ball without a penalty to stop the clock.

Sloloem,"The difficulty is that politicians are allowed to take donations in a number of different ways and it's very difficult to prove that any of that money has been exchanged directly for a political favor.  Put simply, if you are running for a legislative position you may receive several thousand dollars from various entities in the freight shipping industry because they believe in you.  Most politicians want to be re-elected, so there's an expectation that if you act in the best interests of the freight shipping industry you will be able to get that money again next election cycle.  At no point did someone say to you that we'll donate to your campaign if you vote against this proposal to increase truck thruway tolls...that would be a bribe.

Lobbying even further complicates the issue because these are people who are allowed to sit down with a legislator on behalf of their business and literally tell them that they should support certain laws.  They're regulated and can't literally say they will pay for their law, but there's a lot of fuzzy gifting and other favors that lobbyists can provide...plus you're earning the good will of a party with deep pockets that may be more likely to donate to you when you're next up for election.

That's why you can't tell a police officer you'll give them money to let you out of a ticket.  HOWEVER, what you can do is donate to a Police Benevolent or Patrolman's Benevolent Association which are local unions that represent police officers in an area.  Now while this is anecdotal and partially bad-cop circlejerking, in my experience a police officer is far less likely to cite you if your car is displaying a PBA sticker implying you've donated.  When I was in the prime traffic ticket target age range I was pulled over a lot and I got a lot of tickets, the only times I was ever let off with a warning was after I got a PBA sticker.",null,0,cdng50r,1ri12w,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3
unpopopp,"Sorry for the length, but I want to weigh in here, because this simply is not a fair comparison. Police and legislators serve different functions, and ""bribing"" them raises completely different questions.  
 
It is true that there are much stricter laws for bribing a police officer than for bribing a legislator.  Lobbyists are much freer to cajole, wheedle, and overawe legislators with gift and meals and donations. (Note, though, that there are limits, sometimes strict ones. Whether those limits are enforced enough is a separate question)  

But how else could you do it? The whole point of legislators is to hear the arugments of their constituents and come to some conclusion about what policies to support.  Even if you blocked every dinner and every donation, people with an interest in particular policies would still, to paraphrase the First Amendent, do what they could to petition for the redress of greivances.  Maybe it would mean using more attractive lobbyists, or organizing protests, or something else, but it would invariably be more than is available to the average person like you or I.    
 
And, to a certain extent, that's okay. The protections are supposed to be built into the system elsewhere. Rather than making it easier for the executive to go after politicians they don't like (""oh a union member held the door open for you? Bribery!""), we have many legislators, who have to act publicly, and are subject to re-election.  We have courts that can curtail or overturn improper laws, and a free press that can try and shame the truly corrupt. We have constitutional limits on what the legislature can do. And, most importantly, we have elections. This is part of the reason why lobbying tends not to be about convincing people to change their minds and vote for you, but helping people who already support you to make an effort.  
   
A police officer is completely different.  They aren't making policy and carefully balancing the interests of constiuents, who may fundamentally disagree on what's right.  They are enforcing the law. Rather than the highest values being debate and deliberation, the highest values are impartiality and fairness.  You can't vote a cop out of office for being corrupt (usually), there's much less public scrutiny, and the situation itself is often quite different, by which I mean if you bribe a cop to let you go, you go free. If you ""bribe"" a legislator to make a speech, you may lose or win regardless.    
 
And, here I would go back to the rules that are in place to prevent undue influence on legislators.  These rules are usually rules that are designed to prevent the kind of non-policy influence that legislators wield, being stricter when it comes to firms that might win a contract because a Congressperson called on their behalf, or to block people from donating money to get immediate benefits.  
 
**TLDR;** Slipping a $50 to a cop to get him to overlook a crime is radically different from bundling the donations of likeminded people as a way of getting a legislator to support a particular policy goal.  
 
Also, just as a note, I personally think that there is way, way, way too much ""moneyed interest"" influence in politics, and that major reforms are necessary and should be immediately implemented.  But I don't think that it is correct to equate all lobbying with bribery, any more than one would equate all dieting with steroid use.

A cup of water can evaporate if, at the given temperature, the air above it can carry more water vapour than it currently does - in technical terms, when the vapour pressure of the water is lower than the equilibrium vapour pressure. Likewise, if, at a given temperature, the air is holding more water than it should be, then water will condense on a cold surface.

There is little limit on how much can actually condense onto a surface - as long as it is cold, and there is an abundance of moisture. However, in the _absence_ of a replenishing source of moisture, there can be little or no condensation. For example, if you bring out a cool shot glass into a hot summer day, you'll notice condensation build up over time. If you put a normal glass over the shotglass, such that there is no air circulation, there may be limited condensation - condensation only occurs as long as there is excess moisture in the air.

So in an enclosed garage, even with no thermal insulation, simply limiting the amount of air reduce how much frost can build up.

Now, to address the other point: temperature. Even a completely uninsulated garage can retain _some_ heat. All objects emit some form of thermal radiation - usually in the infrared range. This emitted radiation can be absorbed by other objects. A car, for example, can emit radiation that is absorbed by the ground. The ground, in turn, also emits radiation to the car. This means two objects in close proximity can maintain a thermal equilibrium.

If you park outside, however, any radiation emitted to, say, the house on the other side of the road, will be dispersed due to the [inverse square law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square_law) - it's harder to maintain equilibrium. Any radiation emitted to, say, the night sky, is guaranteed to pretty much never return. That's a net _loss_ in energy.

This means that, simply by providing four sides and a roof, you can retain _some_ amount of heat longer than if you parked outside. This is one reason cars parked in sheds with no door can have frost build-up only on sides where it's exposed (especially at the turn of the season, when it isn't really _that_ cold to develop frost elsewhere).",null,0,cdnjxwi,1ri0xe,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3
afcagroo,"You will find that your garage still remains much warmer than the outdoors.  There's no wind, and wind helps to carry heat away from warm objects.  And if your garage is attached to the house, it gets both insulation and heat from the house, as well as the house blocking the wind from part of the garage.  Also, even though your garage is ""uninsulated"", the walls of the garage do provide some intrinsic insulation.    
  
So when you drive your car with its hot engine into the garage and park it and close the garage door, you create a warmer space where heat doesn't flow away as rapidly as it would just parked outdoors. ",null,0,cdnfphi,1ri0xe,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

GentlePandoran,"It's all about the ""dew point"" which is the temperature at which dew will form on grass and bushes...and your car left outside. So for example maybe it's 50 degrees outside overnight...but the dew point is 53 degrees. This means that your car will get wet from dew at 53 degrees. But if it's 50 degrees outside and the dew point is 40 degrees, you car will NOT get wet overnight. Neither will the grass nor bushes be wet. 

Dew point is a humidity factor. The monsoon season in Phoenix, Arizona, for example, is calculated strictly on the dew point. Once it reaches a certain number, monsoon season has arrived...and will stay until that number goes back down, indicating that monsoon rains could arrive on any given day. 

Just like how high humidity will make your cold drink sweat and leave water rings, dew points high enough will make your car outside wet. It's that simple.

Check your local weather station for the dew point temperature. That way you'll know if your car is going to get wet at night or not.

In the first case, gruyere (and I think beemster) is usually ""washed"" while it's ripening by applying a solution of bacteria and other ingredients, which are rubbed into the cheese (so to speak) to promote ripening and to develop a particular flavor.

In the second, a wax coating (often accompanied with cheesecloth) may be applied for a few reasons. First, and perhaps most inportantly, it keeps moisture from escaping the cheese, and arrests the ripening to a degree.

MiracleRiver,"Some early stage research has shown some very exciting beneficial effects of female circumcision in Africa. Namely, a potential reduction in HIV/AIDs of around 50%.

I think further medical research is required. In Africa, RCTs were run on black African men to determine the efficacy of the amputation of the foreskin in reductions in HIV/AIDS. Obviously, RCTs could not be done on white western men for ethical reasons! 

So it's imperative that urgent RCTs be performed on black African women, in order that they too might enjoy the potential benefits that men gain from circumcision. Once again, it's not ethical to run these RCTs on white western women of course.

If the research is positive (hopefully), then perhaps WHO will recommend female circumcision along with male circumcision.

Like male circumcision, there are plenty of peer reviewed studies that show female circumcision is not a barrier to sexual orgasm and enjoyment. Some studies show that orgasm and enjoyment are reduced; and some show no effect.

You'll often come across members of the medical community saying that FGM has no ""health"" benefits, and if women have their clitoris amputated, then their sex life comes to an end. Then they say that MGM has lots of ""health"" benefits and that men's sex life is not affected.

But it's a myth that many women who have suffered FGM are unhappy and cannot have great sex lives. That's why they queue up to have their daughters' circumcised. Plus there are many so-called potential ""health benefits"" - such as a 50% reduction in HIV/AIDS.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris

The visible part - the glans clitoris - is only a small part of the whole clitoris. So when a woman suffers partial or total amputation of the external clitoris when undergoing FGM, only a small part of her clitoris is removed. Thus she often can enjoy a full and satisfying sex life.

The wire, however, which is attached to / threaded through these brackets, is made of some sort of memory alloy which (when bent away from its ""set"" position) will try to bend back to what it was ""set"" to (the 'correct' shape of the mouth / layout of the teeth).

Sometimes the wire is not cut enough towards the back of the mouth where it pokes out at the end of the brackets, and is (usually) able to cut the inside of the mouth. If the gum scrapes along it (while chewing or speaking, for example), it is likely to damage the inner lining of the cheek.

For example, after the 3rd tooth, all my bracers have hooks which are damned sharp. Those are used at a later stage in order to correct the whole jaw. Rubber bands are put on those hooks in order to exert pressure and correct the jaw.

To be honest, to say that no one has come up with a solution to the problem is bull crap. You just didn't research on the matter enough. When I did put my bracers, I was allowed to choose from multiple designs. I chose titanium, mini bracers which resemble the classic ones - just smaller. However, there were all sorts of other materials and designs. There was these ones made of some kind of a ceramic material, which was the same color as the teeth and the manifacturer claimed that they are way smoother. The most interesting ones where a type of bracers that were glued to the inside of your mouth, rather than the outside. Initially, I though of getting these, but my dentist told me that the classic design is the most efficient.

If your little girl suffers from the bracers, there is another clever solution - dental wax. You can get it from every drug store/pharmacy etc. It is a bit like chewing gum, but more dense and hard. You just take a bit from the dental wax, roll it into a ball and stick it to the the places that cause pain to your little girl. It's purpose is actually to smoothen the bracers so they dont tear the inside of your poor girl's mouth. This clever thing saved from countless of sleepless nights.

The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth, like others have noted. However, they also have to be cut to fit her mouth— sometimes if the wire is too long, they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain. This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire, bending the tips of the wire, or using dental wax as others have suggested. I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself- it's a few cents to them, free to you, and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter. 


As to why it's metal, there are several other statements that essentially address the issue. The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth, yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire. Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheap—there simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility, cost, etc. Unfortunately, cutting metal leads to sharp edges, unless it's treated with something to smooth out the edge. As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out, they don't do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut.

Pandashriek,"I am a current bracers wearer and I am one of those unlucky ones. You see, not all people have those sharp bracers. For example, after the 3rd tooth, all my bracers have hooks which are damned sharp. Those are used at a later stage in order to correct the whole jaw. Rubber bands are put on those hooks in order to exert pressure and correct the jaw.

To be honest, to say that no one has come up with a solution to the problem is bull crap. You just didn't research on the matter enough. When I did put my bracers, I was allowed to choose from multiple designs. I chose titanium, mini bracers which resemble the classic ones - just smaller. However, there were all sorts of other materials and designs. There was these ones made of some kind of a ceramic material, which was the same color as the teeth and the manifacturer claimed that they are way smoother. The most interesting ones where a type of bracers that were glued to the inside of your mouth, rather than the outside. Initially, I though of getting these, but my dentist told me that the classic design is the most efficient.

If your little girl suffers from the bracers, there is another clever solution - dental wax. You can get it from every drug store/pharmacy etc. It is a bit like chewing gum, but more dense and hard. You just take a bit from the dental wax, roll it into a ball and stick it to the the places that cause pain to your little girl. It's purpose is actually to smoothen the bracers so they dont tear the inside of your poor girl's mouth. This clever thing saved from countless of sleepless nights.

Good look to you and your little girl.

debman,"There are several parts to braces that can be sharp. The braces themselves, which may cause some irritation at first but her lips will get used to. The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth, like others have noted. However, they also have to be cut to fit her mouth— sometimes if the wire is too long, they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain. This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire, bending the tips of the wire, or using dental wax as others have suggested. I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself- it's a few cents to them, free to you, and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter. 


As to why it's metal, there are several other statements that essentially address the issue. The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth, yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire. Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheap—there simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility, cost, etc. Unfortunately, cutting metal leads to sharp edges, unless it's treated with something to smooth out the edge. As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out, they don't do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut.

rule_Britania,"Both UDP and TCP are protocols that sit just above the IP layer. To put this in context you need to look at the OSI stack: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model. But essentially each layer wraps the one above it with some more information such as where it is meant to be going, how big it is etc.

To really understand what is happening here, you need to know at the most basic level what an IP address is and what a port is. So an IP address is your internet facing address. Forgetting lots of clever tricks where people/computers can share IP addresses (c.f. NAT, LAN), every computer has a unique address. But within each computer there are lots of processes running. This is where port numbers come in. The operating system needs to know which process to send the data to, and that is signified by the port number. Now IP has no concept of ports, so you need a protocol on top of that to contain the port information. This is UDP.

So the UDP header literally contains a 'source' port and a 'destination' port. The other two fields which are required are 'length', to tell the computer where this packet ends and the next begins. And a checksum just to add some level of reliability about the port numbers not being corrupt.

So UDP is the most basic way of sending data between processes across a network. TCP adds a LOT of other things such as congestion control, flow control and reliability; all of which UDP doesn't have.

lumpy_potato,"TCP/UDP are basically rules for how data is sent/received.

TCP is very concerned about the integrity of the data sent. UDP not so much - as long as it gets there, even if you lose some data on the way, its not that big of a deal.

Think of it like this - you have some data that goes out over the internet. It gets split up into packets 1-20.

With TCP, you have to wait until you get all 1-20 packets - if 19 goes missing, you request it again, until you have it. Then you put 1-20 in order, and voila, there is your data.

With UDP, you can be missing packages 10-15, who gives a shit. I have 1-9 and 16-20, lets put together what we can and ask for the next batch.

TCP is very good when data integrity matters - file transfers, for instance - a missing packet or two can cause data corruption.

UDP is very good when speed matters - video, voice, etc. Losing a few frames to packet loss doesn't matter. What does matter is not wasting time waiting for those lost packets to arrive, or requesting them again. Who cares? Get what data you can, the user is more concerned with the voice/video happening with minimal lag, rather than to be super smooth.

Depending on how you want the end product to look, you might choose TCP, you might choose UDP, or maybe some hybrid of the two.",null,0,cdnffnw,1rhzlg,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

Democrats tend to want the national government to have a larger role in people's lives. This is why they support things such as universal healthcare, gun control, and more regulation of businesses and the economy. They encourage higher taxes on the wealthy in America, in order to support the middle and lower classes. On social issues, they support support gay marriage, women's rights in abortion (pro-choice), and stem cell research. Democrats usually support protection of the environment, and thus are not as open to drilling for oil domestically. They are often seen as the more ""anti-war"" party, but that hasn't always been the case. Democrats will be more likely to cut defense spending.

Republicans are called ""conservatives"" because they mainly support traditional values and beliefs. Republicans normally do not support government involvement in economics, and want the free market to regulate itself. Thus, they often do not support higher taxes on the wealthy, and often believe in flat tax rates for all. They strongly oppose gun control and legislation which limits these rights. In regard to social issues, Republicans often do not support gay marriage, stem cell research, and are often pro-life. Republicans are more willing to drill for oil and natural resources on American soil, even if it means environmental harm. On foreign policy, conservatives support a strong military and will support military action overseas more often than not.

One of the big issues now (and the reason the government was shut down) was because they did not support the ACA (Obamacare) which was passed to reform healthcare, because they believe health insurance should be private.

OnionSquire,"When you sleep your body releases a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). What GABA does is effectively paralyze your body, or at the very least, your brains ability to move muscles. This occurs during REM sleep when you're dreaming; it's to prevent you from acting out your dreams, your body expends next to no energy in this state and consumes very little oxygen. This is only one reason why you don't fall off the bed though. REM sleep, when you're actually dreaming, only happens in 90 minuet intervals and only lasts a precious few minutes. So that dream you had where you were skate boarding down a big hill that lasted for hours, only took up a few moments of your actual time. 

There are 5 stages to sleep. N-REM 1, N-REM 2, N-REM 3, N-REM 2 again, and REM. During this cycle, outside of REM, your body and mind are effectively awake. You're not aware of your surroundings, but you're aware enough to know when there's an edge near you, or a predator, and you move away. Incidentally, if you ever get the feeling like you're falling when you're going to sleep, this occurs in N-REM 2 where ""sleep spindles"" happen. A sleep spindle is a sudden massive burst of neural activity that usually jolts a muscle and wakes a person.

i_accidently_reddit,"To understand this, we need to look at the history of writing in the west.

In the modern day western world, we use the Latin alphabet. The Romans however first wrote in Greek.

But maybe you know, just how much of a chip the Romans had on their shoulder about not being seen as as smart and as cultivated as the Greeks. So while Greek still was lingua franca in the Roman Empire, they got really obsessed with their own culture and language and tried very hard to make Latin the dominant language in the Mediterranean.

And of course, developing a own typography goes a long way in setting the two languages apart. This led to what we now know as the Latin alphabet, excluding J, W and U, and all upper case.

Seeing however, that it is quite tedious to write all those big capital letters all the time, the written language evolved into what is called a uncial script.

All the letters are still majuscules, but the beginning of a sentence or a important wort is capitalized. so essentially its smaller capital letters, if that makes sense?

Now this is were the fun part starts: typographers are a weird bunch of people, they are both artists and geometers. Back then, every written text was basically a piece of art, with the capitalised letters being carefully ornated, trying to reflect the tenor of the writing. And the typographer himself knows how the properties of some letters within the text, impact the whole synthesis of his art work.

And seeing that he has some sort of artistic freedom, he just cant allow a A, H or R to destroy the natural flow of text he is trying to convey.

Fun fact on the side: there are Latin papyri dating back to around the turn of the eras, that include lower case letters for the before mentioned a, h or r.

So from there on, it is basically just years and years (two thousand and counting) of improving on the given letters. And this is still happening, for example the upper case S used to have two lower case letters, "" s  "" and "" ſ "" which we got rid of basically just recently, in the beginning of 20th century. Or the english ""th"" used to be the a rune called thorn and fell out of favour in the middle ages.

Romans wrote Latin in Greek.

Now repeat that over hundreds of words and all you have are hundreds of different rectangles where the only difference is their letter length. It all comes down to word recognition based on something called ""shape contrast"". 

For example the words ""PENNY"" and ""PENCIL"" are hard to differentiate quickly when they're all caps. However, ""Penny"" and ""Pencil"" are much easier due to the shape contrast of ascenders and descenders.

ELY20 (explain like you're 20):
Before van Gogh, what mattered was the subject. The painting had to look like the object it was supposed to represent. An artist was only good when creating a variation on a subject matter.
After van Gogh, the intent of the artist became more important. The painting no longer had to represent a specific object. Van Gogh is part of a larger move towards abstraction where the final painting is only the end-product of a longer process. The [Starry Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) is a picture of a starry night and the way van Gogh felt before that scene, both at the same time. That is why the psychological aspect is so important in understanding his paintings. It would take the work of other great artists before full abstraction became recognized as a form of art.

Let's take his [Irises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gogh,_Vincent_van_-_Irises_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) painting.  The reason he is so considered to be so good is that the painting above generates inside of people the impression of seeing a field of Irises while not actually using all the forms and colors of an actual purple [Irises](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BWtpA40ghG4/TaNyV4qcyCI/AAAAAAAAASk/6-5q4Rq2hHY/s1600/purple_irises.jpg).   

To see where this started; painters at one point were basically cameras and someone like Martin Johnson Heade produced a painting called [Birds and flowers](http://www.painting-analysis.com/oiseaux300.jpg).  Then people like Monet started to question this dogma with paintings like [Nympheas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nympheas_71293_3.jpg).  When Van Gogh and other painters at his time came around they pushed these questions harder and with more rigor than those before.  Following Van Gogh people like Picasso pushed this idea even further [Flowers in a Grey Jug and Wine-Glass with Spoon](http://www.artgalleryabc.com/images/stories/P/Picasso/picasso232.JPG).  In all of these images you get the idea and feeling of a flower and that is what an artist does.  Its not their job to reproduce a flower as it is seen.

The value of ALL of the privately owned land in a large city would be more than any private company (even the biggest) could afford.  That would still leave public land that would need to be acquired - which would likely prove even more difficult, especially if the company's intentions were perceived to be less than magnanimous.  On top of that, there would still need to be a democratically elected government/city council representative of the people - which is something that is outlined by City Charters, State Constitutions, and the U.S. Constitution.  Even if you were able to buy up all of the land, utilities etc...of a major city (highly unlikely) - the risk would be tremendous.  At the end of the day - the people are the sovereign, and eventually they could start doing things like using Eminent Domain to seize private property to be used for public good.  If said company was perceived to be operating in the best interests of shareholders and NOT the best interests of city residents - it wouldn't take much for populist sentiment to lead to such seizures, making the initial investment a very risky one.

In PRACTICE no private company would do this because:
Cities that are cash-strapped and struggling have historically been highly open to public/private partnerships that give away sweetheart deals to private companies.  They typically come in the form of tax credits or subsidies for Company X to build a new plant, or offices in the city or state.

Silent letters can happen because the way people spoke a word changed and the way it was spelled didn't (if you think about how hard it was, in older times, to make new copies of all the existing books, you can probably appreciate why people didn't make new copies of all their books every time the pronunciation of a word changed).

Or they can happen because two words got shoved together (Wikipedia's example is ""cupboard"", which literally started as ""cup board"", but as one word started to run together until the 'p' was silent).

And so on and so forth; silent letters usually tell us something about the history of the word and the language it appears in, though exactly *what* they tell may require some digging.

As for two-letter combinations (digraphs), commonly it's because there wasn't one letter that exactly had the sound.

'Phone' is a good example: in ancient Greek the letter ɸ (phi) represented a sound that was like 'p', but ""aspirated"" (breathy -- as you make the 'p' sound, also breathe out so that the breath also makes a sound). There wasn't anything in the Latin alphabet corresponding to that sound, so 'ph' was chosen for transcribing Greek words.

But the sound of the Greek ɸ evolved to where, in modern Greek, it's close enough in sound to be interchangeable with the Latin alphabet's 'f'. So now we are still pronouncing 'ph' the way the Greek ɸ is pronounced, even though that sound no longer matches the 'ph' originally used to transcribe ɸ.",null,0,cdne2cq,1rhuzt,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3

Fairleee,"The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history - it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures, because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing - this universally agreed thing is called a standard. There are a number of different standards, and sometimes we don't have a single one. Consider something like transferring data between devices. The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer, but it isn't the only one - however, because it is so popular, most devices will have a USB port.

In terms of distance, these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do - basically, if we didn't have a standard system of measurement for length, then mass production of components couldn't exist, which would mean that we wouldn't be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform way.

The meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length. This is similar to the celsius system of temperature, which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system. However, the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough, or constant enough, to be fully acceptable. So, part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant. To measure time, a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom - I can't remember details off the top of my head. For distance, the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain (incredibly tiny) period of time.

As for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere, yes, there is! There is a prototype meter (kept in France, I believe), and a number of almost identical (with the tiniest, tiniest variations, and the variations of which are recorded) meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards. So basically, precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter. Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these, and so on, and so on. 

So, a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate, but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing. However, if you are doing a job that requires a very, very, very high degree of accuracy (such as precision engineering), then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration. And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the world.

Fairleee,"The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history - it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures, because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing - this universally agreed thing is called a standard. There are a number of different standards, and sometimes we don't have a single one. Consider something like transferring data between devices. The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer, but it isn't the only one - however, because it is so popular, most devices will have a USB port.

In terms of distance, these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do - basically, if we didn't have a standard system of measurement for length, then mass production of components couldn't exist, which would mean that we wouldn't be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform way.

The meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length. This is similar to the celsius system of temperature, which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system. However, the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough, or constant enough, to be fully acceptable. So, part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant. To measure time, a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom - I can't remember details off the top of my head. For distance, the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain (incredibly tiny) period of time.

As for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere, yes, there is! There is a prototype meter (kept in France, I believe), and a number of almost identical (with the tiniest, tiniest variations, and the variations of which are recorded) meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards. So basically, precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter. Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these, and so on, and so on. 

So, a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate, but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing. However, if you are doing a job that requires a very, very, very high degree of accuracy (such as precision engineering), then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration. And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the world.

At this time, the animals that are best adapted to the old environment, will suddenly lose all of their advantages and either die outright or be displaced by something else.

Upon reaching a critical size, the amount of food just isn't enough to sustain the larger animal and this their production cycle slows in which also shows evolution. 



Small animal on the other hand requires less energy to sustain their population which allows abundance of excesses. This will allow their population to increase. Via having more babies and generations of babies, the speed of evolution is thus sped up for the animal to adapt better to their environment.

* Never wash whites with colors
* Depending on your budget, dress and professional clothes will last longer if dry-cleaned. They will also press them for you, keeping creases where you want them. Extra points for choosing an organic dry cleaner, which are more common now than they were a few years ago. This is good for you and the environment.
* If you wash and dry clothes yourself, move from washer to dryer as soon as possible after the cycle finishes. Similarly, remove clothes from the dryer as soon as possible. Hang clothes you don't want to get wrinkled (slacks, dress shirts, etc.)
* Be sure, when you hang clothes, you fold them along the creases you want. This is particularly true with pants - seam-to-seam from the ankles to the inseam. You can fold the slacks over a plastic coathanger or use one with clips, whichever you prefer.
* Unless you want to dry clean all of your professional clothes, learn how to iron. Even if you don't do a perfect job, an 80% well-ironed shirt says ""I'm a bachelor, but I care about my appearance"". An unironed shirt says ""I'm a slob"".

Git_Off_Me_Lawn,"On defense you usually have a 4-3 or 3-4 formation.  The first number is the number of players on the line of scrimmage, and the second number is the number of linebackers.

That's seven of our eleven players.  There's generally 2 safeties (defensive backs with special names) to prevent big plays and 2 other defensive backs to defend receivers.  That formation would be fine for a run but terrible for a pass play.

Let's say the offense brings out 3 wide receivers on a fairly obvious pass play.  You can't effectively cover them, the tight end, and the RB who may be coming out of the backfield with just 2 people specifically covering receivers and your linebackers may not be all that good in coverage.  So what you might do in this case is trade one of your front seven players for another DB.  That's called a nickle package because you now have 5 dedicated DBs on the field (your three cornerbacks and two safeties.)  A dime package is trading two of your front seven for extra DBs (two nickles makes a dime).

The difference between zone and man coverage is that man to man coverage has a defensive player specifically assigned to cover a specific offensive player.  With zone coverage the defense is in charge of a specific area on the field and defends anyone who enters their zone.

The pros and cons of man coverage are that you need really good cornerbacks to lean heavily on this type of coverage, but if you have the talent you can completely shutdown an opposing receiver the entire game.  For zone coverage it's pretty good at not giving up big plays because everyone tries to keep the receiver they're covering in front of them, but there's holes in a zone defense that can be read by receivers and QBs to gain yards even if they're not big plays.

Generally both teams get enough time to see personnel groupings and plan around them before the play starts.  If the offense originally called a run up the middle but the defense brought in a bunch of heavy run stopping players, the QB might audible to a play action or quick screen pass.

josh4rim,"**Jaw Impact**

A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin around. This quick motion of causes trauma to the brain that knocks the recipient out leaving him unconscious. Points on the jaw that are especially vulnerable to knockouts are the sides of the chin, and where the jaw is attaches to the skull.

**Acceleration and Deceleration**

When the jaw is punched, the head quickly accelerates around. After a fraction of a second, it quickly decelerates as muscles, tendons, and bones prevent the head from spinning any further. The brain inside the skull is floating in fluid. It accelerates slower than the rest of the head. This forces it to crash into the inside of the skull when the head stops.


**Brain Trauma
**
When the brain slams into the inside of the skull, it suffers trauma. It then bounces off the inside of the skull and slams into the opposite side. This causes even more trauma. Depending on the force of the punch, this can happen several times before the brain comes to rest inside the skull.

**Nervous System Response**

The trauma to the brain stimulates an overwhelming number of neurotransmitters to fire at the same time. This essentially overloads the nervous system sending it into a state of temporary paralysis. The person who is hit in the jaw loses consciousness and his muscles relax. The injured person falls to the ground with no memory of being hit.

**Recovery**

A person who is knocked out by a punch to the jaw suffers a severe concussion. It can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes to regain consciousness. It all depends on the severity of the brain trauma. In mild cases, the person who is knocked out can shake off the punch with little more than a headache. In severe cases, brain trauma from a knockout punch to the jaw can cause cerebral bleeding and death.

School, Movies, Sitcoms, Religions, Youtube, Fraternaties, and everywhere else you go, the mind is treated like a shake-toy.  Roller coasters at Disney: ""the Hulk"" bash your head sideways against hard plastic.  Roller coasters have people push their head against a vibrating car.  Children are encouraged to hit the soccer ball with their head.  Kids put their heads in hard plastic spheres and hit it against others as the crowd cheers.  Take your jet engine and wrap it with some padding and throw it off a one story building. Your brain has the consistency of jello and your skull has the consistency of stone.  If I take your brain and pour it into a square bowl, it will take the shape of that bowl.  Vibrating your head will cause ripples and vibrations in that jello.  Shake hard enough and you get scarring, blood clots that expand and push and leak between the modules to cause destruction of neurons.

Getting knocked out causes undiagnosed subdural hematomas which is when blood leaks out of the arteries to flood the neurons and it suffocates a sub-net of your mind as scabbing occurs to stop the leak.  The brain being the most remarkable instrument on the planet can remap old functionality onto new hardware in an instant.  Normally scarring occurs anywhere along the edges of your mind, and your dedicated employees of yours (the 30 million layers of hierarchical hidden markov models) disappear.  Car accidents.  Getting punched.  Hitting your head on the ice.  Contact sports, falling out of the crib cracking your skull open.  Being ""Knocked out"" or a having a concussion.  If your brain experiences a shock of more than 7 G's, you may get brain damage.  The brain can re-map functionality (quite quickly) to other parts of the brain, it will heal itself, but you will be running your hardware system with fewer resources.  Why are boxing champions retarded? Because they have multiple brain injuries.

noptotsch,"Basically, a person knocked out is saving energy for primary body function by blocking functions strictly unnecessary to survival. It's physically processing a (huge) blow (to that person). This can be mentally, coming from a shock or otherwise difficult context of input to your brain, this can be physically as a reaction to a huge slam, bloodloss or otherwise. The result of knockout is in any case a physical reaction where the body physically switches back to survival mode by disabling secondary physical body functions such as seeing, smelling, moving. Sometimes the body already does this to prevent further damage by say assessing and processing any mental or physical (most often sudden) blow to its perception of reality (you can get knock out as shock, no physical blow recieved here), so this can happen as a precaution where physically your body doesn't necessarily needs to shutdown these secondary functions. 

BTW, going more directly into your question, assuming 'trend game' is something like people kneeling down and suddenly stand up to faint; this is like physically draining the oxygen from your head, people sometimes do it by kicking each other in the lungs or stomach too, by suddenly standing up your brain notices decrease of oxygen in bloodflow and shuts down to save the energy for primary function, sort of survival reflex. ",null,1,cdnfoy4,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3
PRATFO,"I don't know about any of the explanations that the brain ""shuts down"" for protective reasons, I just don't see the adaptive benefit to this unless you're arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult. This simply is not the case, if anything, the blood flow is increased following impact. This is the basis of second-impact syndrome. When there is concussion, brain function is altered, resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time. Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate. As a result of this dilation, there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edema.

As to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness, I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement. There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal. The details probably aren't worth going into. But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries. This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness, likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants, such as the Moro reflex, which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change. This reflex originates in the pons. 

ELI5: Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem, where the arousal network is. This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed, this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem, this is called the fencing response.

Your brain is suspended in fluid and there is nothing else that keeps it apart from the skull. When sudden acceleration or deceleration happens, it will cause the brain to smash against the skull.

Another way can be when your brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters. Whether it be pain, flashing lights (epilepsy), and so on, if the brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters it will overload and shut down for it's own safety. 

In the case of an oxygen deficiency, do people remember the ""game"" where people used to play by choking each other until they pass out?

maeon3,"What happens during a head injury event?

School, Movies, Sitcoms, Religions, Youtube, Fraternaties, and everywhere else you go, the mind is treated like a shake-toy.  Roller coasters at Disney: ""the Hulk"" bash your head sideways against hard plastic.  Roller coasters have people push their head against a vibrating car.  Children are encouraged to hit the soccer ball with their head.  Kids put their heads in hard plastic spheres and hit it against others as the crowd cheers.  Take your jet engine and wrap it with some padding and throw it off a one story building. Your brain has the consistency of jello and your skull has the consistency of stone.  If I take your brain and pour it into a square bowl, it will take the shape of that bowl.  Vibrating your head will cause ripples and vibrations in that jello.  Shake hard enough and you get scarring, blood clots that expand and push and leak between the modules to cause destruction of neurons.

Getting knocked out causes undiagnosed subdural hematomas which is when blood leaks out of the arteries to flood the neurons and it suffocates a sub-net of your mind as scabbing occurs to stop the leak.  The brain being the most remarkable instrument on the planet can remap old functionality onto new hardware in an instant.  Normally scarring occurs anywhere along the edges of your mind, and your dedicated employees of yours (the 30 million layers of hierarchical hidden markov models) disappear.  Car accidents.  Getting punched.  Hitting your head on the ice.  Contact sports, falling out of the crib cracking your skull open.  Being ""Knocked out"" or a having a concussion.  If your brain experiences a shock of more than 7 G's, you may get brain damage.  The brain can re-map functionality (quite quickly) to other parts of the brain, it will heal itself, but you will be running your hardware system with fewer resources.  Why are boxing champions retarded? Because they have multiple brain injuries.

noptotsch,"Basically, a person knocked out is saving energy for primary body function by blocking functions strictly unnecessary to survival. It's physically processing a (huge) blow (to that person). This can be mentally, coming from a shock or otherwise difficult context of input to your brain, this can be physically as a reaction to a huge slam, bloodloss or otherwise. The result of knockout is in any case a physical reaction where the body physically switches back to survival mode by disabling secondary physical body functions such as seeing, smelling, moving. Sometimes the body already does this to prevent further damage by say assessing and processing any mental or physical (most often sudden) blow to its perception of reality (you can get knock out as shock, no physical blow recieved here), so this can happen as a precaution where physically your body doesn't necessarily needs to shutdown these secondary functions. 

BTW, going more directly into your question, assuming 'trend game' is something like people kneeling down and suddenly stand up to faint; this is like physically draining the oxygen from your head, people sometimes do it by kicking each other in the lungs or stomach too, by suddenly standing up your brain notices decrease of oxygen in bloodflow and shuts down to save the energy for primary function, sort of survival reflex.

PRATFO,"I don't know about any of the explanations that the brain ""shuts down"" for protective reasons, I just don't see the adaptive benefit to this unless you're arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult. This simply is not the case, if anything, the blood flow is increased following impact. This is the basis of second-impact syndrome. When there is concussion, brain function is altered, resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time. Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate. As a result of this dilation, there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edema.

As to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness, I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement. There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal. The details probably aren't worth going into. But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries. This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness, likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants, such as the Moro reflex, which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change. This reflex originates in the pons. 

ELI5: Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem, where the arousal network is. This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed, this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem, this is called the fencing response.

When the jaw is hit, the head turns as a result of the force of the punch.

SoWhatIfImChristian,"Just like a lot of the posts here have explained, it has to do with either you brain receiving trauma or damage, an overload of sensors or insufficient oxygen levels reaching the brain. 

Whether it be getting hit on the jaw, being in a car crash, etc, all of this causes a fast acceleration to your head. Your brain is suspended in fluid and there is nothing else that keeps it apart from the skull. When sudden acceleration or deceleration happens, it will cause the brain to smash against the skull. This will cause trauma or damage and result in being ""knocked out.""

Another way can be when your brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters. Whether it be pain, flashing lights (epilepsy), and so on, if the brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters it will overload and shut down for it's own safety. 

In the case of an oxygen deficiency, do people remember the ""game"" where people used to play by choking each other until they pass out? In order for the brain to function, it needs a continuous stream of oxygen being . When oxygen is cut off, it results in cerebral hypoxia. When you get choked either by someone else, a belt, a rope or anything, it cuts off the blood supply to your head. The oxygen is carried through your blood, thus it results in cerebral hypoxia. If this lack of oxygen/blood is cut off long enough, you will die. Even if you don't die, it will possibly result in permanent brain damage. ",null,0,cdo18uy,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

- Bad keying (""removing the green""). This may come from bad or poorly configured software, or mistakes in the shoot. Good greenscreen footage requires specific lights which may not be what the set would call for without green screen. Hair or green reflections in skin, as well as other tricky materials cause all kinds of trouble.
- Mismatched lenses / camera movement / perspectives / depth of field / parallax mess with our sense of 3D space. Maybe unlike the light issues, these mistakes might be hard for non-trained eye to spot or specify, but they do contribute to the effect of something being ""not quite right"".

ShingamiOfSmarm,"To reduce it to the 5 year old level, 2 reasons-
First and foremost, Almost all connections used nowadays are digital.  coaxial cable use an analog signal, but that's usually just to carry a digital signal over long distances (IE, to your cable box).
The difference there is analog acts like a wave.  It weakens the further it travels and the worse the medium.     if it gets weak, the end result is fuzzy.
Digital, though, is just 1s and 0s.  Literally. A series of on states and off states.
If that comes through weaker, it's still just 1s and s.  
So, with digital, it's an all or nothing thing, so, signal quality does not matter as much.            
Secondly,  and this one is why people get so about it, is that all those quality enhancements on monster cables? They are complete lies.  Gold plating does nothing to enhance signal, and almost nothing to enhance the connection.  If they used gold the whole way through, it would, but it would also make the cables heavy and far too expensive to be profitable.     
The extra rubber around the outside? it does nothing for the signal.  Just makes the wires more physically durable.    
Those fancy connector heads? all for show.  They do not enhance signal at all.        
In short, monster cable has always lied about why monster cable was better; In modern times, even if they're promises were true, they'd be irrelevant, because the way we send signals does not care about strength much anymore.          
Oh, and the 200 monster cable is not only indistinguishable in quality from a 4 dollar one-

ShingamiOfSmarm,"To reduce it to the 5 year old level, 2 reasons-
First and foremost, Almost all connections used nowadays are digital.  coaxial cable use an analog signal, but that's usually just to carry a digital signal over long distances (IE, to your cable box).
The difference there is analog acts like a wave.  It weakens the further it travels and the worse the medium.     if it gets weak, the end result is fuzzy.
Digital, though, is just 1s and 0s.  Literally. A series of on states and off states.
If that comes through weaker, it's still just 1s and s.  
So, with digital, it's an all or nothing thing, so, signal quality does not matter as much.            
Secondly,  and this one is why people get so about it, is that all those quality enhancements on monster cables? They are complete lies.  Gold plating does nothing to enhance signal, and almost nothing to enhance the connection.  If they used gold the whole way through, it would, but it would also make the cables heavy and far too expensive to be profitable.     
The extra rubber around the outside? it does nothing for the signal.  Just makes the wires more physically durable.    
Those fancy connector heads? all for show.  They do not enhance signal at all.        
In short, monster cable has always lied about why monster cable was better; In modern times, even if they're promises were true, they'd be irrelevant, because the way we send signals does not care about strength much anymore.          
Oh, and the 200 monster cable is not only indistinguishable in quality from a 4 dollar one-

Posty1980,"This applies only to their analog audio cables, anything digital is 100% or nothing. According to Monster Inc. they learned that high frequency and low frequency signals travel though the cable at slightly different speeds. They created a special type of wrapping for the cables, thicker gauge wire in the center, and thinner gauge but more tightly wrapped on the outside. Basically it slows the high frequency sounds down because they wind up having to travel farther. I've done a side by side comparison with analogue Monster audio cables and regular audio cables, and there was a very noticeable improvement. Beyond that pretty much everything else they sell is over priced bullshit; well they do make some decent surge protectors.

JohnSmith1800,"Your airway (trachea) and food ""pipe"" (esophagus) run parallel to each other down your neck. The problem arises because of an evolutionary fluke, the esophagus is behind the trachea. This means that in order for food to get down it, it has to pass over the trachea's opening. If it goes down there, it can obstruct your airway, and you choke (to death is optional).

Normally you don't choke. This is because of a handy flap of tissue at the top back of the trachea, which flops down and covers the opening when you swallow. Most of the time this works and you don't choke, occasionally it doesn't. When it doesn't, the food will undergo one of a few possible outcomes.

It'll usually be expelled by coughing; The lining of the trachea is very sensitive to foreign objects.  For very small particles (or water) it'll pass down into the lungs. Here it will usually be destroyed by macrophages (little cells that absorb stuff, a lot of them hang out in the lungs for just this purpose). Option 3 is that it doesn't come out at all. This may or may not be fatal. For example, bones from meat can lodge in an airway and not actually kill you (although you're at high risk of infection).

There were no recordings, so the only way to actually HEAR the music of the time was to hear it performed. Major cities throughout Europe had their own orchestras; it's not as if one famous orchestra of composer would travel in some grand tour, it was the music itself that traveled, and the name that was attached to that music.

Today, the face of the music is of the performer, because that's what we all can see. It's distributed via TV, radio, and mp3s. We hear the one artist's performance, not one song performed by the local musicians in each town.

maestro2005,"Okay so, nobody here is right.  Not even doovidooves with his 110 upvotes.  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording, and ""classical"" versus ""modern"" isn't the right way to break things down.

First, some terminology.  I'm going to refer to it as ""Classical"" versus ""Popular"".  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music (e.g. Gregorian chant), certain types of Renaissance music (motets, madrigals, etc.), the Baroque period, the Classical period, the Romantic period, and modern periods that we don't quite have the historical context to classify yet.  It continues to be written today.

Popular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created, which today involves the rock combo with guitars, basses, drum sets, keyboards, etc., but includes folk music all the way back.  It actually predates Classical.

Popular music has always been meant to be easily imitable.  In the days before recording, it was meant to be played/sung by amateur musicians in the home, or around the campfire, or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be.  It's simpler music, not that impressive in its composition, so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer.  And usually, there aren't that many performers, which makes it simpler still.

Classical music is not meant to be easily imitated.  The forms are longer and more complicated, and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master.  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits.  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor.  We marvel at the composer's ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece.  We still marvel at the performers, but we marvel more at the composer.  Many people can both write and play Popular music.  Few can play Classical music, and even fewer can write it.

Recording and distribution has changed things a bit.  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular (we do still use that but not exclusively), we can record the world's best Popular musicians and distribute that recording.  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction (see: Metal).

And Classical music has certainly leveraged catchiness to become popular (see: Mozart operas).  So the lines have always been a bit blurry and may have gotten blurrier recently.  But that's the basic distinction.",null,5,cdnlzvj,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,top_day,39
49ersFaithfulForLife,"Commercialized music is more about marketing an image and selling an identity than it is about the music itself. It's easier to take a good-looking singer, stylize them and build a brand around their face and name, than it is to do with the songwriters who may have a less marketable image. In some cases, especially in hip hop, the producer's name may be well-known and liked enough that they'll make a point to associate it with the album, but this is an exception to the rule.

For the most part, the music industry doesn't want you to be consciously aware of the fact that the majority of the music you hear isn't written by the performers, but by marketers in suits and ties applying a formula fine-tuned to maximize the likelihood they'll get your fifteen dollars for the album. That doesn't look as good. Yeah, most consumers know or have been told this is the case, but it's not something the consciously think about every time they listen to a song.

Although your question specifically asks about the different standard with classical composers and ""modern music,"" I'd like to correct you a bit.  You might be too young to remember the explosion of the singer/songwriter movement of the 1960s/70s.  Prior to then, almost all pop artists just sang/performed other people's songs.  As artists like Buddy Holly, to the Beatles came around...audiences discovered the unique profundity when an artist performed their own work.  Bob Dylan was the first major artist to really cross this bridge--a number of artists popularized his work (e.g. Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--Blowin' in the Wind, The Byrds--Mr Tambourine Man, Jimi Hendrix--All Along the Watchtower) but there was no mistaking how powerful an artist Dylan was once you heard him (with all this non-commercial idiosyncrasies) perform his own compositions.

maestro2005,"Okay so, nobody here is right.  Not even doovidooves with his 110 upvotes.  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording, and ""classical"" versus ""modern"" isn't the right way to break things down.

First, some terminology.  I'm going to refer to it as ""Classical"" versus ""Popular"".  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music (e.g. Gregorian chant), certain types of Renaissance music (motets, madrigals, etc.), the Baroque period, the Classical period, the Romantic period, and modern periods that we don't quite have the historical context to classify yet.  It continues to be written today.

Popular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created, which today involves the rock combo with guitars, basses, drum sets, keyboards, etc., but includes folk music all the way back.  It actually predates Classical.

Popular music has always been meant to be easily imitable.  In the days before recording, it was meant to be played/sung by amateur musicians in the home, or around the campfire, or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be.  It's simpler music, not that impressive in its composition, so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer.  And usually, there aren't that many performers, which makes it simpler still.

Classical music is not meant to be easily imitated.  The forms are longer and more complicated, and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master.  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits.  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor.  We marvel at the composer's ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece.  We still marvel at the performers, but we marvel more at the composer.  Many people can both write and play Popular music.  Few can play Classical music, and even fewer can write it.

Recording and distribution has changed things a bit.  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular (we do still use that but not exclusively), we can record the world's best Popular musicians and distribute that recording.  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction (see: Metal).

And Classical music has certainly leveraged catchiness to become popular (see: Mozart operas).  So the lines have always been a bit blurry and may have gotten blurrier recently.  But that's the basic distinction.",null,5,cdnlzvj,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,top_day,39
49ersFaithfulForLife,"Commercialized music is more about marketing an image and selling an identity than it is about the music itself. It's easier to take a good-looking singer, stylize them and build a brand around their face and name, than it is to do with the songwriters who may have a less marketable image. In some cases, especially in hip hop, the producer's name may be well-known and liked enough that they'll make a point to associate it with the album, but this is an exception to the rule.

For the most part, the music industry doesn't want you to be consciously aware of the fact that the majority of the music you hear isn't written by the performers, but by marketers in suits and ties applying a formula fine-tuned to maximize the likelihood they'll get your fifteen dollars for the album. That doesn't look as good. Yeah, most consumers know or have been told this is the case, but it's not something the consciously think about every time they listen to a song.

That isn't to say that all folk music is simple, as much of it, especially from other countries is extremely complex.  I also don't intend to imply that all classical music is complex, as a lot of it is compositionally lackluster as an average pop song today.

zerozed,"""Lots of modern music"" (as you phrase it) is fairly disposable pop with no gravitas.

Although your question specifically asks about the different standard with classical composers and ""modern music,"" I'd like to correct you a bit.  You might be too young to remember the explosion of the singer/songwriter movement of the 1960s/70s.  Prior to then, almost all pop artists just sang/performed other people's songs.  As artists like Buddy Holly, to the Beatles came around...audiences discovered the unique profundity when an artist performed their own work.  Bob Dylan was the first major artist to really cross this bridge--a number of artists popularized his work (e.g. Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--Blowin' in the Wind, The Byrds--Mr Tambourine Man, Jimi Hendrix--All Along the Watchtower) but there was no mistaking how powerful an artist Dylan was once you heard him (with all this non-commercial idiosyncrasies) perform his own compositions.

Finally--to more directly respond to your question regarding classical composers...the answer is simply that their compositions were uniquely their visions...transcribed precisely for artists to render without improvisation.  ",null,3,cdnfat3,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3

Kindergarten is generally 5 years old at the start of the school year, though some parents 'hold back' their kids til they're 6, for varied reasons.

Elementary school runs 5-12 years old (Kindergarted, grades 1-6, although some places grade 6 is middle school or junior high).

Grades 6 (or 7 depending on location) through 8 or 9 are junior high.

9 or 10 through 12th grade is senior high, with graduation and a diploma following completion of the 12th grade.

In our district, it's all one huge building (K-12), but we're in a very rural, very low population density area.  School draws students for about 30 miles every direction, and we barely have 60 kids per grade.

Granite_Maggie,"The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise. Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.

Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.

Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.",null,21,cdnb1pa,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,top_day,66

The side effects for me can range from an upset stomach, to full blown violent vomiting, diarrhea, migraines, muscle/joint aches, iron deficiency, brain fog, inflammation, you name it.

""Among the many potential environmental triggers for T1D, diet has been considered a significant contributing factor [7], [22]. Of the various dietary factors, gluten warrants special mention because epidemiological data suggest that early exposure of infants to cereals containing gluten may increase the risk of T1D.  Rodent studies have supported this claim [24]. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how dietary gluten could facilitate the development of T1D. In the current study, we explored whether alterations in the gut microflora could potentially explain the pro-diabetogenic properties of dietary gluten.""


Celiac is a life threatening response to gluten.  However there isn't much science investigating the responses that aren't as pressing.  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance, which is characterized by a host of symptoms including ""bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain. It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo, among many others."" (from the wiki for gluten sensitivity).  ""Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food."" (from the celiac wiki) The response to gluten obviously falls somewhere on a spectrum, while a lot of the symptoms and pathology of those with celiac and gluten intolerance are the same.

To address your question.. Why do people go on a gluten free diet?  Well, there is obviously a pile of evidence indicating that its consumption correlates with a host of negative health outcomes.  To which part of that pile any one person pays attention may vary, and they may only have heard that such research exists and not done any investigation personally.

Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.

Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.

Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.",null,21,cdnb1pa,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,top_day,66

""Among the many potential environmental triggers for T1D, diet has been considered a significant contributing factor [7], [22]. Of the various dietary factors, gluten warrants special mention because epidemiological data suggest that early exposure of infants to cereals containing gluten may increase the risk of T1D.  Rodent studies have supported this claim [24]. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how dietary gluten could facilitate the development of T1D. In the current study, we explored whether alterations in the gut microflora could potentially explain the pro-diabetogenic properties of dietary gluten.""


Celiac is a life threatening response to gluten.  However there isn't much science investigating the responses that aren't as pressing.  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance, which is characterized by a host of symptoms including ""bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain. It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo, among many others."" (from the wiki for gluten sensitivity).  ""Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food."" (from the celiac wiki) The response to gluten obviously falls somewhere on a spectrum, while a lot of the symptoms and pathology of those with celiac and gluten intolerance are the same.

To address your question.. Why do people go on a gluten free diet?  Well, there is obviously a pile of evidence indicating that its consumption correlates with a host of negative health outcomes.  To which part of that pile any one person pays attention may vary, and they may only have heard that such research exists and not done any investigation personally.

I didn't necessarily set out to not eat gluten exactly, instead the initial thought was to cut out carbohydrates from grains. I'd seen a few documentaries and did some research about how western society wrongly blames fat (animal fat specifically) for weight gain when grain products are to blame (eating ""low-fat"" diets starve your body of lipids which causes your body to hold onto its fat reserves).

I think it is more of a lifestyle change than a ""gluten is bad for err'body!"" kinda thing. It works for some (me) and doesn't for others.

I think this would make sense if people eat a plain gluten free diet, which is basically fruits, veggies, and meat.  That in itself is healthy.

A myriad of testing later, a colonoscopy revealed scalloping in her intestines and they did a biopsy and told her she was celiac. 6 months of gluten free later, she's the happy-go-lucky girl I knew to begin with.

Enchanted_Bunny,"Too many people think ""survival of the fittest"" means ""survival of the most physically fit"" or ""survival of the biggest, baddest, and meanest.""  In reality, being ""fit"" means that you are able to survive, that you ""fit"" into you environment. 

Human beings are far from the most physically powerful animals. A human living alone in the wild is putting himself at great risk and has a statistically lower chance of surviving. So, our evolutionary survival strategy is cooperation. One human in the wild might be weak, but 150 humans? The chances of survival drastically increase. Throughout history we have seen countless examples of the society that cooperates more out competing societies that focus on the individual. It's how the Romans were able to defeat the Gauls so easily. A single roman soldier couldn't hope to defeat a single Gaul warrior. But put two or more of those discipined Romans together, and something happens.  They become stronger than two individuals. They become a synergy: where the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Thus, the people who have a natural inclination to cooperate with each other are more likely to survive and pass those traits to their offspring. Now to your question. 

In order to survive and thrive, a stable home is needed. Our ancestors survived due to a stable home and family unit. The desire for a stable and lasting home was passed down to us. Nowadays it doesn't matter as much but for most of history having a permanent and stable home was crucial to your development.

Rain is water vapor in the form of a cloud condensing and becoming either a liquid (rain) or a solid (snow, ice that will melt on its way down and become rain). Water vapor prefers to have a surface to condense onto, such as dust or smoke or other water droplets.

You see a cloud full of water vapor coming on your radar, which these guys sell. You send up your plane. The plane releases smoke into the cloud a bit before it passes overhead and the water vapor in the clouds starts condensing and becoming rain.

The problem is that clouds are rather large and the silver iodide flares and the rest of the equipment is not cheap. It also requires patience, as it is of no use unless high-moisture clouds are passing overhead anyway - there have been accusations that it is only really useful on days when it was going to rain anyway, and often does nothing at all.

MistaSchlong,"Ok, so you know about digital devices.  Think about a binary switch: something that just turns on and off.  That's what a neuron does: it just turns on and off.  At the end of a neuron, there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too.  These signals are made of molecules, and we call these molecules neurotransmitters.  We won't need to talk about these neurotransmitters, but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them, they're really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn on.

OK, your brain is made of neurons.  (It's also made of other types of cells, but the most simple, straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail.)  ""Knowledge,"" is stored in these neurons.  Now, because a neuron can only, essentially, turn on and off, the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easier.

Making the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms.  You can make the neuron more ""sensitive"" to neurotransmitters.  (This can, for instance, happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor.)  Likewise, you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing ""sensitivity"" to neurotransmitters.

Note: you may have heard of the term Action Potential.  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns on.

Now, knowing that a neuron can turn on and off, and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off, I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar.  Chords are made up of notes, and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings.  Basically turning them on or keeping them off.

However, and this is the key, with just a few chords, you can play millions of different songs.  It's just about how the chords are played; the timing, the tempo, the coordination.

MistaSchlong,"Ok, so you know about digital devices.  Think about a binary switch: something that just turns on and off.  That's what a neuron does: it just turns on and off.  At the end of a neuron, there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too.  These signals are made of molecules, and we call these molecules neurotransmitters.  We won't need to talk about these neurotransmitters, but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them, they're really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn on.

OK, your brain is made of neurons.  (It's also made of other types of cells, but the most simple, straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail.)  ""Knowledge,"" is stored in these neurons.  Now, because a neuron can only, essentially, turn on and off, the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easier.

Making the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms.  You can make the neuron more ""sensitive"" to neurotransmitters.  (This can, for instance, happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor.)  Likewise, you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing ""sensitivity"" to neurotransmitters.

Note: you may have heard of the term Action Potential.  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns on.

Now, knowing that a neuron can turn on and off, and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off, I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar.  Chords are made up of notes, and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings.  Basically turning them on or keeping them off.

However, and this is the key, with just a few chords, you can play millions of different songs.  It's just about how the chords are played; the timing, the tempo, the coordination.  Similarly, the firing of neurons, on and off, in combination, generates recall of stored knowledge.

So all that happens before trial. Day one of trial starts an exhausting version of the standard jury selection.

Trial will probably run 1-2 weeks. If guilty, then the jury comes back and hears testimony about the mitigating an aggravating factors (this is where that investigators work becomes relevant). Then they will vote on life/death.

Defense counsel should invest a lot of time in looking for mitigating information prior to the case even going to trial because if convincing enough and if in the right place, the State may waive seeking the death penalty.

In some states the decision to impose death is then automatically reviewed by the State's supreme court for a proportionality review. They decide whether this person truly deserves the penalty in light of every other defendant that has received it.

During this time, appeals and post-conviction motions run wild.

Lizzipp,"Because if you want to kill someone, you've got to be *really really certain* they're guilty. An innocent person who was sentenced to life in prison could come out twenty years later when DNA evidence shows they were innocent, or the guilty party comes forward, or they could successfully appeal. That's not *ideal*, of course, but the point is it's not irreversible, where the death penalty is. If someone's been sentenced to death, you want to get all your appealing done *before* the sentence is carried out, and you have to delay it for as long as possible to ensure no one is going to come forward with new evidence that could potentially re-open the case, and also you *want* to delay it for as long as possible - you're going to demand every single appeal and retrial and whatever you can because at the end of all that you're going to die. You're going to be the biggest pain in the arse you possibly could.

Add to this the fact that the death penalty isn't legal in most countries, and in the ones that it is which are also a functioning democracy (the US) it's only legal in a handful of places. Say you commit your crime in Texas and flee to the UK, even if you're arrested in the UK you've got to be extradited back to Texas with is an extremely lengthy and therefore expensive process. The touchy nature of the subject is a real hindrance, since lots of countries believe the death penalty is immoral and may refuse to extradite someone if they believe they would face execution, in the same way they do for potential torture victims.

Also, ""life in prison"" is not always *life* in prison. Where I'm from, ""life in prison"" more often means 25-30 years although you can be sentenced to a ""whole life order"", which means there's no possibility of parole. It can easily take fifteen, twenty, thirty years on death row before the actual execution, maybe even more. So although the cost of an execution itself is pretty low, you're already adding that to what's essentially a life sentence, and that's before you take into account the cost of thirty year's worth of legal work.

Second, the public wants to believe that we only execute guilty people.  Third, the Supreme Court has said that only certain crimes and criminals are eligible for execution under the 8th Amendment, so there are additional legal issues in death cases that are not present in life-sentence cases.  The result is a very expensive legal process that usually goes on for years.  This is all aggravated by the fact that states often appoint lawyers who are inexperienced, underfunded, and in over their heads to represent capital defendants in their initial trials.  This leads to subsequent challenges that the trial was unfair due to inadequacy of counsel.

All these appeals and due process take time. Transcripts of proceedings need to be ordered and created. Briefs need to be researched and written. Oral arguments are heard. The courts' written decisions need to be researched and written. This results in these appeals taking years.

Lizzipp,"Because if you want to kill someone, you've got to be *really really certain* they're guilty. An innocent person who was sentenced to life in prison could come out twenty years later when DNA evidence shows they were innocent, or the guilty party comes forward, or they could successfully appeal. That's not *ideal*, of course, but the point is it's not irreversible, where the death penalty is. If someone's been sentenced to death, you want to get all your appealing done *before* the sentence is carried out, and you have to delay it for as long as possible to ensure no one is going to come forward with new evidence that could potentially re-open the case, and also you *want* to delay it for as long as possible - you're going to demand every single appeal and retrial and whatever you can because at the end of all that you're going to die. You're going to be the biggest pain in the arse you possibly could.

Add to this the fact that the death penalty isn't legal in most countries, and in the ones that it is which are also a functioning democracy (the US) it's only legal in a handful of places. Say you commit your crime in Texas and flee to the UK, even if you're arrested in the UK you've got to be extradited back to Texas with is an extremely lengthy and therefore expensive process. The touchy nature of the subject is a real hindrance, since lots of countries believe the death penalty is immoral and may refuse to extradite someone if they believe they would face execution, in the same way they do for potential torture victims.

Also, ""life in prison"" is not always *life* in prison. Where I'm from, ""life in prison"" more often means 25-30 years although you can be sentenced to a ""whole life order"", which means there's no possibility of parole. It can easily take fifteen, twenty, thirty years on death row before the actual execution, maybe even more. So although the cost of an execution itself is pretty low, you're already adding that to what's essentially a life sentence, and that's before you take into account the cost of thirty year's worth of legal work.

poppop_n_theattic,"The level of judicial process to execute someone is much higher than for a life sentence, for three main reasons.  First, you cannot take back an execution.  Second, the public wants to believe that we only execute guilty people.  Third, the Supreme Court has said that only certain crimes and criminals are eligible for execution under the 8th Amendment, so there are additional legal issues in death cases that are not present in life-sentence cases.  The result is a very expensive legal process that usually goes on for years.  This is all aggravated by the fact that states often appoint lawyers who are inexperienced, underfunded, and in over their heads to represent capital defendants in their initial trials.  This leads to subsequent challenges that the trial was unfair due to inadequacy of counsel.   

Source - I am a lawyer with a client on death row.  His trial was nearly 20 years ago, and I was first appointed to represent him more than 10 years ago.  Due process is time-consuming and expensive.    ",null,0,cdnknv4,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
apatheticviews,"Assume it costs $50k a year to keep someone in prison.  After 20 years, that is $1M.

Assume it costs $1M to hold a trial, including all associated fees.

So, to have a trial 1 time, and keep them in prison for 20 years is $2M.

If you have a Death Penalty case, they will automatically get an appeal ($2M), and will probably take at least 10 years before execution.  So your cost to house is less ($500k).  So you are looking at $2.5M as a starting figure vice the the initial $2M.

If the person were to serve 30 years instead, it would break even.  If there were a 3rd appeal (which is likely), there would be a net loss again).

The whole process requires an insane amount of man hours put in by the federal prosecutors where as if someone is sentenced to life in prison without parol their isnt as much work from the start on the prosecutors side.  
     Another factor in the cost being higher is that death sentence inmates cost more to house.  Most states require death row inmates to be housed alone instead of in a group cell.

MisterFiftyFifty,"The Cuban Missile Crisis began, basically, as a combined result of two things: the Cuban Revolution that had happened fairly recently (1959), and NATO missiles that were placed in Turkey. 

The Cuban Revolution overthrew a particularly brutal dictator, Fulgencio Batista, who was backed by the U.S. basically because he was anti-communist. Once this happened, the Soviet Union saw a great opportunity for an ally: a communist nation led by a widely popular and charismatic leader (Fidel Castro) on the front doorstep of your arch-nemesis.

The missiles in Turkey were widely believed to be pointed at the heart of Soviet Russia, as Turkey is in a strategically valuable spot for doing so with ICBMs. The Soviets needed a counterbalance to this, and they saw it in the form of Cuba. 

What went down in a nutshell is that the U.S. noticed these huge missiles 90 miles from their coast, and through diplomatic maneuvering (and a naval blockade of Cuba) by President Kennedy and his entourage, convinced the Soviets to back off and remove the missiles in exchange for the missiles in Turkey being removed (they were later replaced by nuclear submarines anyways). No one wanted a nuclear war, despite the large amount of dick measuring that went on in the Cold War.


I'm not exactly sure what you mean in how the Cuban Missile Crisis connected into Vietnam. Vietnam was a completely different situation, and *official* involvement did not start until 1964, two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis. While the latter was more of a direct threat to America itself, Vietnam was somewhat more of a political gamble to stop the spread of communism, as had been done in Korea (though only halfway). As far as I know, Fidel in Cuba had little interest in Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh was more concerned with reuniting his country, though I'm sure they would have rooted for each other.",null,0,cdnbvj8,1rhek9,explainlikeimfive,top_day,4

PKMKII,"Assuming you're just talking about the filming process itself, and not things like DVDs, advertisements, merchandise, there's three main stages to film production. Appropriately enough, they are called pre-production, production and post-production.

Pre-production is when they set things up so that the actual filming goes smoothly. This usually means things like storyboarding (rough drawings of how scenes are expected to look), getting an production office set up, and hiring crew for the film.

Production is when the film itself is being shot. This is both scenes shot on location, and on sets.

Post-production is the last stage. This is when things like the films background music gets added and mixed, some lines that weren't clear in the filming get re-recorded (and sometimes added entirely with off-screen characters, or characters whose mouths aren't visible at the time). This is also when things like special effects and computer graphics get added. There's also more simple stuff, like editing the film.",null,0,cdn9hw4,1rh9u2,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1
jayman419,"There's a lot of variation in how a movie gets made. Here's one general example of how it could happen.

For starters, Spielberg doesn't always write his own stuff. So the first thing he does is look for inspiration. Then he gets together with a writer to come up with a treatment. He takes the treatment to the studios and tries to sell it.

Assuming the studios want it, they'll ""greenlight"" it ... that is, draw up contracts, assign a budget, and agree on certain dates (like start of production, completion of principle photography, target release date, ect). They'll usually have ""notes"" or suggestions, like asking him to work with a particular writer or using the film as a vehicle for a star they have under a multi-film contract.

Once the contracts are signed, pre-production starts. This is where the script gets hashed out completely. At the same time, people are sent out to scout locations. Sometimes they plan of filming on location, other times they just take pictures to build the sets somewhere else. They start working on wardrobe concepts and set dressings and all that jazz.

Once the script is pretty close to finished, Spielberg give his shortlist for actors to the casting agent, and they see if any are available. If not, they move down the list and/or hold open casting sessions. Meanwhile, he starts storyboarding the script and comparing it to the location info that his team gathered up.

Once the actors are set, they agree on a date to start working, and then begin actually building all the sets and securing the rights to film in the locations they've chosen. They also hire a studio to start early work on special effects, like the big space battle and the alien ships or whatever.

They will bring the actors in for costume fittings, promotional shots, and script readings. They might walk through the sets and talk about the scenes that will go on there, and spend a little time getting to know areas that they're supposed to be familiar with.

The big day comes. They have the sets looking just the way they want, the actors are in their trailers, the script is good and the actors are satisfied, craft services have snacks out for everyone, the lighting department has everything perfect, the camera crew are set, it's the start of principle photography.

This is the easy part. You have a list of shots that need to be completed. They're usually organized for convenience, rather than the order they'll appear on the screen. Like if you have three scenes in a particular house that all take place at different times in the movie, they'll all be filmed in the same general time-frame, with wardrobe and lighting and set changes as necessary.

There's also a second and sometimes a third team of actors and directors working on things like tracking shots (where you can't see the actors close enough to notice it's really their stunt double) and insert shots (like a close-up of Batman grabbing something off his utility belt) where it doesn't really matter whose hand it is.

Once all the shots are ""in the can"" they move on to editing all the footage together into a film. The actors are free to go work on other projects. Now Spielberg is in a little room with his editor, a screen, and a tool for cutting and splicing film. They look for the best takes, and the best lengths for each scene. It's usually around this time that scoring and special effects work begins. (Some bigger FX-heavy movies, they send the scenes for special effects as soon as they have the actor's parts shot, instead of dumping the whole film on them at once.)


So he has FX shots coming in on a regular basis, he has the composer coming in to look at scenes and get a feel for things, and then returning with music, which he adds to the scenes. If necessary, he'll bring the actors back to shoot new scenes or record new dialogue. Maybe the wind was muffling the mic, maybe he decided he needs a scene where someone else builds a mashed potato mountain, stuff like that.

Once he has the cut he likes, he shows it to the studio. The contract will determine who has the final say in the film's edit. Spielberg has a lot of clout, so he generally will get his own way. Some films go to test at this point, where they bring in an audience and gauge their reaction. This might result in new edits or other changes, and it can also take them back to reshooting scenes again if necessary.

Once the studio, the audience, the director, the producer, the editor, the composer, and everyone else is happy, they create a master print of the finished product. This is usually the version of the film that gets screened at festivals and such. 

Around this time is when director and actor commentary gets recorded, usually at some festival or other promotional event.

Then the studio takes the master and uses it to print the copies that get sent out to theaters. This is generally about the time TV advertising starts. The promo shots were probably already released, but they'll use some of those to make posters and print ads and whatnot. 

The studio has a deal with theater chains, where they get a certain cut of ticket sales (on a sliding scale, the more recent the film, the higher the cut the studio takes). They send out the films, the people pour in, they buy lots of popcorn and snacks that the theaters actually use to stay in business, and the reviews start.

Meanwhile they use a copy of the master to get the DVD/Bluray production going. They slap in the commentary and other special features and schedule a release date.",null,0,cdn9iwx,1rh9u2,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

C47man,"The reason we have airspeed and groundspeed is because they serve different purposes. For an airplane to gain lift (fly) it has to move through the air at a certain speed so that the wings will work. To make sure we are at that speed and not coming close to falling below it, we measure airspeed. This is how fast the plane is moving through the air. If air never moved anywhere and stayed in the same place all the time, then airspeed and groundspeed would be the same thing. However, air also moves! We all know that. We call it wind! The airplane is a part of the air mass in the same way that a fish is a part of the water mass. A fish can swim through the water at a certain speed *relative to the water*, but if that water is itself moving with respect to the earth, then fish's speed with respect to the earth is *also* changed the same amount. So if our airplane (a sky-fish!) in the air is flying north at 50mph through the air, and the air itself is moving 10mph *south* relative to the earth, then we have two speeds happening to our aircraft. We are going north at 50mph through air, but only 40mph over the ground, because the air itself is pulling us back as we move forward!

Groundspeed allows us to calculate how long it will take us to arrive at a given destination, and is particularly important so we can make calculations for fuel consumption. Our airspeed is important because the plane will behave differently in the air depending on its speed. Too fast and we could stress or damage the airframe. Too slow and we risk losing lift and ""stalling"", which is basically falling out of the sky (don't worry, we can recover from those easily!).",null,1,cdn8ayt,1rh898,explainlikeimfive,top_day,9

justthisoncenomore,"There are two reasons why moving things ""with your mind"" without assistance, some kind of augmentation, or a physical connection is ""impossible"".

1.) There is no mechanism.  In order for something to move, some kind of force has to act on it.  Visualizing something moving doesn't itself create a force, and there's no known way, other than moving your arms/legs/robotic prosthesis, or ordering someone to move theirs, to jump that gap.  

2.) It takes energy.  Even if you had a mechanism, unless you're violating the conservation of energy, you'd need to somehow transfer energy to the object to be moved/manipulated. This might seem trivial if it's just moving a pencil, but if you want to be able to lift a 200 lbs person, or a 10,000 lbs boulder, you'd need to expend at least the number of calories that would be required to move it through normal action.

1) The military has recently withdrawn en masse out of two different wars. In the past often a military would simply leave behind the arms and make news ones because its cheaper than shipping them back, refurbishing them, and re-equipping their force with old weapons. However, US has gotten in trouble over the last few decades arming local forces with hand-me-downs. Also, equipment now is so sophisticated handing it over to a locally implemented tribal police force with little knowledge of technology and zero skills in supply-chain to maintain it would be useless. But they still try. This doc explains that situation pretty good as it unfolds in Afghanistan.

pythonpoole,"Cell phone plans can either be on-contract or off-contract (also known as 'pay as you go', 'month to month', etc.).

With an on-contract plan: you must agree to sign-up for the plan for a specified length period of time (e.g. 2 years). If you try to cancel the plan early, you may be charged a very large penalty fee for terminating the contract and/or may be required to give the phone back. With on-contract plans, the phone cost is subsidized by the plan cost (so you get the phone for much cheaper [sometimes even free], but you pay a higher monthly bill and must agree to a term contract).

With an off-contract plan: you typically own the phone, you pay on a monthly basis and can cancel at any time without penalty. Since you typically have to buy the phone outright if you choose an off-contract plan, it means you will have to pay much more for the phone (many smart phones cost over $500!).

The next distinction is between Voice and Data plans. The voice plan is what allows you to make calls and send text messages. The data plan is what allows you to access websites, email, and use Internet-based apps on your phone. If you have a smartphone without a data plan, you will not be able to use even basic apps for your phone because any app that gets data from the Internet (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) will be non-functional. So basically you need both a Voice Plan and a Data Plan. 

Most mobile phone companies offer combined/hybrid plans that come with both voice and data, but some companies make a clearer distinction between the two by making you choose a voice plan and then picking how much data you want added to the voice plan. Some companies also offer shared plans where you and family or friends can share the same data plan (for example) but maintain separate voice plans.

Note that data plans are measured by how many megabytes (or gigabytes) of network/Internet data you can transfer over the cellular network per month. If you exceed that amount, you will be cut-off or charged enormous overage fees (so be sure to choose a data plan that fits with how much Internet usage you require). Note that data transferred over Wi-Fi does not count towards your monthly data limit, so you can use as much Wi-Fi service at home (or at schools/businesses that offer Wi-Fi) as you want without incurring overage fees.

Yes, Canadian cell phone bills are much more expensive than those of other countries (e.g. European countries) for a few reasons. One reason is lack of serious competition in the marketplace, but another major reason is that the telephone system works differently in North America as compared to the rest of the world. Specifically, in North America, it's up to the cell phone account holder to pay for incoming calls whereas in other countries it is up to the calling party to pay (a premium rate) for calls to cell phones. So basically the cost of North American cell phone plans in general is more than other countries because they have to include the additional cost of incoming air-time.

Also, Canada (or maybe just BC) have made it illegal to charge cancellation fees! It used to cost $400+ to cancel early, but now most companies use a Tab or incorporate your phone costs into the ill (if its on a 2yr term) for example...a phone valued at $240, over 24 months...they will subtract $10/month off what you owe one the phone, so if you cancel early you just pay what is remaining on your phone balance.
Regarding what someone else mentioned about voice and data...it could be that you CAN use data without having it n your plan, but don't be surprised if you get a bill for $200. If you chose not include data, your cell phone should have an option to turn data off (this means you can use wifi, but any 3G connections won't work)",null,0,cdn7yy4,1rh3pp,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

romnempire,"Ukraine has been in talks to join the EU for several years.  Many Ukranians see entry into the EU as a step forward in economy, job creation, mobility, development, etc.  This is because several postsoviet states, including the baltic states and Poland, have experienced growth and prosperity over the past couple decades because of the EU.  Things like increased foreign investment to develop infrastructure and create jobs and better chances for emigration would directly affect the standard of living for the individual.

Ukraine is a major postsoviet state.  It is contiguous with russia.  Russia is attempting to create a regional organization cum economic bloc comparative with the EU to compete with it and increase its influence.  However, being part of this is not well thought of in Ukraine, well, in most postsoviet states because Russians, who dominated the soviet governments, badly mismanaged nationalisms and resource distribution under the soviet system.  For non-russians, the soviet system was, in a simplified analogy, simply a new imperialism.  As well, Western Europe has more capital for investment and more opportunities to offer.

If Russia cannot convince the Ukraine to join its regional organization, it basically means the organization will be geographically fragmented and, well, not very sensible.  Russian politicians have put political pressure on the Ukraine to join their bloc rather than the EU by threatening to renegotiate their gas sales, which the Ukrainian energy infrastructure is dependent upon.

As well, the current Ukrainian leadership, under Yanukovich, is viewed circumspectly by a number of indivduals, because he has jailed the former PM, Tymonshenko, (actually, over supposedly shady energy dealings with russia) as well because he seems to be more culturally and politically tied to the Russo-Ukranian linguistic/ethnic community and to Russia itself.

Pros - It's open source. People can change the code however they want. So you get a lot of different options in terms of how your desktop works. Previously, the built-in software store gave some versions of Linux an edge because it made it very easy to find/install software. But now that Mac and Windows have their own software stores, this isn't much of a difference. Also, since you can modify Linux however you want, it can be easier for programmers to get their software to work exactly how they want.. especially when it comes to low-level programming, like creating security-related tools.

Cons - A lot of the different versions of Linux aren't as user-friendly. Sometimes things don't work 'out of the box' quite as well as they would with Windows or Mac OS.

2. Inhibits *glutamate*, causing more of this sluggishness and ""slowdown"" effect.
3. Increases the amount of *dopamine* in the brain's reward center, which makes you feel generally good and happy.
4. *Dopamine* also increases confidence and sociability.

Marijuana:

*THC* (the primary active chemical in marijuana) fits directly into ""slots"" in your brain called *cannabinoid receptors* in a number of places. The different effects of marijuana are caused by THC flooding into different parts of the brain, including:

1. The ""reward center"", making you feel good and happy

1. You call the tip line and speak with an operator, usually a police officer or an employee of the RCMP, and leave a tip.

2. At the end of the call you are given a tip number that identifies your tip to the case. You do not give your name or any other info. 

3. You are told to call at intervals giving your tip number to find out about the progress of the case. Your case may just die out and nothing becomes of it. The investigating officer may talk with you. 

4. If your tip leads to an arrest you give your tip number when calling and they will arrange to meet and exchange the cash reward. The meeting is in a public place like a mall or Tim Hortons and a non-uninformed officer gives you the reward.

romnempire,"One of the major sentences in the british court system during the colonial period was transportation.  If you were really bad, you'd be forced to fuck off to america or later australia.  Australia has a lot less resources, so it was more of a punishment, and less people went there voluntarily to make a living.  Some did, however.  Britain wanted to get in on Australia, well, probably just because it was near the Dutch Indies, major spice exporters, an incredibly important piece of the economy of the era.

The natives were never a particularly significant political or military force.  Colonists never really had a protracted war for territory against them, like in the Americas or say India.  Many died from disease, and, because they weren't very powerful, colonists had little respect for their sovereignty.  Like indians in the US, they played a fairly small role in the formation of an Australian state.  

After world war 2, britain was absolutely bankrupt, and it became popular to decry colonialism as a morally corrupt system, so there was little reason or capital to keep administering Australia as a colony.  At that point Australians wanted to fend for themselves, and so they did.  And since a population with a landmass and a self government is usually imagined into a state, Australians came up with their own stories of how they were 'Australian' rather than British because i guess that's just what you do as a state these days.

buds4hugs,"32-bit processors can process 32-bits of data at one time, while 64-bit processors can process 64-bits at a time. Imagine a 32 lane highway versus a 64 lane highway where each car is lined up in every column, and spaced out evenly in every lane, going the same speed. On the 32 lane highway, only 32 cars could cross a single point at a time.

A difference in speeds between one 32-bit CPU and another can come down to how fast they run. Given the example, this would be how fast the cars are driving. If the highway was 60 mph, the volume of cars crossing the line per second would be less than that of an 80 mph highway.

128-bit CPU's exist, but there is no realistic need for it in today's applications.",null,0,cdn4pyy,1rgw82,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3
HungLikeAVillain,"They move 64 bits of data at a time, instead of 32 bits, and generally have 64 bit addressing, too, making them capable of (more easily) accessing more than 4GB of RAM, without some kind of paging scheme.

There are many kinds of CPU.  Hopefully a better understanding of what makes them 'tick' (literally) will help.

We also see wider, faster buses, where you might even be doing 256 bits of DMA (direct memory access) transfer at a time, such as from main RAM to a GPU's RAM, or to a CPU's internal cache.  Of course, these DMA operations tend to grab several values, consecutively, so you only have to 'ask' 1/4 as often for the the common case of needing several things, next to each other.  Of course, all of this super-parallelism has a cost.  Driving this communication takes power.  The noise these things make in the electromagnetic spectrum can be a big problem.  The longer the parallel traces on your board, the more they act like inductors, and capacitors under various conditions, and they start to interfere with each other at the high frequency 'clocks' that CPUs want.  So you see short traces, and short distances between CPU, RAM, etc.

A single-core 128 bit CPU would probably take up as much space on a chip as at least two, and possible up to three 64 bit cores, and lots of 32 bit cores, and consume a lot more power for every 'clock'.  It would also 'suck' for gaming, simulations, and multimedia, versus having more cores.  Making room for more CPU and GPU cores on the same chip is a better use of space, power and speed, for most consumer applications.

To add 64 bits with the ALU (arithmetic logic unit), a 32 bit CPU must do two add operations, the first being an 'add with carry'.  It also has to load that 64 bit value from RAM in two parts, instead of one, and store them in two parts.  However, the 32 bit CPU doesn't need as many conductors (and pins) to interface with the outside world, to do it.  Each of these operations can be thought of as a 'clock tick', or 'clock' of the CPU.

A 'clock' can be understood by what happens in 'microcode', within a CPU.  A CPU breaks every operation down into many simpler operations.  Each of these operations map to a 'bit' of microcode.  Like paper on an antique player piano can cause one or more keys to press at the same time, every row.

So one bit would set the address bus to a value, one bit would gate a value from the data bus (A 'bus' is a set of conductors, in parallel.  A 64 bit CPU might have a 256 bit data bus, and a 48 bit address bus, or other oddities like that.  An 8 bit data bus has eight conductors.  A serial one has two (data + ground), though many have more (e.g. 'clock', device detection, additional serial 'channels)) into register 8, identified by several bits, one bit tell the ALU to add values of register 8 to register 7, and post the result in register 0... lots and lots of bits.  Several of these operations can be done at once.  

Such as, assuming we have an instruction to ADD R8 to SP[0], and a simple CPU of old...

1. Load address register with SP, clear the write flag, gate data register to ALU 0, Gate R8 to ALU 1, increment microcode address

2. Wait state for RAM access, increment microcode address

3. ALU ADD (flags set as side effect), increment microcode address

4. Move ALU result to R0, increment microcode address

5. Fetch next CPU instruction (which breaks down into the data fetch, set the microcode address, etc.)

And so on, the one 'instruction' breaks down into many simpler instructions that are akin to throwing switches, that cause things to happen, according to a long, parallel string of bits from the microcode ROM.  

More bits wide means more stuff to 'switch', and more space, and more power, and more heat.  To do the same 'Add 3 to Y' operation that a 32 bit CPU would do, still needs all of the '64 bit' parts to be active and powered up, and moving around lots of 'leading zeroes'.

In many more devices, nowadays, you get a mix of high and low performance CPU cores.  Some that always need to be processing things quickly, but don't need to be doing complex things, can be simpler and therefore made to consume less power, since every bit of logic you have inside the CPU is eating some juice.  Double the bits, double the amount of logic up and down the CPU.  Practically every I/O device has its own, specialized CPU, with RAM and ROM of its own.  Even seemingly trivial things, like a USB gizmo, usually has some kind of simple embedded 'brain' to handle the communications and housekeeping.

It is unlikely we'll get consumer PC 128 bit CPUs soon (but never say never), since we've nowhere reached the limits of 64 bit processing (16 billion-billion bytes of addressing, and similarly crazy data ranges), and the current trend is more and more CPUs on a single die, to do more stuff at the same time.  Each doubling in register width nearly doubles the amount of logic needed to run the CPU (and space on the chip), which constrains the number of 'big register' CPUs you'll want.  There are CPUs with very wide ALU and FPU (floating point unit) registers, specially built to do 'bignum' math, to crunch those matrices so your polygons line up.

Now then, a floating point operation may need dozens of 'clocks' to do a simple multiply, but the extra time to load two 64 bit values into microcode is a couple of clocks, give or take how long the 'wait states' for RAM access are, whether it was in the cache, etc.  Something that can be done at the same time as other FPU operations, which are generally done independently of other microcode operations, just as an integer operation within the ALU may be.

But a modern GPU (graphics processing unit) is a kind of CPU, that usually has 'lots' of FPUs and dedicated matrix math (linear algebra) units, as well as lots of pixel units to do the peculiar mixing of visible light 'values' and darkness convincingly, and quickly.  So though it takes longer to do these operations, you need to keep feeding it lots of data to keep all of the parts of it busy.  Since everything is more close to 'purpose built' for these operations, the GPU does the operations way, way faster than the general purpose CPU.

Is it better to have one 128 bit core, or four 32 bit cores?  That depends on what you're doing.  Most consumer devices need to be doing several things at the same time.

HungLikeAVillain,"Another way to look at the 128 vs 64 bit thing is, to represent the size of the observable universe in millimeters would require about 100 bits of precision.  

If we take 93 billion light years (diameter of observable universe), and convert it to millimeters, and figure out how many bits that would be...

Log2(8.79829142 × 10^29 millimeters) = about 100 bits of precision for a mantissa.

So give that one bit of sign, one bit of sign for the exponent, and you have 26 bits left over to distribute for the exponent power... in case you need to express a location to 67 million times bigger than the universe, or way, way smaller than the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.

So if you work with atomic-precision cosmology, 128 bits would be pretty useful.

On a tablet, running 'Angry Birds'... not so much.

Though the 'standard' for 128 bit floats sets a much smaller exponent, and a 112 bit mantissa.  Because let's face it, sometimes you need sub-micron precision across merely many thousands of times the diameter of the observable universe.

WatermelonQueen,"TL;DR For the same reason your muscles hurt after you work out - they're tired, too! Anytime you do something for a long time, you'll eventually wear out. Reading and focusing take more work than people realize! 

When you're tired you have less energy to go around and you become more aware of how much energy it takes your eyes to see. It's easy to underestimate how sophisticated our vision can be. From scanning the words to this answer to adjusting for the distance of your computer screen and the light it emits, your eyes do a LOT of work that goes for the most part unnoticed. 

To rest your eyes, close them gently and cover them with the palms of your hands, cupped to cover them without squishing but still giving them a break in the darkness. Also, it is easier for eyes to diverge (look far away) than converge (look closely), so when doing a lot of reading take frequent breaks to look out the window or across the room. Deep breathing to relax is also helpful, as sometimes we tense up when concentrating and don't realize it. 

 I know this will fall of deaf ears (I'm breaking this rule right now), but reading your tablet in bed for hours at a time is really bad for you!

SqueakyGate,"Two common misconceptions about the [K-Pg extinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event) event 65 million years ago:

1. That dinosaurs were the only group of animals who experienced extinction. Lots of crocodiles, fish, marine reptiles ([pleisiosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosauria)), flying reptiles ([pterosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur)), molluscs, mammals, plants etc. all went extinct and suffered losses. Groups which were hit less hard were typically lower on the food chain, generalists in terms of diet and lived in safe habitats (underground, in swamps). However, there were very few groups that experienced complete extinction. For example, crocodiles, lizards, snakes and turtles evolved prior to 65 million years ago and some of their ancestors made it through which is why we have living representatives today.

2. All dinosaurs went extinct, not true some survived and radiated into the many species of birds we have today. The living birds which are dinosaurs trace their ancestry back to a group of theropod dinosaurs. Birds, with feathers and flight and all the other ""birdy"" traits evolved well before 65 million years ago. 

Final note, dinosaurs are reptiles. [Reptiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile) comprise a large and diverse group of species both living and extinct. The living groups include: crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles and birds (dinosaurs). There are many extinct groups, some of which went extinct 65 million years ago - others went extinct much earlier than that. [Dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archosauromorpha) are more closely related to each other than they are to [snakes, lizards and tuatara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidosauria).",null,0,cdn8kb6,1rgt8b,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

sir_sri,"&gt; I've read that you need to do a SEO and make back ends? 

What *YOU* need is to find a company in your area that does SEO, and pay them to do it for you.

So a couple of things to keep in mind:  any time SEO actually works it means the search algorithm is defective.  So you're gaming the system only until someone fixes the algorithm.  That said, you gotta do what you gotta do, and Google specifically makes a defect in its search algorithm - called adwords, and they're happy to sell you access.

The SEO company is going to do a few things, they're going to follow a guide like this one (not mine)

http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/05/12/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-google-adwords/

and they're going to buy a bunch of adwords for your business with your money.  Basically this is a competitive bidding process, if you're competitors are doing the same thing you're going to be stuck in a bidding war.  Sorry to say.  There are a few minor things that need to happen here too, your website will need to be properly configured to be easily searchable by google and have the right keywords in it.  

The second thing that's going to happen, and this is really what you need a SEO for, is you're going to start getting reviews of your business, you're going to need mentions in blogs etc.  Fairly basically this is the bread and butter of SEO.  Making shit up.  How many yelp reviews does your business have?  Whatever it is, multiply it by 10.  Lots of people had 4-5 star experiences at your business.  It doesn't matter if you sell coffee that smells like sewage, dozens or hundreds of people love it.  

The next thing that needs to happen is that you're going to do advertising beyond just 'google'.  Probably this is obvious enough, but if such things exist you're going to want to have your site featured on 'meta' sites.  Things like a local business association - you're now a member and you have your webpage linked.  You have a facebook page, a twitter page an instagram page etc. that are all full of keywords and that point to your main website.  The more legitimate places host ads for your site, the more google will see things pointing at your site the higher you will rank.  

The reason I recommend finding a local company is that it's important to have someone you can meet face to face with, that knows the local geography, terminology and your competitors.  If people in your area do searches based on neighbourhood names or street names or something else you need to know that, and a local outfit is more likely to be better at that than some random company in another state/province/country that doesn't know anything about your area or your business.

SEO is the title of someone who is capable of making your website appear (if it and your services are good enough) in the first page of Googles search results. It means Search Engine Optimization and while these forms of making google work for you are changing, most SEO's are up to date on how everything works and can make the ""interwebs"" a safer, nicer, easier place for you to work.

Currently, there is nothing that can't air on broadcast television. The networks are expected to check themselves and if they go too far from what a common person would find offensive, the network may lose advertisers or face FCC fines. The networks push the limits when they feel it is safe to do so. For example, the TV show Friends had been wanting to say ""vagina"" in the show, but the network censors, for the first few years didn't allow it. After a few years and many scripts trying to slip the word in, the censors decided to allow the word. I can't remember what the title of the episode was, but the scriptwriters tried to get the word ""vagina"" into every scene. 

Another example is 2003, Young and the Restless. There was a scene filmed in which a male actor showed full backside nudity. CBS censors were ok with the scene, but before it aired, Janet Jackson bared a breast at the Superbowl.

The line between politicking and doing ones job as an elected official is not trivial to draw.  The US has rules about what can and cannot be paid for, but ultimately if a politician flies to the other side of the country, gives a speech and talks to a bunch of legislators and then has a dinner where everyone at the dinner just happened to spend 1000 dollars a plate to be in the same room how much of the travel costs etc belong to whom?

For the president, security is basically with him whatever he's up to.  There's no way around it, and there's no reasonable way to expect him to pay for those sorts of costs.

sir_sri,"&gt;Are they just not even trying to pay their taxes?

Well sometimes that's the case. 

The thing is, as others have pointed out, being rich is actually quite complicated.  Most rich people build up to the process, you own a local store, then you own 2 stores, then 5, then 50, then 500.  Or you invest in one place, then 10 then 100 or whatever.  Or you just own one business and that's it for your career.  

Athletes, celebrities and lottery winners all have a problem, athletes particularly because you are at a young age with no experience with money handed a fortune.  You don't know what to do with it and you don't even know who to ask.  So you try and hire accountants and lawyers and the problem is you don't have the skills to know the good ones from the bad.  Most americans can't do their taxes coming out of highschool for a 30k a year job, when it's 3 million earned in lots of places with all sorts of complexity you basically hire an accountant, follow their advice and hope you don't fuck it up.  Assuming you know enough to even do that. 

Wesley Snipes got himself an advisor who didn't believe income tax was legal - which as you can imagine the IRS does not agree with.  So Snipes was in a world of trouble.  

Now in the case of athletes they are in the worst of it, because your career doesn't usually gradually slide into oblivion, you make 10 million dollars one year, and 0 the next, or you get injured part way through, cannot play anymore, and suddenly your lifestyle that expected making  X million dollars before you retire at age 30 now has you trying to make do with 15% of X.  Or 2% of X or whatever.  And you're boned.  

Actors can just keep working, even if you get less money you at least can make something by doing more movies and commercials and you can make bad movies or take your clothes off, do stage work etc.  

Lottery winners and athletes though, they have no idea what to do.  The guy at H&amp;R block you pay 40 bucks to do your taxes isn't going to talk to you if you have millions in income.  So you need advisors and you have very poor prospects for long term income.  

Add to that divorces, failed business ventures, theft by crooked advisors and well, you get the idea.  When you have a lot of money and you get a pet project (think 38 studios) that you hope will keep you going for years and it fails suddenly you can't pay your bills and part of that ends up being taxes.

Snafu_Coaxer_2013,"A lot of these answers ignore the fact that that profit rarely translates into the ability to takeover other companies if you're a listed, public company. Spyker, for example, bought Saab (briefly), despite Spyker being a tiny company.

The reasoning is completely economic. If your cars are cheaper and you sell more, you're going to have bigger facilities and spend more on things like research. Lamborghini (if they were independent) aren't going to have the scale to effectively invest in R&amp;D without outsourcing it. But R&amp;D can be pretty much equally used by all car marques (i.e. it would be more efficient for Volkswagen and Lamborghini to share research as their research needs aren't all that different).

So a company with a lot of facilities like Volkswagen or BMW is going to be able to make better, cheaper cars than a company like Lamborghini. But that's not why people buy Lamborghini's, they buy them for the name and values of the brand: they buy them because they want a sports car with the character of a Lamborghini. So if Volkswagen made a car to compete with Lamborghini, it might be faster and more efficient and cheaper, but it likely won't make much of a dent in Lamborghini's sales. If Lamborghini makes a good car, it will probably cut in to Ferrari's sales, however.

So from that, logically, If Volkswagen bought Lamborghini, Lamborghini would better compete with Ferrari, and Volkswagen itself wouldn't lose any sales because their brand doesn't compete in the same markets as Lamborghini.

So, you get worse doctors, more bureaucracy, and generally lower standard of health care for those who were enjoying the best health care.

From [here](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/04/120604fa_fact_burgess). 

As I interpreted it, it's a book about free will and crime. Is it still good to get rid of crime if you also get rid of free will? Should people be free to make the wrong decisions? (In the book, 'bad decisions' taken to the extreme). Is it ok to force your morals on others? For example, when the scientists were watching the effects of Alex's conditioning, some of them looked at the lady with lust while he grovelled at her feet.

OpenFlameRecon,"Unions are a collection or group of workers within a specific industry or business, who all share a common goal, which is to aid themselves. Most were created and aided under FDR to help with recovery.
 
Some pros include the power to protect rights of workers, ie, to prevent an abusive boss from hiring only specific groups of people or from firing specific people based on unreasonable claims.

However, unions can allow easier access to striking, which can massively damage a business, because the union wants to gain some sort of benefit to its members. In a school union (I can speak from personal experience), it can lead to teachers refusing to write recommendations, refusing to help students, come in early and stay late, etc., if the school boards are not cooperative.

thatssoright,"Unions in the United States came about as a response to some particularly harsh working conditions that workers were subjected to back in the late 1800's-early 1900's when the industrial revolution was getting into full swing. Mostly manufacturing and labor intensive jobs. Workers were treated as interchangeable. In some cases they were paid in  Company Money that could only be used in company stores. Essentially, you belonged to the company. Labor Unions began as a natural response. The individual may be interchangeable, but the workforce as a whole is not. This led to some very bloody confrontations before the US government eventually stepped in and the existence of a labor unions and protections were added. Other countries have their own similar stories with somewhat equivalent time-frames.

The pros of having a union - In theory, all workers are treated equally and fairly. The company makes an agreement with the employees and the union is supposed to safeguard that agreement. Things like working hours, overtime, work conditions, training, disciplinary measures, layoffs and terminations are all usually spelled out in a legally binding contract. In some of the skilled trade professions (Electrical, Plumbing, etc) being Union Certified used to mean you were current on your training, and generally knew what you are doing.

The Cons - Everyone is treated and viewed exactly the same, regardless of how hard or well they work. The pay scale is the same for everyone in the same job title as you and the only way to earn more money is to work whatever overtime is offered. EVERYTHING is based on seniority. If there is training available but not everyone can attend at once, better hope you have high enough seniority. Volunteers for overtime? Better hope you have been there long enough. Layoffs? Better hope you aren't one of the low guys on the totem pole. Job opens up in another department? Not yours if the the guy who sleeps half the day and can barely do his job puts in for it and has even one day more seniority than you.


I am a bit biased against unions. I worked in one for 3 years and then worked along side that same union for the next 12. From what I could tell, they do nothing but push mediocrity. I regularly heard union stewards tell people to stop working so hard because it made others look bad. When companies started outsourcing, the response was to show the company just how good an idea that was by organizing work stoppages on a regular basis. Most unions have become just as bad as the big businesses they rally against. They protect their own interests and not the interests of their members.

Having said that, I am mildly surprised (and I think it speaks to the mindset of most unions) that non-government union membership hasn't started to go up in the last 5 years with how large corporations have been treating the employee base. ",null,0,cdn7qun,1rgngc,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

eideid,"First off, your definition of species is a lie which continues to be repeated, particularly by high-school science teachers. There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. Most organisms aren't sexual and even then, there are countless examples of organisms which can and sometimes even do interbreed with fertile offspring, but their populations are generally separate enough that we treat them as separate species (for an example, look at polar bears and northern grizzly bears).

In paleontology, the general rule is, ""Is there another thing out there which has been discovered which would be difficult to distinguish from this thing that I just discovered?"". If we were to find modern dogs in the ancient archaeological record, we would think they were all separate species, but we currently think of them as all members of a single species. There have been fairly recent reports of skull analyses which might call into question how many early hominid species there really were.

DoggoneCat,"While I agree with eideid's comments, I'm going to take a little different approach, starting first with extant species. Where eideid says, 
&gt; ""There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. ""

I would say that there are several acceptable definitions of species, and all are rather context dependent. If two species are asexual but closely related, how do we determine if they are species or subspecies (races or breeds in some contexts, but not others)? What about two groups of organisms that appear nearly identical but are separated (say on different continents)? They can't (naturally) interbreed. There are literally dozens of scenarios we could suggest to snag someone stuck on a simple definition. So, we use morphology, behavior, and increasingly, genetics, to test hypotheses about the relationships between extant species. I don't know that I'd call the decision-makers, ""high prestige scientific committees"". A single author, publishing a convincing set of evidence may decide to split a previously single species into 2 or more. If her argument is sound, and the data support it, ""consensus"" in the scientific community may simply be that other authors cite the work and accept the argument. Some taxa have a richer history of committee decision however. Birds have long had a devoted following, and there are numerous large and prestigious organizations which have committees that review the literature on taxonomy and vote on what the official relationship will be. So each year, the American Ornithologists Union publishes an update to their official checklist based on the decisions of the committee. 

When we consider extinct species we have much less data to go on, both quantitatively (the number of fossilized examples of a putative species) and qualitatively (the different types of evidence). There are no behavior observations, though we might make some inferences. There may be no usable genetic material. There are rarely skin, or feathers... anything to compare looks. We might only be left with a partial skeleton. At that point, paleontologists measure, and compare, and hunt for more fossils and do the best they can to make informed decisions. Often, someone coming along 10-100 years later, having much more data at hand, will revise those initial findings to a greater or lesser degree. It is messy, and somewhat subjective, but the idea is to apply any and all new, relevant information and to try and let the data suggest the most parsimonious answer - that is, the simplest answer is generally the most likely unless you have data to the contrary.

In ordinary operation, its contracting chambers squeeze the blood out and force it through the circulatory system. All is well.

Treatment for witnessed, large volume air embolus is immediate positioning of the patient left side down with legs up which may prevent the air from movement into the RV/pulmonary artery. Since it's often caused by air entering a central venous catheter you can try sucking it back out by advancing the catheter and withdrawing blood/air with a syringe.

&gt;Small bubbles can block capillaries in vital organs, most urgently the brain, causing anything from pain and inflammation to neurological damage and paralysis. A small bubble impedes blood flow the same way a solid obstruction would — the bubble's surface tension relative to its size is too great for the force of blood to break it up or shove it along. Bad? Yes. Fatal? Probably not, although see below.

&gt;A big bubble, on the other hand, gets us into the vapor lock scenario. Your heart, like the fuel pump in an old car (cars with modern fuel injection work differently), is a simple mechanical device. In ordinary operation, its contracting chambers squeeze the blood out and force it through the circulatory system. All is well. Now imagine a massive air embolus shows up and your heart starts squeezing on that. There's nothing to get any purchase on; the air just compresses.

Larger amounts (about 60cc) can cause ""airlock"" in the heart -- causes the pump to lose its prime and thus lead to cardiac arrest.

Treatment for witnessed, large volume air embolus is immediate positioning of the patient left side down with legs up which may prevent the air from movement into the RV/pulmonary artery. Since it's often caused by air entering a central venous catheter you can try sucking it back out by advancing the catheter and withdrawing blood/air with a syringe.

Occasionally aggressive CPR can ""shove"" it out of the heart and get things going again if it has caused cardiac arrest.

SqueakyGate,"* Gluten should only be avoided if you are diagnosed with celiac disease. In the same way nuts should be avoided if you are allergic to them. 

* Anyone who claims that gluten is not part of a human's natural ""diet"" has a lot to learn about human food systems. Basically everything we eat, be it plant or animal, has been domesticated and artificially selected for over the past 12,000 years, this includes grains and rice. Peppers, almonds, olives, corn, wheat, rye, quinoa, rice, oranges, lemons, pineapples, bananas, broccoli, potatoes...everything is domesticated, selected and altered from their wild counterparts. Seriously most people would not even recognize wild plant foods for what they are. 

* One thing to watch out for: gluten-free foods tend to also be highly processed, and thus may not be better for you - high in sugar, sodium or whatever else - always read the label. 

* Humans are omnivores and as omnivores we can eat a very varied diet. There is no one single ""best"" or ""right"" diet for humans. This is good news for us because we can tailor our diets to meet our individual needs like allergies, intolerances, personal morals or beliefs, local customs and traditions etc. However, there is often a certain level of ""use it or lose it"". If you start cutting out certain foods (like dairy or gluten) you may never be able to go back to eating them. For example; [lactase persistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence) is the continued activity of the enzyme lactase in adulthood. Since lactase's only function is the digestion of lactose in milk, in most mammal species the activity of the enzyme is dramatically reduced after weaning. However in some human populations lactase persistence has recently evolved (~10,000 years ago) as an adaptation to the consumption of non-human milk and dairy products beyond infancy. The majority of people around the world remain lactase non-persistent, and consequently are affected by varying degrees of lactose intolerance as adults. The important part here is that the continued activity of the enzyme is also partly dependant on the body being exposed to lactose in adulthood. Thus a person may have the genetic predisposition to consuming milk into adulthood, but without any lactose products they will become lactose intolerant anyway.

* Micheal Pollan has some great books but his best quote is: ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". By ""food"" he means things that only your great-grandmother would recognize as food.

matingslinkys,"One of the issues with anti-depressants is the order in which they can treat the symptoms of depression. Depression comes with a whole grab bag of symptoms, and they are all linked but separate in a complicated mess that is different for each person, and can respond differently to medication in each person.

Often one of the most significant things that can affect a person with depression is a lack of motivation, an overwhelming lethargy that leaves them unable to perform sometimes even the most basic of tasks. This is the reason that the advice ""just snap out of it, get up and do something"" is so useless to folks with depression. The illness cruelly takes that option away, by filling a person with leaden thoughts and an inability to even contemplate taking the next few steps in their recovery. I have worked with people who have sat soiled on a sofa until someone physically moved them to the bathroom to clean up, people who have not eaten in days being unable to summon up the energy to see the point in getting something to eat. 

This lethargy and lack of motivation is linked, but separate to any suicidal ideation. People may have suicidal thoughts, or they may not, or they may develop suicidal thoughts only when in the very depths of a depression, when the lethargy has already kicked in. Sometimes a person may entertain the idea of killing themselves, but be unable to summon up the energy to put together a plan to do so (after all, many suicide methods require some sort of supplies, which means getting dressed, leaving the house, and interacting with people to purchase things, or may require the effort of driving to somewhere or other such activities. Sometimes even just the effort of making a decision and coming up with a plan to kill yourself is just too much to overcome).  

Now, here's why people suffering from depression should always have someone to help keep an eye on them when they start a course of medication. Sometimes with modern anti-depressants the first symptom that reacts to treatment is the lethargy. All of a sudden the person who was unable to leave the same position on a sofa, or in a bed, for days on end is able to get up in the morning, or to summon up the energy to have a shower, or to go out to the shops...

Skarjo,"As a guy currently living in Japan and who did so to try and understand some very particular aspects of Japanese culture (namely, Japanese folklore and horror) I think there's a few reasons.

Primarily, cultures all over the world are very different. But often they are very obviously different in aesthetics, social constructs, social behaviours etc. So, when these cultures, which are very obviously far removed from standard western-centric views of the world, start having weird traditions then it's not very shocking.

Japan, however, on the very surface, often looks very familiar. The architecture of their big cities, the absolute basics of the school system, the absolute basics of the working world seem very familiar. Not to mention that Japan, over the last 50 years, has adopted and modified many foreign brands and images meaning that, on the surface, Japan can feel very familiar.

However, it absolutely isn't. It's entire social mentality is extremely different to what you may expect from a Western mentality. As such, its social norms can produce seemingly absurd things. Now, they're not absurd to the Japanese, of course.

mobyhead1,"More magnification means a dimmer image, because the lens that does the magnifying can only use a tiny portion of the light brought in by the primary lens (the one in the front).  Try to magnify too much, and the image is so dim it's unusable.

The only way to get a telescope to allow you to magnify *more* is to build a telescope with a bigger primary.  But there is a limit to how big the primary can be.  The biggest refracting telescope (the kind with a lens as the primary light-gathering element) is but a few tens of inches across.  A bigger lens becomes obscenely expensive to make, incredibly difficult to make, the more chromatic aberration (the different colors of light don't all focus at the same point) can occur, and even small imprecisions ruin it.  The solution is to use a mirror.

Scalia, like every other judge and justice in the country, thinks that we should look to the text of the law to figure that out.  This is always the starting point.

But, most judges think that if there is something in the text that isn't clear, we can look to other sources to help resolve that ambiguity when all of the tools we have to interpret just the text itself fail.  These judges are willing to look at things like legislative history (what does the committee report for the bill that led to the creation of the statute say about the ambiguity?).  Some but not all judges will also try to use their own common sense and experience to reconstruct the purpose of the statute, drawing from as many sources as possible.

Scalia, however, thinks that we should stick just to the text.  He says that the answer is in the text and nowhere else.  He will not look to legislative history 99% of the time (he has done it twice to my knowledge).  He will not engage in some inquiry into the overall purpose of the statute as he reconstructs it.  All he cares to look at is the text itself, plus a dictionary (but he likes to use old dictionaries, like Webster's Second instead of Webster's Third).

Basically, he is a textualist, who tries to figure out the intent of the legislature through the text alone.  There are lots of tools to interpret text that he uses (just like all other judges).  These are called the ""canons of statutory interpretation"".  I'll walk you through an easy one

One straightforward canon of interpretation is called ""noscitur a sociis.""  That means ""a word is known by the company it keeps.""  This canon tells us that we are going to look at words around an ambiguous word in a group of words to try to make some sense out of it.  So in the list, ""No person shall possess: cotton candy, Skittles, ice cream, or treats,"" the word ""treats"" is ambiguous.  What if to me, salad is a treat.  Am I forbidden from possessing salad? No, because just using the text, we can figure out that the legislature did not intend to prohibit salad.  All the other items in the list are sweet things that are bad for you in large quantity.  Salad isn't like that.  So it's not a ""treat"" for the purposes of this law.  

Scalia uses tools like these to figure out ambiguities in language of statutes.  So does every other judge.  The difference is that Scalia prefers to stop with just the text.  But if there is an ambiguity that this tool and other tools like it cannot resolve, most judges will look to other sources.

CatRelatedUsername,"Size and role.

Destroyers and frigates are small ships (commonly called escorts), typically meant to keep enemies from harassing the big ships. Currently they are interchangeable, but destroyers used to be the smaller of the two, and focused on anti-submarine warfare, while frigates could bring down larger ships when operating in packs. Also, frigates and destroyers could operate alone, due to their small size and higher maneuverability.

Battleships (along with cruisers, battlecruisers, and dreadnoughts) are what are known as capital ships, and are meant to provide a boat load (pun intended) of firepower. One-on-one, they can outshoot any other ship other than enemy capital ships. The largest ones typically served as the chief admiral's ship, and almost always operated in fleets with smaller ships because of their slower speed. In addition, they often served ended up being statements of nationalistic pride (particularly the Yamato, the Bismark, and the Missouri during and after WWII).

Larger capital ships have largely been replaced with aircraft carriers (which are also capital ships), as aircraft are much more useful in combat that the main guns of a battleship. Cruisers are still used, although they are now more of a large escort ship used for firing cruise missiles, rather than a capital ship in their own right.",null,0,cdn073l,1rgfxj,explainlikeimfive,top_day,10
QuickSpore,"It depends on what era you are talking about.

In the age of sail 18th and 19th century.

* Battleships / Ships of the Line - These are the big warships that would fight fleet to fleet battles.
* Frigates - These are large ships that are faster than battleships. They are out scouting, fighting pirates, escorting civilian ships, and occasionally joining in the big fleet battles.
* Corvettes/Sloops/Brigantines/etc. - There are also a lot of little ships with various roles running around.

As ships developed and got armor, bigger guns, and power plants things changed.

* Battleships - These were the biggest nastiest ships in the various navies.
* Cruisers - These replaced frigates. Faster than anything they can't outshoot and nastier than anything they can't outrun. While the battleships clumped together for big battles, the cruisers were running around doing most of the ""work.""
* Destroyers - When torpedoes were invented they changed the game, now a small boat could carry a weapon that could sink a Battleship. So these ""Torpedo Boat Destroyers"" would screen the fleet from anything little. They had a lot of small guns (couldn't hurt a Cruiser) to blow up little boats.

By WWII this was largely still the same.

* Battleships - Still the same.
* Cruisers - Still the same, but most now carried torpedoes for an extra punch.
* Destroyers - Mostly these had become the Torpedo Boats, with a dozen torpedoes they could pack a big punch in a small size. And because they were smaller and cheaper they picked up a lot of new jobs. They were given sonar sets and sent sub hunting. They were given radar sets and were back on the far edges of the fleet looking for other ships, and more importantly planes.
* Frigates - These were smaller Destroyers, usually dedicated to a single purpose. An anti-sub frigate for example was pretty much a sitting duck to a surface ship or an air attack.
* Carriers - These were the new big kid on the block. Able to find and sink ships before the other ships knew they were there, they completely changed warfare.

In the post WWII era things have changed somewhat

* Battleships - These are now obsolete. Only the US operated them for very long. In the days of missiles bug guns are of limited value. As this moment. There are none operating.
* Cruiser - This is a bigger destroyer. Only the US and Russia have Cruisers any more.
* Destroyer - This is the main ship now. Capable of dealing with any threat, they are large (much larger than the WWII destroyers) ships and form the core of almost all fleets.
* Frigates - These are still the Destroyers' little brothers. Less capable and usually dedicated to a single purpose.
* Carriers - There are a lot of different types carriers out there. The US is the only one who runs the massive super carriers. But both the US and other fleets operate smaller carriers for Helos and small planes that don't need runways.",null,0,cdnf0av,1rgfxj,explainlikeimfive,top_day,4

Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart) of Robin Hood fame and one of the most celebrated kings of English history participated in the third crusade. He drained the royal coffers and depleted the English defensive army, navy, and labor force to go fight in the holy land. Richard eventually died and his brother John became king and in his efforts to raise funds in order to pay mercenaries to defend the realm from France and Burgundy he started a civil war which led to the Magna Carta.

The Teutonic Order was a collective Germanic army which was supposed to be preparing to fight in the crusades, but ended up doing most of their fighting around the south-eastern baltic with the Prussians, Lithuanians, and Livonians (modern-day Latvia and Estonia). When they finished with their war, they ended up just ruling the place until a Polish/Lithuanian alliance finally had enough of it a few centuries later.

For the average person, the crusades was just one more reason the local nobility might call on them to fight and die or surrender up more of their agricultural production. It was nice for Europeans that the actual fighting of the crusades was happening away from their homes, as it meant fewer armies coming through and actually directly harming them, but war of any sort is a hardship born most by the poor.",null,0,cdmztx5,1rgei6,explainlikeimfive,top_day,8

QuickSpore,"In the 70s the US military wanted to create a communication network that would be able to ""survive"" a nuclear war. A lot of the concepts that make the Internet today and from that original DARPA-net. So as this evolved into the Internet, it makes sense how the initial addresses were handed out. You had .mil for military, .gov for non-military government, .edu for universities, .com for companies (like IBM), and .org or the various other entities. Those were the groups and companies involved in the original development.

Eventually the military went its own way, but the Internet (the network connecting all these entities) had achieved a life of its own. It was simply too convenient for IBM to be able to ""email"" files to MIT and so forth. And in the years before about 1990 there were a lot of different competing standards. There were multiple messaging applications, you had linked folders called Gopher and there were search applications like Archie to help you find things on Gopher.

But it all changed when the World Wide Web was developed and all that came with it: the browser, links, sites, etc. that form of the Internet was so user friendly it finally burst into public awareness. Prior to that Internet use was limited to a few businesses and university students. Now especially with the help of early ISPs like AOL anyone could use it. And the business world flocked to take advantage of the opportunities it offered.

**So who owns it?**

Mostly the various ISPs and some other cabling companies you have never heard of. They pay each other to access each others cables. Or they sign reciprocation agreements, you can use my wires, if I can use yours. And in a lot of places the government owns a lot of the cables as well. That is how some countries can control content. They either own or can lean on the owners of the connection points. You gain access by paying an ISP for their wires, and they via their agreements give you access to the others.

The US government was seeing how good for US businesses this whole Internet thing was, they spun off the last bit they controlled: assigning names and addresses. That is now the function of an international non-profit organization named ICANN.

The mirror is not ground flat -- the front glass surface is at an angle to the back (mirrored) surface. So if you looked at this mirror out of its casing, it would be wedge-shaped with the thicker edge at the top. When you ""flip"" the mirror, the back mirrored surface actually points toward the dark ceiling, so you don't see that image. What you see instead is the image reflecting off the front of the glass, and this is much dimmer that the pure reflected image so it does not hurt your eyes.
To prove that this is what is happening, take a flashlight with you one night and play with your mirror (while the car is parked in your garage, preferably).

Why our eyesight is worse than, say, an eagle's?
An eagle depends more heavily on its eyesight for survival (scanning the ground far below for prey while flying by at great speed), therefore over the evolution of the species of eagles we are familiar with, a genetic mutation that resulted in better eyesight almost always resulted in a better chance to survive and reproduce. 

In humans on the other hand, at a certain quality of eyesight (roughly that which we currently possess) an improvement in eyesight no longer improved chances for survival; we already saw well enough to run and hunt on foot.

Optical systems can be incredibly complicated and are subject to produce very bad results from errors of very small magnitude (i.e. your eye is a millimeter to long or short). Source: Optical Engineering Student... yeah it's tough, and it's amazing that anything has evolved eyesight at all.

Why our eyesight is worse than, say, an eagle's?
An eagle depends more heavily on its eyesight for survival (scanning the ground far below for prey while flying by at great speed), therefore over the evolution of the species of eagles we are familiar with, a genetic mutation that resulted in better eyesight almost always resulted in a better chance to survive and reproduce. 

In humans on the other hand, at a certain quality of eyesight (roughly that which we currently possess) an improvement in eyesight no longer improved chances for survival; we already saw well enough to run and hunt on foot.

mattymck,"relatively, a couple thousand feet is NOTHING in terms of closeness to the sun. The sun is some 93million miles away, a mile or 2 wont make any difference.

But the main reason why its colder is because of the air pressure. For gases, a change in pressure means a change in temperature. Depending on the conditions, there can be a lot of ways to look at this. One is that pressure is an outside force, and pumps energy into the thing it is pressurizing. Looked at that way, it's natural that gas molecules under high pressure would be at a higher energy level than gas molecules under less pressure. Another is that with a decrease in pressure gas often increases in volume. If the same number of gas molecules are in a bigger space, they don't jostle into each other as much, and their total kinetic energy is spread out over a larger area, lowering the average temperature.

Air molecules at low altitudes are crowded together in cities. Rough, unpredictable, they're likely to bounce off each other, and run riot through the streets, and go to nightclubs with guns stuck in the waistbands of their jean shorts. They're at a high energy and that makes for a high temperature.

Meanwhile, high altitude air molecules wander in solitude, a pack on their back and a cranky yak carrying their tent behind them. They have more space to wander around in, and because they don't bounce off each other as much, because they're not crammed into a small space by the pressure of the air above them, each square inch has a much lower temperature than sea level air.",null,0,cdmxdsj,1rg91e,explainlikeimfive,top_day,5

* Nuclear reactors as nuclear thermal rockets. This has been [studied extensively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA). Basically you run a propellant (i.e. hydrogen) through a hot reactor. It can be made to work, it's just very expensive and it is very heavy. There are a lot of proposed ways to do this, but all basically work in a similar way.

* Nuclear reactors as electricity sources, to power e.g. ion engines. [This too has been studied quite a lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Prometheus). Again, heavy and expensive, but probably not a bad choice though for spacecraft meant to go pretty far in space. This is the sort of thing you'd use for an in-space thruster as opposed to a rocket.

* Radioactive decay to power electric sources ([RTGs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator)). The are pretty good for providing compact electrical sources. They _are_ used extensively for things like the Mars rovers or satellites. Basically they are radioactive materials that are very hot, and that heat can be converted to electricity. Apparently the idea of using these as heat sources in rockets has been studied, but generally they have just been used to power apparatus (or ion engines) of things that have already been launched into space.

* Exploding nuclear bombs. [Also quite studied](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)). Downside is you have to make and blow up a lot of atomic bombs to make it work. Politically not very feasible. Expensive. Up-side is that it is one of the few really feasible ways to get big ships to go really fast over long distances.

Why don't we do any of these except for RTGs? It's probably not so much that any of the other designs are infeasible (except maybe the exploding atomic bombs one, for political reasons), other than the fact that they are expensive (though all space travel sort of is). 

It's more likely the case that _nobody is at all interested in building long-range, heavy-duty spacecraft_. That is, the space-faring nations built up a space infrastructure around liquid fuel rockets, trying to achieve tasks that are pretty easily achieved through liquid fuel rockets — putting up satellites, for example. You don't need nuclear rockets to put a satellite, or even the Space Shuttle, in space and you probably don't get many advantages out of doing so — certainly no advantages worth the cost of switching systems for. 

The place you get the real advantages are if you are talking about craft that is meant to travel really long distances or with really heavy weights.

Aside from that, nuclear power requires a lot of weight (to cool the reactor and contain the radiation), and it's incredibly difficult (ie. expensive) to get that much weight into space. (This is probably the same reason we don't have nuclear powered aircraft.)

StupidHockeyPlayer,"&gt; As a type of road, a boulevard (often abbreviated Blvd) is usually a wide, multi-lane arterial thoroughfare, divided with a median down the center, and ""roads"" along each side designed as slow travel and parking lanes and for bicycle and pedestrian usage, often with an above-average quality of landscaping and scenery. 

&gt;A street is a public thoroughfare in the built environment. It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. ... The word ""street"" is still sometimes used colloquially as a synonym for ""road"", but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction.

&gt;Traditionally, an avenue is a straight road with a line of trees or large shrubs running along each side, which is used, as its French source venir (""to come"") indicates, to emphasize the ""coming to,"" or arrival at a landscape or architectural feature. ... In US and Canadian urban or suburban settings, ""avenue"" is often simply a street name used to differentiate some streets from others, along with ""way"", ""road"", etc. Thus a community might have a ""Maple Avenue"" and a ""Maple Street"" to avoid confusion between addresses. In some cities in the United States (most notably in Manhattan, New York City), there is a convention that ""avenues"" run in a north-south direction, while ""streets"" run in an east-west direction, or vice versa. 

&gt;The word lane has several meanings, including and especially: 
1. a narrow road or street, usually lacking a shoulder or a median; this is typically applied to roads in the countryside, but can also be applied to urban streets or areas that used to be streets, such as Drury Lane in London, the Brighton Lanes, or the Cathedral Lanes in Coventry. 
2. a portion of a paved road which is intended for a single line of vehicles and is marked by white or yellow lines. 

&gt;In Northern America and Australia, the term also may refer to rear access roads which act as a secondary vehicular network in cities and towns. Large cities in the U.S. states of Nevada and Texas tend to apply the term to many arterial roads. &gt;

MaximumAldwyn,"Raw speed and raw capacity are valid measures of a computer, but not the only measures one must use to guage 'overall speed' or 'seat of your pants' speed.  There are many different speeds within a computer.

Prior to [Solid State Drives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive), hard disk technology really hadn't been changing in it's fundamental workings.  Sure, you can cram more stuff onto a disk, but the way it accessed it was, more or less, the same: a spinning platter with heads on top of it.

The speed of those disks, for most all home PC models, remained the same as well for many years: 7200rpm.  This creates what is called a 'bottleneck' - An area of slowness where things get backed up.

if your CPU can process eleventy billion things every single second, but is still being fed its data from the exact same hard disk as a CPU that can only process 42 million things a second, you won't really see a noticeable difference in speed by simply by watching it. This is because by the time the next chunk of data is retrieved from disk, both CPUs have already been sitting around waiting for it. Sure, the faster CPU had been waiting 'longer', but they were both still waiting; sitting there doing nothing

Much like a chain is is only as strong as its weakest link, a computer is only as fast as its slowest component, and that has most often been the hard disk (taking cd/dvd drives out of question, since those are not used as a core component of a computer, and one can easily use a computer without one).  There are other bottlenecks inside that magical computer-box, but the the hard drive speed is a good one to illustrate the point.",null,1,cdmwtpr,1rg5st,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3
Northwait,"There are a few causes for dropping performance. Using your computer generates lots of activity on storage, deleting and creating small files, and eventually your file system gets fragmented. 

Fragmentation is best thought of in a non-fragmented state. Imagine your 20 page term paper printed out but in a nice neat stack. If you need to read it, you look for the stack and you have it all there. Now imagine your paper is split up into a few pages over here, a few pages over there. Then, to read your paper, you have to go and fetch all of the pages from the many places it's held in order to look at it.

Keeping your system updated will cause that to happen with system files. When your computer was freshly built with an os installed, all the code it executes to do daily things is roughly located close to each other, near the same spots on your hard drive. If one of those libraries gets updated, it was to download and install the new one before removing the old one, and now you have fragmentation BETWEEN files and not just regular files. Think about your term paper and some of the research books. If all the stuff you checked out from the library is nearby while you're doing your citations, it's pretty quick. If you had to make a trip to a different library for each citation, it's going to get awful slow.

Then there are updates themselves. Newer, updated versions of your software might have security fixes, but they also tend to have more features or take some advancements in technology (cpu speed, memory, etc) for granted. On the surface, Word 2013 doesn't do anything for your term paper that Word 2010 couldn't, but it has new features and the code simply does more stuff when you're editing and working on your paper. Now multiply this for the hundred or so programs running on your machine at any given time (check your task manager and select ""show processes from all users"") and you can imagine how the system performance degrades over time despite being exactly the same as it was.

Ideally, if you never update your system and try to keep it defragged, it won't start lagging down.

Your notion is right about what a refund is, it's the amount that has been withheld from your paycheck that exceeds your tax liability.  It can also include refundable credits, most notably the Earned Income Tax Credit
The reason you have taxes withheld through out the year is because the government has figured out that people are not to be trusted in handling their own finances and many people would get to tax time and not have the money available to pay taxes.
Ideally, the taxes withheld would exactly equal the total liability but because everyone's finances and therefore applicable taxes are different it's just not possible to have a one size fits all so it's just easier to go with an estimate.
When you first start your job you fill out a w-4 the amount you have withheld is based on this form.
If I'm being cynical I'd say the government prefers to give refunds for two reasons one all the people that never bother to collect their refund, and two the government gets an interest free loan.  But there are plenty of people who end up owing at the end of the tax year too.
If you wind up owing over a certain amount you will have to pay fines.  And of course if you can't pay your liability in a timely fashion there is interest and penalties.

They used the rock to sharpen the stick. Then they used a stronger rock to break another rock and put little bits of it on a stick.

As time has passed, the rate at which technology improves has increased. We built better tools to make better things, which allowed us to make better tools.

But the main thing that's fueled this massive boom in tech in recent years (like 1970 til now) is the integrated circuit, and the fact that [the number of transistors double about every two years](http://www.mstech.com/nh-it-blog.php?show=171).

sir_sri,"&gt;Why has technology developed so quickly in the last 10 years in comparison to the last 100 years?Explained

The short answer is that it hasn't.

new technologies come out and there's a period of exceptionally rapid growth where it goes from a parlour trick to a major technology, and then it settles into a long period of slow progress.

Aircraft went from from a rickety pile of wood that was more likely to kill you than get you from point A to point B to a something actively used in serious combat in about 12 years.  20 years later and you had aircraft that sort of looked like today's commercial aircraft, though with propellers rather than jets.  Then jets caught on and there was another burst of development and then... we've had 40-50 years of progress but not rapid leaps and bounds.  

Metal ships are something similar, the first iron ships started showing up around the 1840's (with varying degrees of metal-steam-wood-sail).  By 1860 there was a ~9500 tonne ironclad sea going warship, HMS Warrior.  She's still afloat at Portsmouth in the UK if you ever go there.  By 1912 (Titanic) the biggest ships were almost 60 000 tonnes.  That's absolutely huge progress, but since today we regularly build ships over 100k it doesn't seem like such a big deal.  But that was tremendously rapid progress, especially considering how long it takes to build huge ships and make ports and for them.  

The first hot air balloon was basically a death trap.  Within 10 years they were dropping bombs with it, eventually they were the size of an aircraft carrier and could carry a couple of dozen passengers across oceans.  Then they were replaced by heavier than air aircraft. 



What happens is that engineering and innovation catch up to science.  The underlying principles of most of what goes on in microprocessors is E&amp;M and Quantum mechanics, we've had those understood pretty well for the better part of 70 years, but the microprocessor didn't really take off until the 1970's.  So it's rapidly catching up to the limits of our understanding of the science, and in 20 years or we'll probably start to hit a wall where you cannot make a microprocessor based on traditional semiconductor physics work any better.  Someone will figure out how to build a quantum computer we'll have a race to reach the limits with that, and then it will be slow marginal improvements for a while. 

Certainly things like the printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, the internet all speed up communication and speed up development, and there are a lot more people alive than there were at any previous point in history (word pop in 1800 was about 1 billion for the first time, by 1900 it was like 1.6 by 2000 it was about 6 billion. ) so there are a lot more scientists doing a lot more science with much better tools.  

But technology tends to go through spurts and things we think of as unchanged for ages started out as some ridiculous magic trick or gimmick then someone had a revelation about what you could do, and that rapidly progressed to something, and then did very little for a while.  

One of the common questions here is why do batteries suck and microprocessors increase so rapidly.  Well between 1800 and 1900 batteries went from being a misunderstood lab experiment to an actual technology people understood and could use.  Basically from the first battery in 1800 until the mid 1830's no one had a clue what was going on.  Then someone figured it out, made better batteries, that actually worked and could be improved on reliably.  By 1860 we had lead acid batteries, which are still in use in cars and the technology basically went unchanged from 1860 until 1970.   From 1800 to 1860 there were huge advances, and then many decades of very incremental progress.  Expect something similar with lots of the tech you see as so incredibly awesome from the last 10 years.

When it is cold, your nerves are VERY sensitive to the temperature, as it ISNT numb yet, and still....blood flow is slowed down tremendously. In fact, your body has begun ""vaso-constricting"" all it's blood flow AWAY from your hands and feet, then the arms and legs, resulting in nerves being pressed upon by the less suple skin and vascular tissues.

upvoter222,"It's because the point that was selected to be 0 on the Fahrenheit scale was somewhat arbitrary.  In other words, right now 32 degrees is water's freezing point and 212 degrees is its boiling point.  You could just as easily shift the scale over a degree and make current 0 degrees equal to -1 degrees, freezing to 31 degrees, and boiling to 211 degrees.  It's completely arbitrary.  The numbers were selected in part for convenience.  Most things we encounter in our daily lives like weather stay in the 0-100 range.  That's easy to work with.

The thing to remember is that there's no such thing as negative temperature.  With Farenheit or Celsius nothing changes as you go from -1 degrees to +1 any differently than when you go from +10 to +12.  To put it another way, all temperatures are effectively positive.  To deal with this, for the purpose of scientific equations, a scale is used called Kelvin.  Simply put, there are no negatives on this scale.  Absolute zero is 0K and it goes all the way up from there. 

TL;DR: There isn't really negative temperature.  0 degrees Fahrenheit is just a convenient, but arbitrary place to start counting for everyday temperatures.  ",null,0,cdmvx30,1rg2oe,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
ElectroSpore,"Units of measure are relative to some kind of reference or constant.

* Fahrenheit's basis very odd
""On Fahrenheit's original scale the lower defining point was the freezing point of brine, defined as zero degrees."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit

*  Celsius is scaled against water and absolute zero
Celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures: absolute zero, and the triple point of VSMOW (specially purified water).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius

* Kelvin
""The Kelvin scale is an absolute, thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics.""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin

So to answer, your question, Fahrenheit is based of something arbitrary and is measured to have both a positive and a negative.

Celsius is anchored on pure water to give you a good idea of cold.. IE negative is freezing positive is not for the most common thing on earth water.

Kelvin exists to describe having zero energy or more in a very detailed scale for science.

There is no negative in Kelvin as 0 means no energy.. You don't make things cold, you just remove energy from them.",null,0,cdmvyjn,1rg2oe,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

The two best examples of this are also the two most common:

Freenet was the first, and it is designed to circumvent censorship by distributing all the content among the nodes on the network. While fairly easy to set up, it never seemed to gain much popularity.

More recently and (I believe, but it's hard to get any real data on the matter, what with being intentionally hard to measure)  more popular, is Tor Hidden Services.

Tor is a router which routes traffic over intermediary nodes, so (ideally) no node knows if the node before it originated the traffic, or if the node after it is the real end poinnt. Hidden Services are servers are set up to only respond to requests over the Tor network, and they are accessed by connecting to a routing address only accessible by connecting through Tor.

Enter Hitler in post WWI Germany. The country was crippled by penalties from a war that many Germans didn't really think they had lost. There was a strong belief by many Germans that the war was lost by politicians in Berlin, not by the soldiers in France.

Hitler was able to tap into these two beliefs and provide a scapegoat for the German people to pin their frustrations on. The conniving Jews had undermined the government and lost them the war, and they'd continue to block the Germans from their destined greatness.
