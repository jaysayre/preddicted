sir_sri,"&gt;Someone young like me doesn't have $1000 to spend on a single share of Google.

If you don't have several thousands of dollars to lose you shouldn't be investing in individual stocks.  Any single company could have all sorts of things go wrong with it and you would lose everything, that you cannot afford to lose.  

&gt;and their stock would go up as a result, right?

Not really no.

A few thousand people buying one share is irrelevant to the share price.   The way you should be buying into google (or anyone) is by buying into a mutual fund that has several tech stocks.  You get a tiny piece of the larger pie, but you're not stuck to a single company. 

&gt;Or do they not want that for some reason?

They want to drive away hordes of small investors who have no meaningful portion of the company.  1 million investors with 1 share each are only worth a billion dollars, which is less than 1% of the value of the company.  That's a lot of paperwork for basically nothing.  Particularly if they're  highly volatile and trading small numbers of shares around.  


&gt;please explain if this is not the case

Different companies have different strategies, particularly when it comes to stock splitting. If you feel there are enough shares available, or if you feel that you stock is so expensive as to even be pricing mutual funds out of the market you may need to consider a split, unless you only want long term investors.  Cheap stocks can see a lot of trading volume from people trying to get a few dollars a share here or there. 

Berkshire hathaway (warren buffets company) is the example of strongly resisting - to a point of excess.  Their share price as of when I type this is 174 000 USD per share.  Yes, 174k.  Unfortunately they've had to introduce a new class of shares because people started selling securities that were basically just repackaged BRK.A stocks.

rainman21043,"There was a lawsuit against Google that was preventing a stock split, that is apparently clearing up:

http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/17/technology/google-stock-split/

A lot of companies split around $1000 for the reason you are saying - people are hesitant to spend that much money for just one ""thing"", and if they can buy four stocks for $250 each (or just one for $250) then they feel the barrier of entry is lower, the risk is lower (?), etc.  It's purely psychological.  However, typically when a strong company whose stock has been rising splits it stock there is a quick upsurge in the effective stock price as people want to ""get in"" on the new price, they feel they can finally afford it, or whatever.  I would be interested in some statistics on this actually, maybe that is just my bias talking.

The opposite is true in my very limited experience too - I worked at a company who did a reverse stock split to try and get their price above $1 a share, as if that would magically put them into the big leagues and suddenly the company would turn around.  So we traded in two $0.55 per share stocks for one $1.10 and within a week the new price was down around $0.80 and just kept falling after that.  I can't imagine that a reverse stock split has ever worked, it sounds like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic to me.  Once again, maybe some statistics would prove me wrong.",null,0,cdpgyed,1ro811,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
Quetzalcoatls,"&gt; My question is, why is there no consensus over who owns them?

The Islands have changed hands many times over the course of history. If you take the land from someone and then someone takes that land from you, do you have any more of a legitimate claim than someone else? What if you never settled or developed the island but another country later did? All these questions make a question of ownership complicated. 

&gt; What does that mean for territory claims in general, what would happen if country A were to say ""We own this province in neighbouring country B!""? Is that something the international community decides about, and if so, why aren't they deciding anything about the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands?

Country A would be ignored unless they physically controlled the territory or were intending to take it. The international community gets somewhat involved in land disputes but its something that most nations are not quick to get involved with without cause because it is such a touchy subject. 


",null,0,cdp78c2,1ro82m,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
sir_sri,"Taiwan and mainland China both claim the islands because the Republic of China was the government of China until it fled to Taiwan during the civil war, they roughly claim ownership of all of the same territory, and both claim to be the legitimate government of the other. 

&gt;What does that mean for territory claims in general, what would happen if country A were to say ""We own this province in neighbouring country B!""? Is that something the international community decides about, and if so, why aren't they deciding anything about the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands?

There are procedures in place for the international community to try and settle these  things, some more successful than others, and both parties would need to agree to arbitration, which neither party is likely to consider neutral.  

Usually when you sign a peace treaty you agree to boundary changes, but not always.  In the case of Japan and China, China (taiwan) signed as part of the Allies but basically left a number of islands unresolved as the US was going to occupy them, and they figured the islands would be handed 'back' to them. 

The US took the view that these Islands belong to Japan, and so... didn't give them to China (either china).  

Unfortunately, there are a lot of blobs of territory around the world like this.  Someone discovered it, someone else claimed it, someone else claimed it again, someone else settled it, a war was fought where one side presumed it was settled, but wasn't and then 100 years later we're still squabbling over it, but it's low level and no one cares.  Until someone finds something worth having.  Then it's a problem.  

These islands in particular are problematic because Japan may have acknowledged that they were part of China in prior to the 1870's, but claimed annexation in 1879 before a series of wars between Japan and China and it's not clear whether or not they should be returned with 'all chinese territory' or other vague phrases. 

The world used to have little dots of fishing islands that were sort of but no legally abandoned and basically tiny little enclaves of one country in another and no one is ever happy.  As the world changes lots of these things went from important and with recognized (if disputed) claims, to unimportant with no one doing much of anything, and back to important and squabbling again.

mobyhead1,"Yes, plastic surgery works--for the most part.  Too many surgeries, too radical a change in the shape of the features, and good results become harder to acheive.

&gt;Was the NSA just doing a terrible job of hiding it's track

The NSA wasn't hiding it particularly, as it doesn't need to.  Very little of what Edward Snowden has leaked is information we didn't know for at least a decade and sometimes longer.  The specific details we didn't know, but they generally didn't matter anyway.   Yes yes, the NSA is spying on Skype, and internet traffic, we know.  That these programmes have specific names isn't all that important.  

Intelligence is only useful if the right people see it, one of the changes after sept11th is that the intelligence community (CIA, NSA, law enforcement, other countries) realized all these little walled off blobs of knowledge made it very hard for people trying to do useful stuff to actually do the job.

The modifications don't just make the sound/signal louder, they also adjust the sound according to a ""prescription"" (each manufacturer changes the signal in a different way. These modifications are based precisely on the wearer's hearing thresholds at a range of frequencies (250Hz to about 6,000Hz). They also transform the signal to ensure that the output is comfortable for the wearer - as well as making sure it won't blast their ears and damaging any hearing they have left, as well as making sure its not exceeding the limits of the hearing aid (which would cause distortion).

It's the law built up from long traditions and precedents that exists prior to legislative bodies passing specific statutes. The English common law developed in the Middle Ages, and forms the basis of law in England and its former colonies, including the U.S. (Except for Louisiana, whose common law derives from France).

For instance, under English common law, a couple is married when they live together for a certain period of time and hold themselves out to the community as man and wife. Legislatures in most jurisdictions, however, have overridden common law by passing statutes requiring a marriage license issued by the state to be considered married.

carlfish,"As far back as the middle ages, legal disputes between individuals in Britain were decided by taking them to courts adjudicated by judges appointed by the crown. Judges appointed by the King or Queen would literally travel from town to town hearing cases and passing down judgements. In the absence of a comprehensive statutory code, judges would base their decisions on their understanding of how the law should work, and how judges before them had decided similar cases.

On their return to London, courts would record their judgements and the reasoning behind them and share them with their fellow judges. That way, when a judge encountered a similar case on their circuit, they would be able to decide it consistently with the last judge who had decided that case. Alternatively, a senior judge might overrule their junior and create a new precedent.

The Common Law is the result of these thousand years of legal decisions. Judges in Common Law jurisdictions are expected to decide cases consistently with their predecessors, and in turn pass on how they interpret the law in newly arising circumstances to their successors.

How ""legitimate"" the Common Law is depends on your jurisdiction. The degree to which the Common Law is adopted in your local legal system is determined by your local laws. Especially, different countries tend to clearly mark where their local system of precedent diverges from the British system they inherited it from - decisions before that date being binding legal precedent, and decisions after that date only being suggestions on how the law might be interpreted. 

The only consistent rule is that statutory law always overrules Common Law, so once a government passes a law then all other precedent is overruled.",null,0,cdpge46,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

This is why you can't start out in 6th gear but 1st typically tops out around 25 miles per hour. Imagine pedaling a bike - each gear is a compromise between power produced per pedal stroke and difficulty of pedaling at a given speed.

In contrast, a CVT (continuously variable transmission) has no fixed gear ratios. Instead, it uses a computer algorithm to continuously determine the most efficient gear ratio for the given road speed and throttle input. Mechanically, it uses a system of pulleys and belts. Continuing the bike metaphor, this system means that you always have the ideal ratio of pedal difficulty to power production for any given road speed, so it's never too hard to start out or too easy to over-pedal.",null,0,cdpa91u,1rof84,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

To accurately measure the air temperature, official thermometers have historically been placed in a white shelter box referred to as a Stevenson screen and more recently in a white enclosed ventilated plastic cover.

&gt;Often a thermometer used by a business is directly in the Sun part of the day, plus the thermometers are often placed over parking lots that are black and absorb much of the incoming solar radiation and make the surrounding air much warmer.  That dark surface influence has been particularly noticeable in recent days as the strong early Spring sunshine has a lot of potential to warm, but our snow pack has been limiting the area from reaching our temperature potential.

&gt;So if you see a bank thermometer flashing 50 degrees on a sunny day, the reality is, it would likely really be 50 degrees if it was not for our deep snow cover.

At a distance, the black hole's gravitational pull is about the same as the star that it once was.  If you could turn our Sun into a black hole without all the death throes that would surely roast all the inner planets, all of the planets would orbit it just as they orbit the Sun now.  But close up, the incredible gravity of a black hole produces interesting effects.  The tidal pull of our Sun and Moon causes the oceans to bulge, because the pull on the side of the Earth nearer to the Sun or Moon is somewhat stronger than the pull on the on the far side.  This effect of the tide--the difference between gravitational pull between two points--is ferocious near a black hole.

So sometimes people sailed to the correct latitude and then sailed straight east/west (or tried to anyway), that's not trivial when you're powered by sails that lead you not exactly where you intended.

From the mid 1500's on into the 1700's various european monarchs were offering quite a lot of money to try and solve this problem.  Finding longitude is a relatively easy problem on land, not so easy at sea btw.

One of the most basic ways to do this was with very precise measurement of time.  If you know the local time, and the time at some other fixed point (say Greenwich observatory) you could tell where you were.  Unfortunately methods of telling time - hourglasses and pendulums don't work for shit in a ship bobbing around in the open ocean. You can correctly tell *local* time from the sun, but that doesn't do you any good unless you know local time at some fixed point.  

In the mid 1700's (and for quite a while after) the method was based on very complex data tables about the position of of the moon at known points.  Not ideal, but it was good enough until the mid 1850's when high precision mechanical clocks became affordable. (and then in the 1900's they used radio positioning, which along with GPS type systems is still what is used).

A process known as chain surveying by triangles. Essentially you very carefully measured a large straight line distance by hand using a chain of known length^1. Then using trigonometry you could work out the distance of the other two sides. The whole area to be mapped (for instance the whole of the UK by Ordnance Survey) could be broken down in to triangles and mapped in this way. Whilst in theory you could map the whole country based on one single measurement of length, in reality tolerances (small errors that make your calculations too large or small) would build over time and throw your map way out. As such they had to do those physical measurements by hand all over the country to ensure their numbers were not straying far from reality.

The thing is that if the initial two had ""perfect"" genomes with no mutations corresponding to serious defects, there is no reason that their breeding (or that of their descendants) would necessarily give rise to a population with those defects. If they aren't there to begin with, they wouldn't be created by inbreeding. The founder effect is the formal name for how low diversity groups starting a population can lead to high incidences of genetic defects. But that is only because the genes for those traits were brought by a founding member of the population. Inbreeding NEVER creates a genetic mutation. It only increases the chance that one already present will be expressed.

And anyways, if the two people happened to carry in some serious problem traits, as in serious to the point that they would kill off the affected person, then natural selection would act to start pushing the gene's prevalence downwards anyway.

So in short, assuming that these two individuals were healthy to start with, that pretty much guarantees that there are enough ""healthy"" genes in play to rebuild the population.

To the speed of the light we should add the speed of the car. But since the Universe doesn't allow anything to be faster than light, what it does to fix this is make time go slower for the car (and anything inside it, including yourself). The faster you go, the slower time goes for you (even if you don't turn on the lights).

No matter your own speed you'll always see the light going the speed of light (300,000kps) faster than you.

a20gate,"Here's a way to visualize it without any math.  (I'm going to use some horribly imprecise terminology and I look forward to real physicists explaining all the ways this is cringeworthy.)

You're always travelling at the same ""speed"" through 4-dimensional spacetime.  If you're stationary, you're travelling entirely along the ""time"" axis, and all your speed is spent moving in that direction.  Whenever you're moving through space, that means you're moving at an angle through spacetime, spending part of your speed moving along one or more of the space axes, so you don't make as much progress down the time axis.

A photon moving at c is essentially moving through spacetime at a 90 degree angle to a stationary person:  It spends all of its ""speed"" moving along the space axes, and does not experience time at all.

A hypothetical tachyon moving faster than c would be moving through spacetime at a greater-than-90-degree angle to a stationary person, i.e. it would be moving in the ""wrong"" direction up the time axis.  That's why having a velocity faster than c would imply breaking causality and going backwards in time.

Incidentally, the natural and smallest measurable units of spacetime are called the Planck units, and c is equal to 1 [Planck length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length) per [Planck time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time).",null,0,cdpeckh,1ror80,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

The server will usually have a database with all the data that users might be able to see on the page but each individual web page is created on the fly by the server.  This is done with the programming language PHP, or sometimes JSP or plain Java or whatever.  There are lots of different programming languages you can write a web server with.

Take Reddit for example.  The page where I am typing this response has dozens of different clickable areas on it - the header where it says ""FRONT - ALL - RANDOM | PICS - FUNNY - etc..."", then the ""EXPLAINLIKEIMFIVE"" header under that, the login area to the right, the search box, some advertisements, the text of your particular question, etc.  There are thousands of ELI5 questions just on this subreddit and the server doesn't store a different HTML page for each of them (there would be millions of pages to store, and they need to be customized for individual users with their user name, etc...), it just stores the questions and responses in a database.  When I click on the link to your ELI5 question the URL is sent to the server and the PHP program on the server receives my request and generates a brand new HTML file using the latest data in the database, my preferences and user name, etc.  So every time one of the millions of Reddit users clicks on a link, a brand new HTML file is generated and sent to them and promptly forgotten by the server because it will likely never need to send the same exact page ever again.  The CSS and Javascript are usually the same on every page though.

So PHP is just a programming language, but it is most often used to generate HTML files on demand as users on large websites click on various links.",null,0,cdpgqcx,1rorg4,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1
Hifoz,"The difference is that PHP(PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is a serverside processing language, which processes HTML and uses it to make a site work, it basically gets information from the page, and sends to the server and the opposite. It mostly gets used to process login sessions.

SirEbonwolf,"It is different for different types of phone. When you talk into your mobile phone it receives that information (which is in the form of vibrations travelling through the air) and uses a device inside it that works like the human ear-drum to convert that sound into an electromagnetic wave. It then fires that wave to the nearest mobile tower (if your network uses towers) or satellite (I think some phones can go directly to satellite, correct me if I'm wrong) and then from there it is sent to the phone you are calling which receives the electromagnetic signal and uses a microphone to convert that signal to sound. On a wired phone it does the same thing but does not use electromagnetic waves but instead uses a type of electrical current that travels between the two phones through the internet. This all happens EXTREMELY fast, in fact the electromagnetic waves/electric current transmit the signal at the speed of light, so that is why you only hear a tiny delay.

sir_sri,"So I work with a company with games listed on steam that use keys.  

1.  You send them an excel spreadsheet with valid keys.  It checks against the list.  If they run out of keys they unlist your game or it becomes unbuyable and it's a nuisance to get back, as the key uploading (from a developer) wasn't automated last time we had this problem, so you have to wait for someone at valve to put it in the computer system.  

&gt;How does a key get generated?

Key generation is just cryptography.  Basically you take some message, encrypt it with a public key, print it on a disk.  Your servers or valve have the private key and can decrypt the message, read it, and figure out what it says, the encrypted message can be in a particular format to make them easy to understand once decrypted.  

&gt;is it really that unlikely to correctly guess one?

Depends on the encryption used.  But if the encryption chosen was good there would be 10's of millions of valid CD keys in a key space of 2^256 (which is 1.5x10^77) so.. you'd have a 1/10^70 ish chance per key.  That might take a while.  

That's assuming 256 bit encryption.

Feldman742,"Years ago, many scientists started noticing that large astronomical bodies and objects seem to be much, much heavier than they should be based on the amount of material we can account for using direct observation.

Dark matter is a hypothesized substance that basically fills this discrepancy. An invisible substance that makes objects heavier than they appear.

It's unclear precisely what it is, but it's probably a combination of big cold, dark objects like Brown dwarfs and black holes, and numerous small particles like neutrinos, which don't seem to interact at all with normal matter.",null,2,cdpftx1,1rowmp,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

Chemical reactions, such as turning oxygen and hydrogen into water, change the arrangement of the atoms that make up the molecule.

EpilepticFits1,"Water molecules are held together by simple covalent bonding. This makes H2O much more stable than Ionic-bonded molecules (like salts), or large organic molecules (like those that make up wood). The heat of the fire does NOT impart enough energy to destroy a molecule of water; so the water simply evaporates. 

The transfer of heat, incidentally, is why water extinguishes fire. Water is fairly temperature stable. Meaning- it takes a large amount of energy to heat a relatively small amount of water to the point of evaporation. Adding water to a fire (this excludes hazmat situations) cools the burning material enough that the combustion reaction is no longer self sustaining. At this point the fire is self sustaining.

BassoonHero,"There is a lot of mythology about this, so I'll try to post a complete answer. This brushes on some old holy wars, so please read the whole thing before leaving angry comments.

The first important point is that a virus is a specific type of malware. A virus exploits holes in an operating system to spread itself from system to system. You might get a virus from an infected disc or flash drive, or from another system on your network. If you install it yourself, then it's not a virus, even if you were tricked into installing it. A piece of malware disguised as something innocuous is called a trojan horse, or just a ""trojan"" for short.

There is a variety of trojan horse malware out there for the Mac OS, for Windows, and even for Linux. However, there are few viruses that will infect modern Windows and *none* that affect the modern Mac OS. For Windows, this has not long been the case. A decade ago, Windows viruses abounded, and users had to be very careful to keep up with software updates and to run antimalware programs. At the same time, there were *still* no Mac OS X viruses in the wild.

Common internet wisdom holds that this is because the Mac OS was far less popular at the time, so no one tried to write a virus for it. While intuitively appealing, this explanation is faulty for several reasons.

First, it strains one's credulity to suppose that this could explain a *total* lack of viruses for Mac OS X. Surely someone *somewhere* would have seen that while the Mac market was smaller, it was also ripe for subversion. Mac users of the time were justifiably (if irritatingly) smug about not needing to run antivirus programs. If there had been no additional hurdles to creating a Mac OS X virus, then it should have been *easier* to infect Macs, because their users were not accustomed to taking precautions. Moreover, surely some ambitious hacker must have realized the infamy that writing the first virus for OS X would bring.

Second, the prevalence of other types of malware, such as trojan horse software, has increased as the Mac's market share waxes. It's commonplace to hear that yet another Mac-based trojan has been spotted in the wild, yet still not a single virus. If the Mac's market share is sufficient to attract trojans, then why not viruses?

Third, the true cause is evinced by a decline in Windows viruses over the past several years. True, Windows's market share has declined somewhat, but the number of true viruses has dropped precipitously. The drop is all out of proportion to the fall in market share, and, crucially, the prevalence of viruses for other platforms (such as Mac OS X) has not increased to make up for it.

So if we can eliminate market share as the cause, then what? Well, the answer is simple, if sadly contentious. During the ""dark ages"" of Windows viruses, the Windows OS was far more vulnerable to viruses than either its contemporaries or the modern Windows OS. The ""malware explosion"" that accompanied the rise of internet use among ordinary users hit Windows the hardest because Windows was the easiest OS to write a virus for. The subsequent decline of true viruses came as Microsoft worked to close security holes, retire old APIs, and generally modernize their OS.

In a way, it's only by happenstance that the Mac OS avoided this. The ""classic"" Mac OS (versions 1–9) predated Windows, and by the late '90s, it was showing its age. It was designed for a world where a personal computer had a single, trusted user. Where this assumption was violated, there were security holes. And there were definitely viruses, although in those days, you were more likely to catch one from a friend's floppy disk than from the internet. There were also myriad technical limitations that are well-documented elsewhere. So Apple decided to replace the OS wholesale. This was a long and painful process, and an interesting one if you find this sort of thing interesting, but in the end, they had OS X, a modern, multi-user UNIX-based OS. And no viruses.

Windows's evolution took a more gradual path. Windows NT (""New technologies"") was in some technical respects a dramatic step forward, but Microsoft was very careful not to move too fast, lest compatibility problems alienate their users. Apple, on the other hand, maintained compatibility by requiring their users to emulate the classic OS within OS X, an approach that infuriated users but allowed Apple's engineers to make a much cleaner break with the bad old days.

So during the ""dark ages"", Mac users had a brand new modern OS, whereas Windows users had an aging single-user OS full of holes that Microsoft was working to plug. Today, Windows is a different animal – Microsoft's strategy of replacing the planks as the ship sailed seems to have mostly worked. And a modern Windows PC is very unlikely to get a computer virus. But people remember a time, not too long ago, when this was not the case, and the impressions left by that era linger on in the popular consciousness.",null,1,cdpfkns,1roy3o,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3

TheDoctorApollo,"While it is true that there is more awareness for Celiac's Disease and that will lead to increased diagnosis, I am not aware of any evidence that suggests it is more common now compared to 5, 10+ year ago.

Most people who are self-diagnosed Celiacs have absolutely nothing wrong with them, but instead just want to jump on board the band wagon. Perhaps they have an intolerance to gluten, but an intolerance is very different than an allergy which is what defines Celiac's Disease. For someone to truly be allergic to gluten they must have an adaptive immune response to it. As I said, most people are either doing it because they want the health benefits of a gluten-free diet or because it's the cool thing to do. I had a friend that decided she was allergic to gluten this summer. I couldn't help but call her out on it when she decided that pizza and beer didn't count in her new lifestyle.

If your sister was actually diagnosed with Celiac's by an allergist (MD who specializes in allergies) than it is possible that you have it as well. There is some evidence to suggest that there is a genetic link in Celiac's disease. It is worth getting check out by a health professional, prolonged exposure to gluten can cause tissue remodeling in someone with Celiac's, which may lead to cancer or chronic inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome.

liquefaction187,"Awareness does help, but there are many other factors. I believe there's been a steep increase over the last 20-30 years that is only now becoming public knowledge. Children have more sensitive immune systems than adults, and those who have spent their whole lives only eating lots of unfermented gluten from a few strains have a more severe immune system reaction than adults who ate less gluten, grew up on fermented gluten, and ate more diverse gluten. 

For starters, we are overexposed to gluten - we eat more processed foods than we did in the past. Gluten is also added to more foods than ever because it's cheap. It's cheap because it stores well, and it's subsidized. While in the past we ate many different strains of wheat, currently we eat only a few strains. Modern wheat is bred to be extremely high in gluten, because gluten is great for texture. 

The way we process wheat has also changed. Commercial yeast wasn't developed until the 1960s. Before that, wheat had to be fermented to help it rise. A starter was created for this purpose. Starters are usually made from flour and water. The flour and water would be naturally colonized by local bacteria, which would be fed with more flour and water on a regular basis (or less often for sourdough), and these bacteria are what caused dough to rise. That starter was used to make each loaf of bread. The bacteria served another helpful function as well - to break down the harmful substances in grains by digesting them and leaving behind harmless substances humans can digest easily. 

There's a good reason grain is a common allergy. Like animals, plants can have defenses. Not all though - some plants, like fruits, want to be eaten. Their seeds are spread through feces, so it makes sense for them to be delicious and not cause issues in things that eat them. Unsprouted grains, however, die when eaten, so they developed a hull as a defense. That hull contains phytic acid, which blocks absorption of calcium, iron, and other nutrients we need. It's called an anti-nutrient for that reason. Another mildly toxic substance in seeds is lectin. In small amounts, these substances won't cause permanent issues, just some mild stomach upset in those not accustomed. However, when eaten multiple times a day, our bodies sometimes start to react. 

Another thing makes lectins and anti-nutrients in grains more harmful today than in the past. Grains were left in the fields to sprout long ago. Just like fruit now is picked before it's ripe, followers of modern agricultural methods don't allow the grain to sprout, as sprouted grain goes bad more quickly. Sprouted grain also contained fewer of these anti-nutrients as it doesn't need the defenses that a seed does. 

Even in people who aren't intolerant/allergic, gluten causes inflammation due to this toxic substance, as well as lectins. This inflammation causes the intestines to swell. The swelling causes tiny holes to be opened. When this happens, tiny particles of food leak outside of the intestines where they're supposed to be, into the body. At this point our body sees the particles as foreign invaders, and begins to attack them. This is called Leaky Gut Syndrome and is in debate within the medical community, but many people (myself included) have seen relief by avoiding substances that cause inflammation. Had I waited around for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me, I'd still be too sick to leave the house. 

If you think about how your immune system is designed to react to a tiny germ, it's easy to understand how a tiny particle of gluten could cause a reaction as well. Our bodies are reacting to what they see as a constant poisoning by doing what they are supposed to do - trying to make us stop eating something that's bad for us.

defguysezhuh,"When calling 911 in the United States, Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing (D/HH) people have several options (links to additional information are included as I go along):

* **Video Relay Service (VRS) &amp; Video Phones (VP) -** They can use VPs to call 911 immediately via VRS.  Basically, the Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person will dial 911 over the video phone, a certified sign language interpreter will respond first, and then dial 911 is dialed immediately via telephone line in a 3-way conference call (deaf person to interpreter to dispatch).  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located (at home or at a business) registered on that account so that when dialing 911, the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the 911 dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency.  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a time-saver when dealing with emergencies, but is also provides clear and direct communication when a Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person, like anyone in an emergency situation, may be panicking and would likely ""stutter"" with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address.  For more information on how VPs &amp; VRS work, you can check out **[Purple Communications](http://purple.us/)** or **[Sorenson Communication](http://www.sorenson.com/)**, which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida (with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA, I believe).

* **TTY/TDD &amp; Text Relay Services-**  Just to avoid confusion: TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context, but have two different names for the same device.  Some people know it better by one name over the other, so I included both, though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out.  Moving on, it's been pointed out that **[TTYs/TDDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_devices_for_the_deaf)** are an ""outdated technology.""  For the most part, this is true.  A D/HH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other D/HH friends/family members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place.  However, not all D/HH people know sign language.  As such, these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls.  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls, they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the D/HH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that D/HH person.  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the D/HH person as if they were speaking to that person directly.  So, it’s the same idea as calling 911 on a VRS call, but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign.

* **Captioned Telephones-** If you still use a landline telephone, you can use a **[CapTel](http://captel.com/)** phone, which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss (usually a Hard-of-Hearing person and not a Deaf person).  Basically, you’ll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed.  Using speech recognition software, everything being spoken by the person you’re calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone (similar to subtitles on a TV) with the silent operator’s ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software.  Recently, Sprint created a **[CapTel mobile app](http://www.sprintcaptel.com/wireless-captel-sprint)** so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline.  Same principle as using the Text/Video Relay Services, but you won’t have an operator talking for you.  You’ll be talking for yourself, so less delay in 911 calls.

* **Text Messages -** This is still in the works.  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to 911 because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if you’re a victim of attack and trying to hide (e.g., school shootings, muggings, home robberies, rape, etc.), so this is extremely beneficial not only to D/HH, but also to hearing people as well.  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how **[Text-to-911](http://www.fcc.gov/text-to-911)** is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up &amp; running.

defguysezhuh,"When calling 911 in the United States, Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing (D/HH) people have several options (links to additional information are included as I go along):

* **Video Relay Service (VRS) &amp; Video Phones (VP) -** They can use VPs to call 911 immediately via VRS.  Basically, the Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person will dial 911 over the video phone, a certified sign language interpreter will respond first, and then dial 911 is dialed immediately via telephone line in a 3-way conference call (deaf person to interpreter to dispatch).  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located (at home or at a business) registered on that account so that when dialing 911, the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the 911 dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency.  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a time-saver when dealing with emergencies, but is also provides clear and direct communication when a Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person, like anyone in an emergency situation, may be panicking and would likely ""stutter"" with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address.  For more information on how VPs &amp; VRS work, you can check out **[Purple Communications](http://purple.us/)** or **[Sorenson Communication](http://www.sorenson.com/)**, which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida (with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA, I believe).

* **TTY/TDD &amp; Text Relay Services-**  Just to avoid confusion: TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context, but have two different names for the same device.  Some people know it better by one name over the other, so I included both, though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out.  Moving on, it's been pointed out that **[TTYs/TDDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_devices_for_the_deaf)** are an ""outdated technology.""  For the most part, this is true.  A D/HH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other D/HH friends/family members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place.  However, not all D/HH people know sign language.  As such, these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls.  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls, they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the D/HH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that D/HH person.  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the D/HH person as if they were speaking to that person directly.  So, it’s the same idea as calling 911 on a VRS call, but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign.

* **Captioned Telephones-** If you still use a landline telephone, you can use a **[CapTel](http://captel.com/)** phone, which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss (usually a Hard-of-Hearing person and not a Deaf person).  Basically, you’ll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed.  Using speech recognition software, everything being spoken by the person you’re calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone (similar to subtitles on a TV) with the silent operator’s ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software.  Recently, Sprint created a **[CapTel mobile app](http://www.sprintcaptel.com/wireless-captel-sprint)** so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline.  Same principle as using the Text/Video Relay Services, but you won’t have an operator talking for you.  You’ll be talking for yourself, so less delay in 911 calls.

* **Text Messages -** This is still in the works.  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to 911 because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if you’re a victim of attack and trying to hide (e.g., school shootings, muggings, home robberies, rape, etc.), so this is extremely beneficial not only to D/HH, but also to hearing people as well.  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how **[Text-to-911](http://www.fcc.gov/text-to-911)** is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up &amp; running.  However, as /u/MastersInDisasters points out: SMS, as it is defined now, is NOT a reliable protocol. If possible, use voice 911.

I hope this information helps!

**TL;DR -** We have several options: Videophones, TTY/TDDs, Captioned Telephones, and Text Messages (limited locations only for texts but slowly expanding).

7cardcha,"Okay, so I know a fair bit about hardware but most of this is just compiled from a Google search. Some of this could be outdated or slightly wrong but I think it is fundamentally correct. 


The Xbox and the PS4 have virtually the same CPU(an 8 core AMD Jaguar), except the the Xbox is clocked slightly higher, 1.6GHZ vs 1.75 GHZ for the PS4. 


However the games on the Xbox will only have access to six cores, 90% of the GPU, and 5gb of memory(out of 8). I suspect that the PS4 has  some limitations like these as well, but I can't find any info on that. The PS4 doesn't have stuff like the Kinect though, so the limitations may be less.


Games are rarely CPU bound though. The GPU tends to have a hugely greater impact on performance for. According to RPS, 4 Jaguar cores have less then a quarter of the performance of a i5-3570K. This means that my fairly lowly i5-2320 destroys the CPU of a PS4 or Xbox. WTF? I don't even have a gaming computer.



As for the GPU, the PS4 has 0.52 more teraflops then the xbox. The PS4 also has some other advantages like more ROPs and stream processors. However the Xbox is clocked a little higher. I think it is pretty safe to say based on this alone that the PS4 has a fair bit more horsepower then the xbox. Check this out if you want to here more about those stream processors and ROPs. http://www.ign.com/blogs/finalverdict/2013/10/26/xbox-one-vs-playstation-4-hardware-and-specifications/


COD Ghosts also runs at 720p on the Xbox, as compared to 1080p on the PS4.


The PS4's standard memory is wayyyyyyyyyyyy better then the Xbox's. The catch is that the Xbox also has 32 MB of ESRAM. This is the part I'm not sure about. Sorry. I'd have to assume it makes them pretty much equal, except the ESRAM might be harder to utilize.

The Xbox supposedly has a better audio processor, taking a load off the CPU. Little bit of difference. 


Overall I think the PS4 wins.

OldFatMonica,"For the most part, yes, dogs do like to be rubbed and pet. However, it is a common misconception that every dog wants this kind of affection.

Just like people, some dogs prefer lots of affection and others are more independent or prefer to express themselves in a different manner. So, how can you tell if a dog is interested? You look for body language cues. See the following video for a really good idea on canine consent: 

http://youtu.be/-cGDYI-s-cQ

As a shelter manager, I strive for a no-bite environment. Educating my staff and the volunteer population on body language is the number one way to prevent bites and to begin to understand what's going on in your pup's head.

Given that you and a dog have a good rapport already established, dogs like pets and rubs for the same reason you do. It feels good, it's a reinforcer, it's soothing, and relaxing. Aside from that it's a direct form of communication which can tell you a lot about your relationship. For example: 

(1) Your dog comes to you and you scratch behind his ear for 3 seconds.  

*  Your dog is telling you that he trusts you and appreciates your company

(2) When you stop, your dog stares at your face and gently places his snout under your hand.

*  He's telling you that you're doing a great job, you should probably never stop. 

This seems silly, but it's very significant because this is actual communication which suggests the dog's understanding of human behavior and social cues.

Good job on letting the media get to you, OP. Let's debunk this right away, shall we?

There are 4,156 Walmarts in USA. Let's be conservative and say that only 4,000 of them do black friday.

According to [this](http://blackfridaydeathcount.com), there have only been 4 deaths and 75 injuries since black friday started in 2006, 7 years ago. 2 of those deaths were due to a shooting, not technically black friday's fault.

So we have 2 deaths and 75 injuries over 7 years of black fridays. That's .29 deaths a year and 10.7 injuries a year. Spread out among the 4000 walmarts, that's 0.0000725 deaths per walmart a year and 0.002675 injuries per walmart a year.

This is an unfortunate game theory problem that motivates these companies:  Their primary goal is to generate the most revenue.  And this is not *new* revenue in the sense of companies that produce new products or services, but revenue from the same fixed pie (WalMart, etc are all fighting for the same consumer for the same product.)   If everyone opened at the same time on Friday, the total amount sold would be equivalent. However by opening one hour before your competitor, you get some of his slice of the pie.  And so on, until suddenly we don't enjoy Thanksgiving at all and minimum wage staff is made to suffer so the WalMart heirs can by another yacht.

Another area this same problem arises is the minimum wage:  Almost all serious economists agree that if companies suddenly increased wages (disproportionally at the bottom) - say, raising the minimum to $12/hr - it would greatly benefit the economy.  But if your competitor doesn't do it and you do, it hurts you in the short term (and possibly you go under) because your employees make more, but don't necessarily spend it at your store.

Good job on letting the media get to you, OP. Let's debunk this right away, shall we?

There are 4,156 Walmarts in USA. Let's be conservative and say that only 4,000 of them do black friday.

According to [this](http://blackfridaydeathcount.com), there have only been 4 deaths and 75 injuries since black friday started in 2006, 7 years ago. 2 of those deaths were due to a shooting, not technically black friday's fault.

So we have 2 deaths and 75 injuries over 7 years of black fridays. That's .29 deaths a year and 10.7 injuries a year. Spread out among the 4000 walmarts, that's 0.0000725 deaths per walmart a year and 0.002675 injuries per walmart a year.

doctorrobotica,"Because corporate profit is more important than civilization.   This is an unfortunate game theory problem that motivates these companies:  Their primary goal is to generate the most revenue.  And this is not *new* revenue in the sense of companies that produce new products or services, but revenue from the same fixed pie (WalMart, etc are all fighting for the same consumer for the same product.)   If everyone opened at the same time on Friday, the total amount sold would be equivalent. However by opening one hour before your competitor, you get some of his slice of the pie.  And so on, until suddenly we don't enjoy Thanksgiving at all and minimum wage staff is made to suffer so the WalMart heirs can by another yacht.

Another area this same problem arises is the minimum wage:  Almost all serious economists agree that if companies suddenly increased wages (disproportionally at the bottom) - say, raising the minimum to $12/hr - it would greatly benefit the economy.  But if your competitor doesn't do it and you do, it hurts you in the short term (and possibly you go under) because your employees make more, but don't necessarily spend it at your store.

Most producers can use multiple DAWs and are accustomed to the varying workflows. These DAWs are computer programs that are able to pipe in/out sounds all throughout the computer. Basically, you can put a sound into the DAW, hit play, and hear it out your speakers. The DAW is also used to sequence the sounds together. The sequencer is laid out like a timeline and tells the computer when to play certain instruments or sounds. In modern day electronic music, there can be many many layers and sounds to organize in the sequencer.

Artists get their sounds and instruments from various sources. Some instruments are recorded live (guitar, keyboard etc) and then processed with effects and such. Other sounds come as ""samples"". These are short bits of sound ripped from other recordings. Samples can be vocal lines (YES, OH MY GOD!), snare drums, kicks drums, laser blipts, just about anything. Producers love to collect and share samples. I'm quite fond of my sample collection. Other sounds are synthesized via synthesizers! Synthesizers can either be analogue (hands on) or digital (it's in the computer... It's so simple). These synthesizers manipulate different wave forms by subtracting and adding to the waveform. Crafty producers can make awesome wobble bass, thick trance leads, and even realistic and hard hitting drum sounds. 

Artists get these sounds to play via MIDI within the sequencer. MIDI is the information that tells the computer what sound to play, when to play it, how long to play it, and how hard to play it. Lets say I have a big Saw wave synth that I want to play a Db note every 2 beats. I would have to go to my sequencer, find the Saw wave synth section, and put in a Db note every two beats. I would do a similar process for every time I wanted the kick drum to hit, snare, blipt synth, etc. 

In short, the artists collect their sounds and organize them in a DAW sequencer which plays out the arrangement in real time.

t0mbstone,"Basically, due to its shape, it's easier for a boat to move forwards in the water than for it to move sideways.

This means that if you point the boat into the wind, but at an angle, the wind ends up blowing the boat sideways. The boat doesn't want to move sideways, though, so it ends up sliding both sideways and towards the angle it's pointed at.

This enables you to move forwards (and sideways) across the wind. By changing your angle to the opposite direction every so often, you can essentially zig-zag your way towards a destination, even if it's up-wind.

beerMonger11,"No sailboat can sail directly into the wind. But most modern boats can sail at about a 45 degree angle into the wind. 

Essentially sailboats have 2 wings on them. One in the air and one in the water (the centerboard or keel). Both of them are very important to making the boat move upwind. The sail itself uses lift from the wind going around the sail, to pull itself up. Think about blowing over a piece of paper. The paper will move upwards towards the moving air. This is basically how the sail works.

The other wing, the keel or centerboard, does the same thing, only at a 90 degree angle to the force of the sail. You get an apparent motion in line with the length of the boat. 

You mentioned the boats in AC4. Those are mostly the square sailed kind, which basically only went downwind, and used different trade winds to get where they wanted to go.

It's an application of Bernoulli's Principle. The way it was usually explained to me is that the sail is like a vertical plane's wing. The curvature if the sail means that the air on one side has more distance to cover than the air on the other side in the same time. This creates ""sideways"" lift that pulls the boat into the wind.

plasticluthier,"I'll explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about 12;

Three sets of forces are happening while you're sailing a boat. 

* 1. You have the wind pushing on the sail.
* 2. You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind.
* 3. The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shape.

Now, when you're sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry. If you squeeze directly from the sides, the cherry stone wont go anywhere, but if you squeeze from the back, the stone will come out of the front. It's the same with sailing, the wind pushes on the sails, the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards. Now, you can't sail straight into the wind, the forces wouldn't balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise, backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too. So, to balance all the forces, you zig-zag into the wind, turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn. This is called tacking.

t0mbstone,"Basically, due to its shape, it's easier for a boat to move forwards in the water than for it to move sideways.

This means that if you point the boat into the wind, but at an angle, the wind ends up blowing the boat sideways. The boat doesn't want to move sideways, though, so it ends up sliding both sideways and towards the angle it's pointed at.

This enables you to move forwards (and sideways) across the wind. By changing your angle to the opposite direction every so often, you can essentially zig-zag your way towards a destination, even if it's up-wind.

beerMonger11,"No sailboat can sail directly into the wind. But most modern boats can sail at about a 45 degree angle into the wind. 

Essentially sailboats have 2 wings on them. One in the air and one in the water (the centerboard or keel). Both of them are very important to making the boat move upwind. The sail itself uses lift from the wind going around the sail, to pull itself up. Think about blowing over a piece of paper. The paper will move upwards towards the moving air. This is basically how the sail works.

The other wing, the keel or centerboard, does the same thing, only at a 90 degree angle to the force of the sail. You get an apparent motion in line with the length of the boat. 

You mentioned the boats in AC4. Those are mostly the square sailed kind, which basically only went downwind, and used different trade winds to get where they wanted to go.

plasticluthier,"I'll explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about 12;

Three sets of forces are happening while you're sailing a boat. 

* 1. You have the wind pushing on the sail.
* 2. You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind.
* 3. The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shape.

Now, when you're sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry. If you squeeze directly from the sides, the cherry stone wont go anywhere, but if you squeeze from the back, the stone will come out of the front. It's the same with sailing, the wind pushes on the sails, the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards. Now, you can't sail straight into the wind, the forces wouldn't balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise, backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too. So, to balance all the forces, you zig-zag into the wind, turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn. This is called tacking. 

Now, sails are tight in when you're going into the wind, completely out when you're going away from the wind and pulled in until they stop flapping at all other points. generally, the position of the centreboard matches the position of the sails.

&gt;The oldest known source for the expression ""baker's dozen"" dates to the 13th century in one of the earliest English statutes, instituted during the reign of Henry III (1216–72), called the Assize of Bread and Ale. Bakers who were found to have shortchanged customers (some variations say that they would sell hollow bread) could be subject to severe punishment including judicial amputation of a hand. To guard against losing a hand to an axe, a baker would give 13 for the price of 12 in order to be certain of not being known as a cheat. Specifically, the practice of baking 13 items for an intended dozen was insurance against ""short measure"", on the basis that one of the 13 could be lost, eaten, burnt, or ruined in some way, leaving the baker with the original legal dozen.",null,0,cdpg8a2,1rp356,explainlikeimfive,top_day,5

NerdBell,"I'm surprised no one's given this answer yet, so here goes:

Congratulations! You're using a lot more of your lungs than you used to. While you're running, you're building up an oxygen debt as your muscles start to use more and more oxygen than you've asked them to in the past, and your lungs are struggling to keep up. As a result, you start really expanding your chest muscles -- does this sound familiar? This can be where side stitches come from. 

However, your lungs are really only used to taking in so much oxygen. Chances are when you're just sitting around during the day, or walking places, you only take very shallow breaths. The alveoli at the bottom of your lungs don't see much action and they get lazy, but when you start taking deep, heaving breaths you start to use them -- and they don't like that very much. 

This can happen regardless of whether it's cold or warm outside, and regardless of whether you're breathing in through your mouth and out through your nose or what have you (and for the record, I'm pretty sure you can breath through whichever orifices you choose [er, within reason] and breath out through whichever orifices you choose [again, choose wisely] as long as you're getting enough breath. Some people recommend breathing through both your nose and your mouth!)

In either case, it really just means that you're helping your lungs gain capacity. I would suggest looking up some breathing exercises online, being really conscious of how deeply you breathe during your day, and most importantly, keep running. :)

**I thought you were referring to a burning sensation in your legs before you tire. Oops.**



I'm not an expert, but I think you're referring to the effects of the build up of lactic acid.

As I understand it, when your body can't deliver enough oxygen to your muscles, it temporarily forms ""lactate"" which helps break down glucose and give you energy. 

However, one of the downfalls of this process is that you'll eventually experience increased acidity levels in your muscle cells (hence, lactic acid). Now, the whole process doesn't work very well in acidic environments, so the whole process is hindered and this is where you'll tend to get that muscle fatigue feeling. This is all done as a natural mechanism to prevent muscle damage caused by over-exertion. 

Once your body slows down, oxygen becomes more available and the whole system sort of reverses itself and everything is back to normal.

TL;DR: When oxygen is limited, your body resorts to other means that provide a temporary fix, but this process naturally halts and reverses itself before the quick fix causes any permanent damage.

NerdBell,"I'm surprised no one's given this answer yet, so here goes:

Congratulations! You're using a lot more of your lungs than you used to. While you're running, you're building up an oxygen debt as your muscles start to use more and more oxygen than you've asked them to in the past, and your lungs are struggling to keep up. As a result, you start really expanding your chest muscles -- does this sound familiar? This can be where side stitches come from. 

However, your lungs are really only used to taking in so much oxygen. Chances are when you're just sitting around during the day, or walking places, you only take very shallow breaths. The alveoli at the bottom of your lungs don't see much action and they get lazy, but when you start taking deep, heaving breaths you start to use them -- and they don't like that very much. 

This can happen regardless of whether it's cold or warm outside, and regardless of whether you're breathing in through your mouth and out through your nose or what have you (and for the record, I'm pretty sure you can breath through whichever orifices you choose [er, within reason] and breath out through whichever orifices you choose [again, choose wisely] as long as you're getting enough breath. Some people recommend breathing through both your nose and your mouth!)

In either case, it really just means that you're helping your lungs gain capacity. I would suggest looking up some breathing exercises online, being really conscious of how deeply you breathe during your day, and most importantly, keep running. :)

Captainsuperdawg,"If it happens in cold weather, it could be simply from the cold air, especially if you're breathing through your mouth. The cold dry air doesn't warm up through your mouth, but it does through your nose.

MINTBERRYcrunch2,"For me I noticed this lung burning happened when I did not properly warm up my lungs to the air intake required during running which is more than when standing still, sitting, or walking. A slow jog before running will raise your heart rate and breathing rate steadily rather than jumping right up to a running pace. This will allow for a more controlled and comfortable run letting your body reach it's maximum potential (the legs tiring in this instance). This is why warming up and cooling down is so crucial to a good work out or run.",null,1,cdpjus9,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,top_day,9
fouzzz,"**EDIT: Totally misread your question but I already typed this all up, so I'll leave it for whoever is interested.**

**I thought you were referring to a burning sensation in your legs before you tire. Oops.**



I'm not an expert, but I think you're referring to the effects of the build up of lactic acid.

As I understand it, when your body can't deliver enough oxygen to your muscles, it temporarily forms ""lactate"" which helps break down glucose and give you energy. 

However, one of the downfalls of this process is that you'll eventually experience increased acidity levels in your muscle cells (hence, lactic acid). Now, the whole process doesn't work very well in acidic environments, so the whole process is hindered and this is where you'll tend to get that muscle fatigue feeling. This is all done as a natural mechanism to prevent muscle damage caused by over-exertion. 

Once your body slows down, oxygen becomes more available and the whole system sort of reverses itself and everything is back to normal.

TL;DR: When oxygen is limited, your body resorts to other means that provide a temporary fix, but this process naturally halts and reverses itself before the quick fix causes any permanent damage.

everytime i run, even if it is just one minute to catch the bus or something, my lungs burn really bad and i have the felling that my heart pounds directly in my throat.
it takes a solid 10 minutes to get better.

i have been in a great shape running, doing all kinds of sports.
but then i was in a hospital for a week after having a Pneumomediastinum.

which is basically air leaking out of your lungs to places where they don't belong.
in my case it was near my heart or something.
i got an Intravenous therapy for a couple days until they released me from hospital.

they never found a cause for this in my case.

but since then my stamina is super low and i can't do sports really well.
no martial arts anymore. no running. nothing where i jump or something.

sir_sri,"&gt; Why can't they just SAY ""Check system time""?

Because the line of code that failed doesn't know that the problem is that your system time is wrong.  When you do a search for error codes or when you go look at the MS knowledge base you're looking at common causes for an error.

But when you write code you have something like this

If some condition is true (do whatever is supposed to happen).

If not, throw off an error code that indicated this condition failed.  

The solution to the problem is to figure out what caused the condition to be wrong in the first place, but then, maybe it's *supposed* to be wrong some of the time.  


Software is a series of complex interlocking systems, particularly operating systems where you have thousands of programmers who have worked for years.  The guy doing a software update is checking to see if time time is valid, the guy who wrote the clock software 5 years ago did so with whatever his assumptions were (that time servers would be accessible for example).  

Enter you trying to update.  The programmer who wrote the update only knows how to check that the time is valid or not, he has no way to peak into the time keeping code to know that the problem was some time sync failed, and that caused his time to be wrong.  He just knows the time is wrong, and there are a lot of potential reasons for that.

The ASVAB is a test that measures how good you are in various areas, i.e., verbal skills, mechanical systems, math, etc.  Each area gets a score and each job has minimum scores in one or two of these areas.  There's also an ""overall"" score that determines if you're even able to join the military, amongst other things.  Each branch has its own minimum for this overall score, so even if you don't score high enough to join the airforce, you may be able to join the army or marines.

Assuming the recruit qualifies to join the branch of service, the recruiter then gives them a list of jobs they qualify for, based on their ""line scores"", the scores from each area tested.  The recruit then picks one of these jobs and starts training for basic.  After basic, they go to the school for whatever job they chose.

This is one of the first places where the enlisted side diverges from the officer side.  Enlisted soldiers pick their specific job.  Officers pick three branches (such as transportation, medical, communications, etc.) and ""the needs of the Army/Navy/Marines..."" determines which branch they get assigned to (that is, if an officer's first choice is full, the military will look at their second and third choices).  Officers are expected to adapt wherever they go, even if they didn't get the job they really wanted, whereas enlisteds get the specific job they signed up for.

computervirologist,"Computer viruses fall under the category of malware, or malicious software. Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware, a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs. 

A computer virus is usually an executable file that, when executed, will usually perform the following tasks: 

* search for other files on the computer
* if the file is a program, copy the virus's code to that program
* execute a payload (which may or may not be destructive)

Once a program gets a virus's code injected into it, it becomes an infected program. An infected program, when executed, will run the virus code first before running the original code of the program.

Since viruses only infect files when they're executed, they rely on user interaction in order to spread. Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus, any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now. Keep in mind though, that unless the virus has elevated privileges, it can only infect programs that the current user has write-access to. 

An anti-virus virus is a program that spreads like a virus, but when it's code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it. Think of it like a chain: virus, anti-virus virus, original program. First the virus code will run, then the anti-virus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it, then the original program will run. Anti-virus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used. 

Besides viruses, there are also computer trojans, spyware, ransomware, backdoors, worms, and fork bombs.

Trojans are rogue programs, they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else. For example, many trojan programs ironically claim to be anti-virus software, but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malware.

Spyware is any program that collects users' personal data without their knowledge and consent. Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user. In fact, many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature. 

ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom. Cryptolocker, for example, will encrypt the user's files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files. The password for decryption is stored on the hacker's computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up. 

backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker. Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet. A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person, usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down. 

A worm is an autonomous computer virus. Unlike computer viruses, worms do not require human interaction in order to spread. Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading. When a worm is running on a computer, it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as it's host. It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers. Once it finds a host with vulnerable software, the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer. 

Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship. Multiple viruses may infect a worm, allowing the viruses to be transported across networks. Once the worm reaches a destination, the viruses copy themselves to that machine too. You can think of the viruses as piggy-back riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate. Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated worm.

Finally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb. Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources. The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive, requiring a hard reboot. If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads, the computer will crash every time it is turned on. The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up, is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system.

computervirologist,"Computer viruses fall under the category of malware, or malicious software. Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware, a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs. 

A computer virus is usually an executable file that, when executed, will usually perform the following tasks: 

* search for other files on the computer
* if the file is a program, copy the virus's code to that program
* execute a payload (which may or may not be destructive)

Once a program gets a virus's code injected into it, it becomes an infected program. An infected program, when executed, will run the virus code first before running the original code of the program.

Since viruses only infect files when they're executed, they rely on user interaction in order to spread. Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus, any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now. Keep in mind though, that unless the virus has elevated privileges, it can only infect programs that the current user has write-access to. 

An anti-virus virus is a program that spreads like a virus, but when it's code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it. Think of it like a chain: virus, anti-virus virus, original program. First the virus code will run, then the anti-virus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it, then the original program will run. Anti-virus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used. 

Besides viruses, there are also computer trojans, spyware, ransomware, backdoors, worms, and fork bombs.

Trojans are rogue programs, they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else. For example, many trojan programs ironically claim to be anti-virus software, but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malware.

Spyware is any program that collects users' personal data without their knowledge and consent. Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user. In fact, many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature. 

ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom. Cryptolocker, for example, will encrypt the user's files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files. The password for decryption is stored on the hacker's computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up. 

backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker. Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet. A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person, usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down. 

A worm is an autonomous computer virus. Unlike computer viruses, worms do not require human interaction in order to spread. Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading. When a worm is running on a computer, it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as it's host. It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers. Once it finds a host with vulnerable software, the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer. 

Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship. Multiple viruses may infect a worm, allowing the viruses to be transported across networks. Once the worm reaches a destination, the viruses copy themselves to that machine too. You can think of the viruses as piggy-back riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate. Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated worm.

Finally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb. Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources. The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive, requiring a hard reboot. If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads, the computer will crash every time it is turned on. The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up, is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system.

v-_-v,"What /u/burrowowl is correct, and because these monopolies / oligopolies are quite legally cleaver and have the ear of many in government (since they are so freaking huge) that they end up getting away with many of what are fundamentally illegal activities.

Just like there is murder, manslaughter, and whoopsie daisies, there are many ways to interpret a law and many ways to enforce them.

Here is where the government has a fundamental role in making sure these anti-competitive behaviors are not tolerated, but they are a mix of ignorant, unwilling and indisposed.

The result is the current clusterfuck of a situation with media (and other) companies in the US (and in other countries).

There are so many examples of abuses going on nearly every day, but the government seems to really not care much at all.

Just this week it comes out that Bell Mobility (Canadian telecom company) is marking up the price of competing online content by 800% ([explanation](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/11/26/bell-mobility-net-neutrality_n_4338654.html)).

Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T and others have been throttling connections to media hubs like Youtube and Netflix for years. Verizon wants to make people and the companies running these sites pay more to access these media sites as well.

The conflict of interest in this all is just baffling that nothing is being really done.

diMario,"Quantum mechanics, or more broadly quantum physics, studies matter on the level of elementary particles. It turns out that strange things happen when you dig down to a smaller and smaller scale of things.

For instance, electric things. In everyday life you can have a light bulb rating 60 Watt, 40 Watt, 25 Watt and so on. If Philips were so inclined, they could easily make a light bulb rating 41.5 watt or 7.89 Watt. In every day life, things happen on a sliding scale. A certain property can have a value of 1, or a value of 2, or any other value in between 1 and 2.

Not so in quantum physics. When you look at things in a smaller and smaller scale, the properties that you measure take on distinct values. For electric current for instance, you can measure a flow of 1 unit of charge per second, or you can measure a flow of 2 units of charge per second, *but you cannot measure a unit of 1.5 charge per second*.

This is explained by theorizing that electric charge in everyday life is made up by the sum of a bunch of very small but distinct elementary electric charges of which you can have either 1, or 2, but not one and a half.

In order to describe this phenomenon, physicists say that electric charge is *quantized* (from which comes the ""quantum"" part of the name).

Now, as it turns out, not only electric charge but practically all properties of matter that you care to study exhibit this behaviour.

One of the (theoretical) consequences is that when speaking about properties on the quantum scale of things, you cannot deal in certainties but only in probabilities. When I perform a thousand measurements in a certain quantum physical experiment, I'll find that roughly 300 times the outcome is 5, and 700 times the outcome is 9. But when I perform a single measurement, I cannot predict whether the outcome is 5 or 9. Weird, isn't it?

Quantum physics solves this weirdness by assuming that before the measurement, the property I am about to measure is *5 and 9, both at the same time*. Only after I have measured it, the quantum system ""has decided"" whether it was 5 or 9.

This means that only *after* I observe a system, the system ""decides"" what value it will show me. Thus it is said that reality (the value of the property) is influenced by observation (the fact that I measure it).

What is light? Some people, such as Newton, believed that light was made of tiny particles (corpuscles) that were fired off by the light source. This explains why light goes in a straight line, and how it is reflected off surfaces at the same angle. But this does not explain how light is refracted (through a prism, for example). Why would some particles bend more than others? This could be corrected for by assuming that these corpuscles speed up when passing through glass. Still, there are other phenomena that the particle theory does not describe, such as diffraction.

---

Eventually, physicists came to support a different theory of light. Instead of discrete particles, light was a wave. Not like a water wave though, this wave only moved tranversely, like [so](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Electromagneticwave3D.gif). This explained light much better than the particle theory. 

The most striking example is in diffraction. Imagine you have a solid sheet of metal with two slits cut in it, a sensor screen some ways behind it, and you shine a light onto this [contraption](http://www.empiricalzeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/double-slit-box1.jpg). If light were a particle, you should see two bars on the sensor, like [this](http://stephenwhitt.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/double-slit-bullets.jpg?w=490), because the particles go through and continue going straight. However, if light were a wave, the sensor would have [a more complicated pattern](http://grad.physics.sunysb.edu/~amarch/int.gif), because the waves [interfere with each other](http://www.atom.uni-frankfurt.de/research/synchrotron/photonmolecule/H2_double/3_double_slit/double-slit-plane-wave.gif). It turns out, when you do this experiment, that you get the interference pattern. Coupled with the fact that you can explain pretty much all properties of light, this theory is pretty convincing. So it's settled, light is a wave, right?

---

The challenge to this theory came from an unexpected direction. When you heat up an object, it emits light. And physicists had equations to predict how much light of a particular frequency. While these worked well for low frequencies, they predicted that objects emitted infinite energy in the higher ones. Clearly this is wrong. Planck showed that this problem does not occur if light comes in discrete quantities. Other properties, such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are also well described if light comes in lumps. So are we back to the particle theory again? If we are, how do we explain the double-slit experiment?

---

Let's go back to it again. If it is really a particle, then why does the interference pattern form? Say we place detectors at the slits. If light is a wave, then it'll trigger both. If it's a particle, it'll just trigger one. When we do this, we see that only one is triggered. So light is a particle! But when you check the screen, the interference pattern has disappeared, and two stripes show up instead! So we take away the detectors and try again. Now it reappears. If words don't cut it for you, watch [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Wave-particle_duality.ogv).

When we watch the slits, light behaves like particles. When we don't, it behaves like waves. How can we reconcile these two behaviors? The answer is: light behaves like some very unintuitive *thing*.

Quantum physics is the study of how on earth this works. This wave-particle duality only seems to show up for small objects (think on the scale of atoms). Some of the consequences of this include:

* Objects exist in a [superposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) of all possible states, weighted towards the more ""likely"" ones. Measuring the object collapses this superposition to a more defined state.
* The more [precisely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle) you measure the position of an object, the less you know about its momentum.
* Occasionally, objects can [tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling) across gaps or barriers that they otherwise could not cross.

If you're not able to suspend your disbelief, say the movie has set it up so they have warp drive and it takes 2 days to travel 1 light year but in the space of 5 minutes they travel across the entire galaxy, that's because the movie has set out its logic and then broken it without explanation.  It jars you out of being able to accept the premise.    

Edit - You might find too that the more you know about a topic the harder it becomes for you to suspend your disbelief when the premise of the movie, tv show, books, whatever, is using something you know and changing it to fit the story.

Antibiotic: anti = against, biotic = living organism. So something that is against living organisms.
Antiseptic: anti = against, septic (or sepsis) = infection caused by virus/bacteria. So antiseptic (antisepsis) = against something that causes infection by virus/bacteria.
Antibacterial: Anti = against, bacterial = bacteria. So against bacteria.
To make it simple, antibiotics are substances or compounds that are used in the body to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms; antiseptics are used on the body to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms; antibacterial agents are antiseptics that only kill bacteria.

It had to expand and cool a fair bit until the universe had cooled enough to allow for matter to come into existence from the converted energy. The first particles came about a few minutes after the initiation. Neutral stable atoms around 300,000 thousand of years later. 

No one really knows what came before and it is an area of intense research with a number of theories. Nothing in the existing universe can precede the Big Bang so the conditions that set it off are outside our experience, outside time and space. 

Some think that the universe began as a quantum fluctuation that was able to last long enough for the process of inflation start. Once that process began there was no way for the fluctuation to annihilate itself and you end up with this runaway inflation of the universe. This comes from the understanding that spacetime is in constant state of fluctuation. There are virtual particle appearing and disappearing all around us.

For example, why bacon is considered breakfast food, etc.  He proved that media is the best medium to propagate propaganda to get the ""bewildered herd"" to think or vote or spend ""as they should"".  He basically invented the psychological war that's going on as we speak.

Noam Chomsky talks about the theory of the ""bewildered herd"" as well in his book ""Media Control"".

Quick rundown:

1) If major arteries or connecting arterioles (Cerebral medial, posterior, anterior, basal or carotid) are hit, there is a high probability of death. If not, things get interesting:

2)If not, then its down to what brain matter is destroyed (And this is how researchers attributed function to area: 

Frontal lobe: Non life essential (See Patient Phineas Gage), destruction results in change of personality, executive function (higher moral, thought, rationalising and inhibition processes.

Temporal lobe ( lower side): Non life essential (See Patient: HM), destruction may result in loss of memory functions (hippocampus), loss or intensification of primal emotion (fear anger etc) (amygdala). 

If you drew a line from ear to ear along the top most point of your head, this is roughly (slightly more anteriorely) where the motoric and sensory cortex would be. Damage here results in loss of the ability to feel, or move.

Parietal lobe (top side): Non life essential, damage may lead to cognitive  changes, however its very possible that no obvious changes may be seen.

Occipital lobe (back of head): Non life essential, vision loss.

Deep brain (Di-encephalon, Mes encephalon etc.) and brainstem.
Traumatic damage here is almost certainly deadly. 

Most important life functions are breathing, arousal, and decending motoric tracts. 

3)
Lastly, infection is a major concern. High dose Antibiotic (probably broad spectrum) is necessary.

TLDR: 1) If you dont pop a major artery, 2) You can hit non life-essential brain matter and 3) Survive infection, you can survive a shot to the brain and not die.",null,9,cdpjjq5,1rpdhm,explainlikeimfive,top_day,83

YourDoubt,"Actually, the very 'front' is the most 'losable' part of brain tissue to keep you 'alive,' to say nothing of the Circle of Willis (which is more at the base of the 'front'). The Brainstem is typically where the respiratory and other vital maintenance areas are, if you take this out, you will definitely die. An interesting example of losing a large chunk of the Frontal lobe is [Phineas Gage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage). 

What is important to note is that the brain is incredibly vasculated, if you knock out a vessel (which is likely), you not only have to deal with the blood loss to vital regions of the brain, but the blood itself is incredibly neurotoxic, and before that, you have to deal with inter cranial pressure(of course if you have a bullet wound, you likely have a shunt already formed for the blood to come out.) Also, you have to understand that some bullets can create a shockwave of force that can travel through the body itself and cause damage in areas not local to wound itself. There is also the issue of the brain having a completely different immune system, so you may have to deal with an incredible infection.


So, to recap, if you survive the trauma of bloodloss, toxic damage from blood and intracrainial, avoid widespread tissue damage from the bullet traveling through the brain and bouncing around(this can happen with .22 caliber bullets, its a not uncommon method of execution in the underworld of our society), have ALL the bullet fragments miss your medulla you could survive.

The bones themselves contains no nerves. (Aside from the spine, but that's different, as the spinal column isn't a single bone, but many discs stacked on one another, hollow on the inside so that the spinal nerve can be protected and flexibility is still possible.)

As far as anecdotal experience is concerned, you know for certain if you have a broken bone just by the pain alone. It starts as a very intense stabbing feeling at the point of the fracture. Inflammation occurs rapidly, resulting in swelling, and a throbbing ache as the surrounding tissue attempts to stabilize the bones. My hand injury had to be treated with an Open Reduction, Internal Fixation (ORIF) technique, where an orthopedic surgeon had to make an incision into the back of my hand, reduce the fracture so that the two bone fragments were aligned properly, then insert a steel pin inside the bone to keep the two pieces together while they healed.

redrew89,"I had a commuted fracture of the third metacarpal of my left hand back in April. In my experience, the point of the fracture is the origin point of the pain. (And boy, did it hurt like a bitch.) As mentioned by /u/_Momotsuki and others, the pain is actually caused by the nerve fiber that runs the length of the bone, carrying impulses to the muscles along said bone, and returning sensory information back to the brain. The bones themselves contains no nerves. (Aside from the spine, but that's different, as the spinal column isn't a single bone, but many discs stacked on one another, hollow on the inside so that the spinal nerve can be protected and flexibility is still possible.)

As far as anecdotal experience is concerned, you know for certain if you have a broken bone just by the pain alone. It starts as a very intense stabbing feeling at the point of the fracture. Inflammation occurs rapidly, resulting in swelling, and a throbbing ache as the surrounding tissue attempts to stabilize the bones. My hand injury had to be treated with an Open Reduction, Internal Fixation (ORIF) technique, where an orthopedic surgeon had to make an incision into the back of my hand, reduce the fracture so that the two bone fragments were aligned properly, then insert a steel pin inside the bone to keep the two pieces together while they healed.

j_guazu,"&gt;But couldn't you just pretend to be Christian or Atheist?

The religious beliefs of the Jews weren't what the Nazis despised - it was their ethnic identity. A non-practicing Jew was still a Jew, a convert to Christianity was still a Jew. It was your ethnicity that you'd have to hide, and that would be altogether more difficult.
 
People in Nazi-controlled areas were rigorously documented, and several of the states that Germany invaded already had very thorough civil records which were used by the Germans to quickly identify the Jewish population. There was a history of Jewish segregation in Europe anyway, so your Jewish identity would be very likely to appear on your paperwork.

Add to that the fact that anti-Semitism was not a uniquely German thing, there were plenty of gentiles across occupied Europe who would have little problem pointing out which families were Jewish in their community. Even for those who had no problem with the Jews, if a group of SS soldiers turned up in your village and demanded to know who was Jewish, you could either lie and risk you and your family's safety, or identify them and make things easier for yourself.

&gt; did they just decide to kill everyone in France or Poland.

France no, Poland sort of. Poland was going to be part of the Third Reich's *Lebensraum* (living space), so it was planned to reduce and relocate the native population to make way for German settlement.

tl;dr: It would be very hard to pretend to be non-Jewish because good beaurocracy meant that everyone was documented and Jews generally lived in sectioned off communities.

yakusokuN8,"First of all, before answering any of the questions, let me emphasize that the things that non-Americans see are highly atypical and not representative of what happens everywhere.  There's 300 million or so of us, and if you see 300 people acting crazed, that's one person in a million.  You aren't seeing the vast majority of the other calmer, bored, tired shoppers who wait patiently in long lines in stores where nothing happens.  These things don't make the news.  

&gt;In such videos, people always seem to be grabbing items at random. Is this true? Or do they have specific items in mind?

In the videos you see, they probably aren't grabbing things randomly, but there's so many people, that it's hard to calmly make your way through the crowd and tapping someone on the shoulder and saying, ""pardon me, can you pass me one of those?""  They most likely have items in mind, but the craziest people seeking out the best deals are usually after expensive, large items, like television sets and it's difficult to just grab one of the shelf, tuck it under your arm and get out of the way.

&gt;If they're grabbing items at random (just because they're 'cheap'), what is the rationale behind that? Do people grab and buy lots of things they don't even actually want?

This sometimes happens, but it's far from the norm.

&gt;If people aren't grabbing items at random, do they decide before-hand? Do places like Walmart advertise, let's say, iPads as 20% off, and then the riots happen because everyone had a pre-meditated goal to grab that one particular item?

Oh God, does Walmart advertise.  I was over at my parent's place on Thanksgiving night and within one hour of watching a football game, I must have seen 6 Walmart ads, no exaggeration.  We get ads in the mail, ads in the newspaper, and ads on radio and television nonstop for days.  It's really impossible not to know that there are stores having deals on Friday.  As you've noted, yes, often stores like Walmart will feature one big item that's normally $400, marked down to $200 and a few people every year get zealous about being the person to get it, because quantities are usually limited - just enough to get people excited and in the store, but not always enough for everyone to buy it who wants it.

&gt; Why are sales such a big deal to begin with? Sure, I like to save money as much as the next guy. But mostly I can't be bothered going out of my way for the sake of a sale. I don't mind paying a bit more money for the sake of convenience - even though I only work part-time and have a low income.

I'm not justifying the kind of crazy behavior that makes the news in other parts of the world about us, but it's not just a little more, at least percentage.  Some items are marked down 50%, so if you don't get it now, you will be paying literally double if you go a week later.  In the case of the really expensive things, this can mean a few hundred dollars and for many who don't earn much, this may mean a lot of hours.  If you earn $10/hr, $200 off a tv is half a week's pay.

&gt;what makes Black Friday in the US so different to the equivalents in other countries? What inspires all the excitement?

Honestly, companies advertise for weeks, the media hypes it up to *create* a story, then *reports* a story, where it happens and makes it seem like it's a huge thing, and so what's normally less hectic than shopping on Christmas Eve has now become a major deal with huge crowds and chaos.

Don't think the U.S. is unique, though.  When H&amp;M stores were opening in Europe and other parts of the world, there were crowds lined up to the stores.

We have one of the biggest walmart in the area and it is always well stocked if you come early that is.

Anyway, much of this has to do with timing and expectation. You are out with your family in the cold and just want a nice Christmas present for your loved ones, but when you get to the location, you see piles of people. This often results in a highly competitive instinct to get what you have came for.

What shows are people's expectation that they come away with something to show for it.

Last night, i did most of my shopping at boscov and jc Penney (had to get some dress clothes for myself and brother in law) and it was pretty hectic.

We then decided to head down to the walmart next to the mall, and we weren't able to get anything worth our trip. Thankfully we didn't have to travel a long way, but for families that want that special something, it is not unusual that they go crazy.

For your point about other countries, you haven't really been to Singapore during one of those computer expos or that great Singapore sale, have you? I have seen grandmas fighting over a silk blouse.. It is not an usual occurrence as you make it sound to be.

Get the price of popular items extremely low, have very limited quantities and advertise the heck out of it so that everyone knows about that Ipad that comes with a $100 dollars gift card or that $98 tv... and have a sufficiently large population in a small area.

From my experience,  people are rarely violent... I've never seen anything bad. That being said, there is a definite rush for the good deals.

Then stores started having sales to encourage people to come out, often featuring ""early bird"" type specials with limited numbers of the product.

That caused folks to line up to be first in to the store and local news channels began covering it to fill empty holiday broadcasts.

Once a couple of people got trampled to death in the door opening onslaught more and more attention was paid to the entire day. Then we Americans made it bigger and better each year until it reached the ridiculous level of today.

QuickSpore,"As an American, I share your confusion. But here is the what... I can't explain the root why.

Thanksgiving is one of the BIG holidays here in the US. And it is the last one before Christmas. So traditionally the Christmas season and Christmas shopping starts after Thanksgiving.

Over the years stores have pushed big sales to capture the early shoppers. And they started to offer a handful of incredibly discounted product. Like a $1,000 TV, for $250. But they would only have like 5 of them in a store. The idea being that people would come to try and get the TV, but they would buy another TV instead... or enough other stuff to cover for the loss on the TV.

Over time the sales have gotten bigger and crazier. Now it is almost a holiday in of itself. But most of them are not like the near riots you see. Most are just crowded stores. And I would guess that most Americans don't participate in Black Friday at all. I for one don't.

NightMaestro,"All of the ideologies aside, from whatever fucking philosophical judgements are made about American consumerism,

Imagine this big huge gift you could buy someone is normally like 1000$. It's an awesome flat screen. Your family finally has hit the income bracket to afford these kinds of luxuries. You guys love your tv. You want to splurge. You are not necessarily materialistic people, but the finer things in life are always good. Infact, one of the best things in your life are sitting down with your wife of 20 years, putting the kids to sleep, and smoking some weed /drinking beers and watching doccumentaries like frozen planet from the discovery channel. It's an amazing fucking show in HD. You finally get the chance to get a theatre in your room. Who wouldn't want that shit?! You worked for it! Sit with your sexy wife and enjoy your awesome hd expirience, you've earned it.

So at first this tv is 1000$.

The store markets this tv for 250 now on this day because they want people to buy shit, and of course once that shit is out, you buy the 700$ tv because you still wanted a tv in the first place. It's a marketing scheme. But this is not usual in the world of consumerism we have today. No company releases this shit  at such a low price besides this day. I remember when one of my coworkers got all 3 lord of the rings movies from a different store for 5 bucks! In blu ray! I would say that's awesome considering normally you would have to spend a lot more.

Now, would you push a few random people out of the way to grab an awesome TV and save 250$? Yes it is consumerism, but think about it this way. Money is money. You worked your ass off for this, for going through school, going through the hardest of times, to finally get this amount of income. Like I said, it's your money. You use it to pay bills. If you had to pay 1000$ as apposed to 250, guess which one anyone would choose.

I'm sorry but I am sure as shit going to push motherfuckers out of the way if I get to keep 250$ in my pocket, and 750$ saved I will rush in like a mad man. Why? Because its fucking money saved!!!

There isn't some damn horrid dystopian ideologies americans are bred with, it's fucking capitalism. We live in a world where money is money., and as pink Floyd put it, it's the root of all evil today. 

Make what you will with it, but when shit has the possibility to cost a lot less, people will go for it. It's just how the consumer system is set up.

But others have explained this stuff. I'm here to demonstrate it. 

Most iPods have an accessibility setting to make both earphones play the same thing. On iOS, you can find it in Settings &gt;General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Mono Audio. Enable it with functional headphones, and you'll notice a substantial difference. It also serves as a 'fix' when one of your earphones breaks. Or, if you want to use it as intended, when you go deaf in one ear.

EDIT: Buuut... quick question. When you say you can only hear select layers of a song, does that include having the main vocals getting (mostly) stripped out of (most) songs? Because that's usually what signals the end of my ear-buds, and it's a different issue entirely. ",null,0,cdplrrp,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

danpaquette,"&gt; What happens after a company forgets to renew their domain name? 

Once the domain expires, it enters a renewal grace period of about 30 days where the original owner can reclaim it. Once that 30 days is up, it enters a ""redemption period"" where the domain is frozen for 30 more days and drops from the zone file. The original owner can reclaim or make changes to the domain, but the registrar fees at this point are often well into the hundreds of dollars (which is easily still worth it if the alternative is losing your business).

For about 5 to 10 days, it goes through deletion processing where it is dropped from the registry and is available to be registered by the general public.

Some registrars will retain their deleted domains to auction them off; whether they do it themselves or have an agreement with a third party auction house depends on the registrar.

More often than not, a domain that had an established website never makes it through deletion processing and is sold off for auction. Old domains that had measurable bodies of content, users, or search volume can be extremely valuable and can sell for many thousands of dollars.

When it's bought at auction, the new owner can use the domain as they see fit. The vast majority of auctioned domains end up in a portfolio of domains owned by a reseller; we call them a squatter. They often prompt the original domain owners, their competitors, and other interested parties to buy the domain well above cost. 

&gt; Can the person who bought it afterwards negotiate a huge price for the company to get it back?

This is legal as long as the domain isn't a registered trademark and they aren't trying to actively impersonate the original owners of the domain. If there are trademark or legal issues, there are avenues people can take to reclaim their domains; otherwise, they're out of luck and either have to pay the squatter's exorbitant fees or find another domain. I've had companies that drop their domains because no one was monitoring their registrar billing information that were squatted and reoffered to them for tens of thousands of dollars.

For your lungs, some patients can have a condition called COPD. On of the ways COPD can present itself is with reducing the elastic properties of the lungs. This makes it painful for the patient to breath. Therefore, there must be pain receptors in the lungs that tell the patient it is painful.

2. There is nothing canada brings to the table. We already have alaska. 


3. The great majority of canadian trade is with the US. While canada is not important enough to become a US state, it is essentially a US protectorate/territory. Most of canadians live along the US border, most canadians follow american culture, etc.

When it's light, our pupils constrict (the opposite of dilate) to let in less light. If they didn't do this, there would be so much light reaching the retina that everything would just appear to be white, the way you are often temporarily blinded by the light if you go from indoors to outdoors on a very sunny day.

another theory is, it is called that, because its just next to the old ludgate, the eastward continuations of fleet street.  now the etymology for ludgate is not certain, it might come from flood gate or fleet gate, or from old english hlidgeat or ludgeat, meaning postern, swinging gate or black gate.

if it derives from black gate, then the black frairs would be just the monks near the black gate, the black monks.

lumpy_potato,"So think of a restaurant:

The front of the restaurant is where you eat - it looks nice, it has all the fixings, and the food is brought out too you.

The back of the restaurant is where the food is made - all your supplies are there, the food is cooked, etc.

You, in the *front* of the restaurant, don't see the *back*. You just input your order, and get your food - you don't see how the food is made, and you have only as much input in what the *back* does as the *front* allows.

Websites work the same way - the *frontend* is the actual website, like www.reddit.com. Much of the functionality - comments, logins, etc., are like ordering food on a menu. You put all the data you want in and hit send, and the *frontend* delivers that data to the *backend*.

The backend consists of servers and software that, based on how they are programmed, know what to do with the data the frontend sends it. Once its done doing whatever its programmed to do, it sends the data back to the frontend. Some items, like minimizing comments, don't require anything beyond changes to the frontend - its usually only when the frontend needs to access data or send new data that the backend gets involved.

The frontend should know how to respond when the data comes in, and displays it to the user (or does something to it first).

For instance, login:

Frontend: Enter username and password  
-&gt; send username and password from frontend to backend  
Backend: check username and password against internal database  
-&gt; Send confirmation of correct login, or error message of incorrect login  
Frontend: Either log the user in, or display error message  

Or for going through pages:

Frontend: I'm on page one, and the user just hit next - what are the next 20 entries?  
-&gt; Send request for next 20 entries from frontend to backend  
Backend: Next 20 entries? Based on my list of topics, the next 20 should be these  
-&gt; Send data from backend to frontend

so dgestion does take some effort on your bodies part, but the actual driving factor in the ""tired"" feeling after a large meal is insulin.

It also puts your body into an anabolic state. Insulin basically is a hormone that is screaming at your body to grow and sleep. This is the ""sugar crash"" you see in little kids. It happens in adults too, and with complex carbs as well, not just simple ones.

you probably notice this is alot more prevelant after eating a big side of mashed potatoes then it is after you eat 2 lbs of chicken wings.

For example, flopping in the NBA will get you a $5k fine that is more of a warning to watch yourself. If a player keeps flopping even after receiving that fine, the league may increase the fine to $25k, $50k, or even suspend the player (which could be a greater loss overall if you are making over $100k a game). 

Ultimately, it is more of a notice to stop doing something, sort of like a warning. If you have the money to pay continued fines and don't care about getting booked for it, go ahead and keep doing it, but the league may seek much harsher penalties such as suspension or large fines if they see you are not changing your ways. 

Other analogy: If you are rich and speed in your sports car, a speeding ticket may not seem like much of anything the first time you get one.

readthefollowing,"To understand this, I think it helps to look at sports like a movie, where everyone involved is an actor. In your job or my job, if we make a mistake, it might cost the company to lose customers or cause the company to lose money. If an athlete makes a mistake, it may have no effect at all on any of that. The fans remain loyal, the advertisers still advertise, people still go to the games. It's really just altering the script of a movie that everyone still wants to see. 

In this way, I look at the NFL or NBA in the same way I might look at wrestling or a movie.  It's a product of entertainment, and even when things go wrong, that's still okay, because sometimes things go wrong in creative productions. Sometimes the bad guy wins the fight of the night, or the monster eats the hero, and yes, sometimes the athlete commits a violation. 

If a player never committed a foul, no one ever did anything stupid, no one tried anything creative, and it was all 100% by-the-book playing with the precision of a surgeon, sports would become pretty boring after a while and it would be less exciting. You sort of need a small dose of the Jerry Springer factor every once in a while. But only a small dose. Somewhere some executives know exactly what dose is, to keep things on the straight and narrow enough, while leaving room for an occasional ""JERRY!"" moment. 

These fines aren't meant to stop every one of those moments from happening. It's to keep them at their small dose levels.

Who told you that?

Mutations *can* be passed to offspring.

It may be that they don't show up immediately (they may be ""recessive"", meaning that it won't show unless it's present in both copies of that gene). And it may be that the mutation only shows in one out of the pair of genes in the parent, in which case there's only a 50/50 chance of it being passed on to any one individual child.

But it most definitely can be passed down to offspring.",null,0,cdpls8f,1rpqht,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3
topmarx,"Forget everything you know about evolution, imagine that you're hearing about it for the first time.

Ready?

When a baby is born, it is 48% its mother, 48% its father, and 4% random.

That random part is where something just goes wrong or flips out a bit during the baby-formation process. Some of the body-building instructions, which we call 'genes', get *mutated*, or distorted in some way.

This is why two short parents will *usually* have a short child, but occasionally, will have an extremely tall one, or an extremely small one. Or why some people can be born without their limbs, or born blind, or with all their organs flipped around in a mirror image. Everyone's just partially randomised. We call these random changes *mutations*.

Now, some mutations are bad, obviously. But some mutations are good! You might have a mutation that means you are much more muscular than your parents, or a mutation that means your eyes are more sensitive, or a mutation that makes you immune to a certain form of illness.

When animals have mutations like that, it means that they usually live longer and more successful lives; the eyes help them hunt so they eat plentifully when their rivals starve, or they survive an illness that wipes out many others, they're more colourful or stronger and attract more mates. All of which means, they have more babies.

And when they have babies, their genes get passed on -- so the babies might have those lucky mutations their parents had, since they are, after all, 48% that parent. Baby grows up, has lots of babies of its own, lives a longer better life, passes on the mutation to *its* babies...

Over, and over, and over again. If the mutation is really great, then every generation, the people with the mutation will be having more babies than everyone else, which means that the percentage of the population with it grows. 1% today, 2% in a few years, 10% in a few centuries... and eventually, everyone.

Over millions of years, this results in a variety of animals who have separated into different species and sub-species, highly adapted for their specific environments (because the packs that wound up moving closer to Yemen didn't need the winter fur that the Russian packs did, the lizards in the desert found the water-saving mutation great but the lizards in the Amazon found more use for the diving one, etc).

Let's think of a very recent mutation that has caused so much grief for humanity: skin colour.

Humans originated in north Africa. We lived in bands that travelled around, picking fruit and hunting small animals as we went. Some groups went far south, some stayed in north Africa, some travelled far east, some northish, some *far* north.

Human beings need a vitamin called Vitamin D. Part of the way we synthesise it is in our skin, through sunlight. And guess what? The tribes that moved north started losing precious vitamin D, because there's not much sun up in Germany and Russia compared to Sudan and Egypt. Without vitamin D, people got sick. 

But some people were paler than others. Being pale means that your skin lacks melanin, which filters out the sunlight, protecting you from sunburn but also stopping you from making Vitamin D. Pale people didn't get as sick as everyone else. They lived longer, and had more babies on average. Babies that were pale, like their parents. Of those babies, the palest were the healthiest on average, since they had an easier time making vitamin D. So they lived longest, had the most babies -- and the palest babies. And this went on and on for years and years, until, boom -- all the people who had settled around Germany, Sweden, Russia, Netherlands, they were all *white* skinned.

Meanwhile, the people back in Africa didn't have this problem. They got plenty of Vitamin D from the harsh unfiltered sun. What they needed was protection from *too much* sun, which could cause skin cancers and burns. So they developed very dark black skin.

People who had settled somewhere along the middle, like in the Middle East or India, developed skin that was somewhere between the two, because that was the ideal balance for where they were. The people who had settled in Greece and Italy developed skin closer to white, but still not as dark as the Swedish or Russian groups.

That is a simple and easy example of an evolutionary change happening *without* mutation. Mutation isn't involved in every evolutionary change, but it is definitely involved in some of them. The ability to digest dairy is considered to be a mutation, and it's one that [not everyone has](http://cdn.foodbeast.com.s3.amazonaws.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Global-Lactose-Intolerance.png).

Verdandeify,"There's a really great book about this called Guns, Germs, and Steel that explains why some societies have gotten so much more progress than others.

A couple of things.

The ""northern half"" includes North America, which is one of the least advanced, historically. So saying that ""the northern half"" contains the most developed countries in the world is only partially true. If you take the United States, well, that's essentially a really large European colony, and can take advantage of Eurasia's natural advantage.

So that leads to the question: Why did Eurasia have that kind of advantage, anyways? Why did Europe colonize the world instead of Africa or South America? It's a couple of things, actually: The east-west axis of Eurasia, the availability of domesticable animals, and the availability of good quality metal ores.

The Americas are primarily north-south in their orientation, and it's obvious that there are larger differences in latitude than longitude. You can bring that awesome wheat variety you've just domesticated eastward or westward, like what happened in Europe, but it's hard to move that wheat north or south, where it's colder or warmer, and where the weather is probably different.

Secondly, Europe and the Middle East have by far the most large animals available for domestication, and that's a huge deal. When you have a large animal working your fields, you are a lot more productive, and the more productive you are, the more people your land can sustain. Agricultural societies are always a lot more dense than non-agricultural societies, and more dense societies can sustain more non-productive citizens like philosophers, artists, kings, and soldiers. 

Domestic animals also increase your ability to travel, and the amount of luggage you can tow around. When you're limited to smallish loads carryable in a hand cart, you're not going to be able to realistically trade as much as you could if you had a horse-drawn cart, and you're not going to want to go as far. You're not going to be able to really use the massive power of the wheel, because you can't scale up as far as you can if you had an ox-sized being hauling stuff.

Lastly, the advantage of iron and bronze over stone and wood is self-evident. If you have bronze, you're going to beat your stone-equipped enemies and can access iron. If you can access iron, you're going to defeat your bronze-equipped enemies and can access steel, and so on.

Rodorador,"When you mean northern hemisphere I think you truly mean the US and the majority of European nations. Many vast regions that are officially part of the northern hemisphere like Central America, Northern Africa and regions of Asia are actually considered ""third world,"" meaning really that they are underdeveloped by European/""first world"" standards. 

I am not sure why you would pose the question from a European standard, but I am going to hypothesize that it is because you were raised in a region of the world where folks are educated with European standards. 

Now, while the book guns germs and steel is definitely a fascinating account of why certain societies are more powerful than others or have the ability to conquer other societies does not answer the question of why such societies are justified in doing so. I will not get into this, since OPs question was not a moral question. The question was about why the ""north is more developed than the ""south.""

The main reason is the fact of colonialism. European powers like Holland, Spain and Portugal, upon coming into contact with the cultures that had been existing in what we call the ""Americas"" for thousands of years, decided that they would like to conquest the people and the land they used to to create a sustainable living environment for their civilizations. I am not sure how European powers decided to do this, but what resulted was a history of large scale exploitation, theft and enslavement and forced serfdom of entire civilizations. 

If you recall, during the renaissance era, when colonization was in its beginning stages, (Columbus had accidentally landed in America in 1492), gold and silver were measures of a countries wealth and used to trade goods. You can read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations for more info.  

Present day Bolivia and Peru as well as Mexico were excavated by Spain until every ounce that could be found by contemporary technology (enslaved Indigenous miners) of gold, silver and precious metals was shipped to Europe. So much gold was found that European gold reserves quadrupled. 

Once Europe had effectively colonized and extracted the wealth of American civilizations, we move to a period of time called imperialism. This is a term meant to signify a process by which European nations set up government in other regions of the world to dominate and hold power over other people for the empire's benefit. In modern day, although former colonies like the majority of the African continent and all of the Americas were allowed to become independent sovereign states, we still see the legacy of colonization and imperialism continue to keep what we call ""third world"" countries from developing. Structures like the world bank's structural readjustment programs and the US agricultural subsidy prevent these countries from developing. 

The agriculture subsidy has put out so many country's agriculture sector out of business, even though they would have a comparative advantage (ie make crops for cheaper than the us).

Structural readjustment loans from the world bank and IMF give loans to ""third world"" countries, but force them to run their fiscal policy in such a way to force the countries to overdevelop their raw goods sector. This is bad because these nations don't have the funds to develop processed goods like computers or other non-raw resources or technological processes, or their human capital.  What ends up happening and is happening, is that southern countries are still in debt, and the loan programs are not enabling the countries to get out of debt, but keeping them in the cycle of debt. Thus is the legacy of societies who felt justified in conquering other societies.

Doubtless, there are a million things that were different between englanders and the rest of the world. Empirically, we can't tell what factor(s) accounted for the change. That's because empirical work deals with correlation, not causation - but that topic is for another day.

So sticking to theory, what could cause a culture to pursue a better living standard? I can think of only two things: the desire by millions of individuals to make a better material life for themselves and the expectation that they will be able to keep their improvements. For the progress to affect everyone, they all need to be working in mutually beneficial ways. 

Essentially, England had a society that can best be described as capitalist. Its culture embraced the belief that it is morally good to want a better material world, as well as the belief that it is morally appropriate to pursue that better world on a personal level - as long as no one else is hurt by the pursuit. 

And this is just me guessing, but I would say that the other Western European countries had near enough cultures that they could incorporate the progress England started. Unfortunately for parts of the world, personal property isn't respected (certain types of property are stolen or legally prohibited), or there doesn't exist a belief that it is okay to pursue a better material living standard.

Verdandeify,"There's a really great book about this called Guns, Germs, and Steel that explains why some societies have gotten so much more progress than others.

A couple of things.

The ""northern half"" includes North America, which is one of the least advanced, historically. So saying that ""the northern half"" contains the most developed countries in the world is only partially true. If you take the United States, well, that's essentially a really large European colony, and can take advantage of Eurasia's natural advantage.

So that leads to the question: Why did Eurasia have that kind of advantage, anyways? Why did Europe colonize the world instead of Africa or South America? It's a couple of things, actually: The east-west axis of Eurasia, the availability of domesticable animals, and the availability of good quality metal ores.

The Americas are primarily north-south in their orientation, and it's obvious that there are larger differences in latitude than longitude. You can bring that awesome wheat variety you've just domesticated eastward or westward, like what happened in Europe, but it's hard to move that wheat north or south, where it's colder or warmer, and where the weather is probably different.

Secondly, Europe and the Middle East have by far the most large animals available for domestication, and that's a huge deal. When you have a large animal working your fields, you are a lot more productive, and the more productive you are, the more people your land can sustain. Agricultural societies are always a lot more dense than non-agricultural societies, and more dense societies can sustain more non-productive citizens like philosophers, artists, kings, and soldiers. 

Domestic animals also increase your ability to travel, and the amount of luggage you can tow around. When you're limited to smallish loads carryable in a hand cart, you're not going to be able to realistically trade as much as you could if you had a horse-drawn cart, and you're not going to want to go as far. You're not going to be able to really use the massive power of the wheel, because you can't scale up as far as you can if you had an ox-sized being hauling stuff.

Lastly, the advantage of iron and bronze over stone and wood is self-evident. If you have bronze, you're going to beat your stone-equipped enemies and can access iron. If you can access iron, you're going to defeat your bronze-equipped enemies and can access steel, and so on.

Surely I've missed something, but I've gotta go. Hopefully this helped!",null,38,cdpmtcv,1rpre0,explainlikeimfive,top_day,154
panzerkampfwagen,"Look at a globe.  Most of the world's land is found in the Northern Hemisphere. 

In fact, not only does the Northern Hemisphere contain more land but almost every person on the planet lives in the Northern Hemisphere.  Only 10% of the human population lives south of the equator. ",null,20,cdplzz5,1rpre0,explainlikeimfive,top_day,42
Rodorador,"When you mean northern hemisphere I think you truly mean the US and the majority of European nations. Many vast regions that are officially part of the northern hemisphere like Central America, Northern Africa and regions of Asia are actually considered ""third world,"" meaning really that they are underdeveloped by European/""first world"" standards. 

I am not sure why you would pose the question from a European standard, but I am going to hypothesize that it is because you were raised in a region of the world where folks are educated with European standards. 

Now, while the book guns germs and steel is definitely a fascinating account of why certain societies are more powerful than others or have the ability to conquer other societies does not answer the question of why such societies are justified in doing so. I will not get into this, since OPs question was not a moral question. The question was about why the ""north is more developed than the ""south.""

The main reason is the fact of colonialism. European powers like Holland, Spain and Portugal, upon coming into contact with the cultures that had been existing in what we call the ""Americas"" for thousands of years, decided that they would like to conquest the people and the land they used to to create a sustainable living environment for their civilizations. I am not sure how European powers decided to do this, but what resulted was a history of large scale exploitation, theft and enslavement and forced serfdom of entire civilizations. 

If you recall, during the renaissance era, when colonization was in its beginning stages, (Columbus had accidentally landed in America in 1492), gold and silver were measures of a countries wealth and used to trade goods. You can read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations for more info.  

Present day Bolivia and Peru as well as Mexico were excavated by Spain until every ounce that could be found by contemporary technology (enslaved Indigenous miners) of gold, silver and precious metals was shipped to Europe. So much gold was found that European gold reserves quadrupled. 

Once Europe had effectively colonized and extracted the wealth of American civilizations, we move to a period of time called imperialism. This is a term meant to signify a process by which European nations set up government in other regions of the world to dominate and hold power over other people for the empire's benefit. In modern day, although former colonies like the majority of the African continent and all of the Americas were allowed to become independent sovereign states, we still see the legacy of colonization and imperialism continue to keep what we call ""third world"" countries from developing. Structures like the world bank's structural readjustment programs and the US agricultural subsidy prevent these countries from developing. 

The agriculture subsidy has put out so many country's agriculture sector out of business, even though they would have a comparative advantage (ie make crops for cheaper than the us).

Structural readjustment loans from the world bank and IMF give loans to ""third world"" countries, but force them to run their fiscal policy in such a way to force the countries to overdevelop their raw goods sector. This is bad because these nations don't have the funds to develop processed goods like computers or other non-raw resources or technological processes, or their human capital.  What ends up happening and is happening, is that southern countries are still in debt, and the loan programs are not enabling the countries to get out of debt, but keeping them in the cycle of debt. Thus is the legacy of societies who felt justified in conquering other societies.

dontfeedtheanimals,"Your question could probably be rephrased as: why did the industrial revolution start in England, get picked up quickly by Europe, and much more slowly by the rest of the world?

Doubtless, there are a million things that were different between englanders and the rest of the world. Empirically, we can't tell what factor(s) accounted for the change. That's because empirical work deals with correlation, not causation - but that topic is for another day.

So sticking to theory, what could cause a culture to pursue a better living standard? I can think of only two things: the desire by millions of individuals to make a better material life for themselves and the expectation that they will be able to keep their improvements. For the progress to affect everyone, they all need to be working in mutually beneficial ways. 

Essentially, England had a society that can best be described as capitalist. Its culture embraced the belief that it is morally good to want a better material world, as well as the belief that it is morally appropriate to pursue that better world on a personal level - as long as no one else is hurt by the pursuit. 

And this is just me guessing, but I would say that the other Western European countries had near enough cultures that they could incorporate the progress England started. Unfortunately for parts of the world, personal property isn't respected (certain types of property are stolen or legally prohibited), or there doesn't exist a belief that it is okay to pursue a better material living standard.

I think Hernando de Soto has written extensively on the absence of cultural property rights in undeveloped countries, in case you're interested in some reading material.

SecureThruObscure,"Depends. 

Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation. 

The reason is pretty straightforward. Your blood (and veins) act like a radiator system. They're brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area, and then sent off to a different part of the body. 

Is it's cold out, your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities.  It then radiates (transmits) that heat to the fingers, toes, etc. 

Typically, they lose heat (especially in cold weather).  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without. 


It's worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia (less blood gets to the skin/fingers, less heat gets lost), and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals.

Shmalpin,"Your extremities are naturally the coldest parts of your body (this is why gout crystals most commonly form in the big toe).  They are the farthest away from the heated core of the body, so it follows that they are more susceptible to the cold than your head, abdomen, chest, etc.  In the cold, the body attempts to generate heat in the extremities - this manifests as shivering.  If cold in the extremities persists, the body shunts blood away from the arms and legs to preserve a warm, functional core temperature.  
  
If someone genuinely has ""bad circulation"" or a pathological reason that their extremities are very cold-sensitive (and not an offhand, self-made diagnosis) then it would be due to a lack of blood reaching the extremities.  Individuals with autoimmune disorders (like Lupus), Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Vasculitis generally suffer from some sort of peripheral blood vessel damage.  This damage leads to less core-warmed blood reaching the extremities.  When less blood is getting to your arms and legs, they naturally become closer to the temperature of their environment.  Diabetes and Hypertension are becoming increasingly prevalent, but autoimmune disorders and vasculitis are extremely rare.  
  
""Bad circulation"" is something that a lot of folks are eager to diagnose themselves with, whether or not a true medical cause exists.

SecureThruObscure,"Depends. 

Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation. 

The reason is pretty straightforward. Your blood (and veins) act like a radiator system. They're brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area, and then sent off to a different part of the body. 

Is it's cold out, your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities.  It then radiates (transmits) that heat to the fingers, toes, etc. 

Typically, they lose heat (especially in cold weather).  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without. 


It's worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia (less blood gets to the skin/fingers, less heat gets lost), and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals.

Shmalpin,"Your extremities are naturally the coldest parts of your body (this is why gout crystals most commonly form in the big toe).  They are the farthest away from the heated core of the body, so it follows that they are more susceptible to the cold than your head, abdomen, chest, etc.  In the cold, the body attempts to generate heat in the extremities - this manifests as shivering.  If cold in the extremities persists, the body shunts blood away from the arms and legs to preserve a warm, functional core temperature.  
  
If someone genuinely has ""bad circulation"" or a pathological reason that their extremities are very cold-sensitive (and not an offhand, self-made diagnosis) then it would be due to a lack of blood reaching the extremities.  Individuals with autoimmune disorders (like Lupus), Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Vasculitis generally suffer from some sort of peripheral blood vessel damage.  This damage leads to less core-warmed blood reaching the extremities.  When less blood is getting to your arms and legs, they naturally become closer to the temperature of their environment.  Diabetes and Hypertension are becoming increasingly prevalent, but autoimmune disorders and vasculitis are extremely rare.  
  
""Bad circulation"" is something that a lot of folks are eager to diagnose themselves with, whether or not a true medical cause exists.

An older person who jumps into the same cold water has stiff vessels and they will take much longer to constrict. Constricting blood vessels also increases your blood pressure AND forcing all that fluid into your torso puts pressure on your bladder which makes you have to go pee.

Your body uses insulin to deal with sugar. That's the basics of it - without insulin, your body can't break down sugar properly, and you start having problems. This is actually somewhat where Type I comes from - lack of insulin, slowed insulin production, etc. 

Anyways, insulin. Like any chemical, when you have too much of it, you can develop a resistance to it. Well when you're pumping your body full of sugars, your body will create insulin - and over time your body develops [insulin resistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance), and now you need *more* insulin to deal with the same amount of sugar.

Now you are in trouble - this process takes time, but once you hit that peak, its all downhill - you can't easily reverse the process.

Other causes can be hunger and exhaustion (this happened to me all the time when I was in college with two jobs).

There was a feeling like the U.S.A was losing control and Reagan came in and even though all he had to do was smile, he gave people the feeling that things would change.

I'm not sure if you ever heard the term 'Reaganomics' but Reagan cut taxes, removed barriers in production, and provided benefits and tax breaks to upper level income people in the country.

Did it work? Well, it doesn't really matter. Some people will say yes, others will say he indebted the country further to make some citizens richer.

He was looked at like a hero by lots of people in the country. Now, with all that said, let's get at your question.

Reagan was a 'tough' guy. The cold war was going on between the U.S.A and Russia and where Jimmy Carter took a more peaceful course, Reagan went Super Saiyan 3. He stockpiled more weapons and in the end, he won.

""Take down this wall."" More importantly he won peacefully. He ended the cold war. Did he really? Hard to say. But that's how people saw it.

So, in short, Reagan was a famous movie star, an old guy who comes in and 'saves' the country from our economic problems, ends the cold war, put us back on a traditional path, like when grandpa comes over smoking his pipe and saying how he fought in ww2, complaining that mommy doesn't use enough butter in her mashed potatoes.

Everyone boosted him up so high, a small thing like the Iran-Contra couldn't change how people saw him. He'd have to lvl Charizard to 100 and then just let it go, or, I don't know, buy an X-BOX one and PS4 and then give them to the girl down the block, something really terrible for anything to change.

It also helps that conservatives and republicans have referenced how 'good' was, non stop for the last 24-25 years.

TL;DR He was a hero to most people and still is.

mookie88,"Ok let me try to give you the perspective that me and my friends have as 20 year old college students who talk about politics regularly and Reagan frequently comes up. All of us, even the Democrats, agree that our parents have a kind of blind admiration for Reagan as they can't really give us a reason for viewing him as a great president, but here's what we think. The combination of new technology being integrated into the stock market, massive outsourcing, looser economic restrictions, and crack downs on unions gave the middle class much stronger buying power (for the time, at least) but actually ended up levying almost irreparable damage on America's social mobility. He also had little care for political correctness and used terms like ""welfare queens"" and engrained in people the incorrect fact the welfare was being abused by those on it, basically perpetuating a kind of de facto racism that persists to this day, and it should be obvious how this was appealing to Whites from all social classes. Also his ""Trickle-down"" economics, which in theory sounds really appealing but fails to account for the natural greed and self servitude that permeates among all humans, but because of economic success due to other factors it appeared to work (due to failures in modern day Canada, Bush 1, and Bush 2, it's clear Trickle-down doesn't work as well as thought). Anyway he empowered the middle class and there was even a mild recession towards the end of his second term which people didn't attribute to him but instead blamed on ""new technology"", because of his cult of personality. So basically he was loved because he built an aura of invincibility and growth which was powered by short term fixes to our problems (which are even today causing us problems i.e. outsourcing) and the fact that he had a massive cult of personality populated by young middle class kids coming out of college who were allowed massive spending power due to the cheapening of goods and the influx of jobs because of the growth technology (which had little if anything to do with Reagan) and military spending.

Drew2248,"You say that Reagan is ""held to be one of the best US presidents,"" but who believes this?  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagan's accomplishments.  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans.  In any case, even if he were ""held"" to be an amazing president, the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had. 

JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president.  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the 1950s while being, himself, young and vigorous, having an attractive wife and young children (the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelt's and that had been nearly 60 years before JFK), and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights, the Peace Corps, nuclear disarmament, and so forth.  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful, attractive, witty, and energetic.  But, Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president. No civil rights laws and so forth.  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in people's memories.  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish.  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process, in a way. 

Reagan's reputation developed somewhat similarly, though not quite in the same way as Kennedy's.  After all, Reagan did not die in office, but he was very good on TV, witty, pleasant, easygoing like JFK, and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him. So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had.  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits, and Reagan's children from his two marriages (he had been divorced and remarried) were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets.  But he was a nice guy, had a good sense of humor, and his appeal on TV always benefitted him.  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal, no matter what their abilities really are. And Reagan was not a bright man.  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm, that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with, and that America could do no harm.  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man, and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do.  

As for his actual policies as president, he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union. He had come, late in his presidency, to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing. But this was very much different from the rest of Reagan's foreign policy.   

Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive (as Kennedy's had been, as well, with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in 1962).  Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly.  He is often credited with ""defeating"" the Soviet Union, but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents' efforts as from Reagans, and it resulted at least as much from the USSR's own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures, arguably more from internal problems than from what the U.S. did.  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble.  But, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually ""fell"" during the presidency of Reagan's successor, G.H.W. Bush.  Maybe he should get all the credit?  Of course that would be silly, too, but crediting Reagan is just as illogical.  

What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy (like JFK) who made them feel good, that he stood up to the Soviets (but so had Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, and other presidents, often much more dramatically), and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the 1970s.  So, Americans felt better in the 1980s.  Was this Reagan's doing?  

Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending, and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy, and other factors.  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today -- he began the 30-year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others.  This legacy was one of Reagan's worst and we are still suffering because of it.  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the 1980s, and most Americans don't understand very well the economic changes of the last 30 years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the 1920s. This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations, shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top.  

Reagan was also very anti-union (his firing of air traffic controllers), accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor (whatever you might think of unions) in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time.  Reagan was also a strongly anti-environmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws.  On popular issues like these, Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy.  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president.  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS (those who got the disease were most often ""leftie"" homosexuals which Republicans did not care about) or to improve the medical system in any way.  In fact, Reagan's social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president.  

In short (?) our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians.  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre.  But neither is ranked among the top presidents. 

The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and, instead, they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people, was reviving the economy, was a patriot on foreign policy.  These claims are inaccurate, but the average American does not read much, I'm afraid, or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they ""feel"" about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing. And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan (he was reelected in 1984, of course) or buy most of the claims made in his favor, and in the last years of his presidency Reagan's popularity was dropping.  

This was partly due to his involvement in the Iran-Contra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagan's impeachment, but didn't. He somehow survived to the end of his term, and he got Alzheimer's fairly soon after leaving the White House, he was already very old, and people generally liked him, so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him.  The public simply choose not to care.  But the facts are there, nevertheless.  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past, had been divorced, and lied a little about his accomplishments, but was very charming and told good stories, so people liked him anyway. 

Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them.  Abraham Lincoln, often ranked as the best president today, was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good.  Popular views are shaped by emotion, sentiment, misunderstandings, a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues, and faulty memories.  Truman was widely disparaged as president, then there was a Truman Revival in the 1970s after we'd had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better, and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more.  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher, I think, due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were.  In any case, I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president.  It's the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy.  Heck, I liked him, but I hated his policies and still do. ",null,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_day,4

I'm old enough to remember him, and what I remember is that he was kind of a doofus. A nice guy, well-meaning, but hardly the great hero he's made out to be. The depiction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU9lv_WqK6k) is, believe it or not, pretty much how a lot of us regarded him at the time. It probably seems very unlikely, since you've likely heard the more recent 'awesome' depictions of him. He was just a guy, and hardly a spectacular one. There were a *lot* of depictions about as flattering as this (and some much less so). There were also plenty of much more positive ones. He was not one-dimensional, after all, and he fairly won two terms, with good margins. He was controversial in many ways, but hardly despised. Even those of us who rejected many of his ideas and policies respected him, for the most part. If nothing else, he was likeable and personable, down to earth, and a terrific speaker. (Though many of us recognised that as the product of his earlier acting career and his years of corporate speakership; he was trained and highly practiced, but we did not confuse that with competence, high intelligence, or vision. We knew good acting when we saw it.)

I don't want to condemn him, but it bothers me a lot how modern conesrvatives regard him, because he was not very much like the way they paint him now. Reagan himself would be pretty disturbed at it, I think. He was conservative, but he was one of the last of the *paleo*conservatives, men of an earlier time who clearly remembered the prewar period and a different system of ways and values than we have now. By the standards of his time, he was more or less moderate, and was well liked by many liberals and conservatives alike. But by modern standards, he was more liberal than conservative, despite the very distorited image presented of him now. People can lie, but facts don't. Reagan favoured reasonable gun control, argued for union rights, holds the all-time presidential record for signing environmental regulation (much of which he personally championed), and was the first president to put up a gay couple at the White House, over the objections of many more conservative people.

I want to make it clear that he was not a cartoon. He was a real guy. But he was *just* a guy, neither villain or hero. It's weird and unsettling to me how people talk about him now.

VoreGidal,"The myth of Reagan as a great economic, free market messiah is conservative propaganda: http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/02/05/142288/reagan-centennial/

Some stand-out quotes:

2. Reagan nearly tripled the federal budget deficit. During the Reagan years, the debt increased to nearly $3 trillion, “roughly three times as much as the first 80 years of the century had done altogether.” Reagan enacted a major tax cut his first year in office and government revenue dropped off precipitously. Despite the conservative myth that tax cuts somehow increase revenue, the government went deeper into debt and Reagan had to raise taxes just a year after he enacted his tax cut. Despite ten more tax hikes on everything from gasoline to corporate income, Reagan was never able to get the deficit under control.

3. Unemployment soared after Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts. Unemployment jumped to 10.8 percent after Reagan enacted his much-touted tax cut, and it took years for the rate to get back down to its previous level. Meanwhile, income inequality exploded. Despite the myth that Reagan presided over an era of unmatched economic boom for all Americans, Reagan disproportionately taxed the poor and middle class, but the economic growth of the 1980′s did little help them. “Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled,” the New York Times’ David Leonhardt noted.

4. Reagan grew the size of the federal government tremendously. Reagan promised “to move boldly, decisively, and quickly to control the runaway growth of federal spending,” but federal spending “ballooned” under Reagan. He bailed out Social Security in 1983 after attempting to privatize it, and set up a progressive taxation system to keep it funded into the future. He promised to cut government agencies like the Department of Energy and Education but ended up adding one of the largest — the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which today has a budget of nearly $90 billion and close to 300,000 employees. He also hiked defense spending by over $100 billion a year to a level not seen since the height of the Vietnam war.",null,3,cdpzabn,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_day,6

Its called ""myth making"".  Reagan's reputation is a cultivated myth, and does not stand up to serious examination.  Google ""the clothes have no emperor"" for the definitive book, written just have his terms ended.  This book consists only of quotes, where he over and over again shoots himself in the foot.

He started having alzheimer's symptoms early on, and slowly deteriorated.  He is credited with writing all these beautiful letters, but there was a ""Freudian Slip"" by Nancy Reagan when the letters book was published, where she used the word ""we"" when talking about their letter writing activity in the evenings.  She recovered quickly and changed that, but the slip is out there.

I'm pretty sure the letter writing was part of exercises where she tried valiantly to hold back his looming dementia.

It is actually Rock 'n Roll that brought down the Berlin Wall, ... read what the people in Russia have to say about how emboldened they were with the ideas of freedom conveyed in that music (especially the Beatles).

Reagan was governor of California, and ordered the CS gassing from overflying helicopters) of students on the campus at Berkeley in the

The really weird thing is that most of his actual economic policies (outside of the famous - ""read my lips, no more taxes"" - which he violated once elected) were right in line with modern democratic economic thinking.

There's more, but you get the idea. We desperately needed someone to help us believe that the U.S. could be great again, and Carter, nice as he was, simply wasn't that guy. 

Reagan was. I'm not arguing whether he was a good president, but there's no question he was the right president at the time. His sunny optimism and fierce belief in american exceptionalism were, at least perceptually, what fixed a broken country. 

I don't agree with everything he did, but I don't think we'd be better off if Carter had won (or Mondale).

The answer to why is complex, but in my opinion it can be as simple as every group needs a charismatic leader that doesn't alienate too many people and appeals to a broad audience and people who fit that description in the GOP are in short supply. If not Reagan, who? Ford was an unelected President. Nixon resigned due to scandals. Ike coined the phase industrial-military complex. Hoover is tainted with the Great Depression.

That all sort of changed with your 4th grade teacher, didn't it? Nobody messed with him or tried to test him. They respected him a lot more.

The 39th president of the U.S.A was Jimmy Carter, although not a terrible president, people even today look at him as soft. He did some good things, but the country was just coming out of a terrible period of war; the cold war was still chilling around and Stagflation was casting freeze trap everwhere-- where, how should I say it, the cost of everything was going up, but at the same time, the economy was slowing down.

There was a feeling like the U.S.A was losing control and Reagan came in and even though all he had to do was smile, he gave people the feeling that things would change.

I'm not sure if you ever heard the term 'Reaganomics' but Reagan cut taxes, removed barriers in production, and provided benefits and tax breaks to upper level income people in the country.

Did it work? Well, it doesn't really matter. Some people will say yes, others will say he indebted the country further to make some citizens richer.

He was looked at like a hero by lots of people in the country. Now, with all that said, let's get at your question.

Reagan was a 'tough' guy. The cold war was going on between the U.S.A and Russia and where Jimmy Carter took a more peaceful course, Reagan went Super Saiyan 3. He stockpiled more weapons and in the end, he won.

""Take down this wall."" More importantly he won peacefully. He ended the cold war. Did he really? Hard to say. But that's how people saw it.

So, in short, Reagan was a famous movie star, an old guy who comes in and 'saves' the country from our economic problems, ends the cold war, put us back on a traditional path, like when grandpa comes over smoking his pipe and saying how he fought in ww2, complaining that mommy doesn't use enough butter in her mashed potatoes.

Everyone boosted him up so high, a small thing like the Iran-Contra couldn't change how people saw him. He'd have to lvl Charizard to 100 and then just let it go, or, I don't know, buy an X-BOX one and PS4 and then give them to the girl down the block, something really terrible for anything to change.

It also helps that conservatives and republicans have referenced how 'good' was, non stop for the last 24-25 years.

mookie88,"Ok let me try to give you the perspective that me and my friends have as 20 year old college students who talk about politics regularly and Reagan frequently comes up. All of us, even the Democrats, agree that our parents have a kind of blind admiration for Reagan as they can't really give us a reason for viewing him as a great president, but here's what we think. The combination of new technology being integrated into the stock market, massive outsourcing, looser economic restrictions, and crack downs on unions gave the middle class much stronger buying power (for the time, at least) but actually ended up levying almost irreparable damage on America's social mobility. He also had little care for political correctness and used terms like ""welfare queens"" and engrained in people the incorrect fact the welfare was being abused by those on it, basically perpetuating a kind of de facto racism that persists to this day, and it should be obvious how this was appealing to Whites from all social classes. Also his ""Trickle-down"" economics, which in theory sounds really appealing but fails to account for the natural greed and self servitude that permeates among all humans, but because of economic success due to other factors it appeared to work (due to failures in modern day Canada, Bush 1, and Bush 2, it's clear Trickle-down doesn't work as well as thought). Anyway he empowered the middle class and there was even a mild recession towards the end of his second term which people didn't attribute to him but instead blamed on ""new technology"", because of his cult of personality. So basically he was loved because he built an aura of invincibility and growth which was powered by short term fixes to our problems (which are even today causing us problems i.e. outsourcing) and the fact that he had a massive cult of personality populated by young middle class kids coming out of college who were allowed massive spending power due to the cheapening of goods and the influx of jobs because of the growth technology (which had little if anything to do with Reagan) and military spending.

Drew2248,"You say that Reagan is ""held to be one of the best US presidents,"" but who believes this?  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagan's accomplishments.  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans.  In any case, even if he were ""held"" to be an amazing president, the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had. 

JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president.  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the 1950s while being, himself, young and vigorous, having an attractive wife and young children (the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelt's and that had been nearly 60 years before JFK), and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights, the Peace Corps, nuclear disarmament, and so forth.  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful, attractive, witty, and energetic.  But, Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president. No civil rights laws and so forth.  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in people's memories.  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish.  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process, in a way. 

Reagan's reputation developed somewhat similarly, though not quite in the same way as Kennedy's.  After all, Reagan did not die in office, but he was very good on TV, witty, pleasant, easygoing like JFK, and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him. So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had.  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits, and Reagan's children from his two marriages (he had been divorced and remarried) were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets.  But he was a nice guy, had a good sense of humor, and his appeal on TV always benefitted him.  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal, no matter what their abilities really are. And Reagan was not a bright man.  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm, that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with, and that America could do no harm.  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man, and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do.  

As for his actual policies as president, he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union. He had come, late in his presidency, to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing. But this was very much different from the rest of Reagan's foreign policy.   

Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive (as Kennedy's had been, as well, with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in 1962).  Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly.  He is often credited with ""defeating"" the Soviet Union, but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents' efforts as from Reagans, and it resulted at least as much from the USSR's own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures, arguably more from internal problems than from what the U.S. did.  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble.  But, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually ""fell"" during the presidency of Reagan's successor, G.H.W. Bush.  Maybe he should get all the credit?  Of course that would be silly, too, but crediting Reagan is just as illogical.  

What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy (like JFK) who made them feel good, that he stood up to the Soviets (but so had Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, and other presidents, often much more dramatically), and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the 1970s.  So, Americans felt better in the 1980s.  Was this Reagan's doing?  

Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending, and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy, and other factors.  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today -- he began the 30-year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others.  This legacy was one of Reagan's worst and we are still suffering because of it.  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the 1980s, and most Americans don't understand very well the economic changes of the last 30 years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the 1920s. This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations, shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top.  

Reagan was also very anti-union (his firing of air traffic controllers), accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor (whatever you might think of unions) in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time.  Reagan was also a strongly anti-environmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws.  On popular issues like these, Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy.  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president.  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS (those who got the disease were most often ""leftie"" homosexuals which Republicans did not care about) or to improve the medical system in any way.  In fact, Reagan's social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president.  

In short (?) our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians.  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre.  But neither is ranked among the top presidents. 

The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and, instead, they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people, was reviving the economy, was a patriot on foreign policy.  These claims are inaccurate, but the average American does not read much, I'm afraid, or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they ""feel"" about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing. And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan (he was reelected in 1984, of course) or buy most of the claims made in his favor, and in the last years of his presidency Reagan's popularity was dropping.  

This was partly due to his involvement in the Iran-Contra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagan's impeachment, but didn't. He somehow survived to the end of his term, and he got Alzheimer's fairly soon after leaving the White House, he was already very old, and people generally liked him, so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him.  The public simply choose not to care.  But the facts are there, nevertheless.  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past, had been divorced, and lied a little about his accomplishments, but was very charming and told good stories, so people liked him anyway. 

Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them.  Abraham Lincoln, often ranked as the best president today, was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good.  Popular views are shaped by emotion, sentiment, misunderstandings, a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues, and faulty memories.  Truman was widely disparaged as president, then there was a Truman Revival in the 1970s after we'd had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better, and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more.  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher, I think, due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were.  In any case, I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president.  It's the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy.  Heck, I liked him, but I hated his policies and still do. ",null,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_day,4

I'm old enough to remember him, and what I remember is that he was kind of a doofus. A nice guy, well-meaning, but hardly the great hero he's made out to be. The depiction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU9lv_WqK6k) is, believe it or not, pretty much how a lot of us regarded him at the time. It probably seems very unlikely, since you've likely heard the more recent 'awesome' depictions of him. He was just a guy, and hardly a spectacular one. There were a *lot* of depictions about as flattering as this (and some much less so). There were also plenty of much more positive ones. He was not one-dimensional, after all, and he fairly won two terms, with good margins. He was controversial in many ways, but hardly despised. Even those of us who rejected many of his ideas and policies respected him, for the most part. If nothing else, he was likeable and personable, down to earth, and a terrific speaker. (Though many of us recognised that as the product of his earlier acting career and his years of corporate speakership; he was trained and highly practiced, but we did not confuse that with competence, high intelligence, or vision. We knew good acting when we saw it.)

I don't want to condemn him, but it bothers me a lot how modern conesrvatives regard him, because he was not very much like the way they paint him now. Reagan himself would be pretty disturbed at it, I think. He was conservative, but he was one of the last of the *paleo*conservatives, men of an earlier time who clearly remembered the prewar period and a different system of ways and values than we have now. By the standards of his time, he was more or less moderate, and was well liked by many liberals and conservatives alike. But by modern standards, he was more liberal than conservative, despite the very distorited image presented of him now. People can lie, but facts don't. Reagan favoured reasonable gun control, argued for union rights, holds the all-time presidential record for signing environmental regulation (much of which he personally championed), and was the first president to put up a gay couple at the White House, over the objections of many more conservative people.

I want to make it clear that he was not a cartoon. He was a real guy. But he was *just* a guy, neither villain or hero. It's weird and unsettling to me how people talk about him now.

VoreGidal,"The myth of Reagan as a great economic, free market messiah is conservative propaganda: http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/02/05/142288/reagan-centennial/

Some stand-out quotes:

2. Reagan nearly tripled the federal budget deficit. During the Reagan years, the debt increased to nearly $3 trillion, “roughly three times as much as the first 80 years of the century had done altogether.” Reagan enacted a major tax cut his first year in office and government revenue dropped off precipitously. Despite the conservative myth that tax cuts somehow increase revenue, the government went deeper into debt and Reagan had to raise taxes just a year after he enacted his tax cut. Despite ten more tax hikes on everything from gasoline to corporate income, Reagan was never able to get the deficit under control.

3. Unemployment soared after Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts. Unemployment jumped to 10.8 percent after Reagan enacted his much-touted tax cut, and it took years for the rate to get back down to its previous level. Meanwhile, income inequality exploded. Despite the myth that Reagan presided over an era of unmatched economic boom for all Americans, Reagan disproportionately taxed the poor and middle class, but the economic growth of the 1980′s did little help them. “Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled,” the New York Times’ David Leonhardt noted.

4. Reagan grew the size of the federal government tremendously. Reagan promised “to move boldly, decisively, and quickly to control the runaway growth of federal spending,” but federal spending “ballooned” under Reagan. He bailed out Social Security in 1983 after attempting to privatize it, and set up a progressive taxation system to keep it funded into the future. He promised to cut government agencies like the Department of Energy and Education but ended up adding one of the largest — the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which today has a budget of nearly $90 billion and close to 300,000 employees. He also hiked defense spending by over $100 billion a year to a level not seen since the height of the Vietnam war.",null,3,cdpzabn,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_day,6

He started having alzheimer's symptoms early on, and slowly deteriorated.  He is credited with writing all these beautiful letters, but there was a ""Freudian Slip"" by Nancy Reagan when the letters book was published, where she used the word ""we"" when talking about their letter writing activity in the evenings.  She recovered quickly and changed that, but the slip is out there.

* One of the largest issues is that the website still isn't there yet, making sign ups difficult, on the healthcare.gov website primarily.
 * [Looking at this chart](http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Health-care-signups-California-outpaces-U-S-4982217.php) within the first month states on their own exchanges did pretty well as far as signups
 * The enrollment period technically ends in March 2014, so there is still time to get to that millions of enrollments.
* while the first month has not been good, there were a large amount of signups on the state-run exchanges - this should indicate that once the federal website is up and running, we should see the numbers catch up

If you look at the [actual numbers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/health-care-laws-reach/2013/11/13/6ea6b2a8-4cd1-11e3-ac54-aa84301ced81_graphic.html) , 1.5 million people completed an application in the first month - 1 million were eligible for a plan, and 100K chose a plan. So people *are* interested, but there are either issues with signing up (Healthcare.gov) or people are still trying to figure out what plans will work best for them.

It's hard to say how much of that drop off from 1.5M to 100K is due to technical issues - there is also public perception of the plan, media coverage, and the political sparring that has been happening steadily over the last year, all of which can make it more difficult for someone to make an informed decision.

doovidooves,"Well, first of all, it would take MASSIVE amounts of energy for us to change the Moon's orbit in any way, let alone send it on an escape trajectory from earth. At it's current rate though, it will eventually do this on it's own, as it appears to be moving about an inch away from Earth per year. Give it enough time, and it will happen on it's own, baring any sort of mass collision, that could impact it's orbit (which is still highly unlikely).

But anyways, assuming that we could change it's orbit, so that it escape's Earth's sphere of influence... it would probably have a slightly longer orbit around the sun that we would have, mostly due to the speed at which it would have to travel to escape our influence. It would probably be just fine, and it it ended up far enough away from Earth, would then be considered a planet. If it shared our orbit, without ever returning to our orbit (which is highly unlikely), then it would potentially demote Earth from it's planet status, as a planet must not share it's orbit with any other celestial body.

But anyways, back to Earth. Without a Moon, our orbit would stay exactly the same. it's possible that the length of the day would change, as there is evidence that the Moon did have some part to play in causing the Earth to achieve on full rotation every ~24 hours. Other than that, it would have some significant effects here on Earth. Tides are created by the moon's gravitational pull, and a great number of biological cycles seem to be regulated by the moon as well.

The radioactive particles are of such a high amount of energy that after they ""ping"" into one of your particles they'll keep bouncing around. And each particle it interacts with is going to bounce around transferring kinetic energy to more and more particles.
The more energy a particle has the higher degree of temperature.  So if you are exposed to too much radiation you will cook yourself.  Sun burn is a result of too much ultraviolet radiation, for example, while the microwave radiation that cooks your hot pockets is a different type.

The average person is exposed to about 300 mRem of radiation per year. More so if you smoke, eat a lot of bananas, drink a lot of milk or dwell in a basement.

Alpha particles are, comparatively, very big and therefore very slow moving. They are stopped by your layer of dead skin. However, if you were to ingest them they can do terrible damage... y'know, because your intestines are inside you. Beta particles are stopped by your clothing, they have a little more energy than alphas but, again, being exposed internally is a bigger worry.
Neutron and gamma radiation involve much faster, smaller particles.

With getting cooked eventually happening if you are exposed to very high amounts of radiation, you also have the possibility of slower damage from radiation resulting. A cell will form more copies of itself. So if a cell is ""pinged"" too many times the cell produces faulty copies of itself, and then those cells go on to form faulty copies of itself, etc. Or perhaps the cell is too damaged to produce daughter cells and the cell simply dies off.  Over time this results in damage (this is what happens to people who tan too much and look wrinkly and withered). 

However, getting dosed with a small amount over time means that while you might sustain cell damage it won't be to the extent that your cells reproduce damaged daughter cells; which is why after a few days or weeks your sunburn goes away because your damaged cells went on to produce new healthy cells. Which is why that 300 mRem/ year isn't a bad thing.

In summary: radioactive particles are high in energy, which equates to higher temperature. Therefore the more particles you are bombarded with the more your own cells/ organic matter are going to either die, become damaged, or cook.

ixian_probe,"There are two types of radiation explosure, acute (all happens at once) or chronic (slowly over a long time). In the case of Elysium, Max (Matt Daymond) is exposed to a lethal medium level dose of radiation. It is important to understand that people do not  become more radioactive when exposed to radiation. Instead, their bodies are damaged by the radiation in ways that are bad for their health. 
There is also another confusing expression you need to understand. Often acute radiation exposure is called radiation poisoning, even though it is actually not a poisoning at all! 

The reason it is called radiation poisoning is because the damage that happens to the body resembles very much what happens when people are poisoned. If they are exposed to a very high dose of radiation they start vomit and bleed from their lungs, stomach and such within a few hours. This happens because the radiation kills so many cells inside their bodies that the body start to leak so badly that the body can't ""patch the holes"" fast enough to keep itself alive. 

For a medium (but still lethal) radiation dose the damage is still very serious but people will live for a few days before the effects occur. Inside the body you have particular areas such as the bone marrow where new red blood cells and the white immune cells are made. As long as your bone marrow can produce new cells, the red blood cells will transport oxygen inside your body and the white immune cells will attack bacterias and other harmful invaders of the body. Unfortunately, the bone marrow is very sensitive to radioactive radiation and can be seriously damaged by radiation long before the rest of the body becomes badly damages. After a few days the body will run out of white and red blood cells and people start to die from either an infection or because they can't get enough oxygen to keep the body alive.

Lastly, cancer becomes the main cause of death only after someone survives a medium level radiation exposure or if they were exposed to a low level acute/ chronic(long term) radiation.

The average person is exposed to about 300 mRem of radiation per year. More so if you smoke, eat a lot of bananas, drink a lot of milk or dwell in a basement.

Alpha particles are, comparatively, very big and therefore very slow moving. They are stopped by your layer of dead skin. However, if you were to ingest them they can do terrible damage... y'know, because your intestines are inside you. Beta particles are stopped by your clothing, they have a little more energy than alphas but, again, being exposed internally is a bigger worry.
Neutron and gamma radiation involve much faster, smaller particles.

With getting cooked eventually happening if you are exposed to very high amounts of radiation, you also have the possibility of slower damage from radiation resulting. A cell will form more copies of itself. So if a cell is ""pinged"" too many times the cell produces faulty copies of itself, and then those cells go on to form faulty copies of itself, etc. Or perhaps the cell is too damaged to produce daughter cells and the cell simply dies off.  Over time this results in damage (this is what happens to people who tan too much and look wrinkly and withered). 

However, getting dosed with a small amount over time means that while you might sustain cell damage it won't be to the extent that your cells reproduce damaged daughter cells; which is why after a few days or weeks your sunburn goes away because your damaged cells went on to produce new healthy cells. Which is why that 300 mRem/ year isn't a bad thing.

In summary: radioactive particles are high in energy, which equates to higher temperature. Therefore the more particles you are bombarded with the more your own cells/ organic matter are going to either die, become damaged, or cook.

ixian_probe,"There are two types of radiation explosure, acute (all happens at once) or chronic (slowly over a long time). In the case of Elysium, Max (Matt Daymond) is exposed to a lethal medium level dose of radiation. It is important to understand that people do not  become more radioactive when exposed to radiation. Instead, their bodies are damaged by the radiation in ways that are bad for their health. 
There is also another confusing expression you need to understand. Often acute radiation exposure is called radiation poisoning, even though it is actually not a poisoning at all! 

The reason it is called radiation poisoning is because the damage that happens to the body resembles very much what happens when people are poisoned. If they are exposed to a very high dose of radiation they start vomit and bleed from their lungs, stomach and such within a few hours. This happens because the radiation kills so many cells inside their bodies that the body start to leak so badly that the body can't ""patch the holes"" fast enough to keep itself alive. 

For a medium (but still lethal) radiation dose the damage is still very serious but people will live for a few days before the effects occur. Inside the body you have particular areas such as the bone marrow where new red blood cells and the white immune cells are made. As long as your bone marrow can produce new cells, the red blood cells will transport oxygen inside your body and the white immune cells will attack bacterias and other harmful invaders of the body. Unfortunately, the bone marrow is very sensitive to radioactive radiation and can be seriously damaged by radiation long before the rest of the body becomes badly damages. After a few days the body will run out of white and red blood cells and people start to die from either an infection or because they can't get enough oxygen to keep the body alive.

Lastly, cancer becomes the main cause of death only after someone survives a medium level radiation exposure or if they were exposed to a low level acute/ chronic(long term) radiation.

The character Max was obviously exposed to a medium level dosage of radiation because he didn't die after a few hours. Hope this was a useful answer to the OP's question.",null,0,cdpu2az,1rq7w4,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

You will start losing blood. The decrease in blood volume will translate to a decrease in blood pressure. Your baroreceptors will detect this change in blood pressure and activate your sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate and contractility of the heart to increase cardiac output and thus get more blood out.

The most important organ in your body is your brain and your body will do anything in its power to protect it. It will cause vasoconstriction of the vessels that supply the periphery (fingers, toes, arms, legs).

Your kidneys will have less blood going to them due to you having less blood over all so it will start to fail (less urine output). Your gut and your liver will also have less blood flowing to them.

You will eventually get to the point where there is insufficient blood pressure to perfuse the brain and you will start to get drowsy. Your brain will try to minimise brain activity to reduce O2 and energy demands to prevent damage to neurons. You will lose consciousness. Insufficient blood flow to the brainstem may cause you to have an irregular breathing pattern as it modulates your respiratory rate. Insufficient blood flow to the coronary arteries may cause areas of hypoxia in your cardiac tissue.

so_I_says_to_mabel,"Ok, what people are missing about why activated charcoal actually absorbs things (yes the pores are important, but not the only reason) is that charcoal is made up of many carbon atoms bonded together. The surface of this carbon material has many sites of positive charge. 

When it is ""activated"" by being treated with oxygen the surface of the carbon many of the neutral sites and some of the sites of positive charge are changed so they now have negative charges. This leaves the surface of the charcoal with regions of neutral, positive, and negative charge. In practice this means that just about any material suspended or dissolved in a fluid can find a location of attraction on the carbon which it sticks to, removing it from the liquid.

It can then simply be allowed to settle out of or float to the top of the liquid (depending on the density of the carbon used) as it will have a different density than the water.

AtomicSans,"The main difference is processing power.

An animated movie, a Pixar movie for example, is pre-rendered on massive arrays of computers called render farms. The calculations needed take large amounts of time to finish, and if I remember correctly, a ten-second scene of an animated movie takes somewhere close to half an hour to fully render. This explains why special effects look so good. However, after the movie is rendered, it is turned into a video file, which is simply a series of still pictures played rapidly so that it appears to move (Oversimplified. If you want to know how video compression works, there's lots of explanations out there for you to look at.) Playing this video isn't hard to do, which is why a DVD or Blu-Ray player, which isn't very computationally powerful, is able to play such good-looking movies.

Games are quite different. Instead of being rendered already for you, your console/PC has to perform all the texture, lighting, polygon, shader, etc. calculations and rendering on its own. Also, unlike movie render farms, these calculations have to be done near-instantaneously to keep up with your controller/mouse and keyboard inputs. To account for this, game developers are forced to make game elements easy and fast to calculate.

TL;DR: ""Graphics in games and movies are visual effects that are created (rendered). Movies are pre-rendered using tons of processing power, games are rendered on-the-fly with your desktop machine."" Thanks, /u/MichelloDSloth!

TimeTravellerSmith,"First off, movie effects don't *always* look 100% realistic.  I can watch a movie like the first Transformers or Avatar and tell that something is CG vs makeup/model.  

Secondly it's budget.  Compare Halo 3 to the first Transformers movie, both released circa 2007.  Halo 3's budget was [around $60M](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/10/25/halo-4-is-microsoft-39-s-most-expensive-game.aspx) while Transformer's budget was [around $150M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_%28film%29), ~2-3x more than Halo 3.  So on budget alone they can spend more on VFX

Lastly is the process by which that graphics are made.  Game graphics and movie graphics use different processes and methods to created them, and game graphics have a *huge* power cap compared to film gfx.  Halo 3 is designed to run on an Xbox 360 whereas the vfx produced for Transformers were made on a highly specialized and extremely powerful PC.  The hardware just outclasses games by several orders of magnitude.  It also helps a lot that there is a live action factor in film that you don't get in games.  A game has to render *everything* whereas you can make things look a lot more realistic if you incorporate actual, real, physical things going on alongside it.

E-X-I,"There are so many factors that come into play when talking about longevity.

For one, counter-intuitively, our cells are built *to die*.

Only a small portion of our DNA is actually active.  A truly great amount has 'old' inactive DNA, which is how some people can [be born with lizard hearts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014134/).  There is also a tail end of DNA strands made up of telemerase.

This telemerase acts as a kind of buffer against excessive replications (it helps to prevent cancer to some degree).  Each time a cell is duplicated, part of this telemerase falls off.  Once all the telemerase breaks away, the cell is no longer able to replicate.  Once this happens across enough cells in the body, the animal is more susceptible to death.

Now, this use of telemerase is an evolutionary advantage - it helps keep animals alive long enough to reproduce and care for young.  That means that, among many other factors, these tails can show up in different lengths or not at all in different animals.

If a trait (such as a dog dying after 15 years) doesn't interfere with its ability to reproduce and spread its genes, then it will not affect its prevalence in the population.  Similarly, if another animal doesn't have programmed cell death but it doesn't cause say, cancer, to the point of preventing it to reproduce, then it will continue to live longer lives.

On another note, dogs are pack animals while turtles are solitary.  On top of that, they're warm blooded and require massive amounts more energy to stay alive than a cold-blooded turtle.  If dogs aren't programmed to die after so long, then their populations continue to increase at potentially unsustainable rates (at least unsustainable for their immediate environment, considering that dogs aren't able to import food from every corner of the globe, if need be).

Perhaps former populations of these pack animals lived longer lives, but eventually went extinct as a whole due to lack of enough food to support them.",null,0,cdpsqt4,1rqdm9,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3

Scientology has had a written program governing celebrity recruitment since at least 1955, when L. Ron Hubbard created ""Project Celebrity"", offering rewards to Scientologists who recruited targeted celebrities.

&gt; The Church of Scientology operates special Celebrity Centres. Scientology policy governs the Celebrity Centres (the main one in Los Angeles and others in Paris, Nashville, and elsewhere), stating that ""one of the major purposes of the Celebrity Centre and its staff is to expand the number of celebrities in Scientology."" (Scientology Flag Order 2310) Another order describes Celebrity Centre's Public Clearing Division and its goal, ""broad public into Scientology from celebrity dissemination""; this division has departments for planning celebrity events and routing the general public onto Scientology services as a result of celebrity involvement.

&gt; As founder L. Ron Hubbard put it: ""Celebrities are very Special people and have a very distinct line of dissemination. They have comm[unication] lines that others do not have and many medias [sic] to get their dissemination through."" (Flag Order 3323, 9 May 1973)",null,4,cdpsrxg,1rqf3h,explainlikeimfive,top_day,17

misanthrope82,"Guns are classified according to their action and their caliber.  The types of action for long guns (carbines, rifles and shotguns) are Pump, Lever, Semi-automatic, break barrel, Bolt action, Revolver, and automatic.  Pump guns require the operator to pull the fore end grip back then push it forward to chamber the next round.  Lever is where the operator has to pull a lever down then back up to chamber the next round.  Revolver (very few long guns use this) is a cylinder that holds generally 5 rounds that rotates every time the trigger is pulled, and can be fired either single or double action (cocked or un-cocked).  Break barrel is usually a single or double shot gun (rarely triple) that requires the user to open a hinge that exposes the spent shells to be replaced with new rounds.  Semi-automatic is a gun that has either a magazine or an internal magazine that fires every time the trigger is pulled until it is out of ammunition, fully automatic is the same except it fires in either burst or full auto as long as the trigger is depressed.  Bolt action has a magazine (detachable or internal) that every time it is fired the user has to unlock the bolt, pull it back to eject a shell then push forward to chamber a new round.

For Pistols, the same rules apply, they just have no stock to shoulder, and they have shorter barrels.  All of the same actions apply (I can't think of any pump, lever or bolt action ones but that does not mean they do not exist).

There are also black powder/muzzleloaders.  These are single shot guns that do not use a cartridge, are loaded from the firing end and require an external ignition source, like a percussion cap or a flint striker.  

Now to the numbers.  These indicate the caliber of the firearms.  Caliber is the diameter of the projectile in inches.  .22 is 0.22 inch diameter bullet.  .223 is a 0.223 inch bullet (5.56 mm).  The confusing part comes with the types of ammunition.  There are a bunch of different .45s.  There is .45 ACP, which is used in semi-automatic .45s and a very few .45 revolvers.  There is .45 long colt, used in revolvers.  There is .45 Heavy, or Buffalo, used in revolvers.  There is 45-70Government, used in big rifles and gatling guns.  then there is the big guy, the .454 Casul.  It is basically the magnum .45, only to be used in revolvers specifically marked for its use.  a lot of calibers are like this, so if you are buying ammunition for a gun for the first time, do not assume just because it says .357 that it will shoot in a .357 revolver.

The manufacturer and insurers in the US.  The pharmacist, the delivery guy.  

But also the 10 dollars you're paying in South Africa may in part be a tax writeoff for the company (they're selling it below cost) or they're manufacturing it locally with local quality control - which is good enough for africa but if you want to do quality control in the US or Europe you have to pay US or EU labour rates and that sort of thing drives up costs.

Poor countries (including South Africa) have basically told the drug companies that they cannot afford patents.  If you make a drug that saves lives you'll sell it for next to nothing or they'll ignore the patent, make it themselves and then the manufacturer will get nothing at all.

Drug production itself isn't very expensive, for most drugs, the big costs are in R&amp;D.  Companies make their money back by having patents and charging basically whatever they want.  But patents are up to a country, and South Africa has no obligation to grant drug patents at all.  

As a practical reality this system wouldn't be sustainable, the people doing R&amp;D all need to get paid and for every successful new drug there are a lot of dead ends in research that need to be paid for.  That's why patents exist at all, but of course poor countries are trying to get out of poverty by improving overall health.

[""In the wake of the 1962 amendments, the FDA’s regulation of new drugs became increasingly stringent and risk averse, leading critics to complain of overregulation. The bureaucracy at the FDA acquired a reputation for remarkable inefficiency and delay, with processing times for new drug applications (NDAs) typically extending to two years or more, and paperwork reaching into tens of thousands of pages. Meanwhile, the time and expense of new drug development increased dramatically. By 1976 the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated $24 million, 10 to 20 times as much as in the early 1960s, while development times had climbed from a couple

TL:DR: in poor countries they pirate, sometimes with permission of the original content creator and sometimes not: in rich countries we pay full price.",null,3,cdpyx09,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,5
sir_sri,"&gt; who's getting the extra money?
The manufacturer and insurers in the US.  The pharmacist, the delivery guy.  

But also the 10 dollars you're paying in South Africa may in part be a tax writeoff for the company (they're selling it below cost) or they're manufacturing it locally with local quality control - which is good enough for africa but if you want to do quality control in the US or Europe you have to pay US or EU labour rates and that sort of thing drives up costs.

Poor countries (including South Africa) have basically told the drug companies that they cannot afford patents.  If you make a drug that saves lives you'll sell it for next to nothing or they'll ignore the patent, make it themselves and then the manufacturer will get nothing at all.

Drug production itself isn't very expensive, for most drugs, the big costs are in R&amp;D.  Companies make their money back by having patents and charging basically whatever they want.  But patents are up to a country, and South Africa has no obligation to grant drug patents at all.  

As a practical reality this system wouldn't be sustainable, the people doing R&amp;D all need to get paid and for every successful new drug there are a lot of dead ends in research that need to be paid for.  That's why patents exist at all, but of course poor countries are trying to get out of poverty by improving overall health.  Trying to charge 110 dollars for something is simply out of reach for millions of people in the world.  ",null,0,cdpykd6,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1
eternalfrost,"Developing a new drug takes an incredible amount of money. You need a team of hundreds of PhDs to develop the chemistry, thousands of engineers to design and build the machinery to produce it, and hundreds of thousands of test subjects in clinical trials. 

This is all made much worse in America and Europe (where basically all new drugs are developed) because of very high governmental safety standards. In the end, each new FDA approved drug takes *billions* of dollars and decades to get to market. Drug companies start out very deep in the hole and need to make up a lot of ground.

Plus this all takes place in the crazy healthcare system and corporate greed cultures as other people have elaborated on...

It takes a billion dollars to invent a pill but like 50 cents to actually produce one. Sort of like how it takes a billion dollars to create a blockbuster movie, but 50 cents to make each actual DVD to sell. You need to price it way above that to make up for the development cost at first, but 10 years later, you can buy ""Ghostbusters 2"" for 25 cents it walmart because it is so cheap to make the actual physical item.",null,0,cdpzu8c,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2

wdmc2008,"One aspect that hasn't been mentioned is drug patents. In most developed countries, a company can apply for a patent for a drug it is developing. This patent lasts for 20 years and gives that company protection from anyone else who would produce a ""generic"" version of the drug. This allows them to charge whatever they want in order to recoup the costs of development.

Usually, companies apply for the patent long before the drug is developed. Then it still has years of trials, so by the time it gets to market, it may only have 8-10 years of patent protection left. Therefore, many countries also allow for a patent extension of 5 years. One notable exception is Canada.",null,0,cdq1s6d,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

kschmidt62226,"OP: You also must realize that, depending on the country, just because it SAYS it's a certain medication doesn't mean that it IS the same medication.  Many seniors travel to Canada -or they used to- to buy expensive prescription drugs because they were cheaper.  Travelling to Canada and buying is generally considered safe (if it's still allowed).  Other countries, PERHAPS not so much.  Buying off the internet has been shown many times that the drugs are not the same drug or a diluted dosage.  Unless the drug is something you'd feel physical or mental effects from, you wouldn't be able to know what exactly you were taking without lab tests.

EDIT: I have no information on specific countries and am not sure if travel to Canada by seniors is still accepted/allowed.  I am NOT downplaying the significance of purchasing inexpensive medicines in other countries.  I'm only advising you to be absolutely sure that you are getting what you pay for.",null,0,cdq3s5j,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1

dvfw,"The FDA requires that all drugs, before entering the market, meet a very large set of requirements. This means that the cost of producing the drugs increases dramatically, and so does the final production cost. The regulations, as well as patent laws, also serve to kill smaller competitors, which means the decreased supply of the drugs causes a higher price.

[""In the wake of the 1962 amendments, the FDA’s regulation of new drugs became increasingly stringent and risk averse, leading critics to complain of overregulation. The bureaucracy at the FDA acquired a reputation for remarkable inefficiency and delay, with processing times for new drug applications (NDAs) typically extending to two years or more, and paperwork reaching into tens of thousands of pages. Meanwhile, the time and expense of new drug development increased dramatically. By 1976 the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated $24 million, 10 to 20 times as much as in the early 1960s, while development times had climbed from a couple
of years to the better part of a decade.""](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1985/5/cj5n1-10.pdf)",null,2,cdptiug,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2
