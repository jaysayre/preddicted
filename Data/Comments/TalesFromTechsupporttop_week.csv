dazvn,"&gt; a friend of mine who is really into computers

The worst kind of friend. I had a guy call me up with a brand new 27 inch iMac and proceeds to have a 10 min rant about how expensive it was and how useless it is since his friend keeps sending him an email which he doesn't receive.

Okay sir, let's check the mail app first. No your an idiot I don't use the mail app, oh so how do you normally check emails, I open safari and go to yahoo.com (webmail).

After face planting the desk....hard I then try to explain that the iMac cannot be the problem since he isn't using the mail app and is using webmail, nope I don't know what I'm talking about, I send him an email to prove it, which he receives, nope still don't believe you must be this damn iMac

Then proceeded to call said friend and put him on speaker, said friend insists I'm a liar and just don't want to help and that he 'knows all about computers'. At this point I'm thinking since you know all about computers why don't you just sort it out since you think I'm incapable of doing my job?

I ended the call by finally getting some agreement that the issue is maybe yahoo and transferred him to yahoo customer services.

I bet £50 the 'friend' was typing the email address wrong",null,7,cdnppg2,1riix1,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week,29

One that comes to mind was the employee of a client who insisted, incessantly, that she could not do her job without having an all in one printer at her desk. Had to be able to scan and copy as well as print. Had to be a laser. She couldn't explain why to the owner or me, but she just had to have it. Eventually he got tired of her whining and told me to get her one. Fine, it's not my money.

I went over her requirements with her, selected a unit, made certain she was OK with it, picked one up and installed it. Printed out a test page and used that page to test the scanner. Left the test page on the scanner plate and put a few blank pages in the tray. This was over a year ago.

Walked by her desk a couple of weeks ago and noticed that the printer had a clock radio sitting on top of it. It was covered in dust. Looked at it more closely and found that it still had the test page on the scanner plate and the same few blank pages of paper in the tray. She has not used it once in well over a year. WTF?

While ""Xerox"" is a common term for a photocopier, in this situation we have two photocopiers and one of them is actually a Xerox and the other is HP.  If you tell me the ""Xerox"" isn't working, I will go to the one with that name.  That's not my fault, that's a failure in communication.  My time is valuable, so when I'm done here i work on other important issues.  Please take the time to use the right terms when communicating with me, or if you don't know them, use the most generic terms, like ""the copier in the closet""...""

DallasITGuy,"I hate printers. They bring out the worst in users. I've had pretty much every situation possible with them over the years.

One that comes to mind was the employee of a client who insisted, incessantly, that she could not do her job without having an all in one printer at her desk. Had to be able to scan and copy as well as print. Had to be a laser. She couldn't explain why to the owner or me, but she just had to have it. Eventually he got tired of her whining and told me to get her one. Fine, it's not my money.

I went over her requirements with her, selected a unit, made certain she was OK with it, picked one up and installed it. Printed out a test page and used that page to test the scanner. Left the test page on the scanner plate and put a few blank pages in the tray. This was over a year ago.

Walked by her desk a couple of weeks ago and noticed that the printer had a clock radio sitting on top of it. It was covered in dust. Looked at it more closely and found that it still had the test page on the scanner plate and the same few blank pages of paper in the tray. She has not used it once in well over a year. WTF? I think she just wanted it because someone else in the area had one and she wants to feel as important as that person.",null,2,cdndqsu,1rh0gr,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week,18

hicow,"&gt;Using 1 1/2"" sheet rock screws. So now there's four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table. Luckily they're covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table. They haven't penetrated the steel bottom of the case.

Reminds me of a story I was told the other day - Furniture assemblers have big conference table they're putting together on-site, as it's too big to go in one of the trucks assembled.  With it upside down, they bust out the screw guns and put the legs on.  They go to flip it, and it won't move.  They sweat, grunt, curse; doesn't matter, it won't move.  They call up the rep who sold it, tell him they have a problem, ""It's too heavy with the legs on, we can't flip it over.""  At some point they discover the problem - they didn't measure the screws, which went through the flanges, through the (very expensive) table top, and into the customer's floor.

You need at least 3 NTP sources to avoid problems like this - odd number being a key.  So if you have one NTP server appliance locally, if it won't let you add two more NTP sources from the internet (public servers), put a linux box in, and have the linux box act as the NTP server for your clients.

The educational organization that I work for had just started a 1 to 1 laptop initiative for it's students. Basically they all got iBooks (MacBooks hadn't yet come about). One day, one of the students brings in her iBook and it is smashed to Hell. The screen is literally hanging on by one *maybe two* wires. I ask what happened and she said that she had her laptop open in the passenger seat listening to iTunes and that some lady hit her head on. I don't doubt the story but I've always suspected that perhaps the head on occurred because she was fumbling with iTunes and not paying attention to her driving. So, I set about getting her up and running on a loaner laptop using Target Disk Mode (awesome feature that I wish PCs had) and amazingly enough, it still works. No bad sectors on the drive (thanks to the accelerometer stopping the HD before it collided with the glove box/dashboard on impact).

When you suscribe to a french ISP, you usually suscribe to ADSL with phone and TV. Then you get a TV box, and a router. The router usually has 4-5 ethernet port, WiFi and a RJ11 where you plug your phone. Then you have a tv box to watch TV and Upnp stuff and blue ray. It also come with an integrated HDD and is connected either by wifi or by PLC.

In France we have a great law made stupid because of copyright holders. The law allow me to duplicate Tape/CD/Vinyl/Movies/video games/whatever that i own as long as the copy is for my personal use. Copyright holders where not happy from that law (come from music tape/VHS in the 80's i think), so they managed to have a tax on blank media. When you buy a blank CD or a DVD or SPECIFIC TYPE OF HDD you have to pay a tax for private copy. This tax is then payed to copyright holders.

Taxed HDD include HDD sold in a TV box, but not HDD inside a router.

How else are they supposed to make presentations? They don't present in person in the business world, they make videos and show them! So they went and purchased some Sony cameras that only wrote to DVD. And then yelled at us when they couldn't just grab the footage onto their PCs and edit the videos.

By the way, how long ago was this? Nowadays NMR instruments are shielded so that the magnetic field does not extend more than a half-inch past the sample chamber. This should only have occurred if the shielding failed. (One of my friends who does all her research on NMR broke her ankle and had to get steel plates. She checked very, very carefully that all the instruments she would be working with were shielded). 

Although now my boyfriend informs me that the shield may not be up during the installation process, so maybe that's what happened.

That said, one of the biggest fears is that something would cause the NMR to quench, especially since the one I used in undergrad was stuffed into a closet. Rapidly filling a small space with a bunch of helium and nitrogen (a shell of liquid nitrogen is used to help keep cool the helium that is used to cool the coils, how cool is that?) is not advised.

Now I'm going to be pedantic.

So I'm in a satellite office 20 miles away from the main office, and if you hit the shift-meta key combo instead of the ctrl-metakey combo, it would error out, and lock your terminal window. 

As it turned out, 20 miles away it was cranking out this customer's entire history, every interaction with the company, and dumping it in some random geek's paper tray, and wasting up to 40-50 pages. 

So, the AS/400 guy doesn't know what's going on, but he can change the printer so it spits out in the satellite office. Problem solved, sort of, 
a few more random errors, more head scratching as, in theory, my access level doesn't allow me to do any of these functions. 

Eventually, I'm doing something, and it locks up again, so I point it out

Well gee, Einstein. Normally people stop pushing at the significant resistance and the sound of crunching plastic! (PTSD Zip drive story coming later, I promise.)

&lt;rantmode=ON&gt;

If people could just LOOK, LISTEN, AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS, our lives would be so much easier.  It's like the never ending battle of ""Click on Start"", and so many others.

The whole ""I'm bad at computers"" is a cop out that rivals the current economic state of the US Government.  If I am giving you detailed instructions on how to do something, pay attention and follow my directions. I don't expect you to know computers. I expect you to be able to READ, LOOK, CLICK, TALK, and most importantly LISTEN TO ME because if you ""knew computers"" you wouldn't be calling me to walk you through how to save a word doc. Instead, I'm having to use you as a remote console to be able to decide for you what action needs to be taken because you are incapable of thinking independently.

It'd be different if a user would call the IT desk and say ""I need help with my Internet connection. I can't connect to any websites and I've checked my connection. My IP is blah.blah and I'm using ManufacturerName router"" as opposed to ""I can't connect to the Internet WAAHHH!!!  This is all your fault! WAAHHHH!!!""....

Instead, I've learned that ""I'm bad at computers"" means ""I don't give a fuck about fixing it, I want it done for me all the time because you are my bitch"". 

On the other hand there are those rare (almost sacred) customers that are patient and actually want to learn.  I taught an 80 year old grandma how to do basic troubleshooting on a Windows XP computer.  She has not had an internet connection issue since! From the generation of ""I need to learn how to maintain this to keep it running for many years"", this little old lady now knows how to check her computer for Internet connectivity issues! Why do younger people have such a problem?
