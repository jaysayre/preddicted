When you suscribe to a french ISP, you usually suscribe to ADSL with phone and TV. Then you get a TV box, and a router. The router usually has 4-5 ethernet port, WiFi and a RJ11 where you plug your phone. Then you have a tv box to watch TV and Upnp stuff and blue ray. It also come with an integrated HDD and is connected either by wifi or by PLC.

In France we have a great law made stupid because of copyright holders. The law allow me to duplicate Tape/CD/Vinyl/Movies/video games/whatever that i own as long as the copy is for my personal use. Copyright holders where not happy from that law (come from music tape/VHS in the 80's i think), so they managed to have a tax on blank media. When you buy a blank CD or a DVD or SPECIFIC TYPE OF HDD you have to pay a tax for private copy. This tax is then payed to copyright holders.

Taxed HDD include HDD sold in a TV box, but not HDD inside a router. So Mr FreeISP decided to put the HDD for the TV.... inside the router! =&gt; no private copy tax!, and you can still record TV on the HDD.

FountainsOfFluids,"There appear to be a lot of non-technical people in here sticking up for the ""tech support"" person. As somebody with any experience or training in IT, you would not EVER do an install where a single color cable would be both cross-over *and* straight through. The entire point of different colors is to make them easily distinguished from one another. 

To have a pile of mixed patch cables and crossover cables would be *absurd*. It is indefensible for anybody except for real beginners to be confused in this situation. And why in the *hell* would you want a complete beginner observing an installation? They would not be able to absorb the pertinent information because of all the basics they don't have squared away yet.

Then proceeded to call said friend and put him on speaker, said friend insists I'm a liar and just don't want to help and that he 'knows all about computers'. At this point I'm thinking since you know all about computers why don't you just sort it out since you think I'm incapable of doing my job?

So we resized the existing partition to allow space for a second partition with Windows 95 (or was it 98?), and a decent display driver.

One of my colleagues got busted because he complained he didn't have enough space on his hard drive. The IT tech who came to his desk was a friend of ours and he was good at his job.

Back in 2004-2007 when I was coming across a large string of budget computers (budget as in, AMD 700Mhz-1.8Ghz Celeron boxes with SiS chipsets and 192MB RAM average) that needed repair, I would come across people who would catch viruses to no end no matter how much you tried to prevent infections. Others, were given ""dirt cheap"" machines that were not only slow, but had unlicensed Windows XP on them as well installed by the system builder, or did not have a COA attached to their system (not attaching these is against the Microsoft Software Agreement). For the COA bit, I'd always ask for these and the user very rarely was able to produce one, much less any documentation provided with the machine proving it should have a copy of Windows XP installed.

Whenever I came across an unlicensed copy of Windows, I gave the person two choices: 1: Either buy a license for Windows XP, or 2: I give the machine back with Linux installed. Considering people were not playing games or doing much besides check e-mail and browse the web on these horribly slow machines, they all for the most part, received a copy of Ubunbu with all of their files and essential programs to read those files installed. I'd also give them full blown lessons for the price of a pizza. Months later when these individuals have a quick question for me, they always tell me they're amazed at how fast the computer has been, and the lack of ""games"" in the browsers. Every once in a while I'll receive a call asking for help to install specialized software, and I'll gladly remote into the machine and walk them through installing the software.

It took them *several days* to fix an access violation of that magnitude? Oy oy, our coffee cannot repel that.

Sounds about the time when you document everything, go to the principal and tell him either the AD goes or you stop fixing anything related to it. Also, since this sounds like something that *will* blow up at some point, why not start documenting the security problems, possible problems and hours spent on it, with a weekly mail to your boss/principal.
