QVCatullus,"The Romans had indeed done precisely that -- breaking up barbarian nations and incorporating them into areas that were short on manpower. Sometimes they were left somewhat cohesive but transported far from home to limit their ability to side with their former countrymen against Rome -- hence everyone's favourite Sarmatians in Britain, for example. By the end of the empire, though, they had suffered tremendously in their ability to dictate terms; the best example of that would be the admission of the Goths into the empire under Valens and Valentinian that led, via brutal mishandling of the Gothic immigrants and poor handling of the situation in a military sense, to the battle of Adrianople. After that battle, the goths in particular were more or less a presence in the Empire that the Romans were unable to completely subdue, so it became necessary to treat with them -- consider that, after the fall of Rome to Odoacer, the Ostrogoths took over Italy, ostensibly on behalf of and with the consent of Constantinople, due largely to the fact that there simply wasn't much that Constantinople could or would do about it.

It's important to realize that after Marcus Aurelius, the shift of the role of the Roman army and the imperative of the emperors became much more, at most but not all times through the remaining history of Rome, about defending against other Romans than it was about defending from foreign foes. The collection of heavy forces into the comitatenses had a great deal to do with the emperor's ability to keep an eye on the troops, rather than a strategic imperative to have a strong centralized reserve. By the late empire, the emperors had reasonably effectively pinned themselves into defensive positions in Italy like Ravenna, and were more concerned with their fellow Romans and the threat of the the Vandals against the Italian interior than they were with whether the Franks were on a leash in Gaul. The Visigoth entry into Spain, for example, applied pressure to the Vandals, so very little was done about this by the Romans until Justinian I.",null,6,cdnqgw0,1rio7f,askhistorians,top_week,19
Jazz-,"Well the reliance was partly due exclusively to the urgency of the surrounding events. 

After the Battle of Adrianople the crisis of the incoming barbarians had become so large that Valentinians son Gratian panicked and made the son of his fathers Master of the Horse Augustus. This new Augustus whose name was Theodosius realized that something drastic had to be done to prevent even more tribes from moving into imperial territory. 

“Theodosius took a step which was to have grave consequences, though it was necessary at the time.. ” 

And of course as you already know, what Theodosius did was bring in barbarians to the army which will sooner or later transfer the power away from roman hands.

LDPotter,"Agree with QVC and also, the process of incorporation of tribal armies into the Roman legions occurred over many decades.  Stationed far from Rome, the local culture and the Roman culture were always in tension.  Moving troops meant moving entire communities - complex, expensive work - so incorporated tribes were left in their homelands and gradually Rome was absorbed, not the reverse as was the plan.  This was all exacerbated by the focus of Rome itself on maintaining the capital region, which was huge, rich and not particularly productive.  The focus of the worldview was extracting from the empire to feed the center. This didn't facilitate Roman leadership seeing the beggar picture.",null,0,cdnr8di,1rio7f,askhistorians,top_week,2
Grombrindal18,"It was mostly due to funding. The Roman Empire had a very large border to guard, from Hadrian's Wall to the Rhine to Mesopotamia, and needed a certain number of soldiers to man these defenses, which slowly became a higher and higher amount as the foes on the outside got more powerful. Say what you will about economic decline within, certainly that played a part as well, though I am not as familiar with the economic side. 

As Rome needed more soldiers, it was simply not possible to guard the border with primarily legionaries- they had to be paid more, had more significant pensions, and generally used more expensive equipment, so the balance started tipping towards auxiliary forces, which became the majority sometime in the third century. 

As for your statement about breaking up the armies of potential foes, this was done, at least initially, to provide the Roman Army with something it did not possess (especially cavalry). And in general, foreign warriors would be more likely to join the Roman army if they could maintain some semblance of their own culture- in units of their own tribesmen.

By the time that the Romans were relying on their allied kingdoms to supply most of their armies, it was already too late, the border too long and porous. ",null,1,cdnzjh7,1rio7f,askhistorians,top_week,1
Skolman,"Forgive me for the lack of citations and specific details as my materials on the topic are currently in a storage locker, but I shall attempt to give you the basic answer.

Yes, and no. By the final year of the war the south as a whole was in a state of near destitute as inflation was rampant and most of the labor force was engaged in supplying the confederate army, in manner similar to Germany and Japan in WWII. So yes, life was pretty bad as a whole. (This may just be my uninformed opinion.) But I believe there are two roots to the ""Yankee brutality/Lucifer's Legions"": first you have the major parts of states and whole cities that were pillaged by Sherman's March that were then burned to the ground as it's their citizens were still in their homes, but they're were other cities, towns, and villages across the south which suffered near the same fate; secondly you have the Prisoner of War Camps, such as the famous Andersonville, GA Prison Camp, which were filled over capacity and downright filthy and putrid places and claimed the lives of 56,000 soldiers, or approximately 12% who were sent to them (Approximately 1% died in German POW camps, and not by starvation, typhoid fever, etc.). But to simply stop there is to not pay the conditions of the confederacy the honor it is respected.

Sustaining the Confederate Army was no easy task when the majority of the Pre-1961 laborers were involved in the war themselves. The popular belief that most southerners owned slaves is a myth, rather the number is something like 1 in 10 families owned slaves and the average was 1 to 2 slaves, and that something like 1% of slave holders owned more than 200. Prior to the Civil War non-slave-holding white southerners, and even those who owned slaves, were often doing the same type of labor and living a slightly better life than that of slaves as 45% of the nation was in poverty. They were often sharecroppers and or practiced subsistence agriculture, meaning life was pretty bad. 

This life style only worsened as the war progressed when the men who didn't own plantations were drawn from their families and land to the battlefield. This often left mothers and women to try and run the entire household, so farming, even worse than their husbands often did, while simultaneously raising an average of 4+ children. 

As things worsened for the family, the confederacy as a whole suffered from what I'll term ""regional specialization"" (Correct me oh apathetic southern scholar if you would please.), that is there were distinct regions in which certain things were produced in each region, ie: cotton/rice/indigo/other stuff (if any extra was managed to be produced besides subsistence requirements) and often only those. As the War surpassed the expected end date of 1 year (may of been 6 months) these regions struggled to transition to support the needs of a nation instead of exporting it's products to the North and Europe. Combined with the Union Blockade and Egyptian/Indian Cotton providing Europe it's needs, the South had little to no economic capacity. Inflation thus grew steadily, with the help of speculators who would purchase and hold what wheat and grains were available until it raised in price even more, reaching near 5000% by 1864 after which it spurned to 9000% during the last year of the war. Yes those are thousand percent interest rates, and items such as coffee and bacon were quite literally at 9000% by the wars end. (Bacon was an important staple in 19th Century life because of it's fat content.)

Thus a vicious cycle was born: Families could often barely sustain themselves without the paternal figure of the household yet they were expected to produce sustenance for the Confederate Army. Those who did produce for the Army were then payed in sums which had no competition with the rising inflation, thus they had to try to sustain themselves all the while being worked, figuratively while sometimes literally, like a mule to the point of exhaustion and death. This cycle grew larger, faster, and more vicious each time it returned.

While the Southerners were being picked and prodded like cattle by the CSA Government, they were often at the whims of Union Armies and their smaller components. As with any war the invading Army often used the cities and towns they approached and occupied, often for months at a time, remember this was a slow war compared to modern wars. When Union supply lines were destroyed or running low they would often use what was in the house/town/city they were occupying as a their personal kitchen pantry and alcohol cellar. (Some commanders prevented this, some turned a blind eye, some instigated it.) This was a process that occurred throughout the war on both sides, but as the situation for food and supplies worsened the war also entered it's more southern phase thus putting the brunt of the Union Armies needs on families and towns which struggled themselves. I believe at one point near the end of the war, I believe it was some time near spring 1864, Generals and field commanders would instruct their soldiers to not leave anything that would be of use to the confederate war effort. This often entailed a complete destruction of grain stores, cattle, and anything such as guns and jewelry which the soldiers wanted. (I'm not informed of the nature of it, but I assume that there were instances of rape/murder among the occupied areas. 

Sherman's March is, well it's Sherman's March. There have been countless pieces written covering every aspect of it. Did Sherman sadistically burn most of his way to the sea while there were citizens inside? No. For the most part Sherman gave the towns/cities advance notice of their approach and informed the larger and strategic ones to evacuate because he was going to burn it down. I think he gave Atlanta two or three warnings and wait 3 days, but a CSA leader said not to evacuate the city was impenetrable or something similar. Georgians as a whole were told to stay put and fight, which made the situations worse upon themselves. Smaller towns and nonstrategic cities were often just pillaged as Sherman had no supply lines on the March.


An anecdote that should be noted as that both the North and the South participated in the pillaging process and the treatment of prisoners, so some of the actions taken were retaliatory; also of note is that the first phase of the war was initially fought outside the deep south, primarily border states and northern states so southerners often knew little of what occured and what the south did to the north, which was as equally disturbing.


Was southern life bad during the last year? No doubt, but as bad as some say it was? I'll let you decide.",null,2,cdnpoal,1rindw,askhistorians,top_week,11
seangt12345,"The South had a great deal of suffering because of their horrible economic conditions, which was then compounded when Sherman came through and committed ""total war,"" especially in Georgia and South Carolina. The stories of raping and pillaging had some truth to them, but they were greatly exaggerated in many cases. Sherman left many houses like the Henderson House in Dallas, GA stand along with many others. David Williams that teaches at Valdosta State University in Georgia wrote an article about women who rioted for food and supplies because inflation was so bad. The Confederate Government was also not reigning in the Planter class or speculation because those people ran the government. A judge from Paulding County named W.A. Foster wrote a county history for Paulding and according to the sources he used prices for boots, coats, and pants were into the hundreds of dollars. Meat was non-existent in markets. Bacon was $916 a pound. All in May of 1864. These prices would be absurd for us in 2013 so you can imagine what this looked like to the citizens in 1864. Now when Sherman came through he did burn and destroy a lot, and many people who had fled their homes to avoid the fighting came back to nothing heading into the winter of 1864. Citizens were suffering greatly but this was a combination of internal issues along with Sherman marching into the south.

l_mack,"I'm speaking from a largely Canadian context - and most of the literature that I'm familiar with revolves around the mining industry - but I think that there are some parallels that can be drawn between child labour in mining and child labour in textiles. Notably, I think I can address - to an extent - your main question regarding compensation.
 

Child labour in Canadian coal mines occurred extensively during the 19th century and petered out in the early decades of the 20th century. In Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, for example, they accounted for 16% of the mining workforce in the 1880s, 10% in the 1890s, and then 9% at the turn of the century. [1] Boys in the mines generally gave their pay to their parents to dispense with - this became less common as the boys grew older, but while they were living under their parents roof it remained common to contribute substantially to the family fund. That said, even young boys could often expect an ""allowance"" to be doled out by their parents out of their earnings. Children in the pits, often working alongside an older family member, could contribute to the family economy in non-wage related ways also. For example, a boy in the mine could work alongside an older family member - allowing for the allotment of an additional coal tub that the older worker could help to fill to boost their production of coal higher than normal and ensure greater compensation. These contributions - both in terms of additional wages and on-the-site benefits, ensured that children's contributions to the family economy was often substantial. For this reason, it would be economically - as well as emotionally - devastating to lose a child to workplace injury or death. [2]

Workers' compensation plans spread unevenly. In Britain, for example, the *Employers Liability Act* was introduced in 1880 to provide some modicum of support to bereaved families. Liability acts were also passed in several Canadian provinces in the late-1890s - but these were not ""compensation"" acts, they merely placed the possibility of liability for workplace injury at the feet of employers. Workers' families would still have to take the employer to court to receive compensation. In Canada, the first actual compensation act was passed in Quebec in 1909, while Ontario and Nova Scotia followed suit in 1914 and 1915 respectively. [3] In the U.S., this type of legislation began to spread throughout the states after 1910s. [4] 

In terms of child labour, until these pieces of legislation were passed the only recourse would be for the family to take employers to court. Unfortunately, social pressures would sometimes be enacted against families who opted to go for this option. Ian McKay writes: 

&gt;Those who had not understood the tight bonds tying families to the mines easily condemned the families who sought compensation for children killed in the Explosion of 1891 [in Cumberland County] or other mining accidents, inferring sordid profiteering from petitions more likely motivated by the desire of families to survive after the loss of an important breadwinner [5]

That said, sometimes these cases did go forward; Robert McIntosh describes the 1888 legal action between collier John O'Henly and the Acadia Coal Company regarding the death of O'Henly's young son. [6]

SplendourFalls,"I studied this in quite a lot of detail, so I'll be happy to answer.

**What was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of England?**

The political situation was tense. Following the Spanish Armada a hundred years before, England had become fanatically anti-Catholic, legislating heavily against the religion and generally subverting it until by 1688 it was a tiny minority - around 2% of the population. In the seventeenth century, your political allegiance was often pre-determined by your religion, and Catholicism was associated with absolute monarchy, whilst Protestantism became associated with parliamentary or constitutional monarchy and the rule of law (a lot of this is due to the propaganda surrounding the religious wars in Europe, and the fact that Members of Parliament were generally devout Protestants). I always like to use the analogy that 'Catholic' meant to an Englishman in 1688 what 'Socialist' meant to an American in 1960 - there was *very much* a 'Catholic scare'. So when James II, a Catholic, inherited the throne in 1685 and began *overriding* Parliament, going over their heads and using his royal powers to enact pro-Catholic policies without the consent of Parliament, things began to get ugly, and Parliament feared James was planning to implement a Catholic tyranny, an absolute monarchy of the type that had caused the Civil Wars a few decades earlier. *Even the Pope* was wary of what James II was doing and urged the king to be cautious. The tipping point comes when James II produces a son, a Catholic heir. Several high-profile figures conspire and sent a letter inviting James II's son-in-law (who would have become king had James not produced a son), the Protestant William of Orange, to take the throne with Parliament's blessing.

**How was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasion?**

James II had been allied to fellow Catholic, the King of France and archetypal absolute monarch, Louis XIV. When William is crowned king  England joins the anti-French bloc of states fighting in the [Nine Years' War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Grand_Alliance) in Europe.

**How was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasion?**

I don't know much about this I'm afraid. They had warred in the past, but James II did marry his daughter to William and they were big trading partners, and Parliament would hardly have invited someone hostile to take the throne. 

**Even if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England. Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes, England was actually conquered by The Dutch Republic?**

It would be very difficult to argue that. I certainly wouldn't recommend you make a statement like that in any academic work. It's best to see it as a coup that's was justified at the time by portraying it as a 'glorious' event. 'Conquest' certainly has far different implications and connotations that aren't suited to describing the events of 1688.

Now, this is the interesting bit. At the time, the British Isles weren't united under one crown, but were three separate kingdoms that *happened* to have been governed by a single person since 1603. 
Now, William didn't 'conquer' England in any meaningful sense, but he *certainly* had to fight for Ireland [in a war that lasted for several years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamite_war_in_Ireland) There was also no guarantee that the Scottish parliament would offer William the crown, though they eventually did in 1689, and should the Scottish parliament have refused him the crown William might well have had to conquer Scotland. 
 
At this point I should also explain a little about the term 'Glorious Revolution'. 'Revolution' only acquired its modern meaning (violent overthrow of authority) after the French Revolution of 1789, but as early as 1689 the events of 1688 were known as the 'Glorious Revolution' in England. It's because *revolution* in this context is more literal - it's a restoration in the 'coming full circle' sense. This is because those involved saw themselves as as restoring the ancient rights and liberties of Englishmen that came from Magna Carta in 1216, rights they believed James II was infringing.

I'm assuming this has answered the bit about why England didn't become 'a part of the Dutch Republic', but basically, that's easily answered by a quick look at the definition of a [personal union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union).

**How was the invasion successful with only 15,000 men?**

James II had *no support whatsoever* in England. In July 1688, before James produced his Catholic heir, the Royal Navy mutinied after a Catholic captain had Mass performed onboard his ship, and James had to pacify them in person, which emphasises the tension of the situation in England at the time. After William landed in England James was hesitant to engage the Dutch army and simply sat his troops in camp in the south-west of England, his men deserting in their thousands, having no intention of fighting for James. It was a total capitulation and the army dissolved almost without firing a shot. Interestingly enough the complete collapse of the royal army worked *against* William - he then had to spend months wrestling with Parliament for funds with which to build a new force to check the growing rebellion of James' supporters (known as Jacobites) in Scotland.

Hope this helps, hit me up if you have any more questions.

Also, a quick disclaimer: This is an incredibly Anglo-centric post and the events of the Revolution took on completely different dimensions in the other kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland, but you were specifically referring to England in your questions.",null,0,cdo27z3,1rik13,askhistorians,top_week,3
darth_nick_1990,"I'll just add my two cents:

**What was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of England?**

The British Isles had just faced the British Civil Wars/Revolution and Restoration. This period of twenty years, from 1640-1660, completely changed society within Britain. It had deep implications for the government, the monarchy and even the peasantry. James II was a Catholic king of England prior to the Glorious Revolution. There was widespread fear and disgust that he was taking influence in his rule by his Stuart ancestors as an absolute monarch. This would have undone all the ""progress"" made since 1640.

**How was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasion?**

The Glorious Revolution is largely seens as the only successful ""peaceful"" revolution. I say ""peaceful"" only in relative terms. There were some very minor military conflicts but when compared to other famous revolutions where regimes have fell or changed, there was very little blood shed. This was a very positive aspect of the Glorious Revolution and there was far less shock when compared to the earlier events of the regicide at the end of the British Civil Wars. William of Orange was generally accepted, partially due to his marriage with Mary, an English princess. This helped to legitimise their coup.

**How was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasion.**

The English and Dutch relationship was generally amiable. During the Dutch Revolts in the sixteenth century England offered help, unofficially. It was unofficial help in order not to escalate a war with the Spanish. Although the Spanish did eventually declare war on the English (think Spanish Armada) their was a concious attempt by the English to not officially escalate a war but also to help others which were politically and religiously alligned. After the coronation of William and Mary the Dutch Republic certainly became less of a priority to manage. This may be an offhand comment but it has been raised at other points in history, particularly with the coronation of James I/VI of England/Scotland. James I sought England as it was larger, wealthier and far more influential. A similar case could be made about William and Mary seeking England over the Dutch Republic.

**I read that a result of the invasion was that the dominance of world naval trade shifted from the Dutch Republic to England. How did this happen?**

I would disagree. Although the Dutch naval trade was very prosperous, so was the English. England had strong trade links to most of Europe. The addition of a further naval network simply benefited both countries. Although I am not a specialist in this area, I would imagine that this was simply a benefit to both countries, rather than an amalgamation of the two networks.

**Even if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England. Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes, England was actually conquered by The Dutch Republic? If so, why didn't England just become a part of The Dutch Republic?**

I completely disagree with this sentiment. I see it as the English parliament *allowed* William and Mary to take up the English throne. They were *invited* because: a) they had a legitimate right to the throne, b) they were protestant, c) they were malleable (compared to James II). Parliament could have raised another Civil War if they wanted to. There certainly was a similar level of distrust towards James II as there was to Charles I. Instead, they saw a different avenue they could take. I think your question relies very heavily on thinking the Dutch Republic had a superior military advantage, and that is how they succeeded.

**How was the invasion successful with only 15.000 men?**

Like the answer above, success depended upon the relationship between the English parliament and William and Mary. James II had little to no support. He could not muster a real defence. The 15,000 men were to mop up the small protest made against the Dutch and to parade down the Thames.

Hope that helps.

The mongols were very invested in meritocracy and were more than willing to allow vanquished foes to join their army.

Carol_White,"Well, one way we might answer this question could be by looking at a case study. In 1791 Benjamin Banneker sent a copy of his almanac and [a letter](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h71t.html) to one Thomas Jefferson addressing the very issue you raise. Banneker said that while popular opinion held that Africans were ""scarcely capable of mental endowments,"" the perceived lack of accomplishments on the part of the Black race was actually due to environmental factors, like ""groaning captivity and cruel oppression."" Banneker sucked up to Jefferson and hoped that his intelligence and humanitarianism would persuade him to admit to racial equality.

Jefferson's [reply](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h72t.html) was as follows: ""No body wishes more than I do, to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men; and that the appearance of the want of them, is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence, both in Africa and America. I can add with truth, that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced, for raising the condition, both of their body and mind, to what it ought to be, as far as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstances, which cannot be neglected, will admit.""

How should we read this? On the one hand, it's a rather progressive statement compared to his musings in 1781 that Africans were ""in reason much inferior"" to Europeans, and that Black men were more attracted to white women in the same way that orangutans are more attracted to Black women. Yet the words were not accompanied by any sort of advocacy. The best he could do as president was hope that the physical expansion of the United States would eventually cause the extinction of slavery.

Jefferson and his fellow men of the Enlightenment were on the fence about the intellectual capacity of Africans. They didn't have all the evidence. A generation later we'll have the rise of true scientific racism and the medical ""proof"" of Black inferiority.

ConanofCimmeria,"My personal favorite translation of the *Gesta Danorum* is the two-volume edition by H.E. Davidson, whom I just love unconditionally. It's a little old-fashioned but reads well and is very thorough.

You mentioned the Baltic crusades: *the* definitive book on this is imaginatively titled *The Northern Crusades* by Eric Christiansen. It's a very old-school work of history but a really great and informative read. William Urban also has a whole bunch of stuff on this, but I've not read much of his work. What little work has been done on these crusades (in English; there's a lively cottage industry on the subject in German and Russian) doesn't take anything like a national perspective, in part because they were a more or less international project, with various popes issuing papal bulls for them just as they would a crusade to the Holy Land, so settlers from Scandinavia, the German territories and in some cases even the British Isles took part.

This may be a problem you find throughout the literature, particularly because in the late Migration Age/early Middle Ages there's no such thing as a ""nation,"" so working from a national perspective is inherently anachronistic. Also, for whatever reason a great deal of our primary sources are more concerned with the west Norse (ie, Norwegians and Icelanders;) I don't really know a reason for this except that Sweden's Tre Kronor castle went up in flames in the late 17th century, destroying a large chunk of Sweden's earliest historical texts. Why there should be comparatively little to do with Denmark I'm not sure.

Sorry I couldn't give a more definitive answer. I am mostly interested in Swedish history (förlåt!) so I don't know that much about state-building in Denmark. If there's one particular aspect of Viking Age history you're interested in (eg, runes, mythology, material culture, what have you) I may be able to point you to some useful resources.

falafel1066,"Interesting question, complicated answer. A little history on both men could probably help illuminate the answer.

Let's talk Malcolm X first. Born into urban poverty, son of Garveyites, ex-convict, member of the Nation of Islam until the last year of his life when he converted to Sunni Islam, Malcolm Little (as he was born), had a deep hatred of racism, inequality, poverty, and the social conditions surrounding him. He lived mostly in the north, so the racism he saw was not necessarily Jim Crow, ""Separate but equal,"" but institutionalized racism through discriminatory housing practices, voting discrimination, etc. Therefore, he advocated a militant resistance to white racism and separation from whites. BUT, the Nation of Islam prohibited political engagement, so Malcolm X only preached it (until the last year of his life when he founded the pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity which worked to reach out and make connections to other similar organizations, like SNCC). The last year of his life, though, through his exile from the Nation of Islam, his conversion to Sunni Islam, and his international travels, Malcolm X's rhetoric and political advocacy turned more toward cooperation with the civil rights movement, though he advocated human rights (healthcare, housing, employment, etc) rather than just civil rights (voting, representation, etc). For more on Malcolm X, see Manning Marable's Pulitzer-prize winning biography, *Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.* 

Alright, let's talk Martin Luther King, Jr. Born into a religious family (his father was a reverend too), King promoted Christian love and non-violence as the answer to racism. Though King was critical of American politics, he ultimately believed that the road to freedom was through social organization that confronted racist civil policies, like segregation. Therefore, we have the Montgomery Bus Boycott as an example (whereas with Malcolm X, we don't only have one indication of him protesting publicly). King was willing to engage directly to bring attention to the issues. Towards the end of his life, King turned more radical, seeing how embedded racism was in the country (part of this was influenced by his travels north, where he didn't see the KKK or overt racism, but, like Malcolm X, became aware of institutionalized racism). He started to challenge underlying issues of racism, like housing and employment- issues of human rights, not necessarily civil rights. Sound familiar? 

Historians have recently noted how at the ends of their lives, King and Malcolm X seemed to approach an understanding of the deep roots of racism, and began to challenge the traditional ways of the NAACP or the NOI. Does this mean had they survived they would have agreed completely? Probably not, but identifying their late in life turns shows a remarkable similarity in ideologies. Yes, Malcolm X was a Muslim and King a Christian, but ultimately they found strength in their faith to fight the roots of racism in America. Here's what King wrote to Betty Shabaz (Malcolm X's wife) after Malcolm was assassinated:

&gt;""While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.""

So I guess I would encourage you to rethink the ""divide"" between these two men's ideologies. The history of African Americans' resistance to racism is often framed King vs. Malcolm X, non-violent vs. violent, when in reality, the truth is much more complicated (as it always is). But, if you want to look at factors that separate them, look at their personal history and religion.  For further reading:

The_Turk2,"Hitler was known for having a very loose management structure, much unlike Stalin in this regard. Hitler was bad with scheduled meetings, was sporadic, and left a lot of the actual governing work to his administration, and trusted Nazi officials. He gave the government direction, and government followed. He was always open to new ideas, and innovations in military technology and tactics. He gave his generals a surprising amount of autonomy compared to the French (case and point de Gaulle with the use of armour) and Stalin (pre-1942/3 about*...). 

Needless to say this had many benefits for the German military, and some downsides, such as Goering pushing to allow his aircraft to bomb and ""finish"" off the French/British at Dunkirk which he failed to do, rather than letting the army move in and crush them. You have to remember that Hitler was largely disliked by the Prussian military aristocracy that had been led by Hindenburg before his death. To make up for this, among other things, he gave a lot of autonomy to his generals, and as most military books were being written in German throughout the 1930's, he had a wealth of knowledge to choose from. 

This changed for Hitler on the Eastern Front, as the war against Stalin in Southern Russia began to stall (as Moscow was about to fall), he decided to take full command of all military operations in Operation Barborossa, in a mad attempt to secure the entire south, and the Baku oil wells, which failed spectacularly. Very famously he denied Guderian the chance to seize Moscow, but instead turn southwards. This allowed Stalin time to regroup, and push back against the Germans and her allies. 

At the same time might I add on the Eastern Front, Stalin began to relax his grip on the military, and allowed his generals, most importantly Zhukov to have a greater say in the running of the war, and battle plans. 

*Stalin gave in eventually, and decided to trust his generals, especially Zhukov. Can't pinpoint a date I'm afraid. 

TL;DR: How much autonomy a leader gives to his gifted generals, and its for sure a fine balance, can change a lot the outcome of a war. Foolish decisions for personal glory, usually end in vain defeat. Even Stalin had to swallow his pride, to allow Zhukov command. ",null,8,cdnrex8,1ribha,askhistorians,top_week,26
OiBoi,"You may want to consider tweaking your question just a bit, and replacing ""tactician"" with ""strategist."" In the modern military use of the word, tactics refer to troop engagements, battles or parts of battles. I'm assuming you mean more the ""big picture"" or the Operational and Strategic tiers.

There is some level of disagreement among historians about Hitler's ""brilliance,"" was he just lucky, or was there actually some genius behind his moves? That being said, I'm just going to outright support the former notion with my response until someone more knowledgeable shows up. 

Overall, Hitler made bold gambles at critical times which often paid off for him. His decision to march into the Rhineland, for example, seems like keen calculation in hindsight, but at the time Hitler could not have been assuredly confident that the French would yield so easily. Similar successful gambles that paid off were the annexation/occupation of Austria and the handling of the Sudetenland (first getting the Sudetenland at the negotiating table, and then essentially taking the rest of the country by force afterwards). People have a tendency to look at men who took big gambles, and won, as having genius (Caesar at the Rubicon, for example). When you consider the successes of some of Hitler's gambles, it's easy to understand where the myth of his genius comes from.

But not all of Hitler's gambles were successful; the failed Putsch in Munich and the invasion of Poland come to mind. The latter one ties in nicely with your question of advisers, as it was Ribbentrop (Germany's then foreign minister) who played a role in convincing Hitler that France and England would again try appeasement. Instead, WWII was started in earnest. 

The notion of Germany's success in WWII being largely due to the competence of the men who advised Hitler, or carried out operations under his general orders has some merit. German’s quick victory over France was largely due to the result of plans made by the German General Staff (primarily the Manstein Plan) in combination with successful implementation of Maneuver Warfare, aka “Blitzkrieg” (not unlike a doctrine practiced by the modern US Marine Corps).  The presence of a frontline commander of Erwin Rommel’s caliber should also be worth noting.

This brings us to the Battle/Miracle of Dunkirk.  By the end of May 1940, Several German tank divisions had roughly 350,000 allied troops trapped near the port of Dunkirk. But on May 22nd, a halt order was given to the encroaching Germans. Ultimately, the Germans gave the British an additional 4 to5 days to organize a mass withdrawal of some 300,000 men.  William Shirer stipulates in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, that Hitler gave this order under the advice of Hermann Göring, who wanted an opportunity for the fledgling Luftwaffe to annihilate the British and gain prestige.  It would later be revealed that the order to halt was initially given by Von Rundstedt, the German Commander, and was confirmed hours later by Hitler. However, even if Shirer’s point is ignored,  the mere fact that Hitler allowed for this delay and the escape of so many British forces, essentially keeping Britain in the war, is IMO at the very least strong anecdotal evidence that Hitler did not possess the military genius often misattributed to him.

Obviously, there are mitigating circumstances with Dunkirk, in particular the mechanical state of the German Panzers and whether or not the evacuation on that scale could have been reasonably foreseen.

I’m dead tired, so I’m going to stop here. My sources are primarily military history courses I’ve taken as a Military Strategic Studies major, and Shirer’s “Rise…” (I’m well aware of the faults people have pointed out in his work, but I don’t think his adherence to the Sonder Weg-theory much affects this question). Lastly, when referring to a “military genius” I’m using the term as defined Clausewitz.

vonadler,"I'll recap my [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16m1n3/how_was_hitlers_military_acumen/c7xa3a6) on Hitler's tactical and strategic acumen.

Hitler was not a great general, far from it.

His good sides;

1. He was prepared to side-step seniority and adapt a good and innovative plan when it was required. See for example Manstein's Fall Sißelschnitt plan for the invasion of France.

2. He was a risk-taker and would bet hard on small chances and narrow margins. Especially early war this paid off quite a bit. He bet that the French would take more than two months to assemble a serious offensive to relieve Poland, and defended the west with a motley collection of second and third line divisions that lacked much of their equipment. The campaign in Norway was also a prime example of this.

However, this is where his good abilities stop.

His bad sides;

1. He was unable to organise the high command and the war in a unified way, instead encouraging infighting between the OKH (Oberkommande des Heeres, High Command of the Armies) and the OKW (Oberkommande der Wehrmacht, High Command of the Armed Forces) and intriguing between officers for command, his attention and the spotlight, which gave them more resources. he had this fault when it came to politics as well, and encouraged infighting to ensure that noone fought him for the supreme position.

2. He was unable to take criticism, feedback or in any way take the blame for any failure. That way he would not learn and would not improve as a general. In the long run, it also meant that he appointed yes-men and commanders with political skill rather than skilled generals to conduct the war. All others were simply removed.

3. He was unable to see skill in defeat. Some German generals did miracles, kept their armies together and delayed the enemy and caused him massive casualties, but were eventually driven back - Hitler saw this as a defeat and would remove the general.

4. He was unable to keep himself from the details, losing overall focus and oversight. He would often study things in extreme detail and berate generals for not knowing where their battalions were exactly (which was the duty of the regimental or divisional commander, not the army commander) or industrial owners for not knowing details of armament. Generals soon had to spend hours reading up on the exact positions of individual small units under their command before a briefing with Hitler, time better spent on other things. Hitler would also place battalions and move them around, with no regard for the knowledge on the ground (the strength and readiness of the battalion, the local terrain, line of sight and enemy dispositions etc).

5. He believed in fixed defence and placed troops like they had been placed early ww1 - with all firepower to the front, preferably in fixed positions, to blunt an enemy attack directly. This is an amateur's view of war (as much firepower as possible) and in reality a flexible defence (with small outposts up front and most of the firepower further back) with a large reserve will allow you to blunt an enemy attack late ww1 or in ww2 much better. Line thinking, which goes back to the first village pallisade all through warfare until early ww1 was obselete - you needed to think along the lines of hedgehogs, outposts and large fields rather than lines, and Hitler could and would not.

6. He placed much too much focus on morale. Ordering that veteran tank crews that had been defeated should not get new tanks first, as they would be demoralised, so they should go to newly trained crews with high morale instead. In large area warfare, from ww1 and onward, morale was fed by food, sleep and getting arms and ammunition needed. Then the men used their training and fought for their comrades rather than consider any defeat or grandiose statements or ""signals sent"" by high command. Hitler believed in these grandiose gestures and morale and was heavily mired in late 19th century romanticist ideas of morale, nationalism and a national will. He firmly believed his ""not a step back"" order during the 1941-42 winter Soviet counterattacks saved the German army and that it was Napoleon's order to retreat that had doomed the French invasion of Russia. Most likely, if the Germans had used flexible defence, they would have lost less men and caused the Soviets massive casualties during the winter fighting.

Hitler was disregarded as a General by the German officer corps. He had not gone through officer school, he had not been a cadet, he had not been promoted to a staff position and done staff work, and he had not played any kriegsspiel (realistic board games the Germans used to play through potential battles at all levels).

I use a 4-rule guide to a general.

**Organisation.** Can the general organise troops so they fight welland the civil society to provide him with more troops, supplies and other things needed to fight. Can he keep himself involved only at a level above and a level below his own, to have focus on what he needs to do? Does he understand logistics?

Hitler was a lousy organiser. He inherited a strong officer corps and a good military tradition, and a fantastically organised army, but did nothing to improve it. Indeed, when it resisted his attempts at controlling it, he expanded his bodyguard (Waffen SS) to a full army, and that army was exceptionally crappy except for 3-4 divisions mid-war. He got involved at too much detail, concerned himself about 'signals' sent and much more.

**Tactics.** Can the general win battles under different circumstances, against differing and sometimes superior opponents? Can the general delay superior opponents and keep his forces together under dire circumstances? Can the general handle a guerilla insurgency as well as a line battle?

Hitler used amateur military tactics and early ww1 thinking, and refused to learn. He was a lousy tactician.

**Strategy.** Can the general see the big picture, can he use his victories to knock out enemies of the war, can he follow up on successes and not go headlong into pursuits where he will be stranded? Can he get allies and improve his positions without fighting? Does he have an understanding on how to undermine the enemy ability to fight?

Here I would actually give Hitler something. He was good at this. He knew the need for strategic terrain, knew the need for allies and knew the importance of raw materials. However, he lacked the planning for a long war, which brings him down from an excellent grade.

**Politics.** Can the general keep in position despite others trying to remove him? Can he get allies, can he work with those allies? Can he secure resources from himself, work with his seniors, juniors and equals? Can he drum warring tribes together against a common foe? Can he build a legacy that lasts? Can he appoint the right men to the right place and promote competent people?

Here Hitler fails again. He was unable to take criticism and removed anyone who opposed his ideas, filling the OKW with yes-sayers. He got into power and remained there, but that is also all he managed to do in this area. His legacy is destroyed and mere mentioning of it is an insult.

So, 1 good, 3 failures. Not a very good general, I say. If I would place Hitler anywhere, it would be as a Staff Major at an Army Command.",null,0,cdo0re0,1ribha,askhistorians,top_week,9

idjet,"Before answering this question I've reviewed the chapter to refresh my memory. It is very dramatic with multiple players speaking, like an episode of Law and Order.

We are very fortunate to have transcripts of actual inquisitions of this same time period and so we could go through a comparative analysis. But this would be fruitless: Umberto Eco needed to serve a story before anything. He made the choice to treat a session of inquiry, an *inquisito*, more like a trial for his dramatic effect. 

*Inquisitos* were not trials during the medieval period: they were question and answer between inquisitor and subject, mostly a dialogue that was lead by inquisitor. We have no evidence that there was neither some broad audience nor multiple subjects for these sessions: a lot of the transcripts have marginalia notations like 'ask so-and-so follow up question' and other manuscript indicators that suggest if there were other subjects in the room they might have eventually said *something* that would be recorded. So we gather the *inquisito* was inquisitor(s), scribes/notaries, perhaps noble(s) as secular witness to proceedings, perhaps Bishops, monks or other clergy watching and listening. Certainly we read stirring conversations: stunning displays of logic and argument; but not high theatrics.

Umberto Eco modeled his Bernardo Gui after the real Gui. Here is an example from Gui's own manual about dealing with subjects who attempted to double-speak or use the inquisitor's own language against him:

&gt;When one of them has been seized and is brought up for examination, he comes as if without a qualm, as if conscious of no wrongdoing on his part, and as if he felt entirely safe. When asked if he knows why he has been arrested, he replies 
quite calmly and with a smile, ""Sir, I should be glad to learn the reason from you."" When he is questioned about the faith which he holds and believes, he replies, ""I believe all that a good Christian should believe."" Pressed as to what he means by 'a good Christian', he answers, ""One who believes as the Holy Church teaches us to believe and hold."" When asked what he calls the Holy Church, he replies, ""Sir, what you say and believe to be the Holy Church."" If he is told, ""I believe the Holy Church to be the Roman Church, over which presides our lord pope and other prelates subordinate to him,"" then he responds, ""That I do believe,"" meaning that he believes that I believe this. [*Practica officii Inquisitionis heretice pravitatis* (Conduct of the 
Inquisition into Heretical Wickedness)], c1323]

Eco is a medievalist, a trained historian and philologist, and so his work would be accurate - he likes to put his medievalist knowledge on display in The Name of the Rose. His portrayal of Gui matches with what we know of him: smart, clever and a rigid, determined, dogmatic Catholic.

Qweniden,"In fact the oldest known archeological evidence of human alcohol production is from China.

Between 7000 to 5800 BC in what is now called Jiahu China there was a village where an alcoholic beverage was made.  Scientific analysis of pottery shards reveals a beverage made from rice, honey and either a grape or hawthorn berries.  We know its either grapes or hawthorn berries because those are the only types of fruits from the area that create a specific type of acid that was found.

Fermentable sugars would mostly have come from the honey but there are various methods to convert the starches in grains such as rice into fermentable sugar as well.

France was scared at this time and lashing out at anyone that was even tagently connected to royalists, so defending Louis would be impossible since the prosecution wanted him dead.

It must be noted that Louis wasn't a terrible king, he just wasn't the king France needed at the time. He let a financial crisis explode into a sociopolitical crisis and the people whom didn't have a voice had one, and they wanted to lash out at Louis for simply being born a king.

TheVitruvianDan,"The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England saw William of Orange overthrow the Catholic King James II and establish himself as William III. Hobbes was referenced quite a bit in discussions following James II's fleeing of the country.

The two broad political groups the Tories and Whigs tried to legally justify the overthrow of the king. The Tories (who tended to believe in Divine Right of Kings) maintained that by fleeing England James had, in effect, abdicated (he had left the throne vacant). Importantly for our purposes though, the Whigs began referencing Hobbes and Locke and others who espoused the idea of the social contract. They maintained that James II had broken his contract with the people through his attempts to destroy the Anglican Church (long story) and various other examples of his poor rule (mostly through ignoring Parliament and therefore the people). This then came to a close when the Convention Parliament declared James to have abdicated and listed all his failings as king and pronounced William and Mary (James' daughter) as King and Queen. This was later formalised as the Bill of Right. William, for his part, undertook to uphold the Protestant religion as King and to work with Parliament.

It is obviously difficult to trace Hobbes' exact influence on the settlement but we do know that he was one of the key thinkers referenced in the discussions.

The viewpoint you're mentioning here - that the Muslim conquests were the defining break with the classical world, not the fall of Rome - has become quite popular over the past few decades. Peter Brown is probably the best known proponent. Certainly Brown's ideas have been a needed corrective to some old cliches. 476 - the date when the last nominal Western Emperor was deposed - wasn't particularly important, as it was merely the continuation of a pattern of barbarian co-opting of imperial institutions that had been taking place for the better part of a century. And the popular notion that the Dark Ages were an era of total ignorance is nonsense. 

But personally, I'd side with Peter Heather and others in saying that , while Brown's ideas are insightful, they go too far in minimizing the upheaval that happened in Western Europe. 

Trade, population, literacy and the production of books, and large-scale construction all declined massively in the late fifth and sixth centuries. The change wasn't instantaneous and it wasn't uniform  (Britain was the most affected, Spain the least so; as late as the 630s Isidore of Seville was basically a old-school Roman intellectual), but it was drastic.  In the 3rd century an aristocrat could travel from Scotland to Mesopotamia without ever leaving a common cultural system, but two centuries later that unity was gone.

I'll post it here now and edit in a TL;DR when I'm done reading it.

Edit: as promised, TL;DR.

First off, we know that the original symbol for 50 was not L, but a three-pointed V, like a trident.  And we know that D was a D with a line through it (kind of like Ð).  And there are several early versions of M, including a circle with an X through it.  This will be important later.

There are many, many, many theories proposed over the years, some valid, and some not.  The one this guy is proposing involves set symbols for 1, 10, 100, and 1000, with 5, 50, and 500 representing those symbols cut in half.  

5: V is the top half of X.  

50: The original symbol for 100 (attested in Etruscan inscriptions) was an X with a line down the middle, which when cut in half becomes the trident thing, eventually simplified to an L.  

100: The X with a line down the middle was simplified to something like this: )|( Which ultimately became a C.

500: And the circle with an X through it, representing 1000, forms a Ð when cut in half, which became D.

1000:  The circle with an X lasted a good long time, and it wasn't until later that an M for *mille* became the convention.  (C definitely does not stand for *centum*, by the way, because the Etruscans used it first.)",null,1,cdnk753,1ri4qy,askhistorians,top_week,7

 Their association went back further though considering their alphabet was derived from them before Rome's establishment under the Latin people. These people would have come from somewhere in Northern Europe (most likely) and have been at the very least before the establishment of Rome been conquered by either Phillip or Alexander of Macedon.

 A lot  of what we know today about Greece comes to us via the Romans. Things like Art and Literature and accounts of historical events are of fascination to the Romans. They would have been aware intimately of the myths and the real histories often collecting Greek memorabilia as antiques or as family heirlooms. 

They endeared themselves to The greeks somewhat and tried to make themselves more like them, even claiming they had descended from the original inhabitants of Troy. 

The histories of Greece will have been studied also by people such as Virgil and Cicero and heck even the Generals with regards to warfare. There is reference to these myths and events in Roman writing.

k1990,"Okay, so this answer is primarily to do with the chronology and strategic progress of the war, as an attempt to explain why there aren't really many examples of Allied and Soviet soldiers interacting. Links are generally to Wikipedia articles to provide a top-level overview, as I'm at work and don't have time to dig out better sources right now. So here goes:

The primary reason for the scarcity of accounts is simply that the US/Commonwealth and Soviet ground forces spent the vast majority of the war fighting on entirely different fronts, thousands of miles apart:

- the USSR didn't enter the war against Germany until [June 1941](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_barbarossa), and was preoccupied with the challenge of pushing a German invasion back through southern Russia and the Caucasus;
- by that point (ie. after [the Dunkirk evacuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation) in May/June 1940 and [the fall of France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_France) in late June 1940) the non-Soviet Allies are not engaged in ground combat in mainland Europe again until [the invasion of Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Italy) in September 1943);
- the non-Soviet Allied ground war from 1940-43 is focused primarily in north Africa ([the Western Desert Campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_Campaign)) against Germany and Italy and [against Japan in the Far East](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_war);
- the [entire Soviet ground war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_\(World_War_II\)) is a push towards Germany from Russia through the Caucasus, the Baltic states and Eastern Europe and parts of Scandinavia, so the US/Commonwealth forces and the Soviets are divided by pretty much the entire continent of Europe for the most of the war;
- in the Far East, the USSR did not declare war on Japan until [9 August 1945](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War_\(1945\)), so played almost no role in the Pacific War.

All of that strategic chronology is why the main examples of interactions between Soviet and non-Soviet Allied ground forces during the war come from 1945, when they essentially meet halfway after invading Germany from opposite sides (see [Elbe Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe_Day) for a brief overview).

The wild card, which I don't know enough about to speak of (but which someone else will hopefully discuss) is [the joint Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in the autumn of 1941](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran), to lock down the Persian oil-fields and secure a key east/west supply corridor.

At the macro/geopolitical and economic levels, and in the naval war in the Atlantic, there's a lot of very, very interesting interplay between the US, UK and USSR, but at a ground-based tactical/strategic level there just isn't very much fighting side-by-side. ",null,5,cdnh9he,1ri35i,askhistorians,top_week,13
Acritas,"There were several areas of interactions - mostly lend-lease operations.

In 1941:

UK and USSR troops took control of Iran, advancing from south and north respectively. Afghanistan was also controlled by allied troops. 

Prior to 1945, areas of contact were limited by lend-lease supply routes:

* Arctic supply routes 

* Persian corridor 

* Pacific Route

* Alaska-Siberia Air Route

In 1945

* direct contacts between fronline troops were quite common. 

Let me describe in details:

Arctic supply routes (PQ/QP convoys from Scotland to Murmansk, after 1942 - JW/RA; also aerial route) were dangerous. There were several instances when allied forces fought together to protect convoys against Luftwaffe and submarine attacks. Yes, interactions were quite friendly, although incidents and misunderstandings did happen. For example, the losses of  convoy [PQ-17](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_PQ_17) could be attributed to decision to scatter convoy (blame UK) and to unencrypted radio message about convoy (blame USSR).

Iranian corridor was quite safe. Since each ally controlled a separate part of Iran (North was USSR-controlled and South was US and British-controlled), interaction happened mostly at checkpoints and between lend-lease operators (e.g. soviet pilots, flying lend-lease planes)

For Pacific naval route there were several incidents when US submarines mistakenly fired torpedoes at USSR cargo ships. In total, 6 USSR ships were sank by US Navy and 1 by Japanese. And that was the safest naval route.

1945 encounters when unexpected and uncoordinated sometimes led to friendly-fire instances, but such incidents didn't give rise to any significant unfriendliness. And when coordinated, it usually was quite festive - see [Elbe day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe_Day). 

As an example of friendly fire, Ivan Kozhedub was attacked by a pair of american P-51s and had to shoot them down after they kept attacking . Later it turns out that they mistook his plane for FW-190 (Kozhedub flew La-7).

Fish such as ""cod and bass"" had been caught and preserved in the summer. ""Indian corn"" had been harvested. The fowl you mentioned were one or more varieties of waterfowl that had recently migrated into the area on their way south. However, Bradford does mention other wild animals being hunted, notably turkey and deer. Speaking of turkey specifically he says ""they took many"" because they were abundant in the area.

&gt; **What did the natives bring, if anything?**

Edward Winslow's account (see the footnote of the previous link) is more specific about what prompted the Thanksgiving and how the Wampanoag became involved. 

Just after the harvest, Bradford had sent out four men to hunt the waterfowl coming into the region and they had killed enough to feed the colony for a week. The successful harvest and hunt prompted the festivities, during the course of which, the colonists fired off some celebratory gunfire.

The Wampanoag heard the gunfire and thought that there was trouble in the colony. Perhaps the colonists were under attack, or perhaps they had launched an assault of their own. Either way, it warranted investigation. Massasoit Ousamequin, better known merely as Massasoit though that's his title rather than his name, led 90 men to colony to find out what was going on. When they realized the colonists were just having a feast, they quickly hunted five deer, made a gift of them, and joined the festivities for three days.

**EDIT**

I found one other source I was looking for, [a letter by William Hilton](http://books.google.com/books?id=uMUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=At+our+arrival+in+New+Plymouth+,+in+New+England,+we+found+all+our+friends+and++planters+in+good+health,+though+they+were+left+sick+and+weak,+with+very+small++means;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftqUUvTbLafKsASZ9IDoDg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=At%20our%20arrival%20in%20New%20Plymouth%20%2C%20in%20New%20England%2C%20we%20found%20all%20our%20friends%20and%20%20planters%20in%20good%20health%2C%20though%20they%20were%20left%20sick%20and%20weak%2C%20with%20very%20small%20%20means%3B&amp;f=false) written in November 1621.

Anyhow, Hilton's letter, while not make specific references to the Thanksgiving, does mention several wild plants that would have been on the menu. These include walnuts, chestnuts, plums, gooseberries, and strawberries. He also mentions several species of fowl that could have been hunted: turkeys (as mentioned earlier), partridge, quail, and [passenger] pigeons. He goes on to boast about the bounty of the region, because this letter is intended to encourage others to move to the colony from England.

I should also note here that since Hilton is writing this in November, it's likely *after* the Thanksgiving. We don't know the date on which it occurred, but based on the context (recent harvest and bird migrations), it was probably in late September or October, rather than late November as we currently celebrate it.

myrmecologist,"In understanding the tumultuous last days of the British Empire in India it becomes convenient to focus on specific personalities. The cult of Gandhi or Jinnah, the tact of Patel, the dynamism of Mountbatten --- such epithets may have some validity, but they are largely unable to help us consider the events leading to the break up of the Indian subcontinent.

The anti-colonial struggle was, at least at the height of Gandhian nationalism, primarily a political struggle. Jinnah's positioning for greater minority rights was not too illogical in such an environment. Ambedkar, too, was struggling to garner political representation for the backward castes. We have to thus be cognizant of the fact that the reach of the Congress, while expansive and entrenched, could not be totally representative of the whole of British India. There were far too many factions with many diverse demands that jostled for space in the anti-colonial movement of the 20th century British India.

The demands of the All India Muslim League (Muslim League in short) were largely couched in the language of electoral politics. The League's fundamental demand was for a more equitable presence in the quasi-representative measures that had been initiated by the British Government, particularly in the 1930s. The League purported to represent all Muslims in the subcontinent. But such a claim (just like Congress's claims of all-encompassing representation) was limited and extremely provincial. The League had a massive presence in Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) and a fair hold of Punjab. It's presence in the United Provinces too was sizable. Yet, it could not contend with the organizational might of the Indian National Congress. As such, the bargaining tools at the League's disposal were limited. And this is crucial --- most of the demands that Jinnah presented were *strategies of negotiation*. The demands were meant to garner a few crucial benefits for the Muslims. While there was legitimate concern amongst the Muslim community (and not just among those who identified with the Muslim League) about the extent to which their rights would be safeguarded or violated under a Hindu majority regime, 
there was no concerted effort to channelize those demands to the idea of a separate Muslim nation. 

As late as 1946, with the Cabinet Mission Plan about to be bludgeoned under the weight of contestations, the League had no idea what exactly it meant through its recurrent threats for a separate Pakistan. Jinnah too was a product of the nationalist politics which birthed Tilak, Gandhi et al. His faith in representative politics was steadfast, and there is not much in his actions for us to consider him directly responsible for the Partition. 

By 1946, in fact, Jinnah's hold over the Muslim League had considerably weakened. The absence of a definitive idea of what exactly it meant to want a separate Muslim nation is suggestive of the inchoate nature of the idea. Jinnah was the League's ideologue and he seemed to regard the two-nation idea as a mere tool to ensure the safety of the Muslims and better representation in administration. The ground reality, however, seemed more brutally in favor of the two-nation theory. The 1946 Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta seemed to, ironically, legitimize the idea of an unbridgeable divide between the two communities. As the historian Ayesha Jalal contends, there is enough evidence for us to doubt this hypothesis. What is more likely is that other divisive factors, like the divide between the zamindars and laborers, the animosity between traders and merchants and of course the presence of various Muslim petty gangs seeking to profit from the chaos, magnified the Hindu-Muslim divide of the riots. The Congress, safe in its hold over the government formed by the Cabinet Mission plan, quite likely overestimated the extent to which the League commanded power at the ground level. The majority opinion among many in the League too favored a break once it became clear that the Congress was less inclined to negotiate with them. Jinnah, one could argue, was stuck between an uncompromising Congress, a hesitant British Government and an impatient set of followers. Converting the two-nation idea into a veritable reality seemed the only way to break the deadlock.

Jinnah, thus, is to be blamed if we understand history from the lens of nationalist Indian historiography. He could be blamed for highlighting the societal fault lines of the Indian nationalist imagination. Jinnah could be blamed for stoking the fires of Hindu-Muslim animosity. Jinnah could be held accountable for the hundreds who were killed on the streets of Calcutta, or for the many millions who were butchered on both sides of Punjab. Jinnah could be blamed giving birth to Pakistan, for its illegitimate child of Kashmir, for making the subcontinent a nuclear war zone. The Quaid-i-Azam could be held responsible for all this. 

But if we do so, not only do we judge the man unfairly, we also accord him an influence much higher than what he wielded (For if he was indeed responsible for all the ills of the Indian subcontinent, he had to be man of immense influence, right?). Jinnah could be *blamed* for India's partition to the extent that we consider the demand for a separate Muslim state of Pakistan illegitimate. ",null,0,cdnv2wc,1rhz3e,askhistorians,top_week,4
XenophonTheAthenian,"Oh boy oh boy, naughty words. I think I'll share one of the nasty phrases I know, and it's one of the tamer ones. We find in Aristophanes' *Birds* the phrase ""He's gone to the crows."" That's an idiomatic expression that's difficult to translate into English. What's usually said is that ""Go to the crows"" means more or less the same thing as modern English ""Go to hell."" But it's not *really* that good a translation. ""Go to the crows"" doesn't have a meaning *quite* as strong as ""Go f\*\*k yourself,"" but it's not a very nice thing to say. To go to the crows implies death, and not just death, but that your body will be lying out in the fields for the crows to feast on. Maybe that's not a big deal to hear these days (although there still is the phrase ""Go die in a hole,"" even though its meaning has been pretty significantly blunted) but in the ancient world that's on *nasty* thing to say to someone. It means that not only do you wish the end of his existence, but by expressing that wish you're actually *cursing* him. Plus, you're cursing him with a death without proper burial and funerary rites, doomed to be the food of the carrion birds, cursing his soul to torment forever (since the Greeks, like pretty much everyone else, believed that lack of proper funerary rites led to various forms of netherworld unhappiness). Not a nice thing to wish for someone.

With curses in mind, let's also recall some of the Athenian curse tablets. Curses are a frequent feature of tragedy, and in Greece curses more or less take the form of an invocation of the god or an oath to the god that takes a negative form. So instead of invoking the god for the purpose of blessing you or allowing an action to happen, you're asking him to harm somebody else. The curses were written on lead tablets and read aloud. These curse tablets aren't insults *per se*, but a lot of them say some *very* nasty things about the victims of the curse and ask the god to do some pretty evil things to them. A lot of these have never been published or translated, but they ask the god to destroy people's livers and lungs and other organs, to inflict them with poxes, to chill their minds and spirits, to make them deaf, mute, and blind, to go die in various ways (including many tablets that have been buried under houses or just underground with the inscription, ""Here I have buried so-and-so, etc."" Sounds an awful lot like ""Go die in a hole you S.O.B.""). 

In a similar light we see that many of the graffiti inscriptions at Pompeii are pretty insulting. They rarely actually insult people with swears or anything like that, but they frequently point out very embarrassing things or make fun of people for certain things. So we find that there's a famous graffito that says (in polite terms) ""Lesbianus, you defecate here and write 'Hello everyone!'"" A similar graffito on a different building actually writes a curse out: ""To the person defecating here: Beware this curse. If you look down at this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy."" There are a lot of things about taking dumps in Pompeii, and the Romans were big fans of making fun of defecation (rather like the Greeks, who seem to have found farts and penis jokes extremely funny). We also get ones that say things like, ""Secundus screws boys"" and ""Phileros is a eunich!"" and funny things like that (just as a side note, my favorite graffito at Pompeii of those that have been published so far reads ""A person who buggers a fire burns his penis."" Wise words).",null,7,cdnfb65,1rhwm4,askhistorians,top_week,49
caffarelli,"Okay I’ll be game and start us off by explaining the two nouns in my post: 

* COXCOMB: More or less, this meant like an uppity dude, who struts around like a rooster, generally being a butt. 

I also have a minorly amusing story about this one. I first came to know this word from Charles Burney, who translated [a letter written by Metastasio, who was quoting Caffarelli who called a guy that right before challenging him to a duel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1g4bp9/tuesday_trivia_reading_other_peoples_mail/cagoeak) Now, if you actually go look at Metastasio’s original letter in the original Italian, Caffarelli called that composer something *much ruder* than coxcomb, he called him “cazzo,” which you can still shout with gusto on the streets of Italy, and probably could be translated to “cock” or “dick” in British or American English, respectively. So Burney censored history a bit when he translated that letter! There’s no way he didn’t know the full impact of that word, having spent loads of time in Italy, he had to clean Caffarelli up for publishing by putting the insult down as the rather limp “coxcomb” in English. But you can’t scrub the swearwords out of Caffarelli’s magnificent mouth for long, haHA! I have put them back. 

* BLUESTOCKING: I love this word! A bluestocking was an over-educated and frumpy woman, as the term was used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It comes from blue wool stockings being a practical, hardy choice of legwear over more fashionable options like black silk. It was also the name of a women’s intellectual club in the late 1700s with such notable members as Ava Lovelace and Fanny Burney (daughter of my friend above Charles Burney!) It’s also the name of a [modern gender studies magazine.](http://bluestockingsmag.com/)

One of these historians stated that the best sources for finding uncensored curses were organizations composed primarily of men. Military Court Martials, which painstakingly recorded everything, were particularly useful.

Somewhat more surprising, to me anyway, was their statement that early American baseball rules were sometimes specific about which words could not be used on the field. As baseball became less a men's club game and more of a spectator sport, they had to be stricter about the conduct of players on the field. One of the terms that was banned was *""nob gobbler.""* This apparently means one who engages in oral sex.

ScipioAsina,"Hello all! I've been pretty quiet here recently (drowning in school and work), but I thought I'd share a Sumerian insult I came across in my research. B. R. Foster comments: 

&gt; In Sumerian school debates... the interlocutors plied each other with elaborately artificed insults about each other's genealogy, appearance, and level of education, presumably with an eye to raising a laugh in the gallery. An example begins, **""He is spawn of a dog, seed of a wolf, stench of a mongoose, a helpless hyena's whelp, a carapaced fox, an addlepated mountain monkey whose reasoning is nonsensical.""** The parents of a Sumerian scholar who is failing in school invite his teacher for dinner. After a fine repast and a handsome present, the teacher discourses warmly on the youngster's talents and prospects. (""Humor and Wit in the Ancient Near East,"" in *Civilizations of the Ancient Near East* 4, ed. J. M. Sasson [1995], 2464)

I suppose someone today could still find this offensive, though much of the context would be lost. The same chapter also contains a curious political quip, which seems potentially insulting:

&gt; An Amorite nobleman allows himself a political joke in writing to the queen of Qatara, a city in northern Syria. Acknowledging her dispatch of a shipment of small fish, such as her own husband, the king of Qatara, esteems, he writes, ""Just as your husband Aqba-khammu has learned to appreciate 'little fish' when in Qatara and Karana [two small kingdoms], I myself have always had a liking for the 'big fish' in Shubat-Enlil, Ekallatum, Mari, and Babylon [capitals of major kingdoms].

yodatsracist,"Contemporary English lacks a [T-V distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction), that is, we just have one pronoun for the second person, formal and informal (and plural and singular for that matter).  While French has *tu* (informal singular) and *vous* (forma plural and singular; informal plural), German has *du* (informal singular), *ihr* (informal plural), and *Sie* (formal, singular and plural), Turkish has *sen* (informal singular) and *siz* (formal singular and plural; informal plural), etc.  English has just ""you"" for the whole kit and caboodle.  English obviously *used to* have an singular, informal pronoun: thou (as an object: thee, possessive before a constant: thy, possessive before a vowel: thine).  When the King James Version of the Bible says ""thou"", it is not being more formal but more *in*formal.  For example, the commandment ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" is ""Tu ne commettras point d'adultère"" in French.  The ""thou"" just became calcified, and as we forgot what it meant, some people began to assume it was more formal as it only appeared in the context of formal, liturgical language. (Also, isn't it kind of freaky that the commandments are in the singular?  You, yes, *you* shalt not commit adultery)

So how does that relate to insulting people?  If you've learned a foreign language that has a T-V distinction, you've realized that it is way easier to be rude in those languages.  I've made an ass of myself many times in Turkish by using ""sen"" for a boss, state employee, or old person when I should use ""siz"" (people are momentarily offended, but give me a pass as a foreigner), or using ""siz"" when I should use ""sen"" (""Yodats, you're so formal!  Chill out."").  In French and German, there are even verbs for speaking in the formal and familiar with someone.  You can *[vouvoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vouvoyer)* or *[siezen](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/siezen#German)* someone if you're being formal or polite, and you can *[tutoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tutoyer#French)* or [*duzen*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duzen) them if you're being informal... or condescending.

In English, the verb equivalent is ""to thou (someone)"".  This is where it gets awesome.  During the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, it is widely alleged that Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, declared his utter contempt for Raleigh by saying:

    I thou thee, thou traitor!

&gt; For a man who could not have children (whether due to impotence, sterility, age, etc.) homosexual relations may have been acceptable. One slang term for such a man seems to have been *kottrinn inn blauði*, or ""soft cat"" as reported in *Stúfs þáttr*, an epilogue to *Laxdæla saga*, in a conversation between the Norwegian king Haraldr *harðráði* and Stúfr, the son of Þórðr *kottr* (Þórðr the Cat): puzzled by the unusual nickname, Haraldr asks Stúfr whether his father Þórðr was *kottrinn inn hvati eða inn blauði*, ""the hard or the soft cat."" Stúfr declines to answer despite the implied insult, but the king admits that his question was foolish because ""the person who is soft (*blauðr*) could not be a father"" (Jochens 76).

It thus follows the time-honed tradition of using implied sexual submission as an insult. I personally think it's rather cute.

[Here's a bit of detail from the Alutiiq Museum](http://alutiiqmuseum.org/language-studies/the-word-of-the-week.html):

&gt;Among Alutiiqs, behaving like a big shot can be dangerous. Boasting is not only bad manners, it can poison your luck. A boastful hunter may offend the animals his family depends on and cause them to avoid his arrows. In the case of a bear, boasting can cause the animal to become enraged. A braggart can bring starvation on his family or get himself killed.

&gt;Despite warnings about boastful behavior, Alutiiq stories feature the raucous, boastful Raven, an obnoxious bird that does great deeds. In these stories, Raven lives in Alutiiq communities and can speak in Alutiiq, but he is arrogant, dirty, and impolite to his Elders. Yet despite his poor behavior, Raven is smart and keeps his promises, and he ends up succeeding where others fail.

&gt;In one legend, Raven lives with his elderly grandmother at the edge of a large village. Here, he is so disliked that he must live off refuse from the beach. One harsh winter, when hunting was impossible, the villagers began to starve. Raven, who was always able to scavenge enough food for himself and his grandmother, asked the village chief what he would give him if he were able to bring the chief food. The chief offered Raven his oldest daughter in marriage. Pleased with the offer, Raven ordered his grandmother to clean their house and pecked her until she complied. Then he scavenged a bundle of dried fish and won the chief's daughter. But the Raven smelled so bad that the girl refused to stay with him and went home to her father. 

&gt;The next winter, famine struck the community again. Raven sent his grandmother to the home of another young woman and offered her food to marry him. She agreed, and despite the Raven’s stench, she stayed in his home. Raven then captured a giant whale and brought it to the starving village to share with all those who had treated him poorly. They gorged themselves on blubber, eating so much that they soon died. Only Raven, his grandmother, and his faithful wife lived.

AnOldHope,"We all know that religious conferences are all about being pious, right? So how about a (pious) death threat on the floor of a religious conference?

As Poterfield has documented, doubt, after the fervor of the Revolution wore off, was pervasive in the antebellum period of the US. Religious groups moved from prophetic statements to considerably more conservative position. Methodist views on slavery was one of those positions that we can trace the genealogy from a *respectively* liberal position to a more conservative one. 

Welsey, the founder of Methodism, had originally been an outspoken proponent of antislavery. His 1774 pamphlet, *Thoughts Upon Slavery*, was reprinted a number of times, [including in the US.](http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/wesley/wesley.html) In the pamphlet, Wesley argues that black folks should be immediately manumitted. 

&gt;O, whatever it costs, put a stop to [slavery’s] cry before it be too late; instantly, at any price, were it the half of your goods, deliver thyself from blood guiltiness! Thy hands, they bed, they furniture; thy house, thy lands, are at present stained with blood.

&gt;Arise, and help these that have no helper, whose blood is spilt upon the ground like water! Are not these also the work of thine own hands, the purchase of thy Son's blood? Stir them up to cry unto thee in the land of their captivity; and let their complaint come up before thee; let it enter into thy ears! Make even those that lead them away captive to pity them, and turn their captivity as the rivers in the south. O burst thou all their chains in sunder; more especially the chains of their sins! Thou Saviour of all, make them free, that they may be free indeed!

Wesley would even go on to write Wilberforce, the British abolitionist, a letter in support. Nevertheless, questions should arise about Wesley and how important antislavery was to his cause. We only have one extant reference, in Wesley's journal, to him giving an antislavery speech. In fact, Wesley's whole system of theology was about the gradual removal of sin while working towards perfection. Wesley's system lends itself more to gradual emancipation, but emancipation nonetheless. Yet, American Methodism would change its view.

One can track the continuous walking back of the antislavery rhetoric through the *Book of Discipline* (BOD), which outlines the polity of the Methodist church. While Wesley called for immediate release, the first BOD  for the US (1784) allowed, under the section ""What Methods can we take to  extirpate Slavery,"" for slaveowners to become members. However, the BOD does make a caveat: slaveowners, ""upon notice,"" were to gradually emancipate their slaves; certain regions of the country were probably more apt than others to give (a quick) notice. Additionally, there was a method to their emancipation: ""And every Slave under the age of Twenty, [will be manumitted] as soon as they arrive at the Age of Twenty-five at farthest.” In 1838, Georgia Methodists would argue ""[i]t is the sense of the Georgia Annual Conference that slavery, as it exists in the United States, is not a moral evil,” and no rules concerning manumission were needed for slaveholding members. American Methodism was far afield of Wesley's original call for manumission.

But I promised you a death threat! And a death threat you shall have.

In 1836, at General Conference (a quadrennial gathering of the Methodists, like comic con but not as cool, to decide issues of polity) there was a particularly acrimonious debate. Rev. Orange Scott, an abolitionist from New York, had just implored the church to embrace abolitionism. Speaking against Scott was Rev. Dr. Andrew Smith. Smith hailed from Virginia. 

Smith denounced modern abolitionism as folly, and claimed that modern abolitionism makes slaveholders into criminals against God; it makes slaveholders unchristian. Scott rose to argue that, if Smith was referring to him, then Smith had misrepresented Scott's position. Smith tells Scott ""I have no more to do with that brother, than if he did not exist."" Smith hits his point home: ""I wish to God, he were in Heaven,"" and while his words were not recorded perfectly, Smith added with fire something along the lines of wishing all abolitionists in heaven right now. In other words, and this is a point Lucius C. Matlack makes in his retelling of the events, that Smith had wished all abolitionists dead.

Just a few years later, in 1843, Scott would lead an exodus from the Methodist Episcopal Church. He, along with Matlack, would found the Methodist Wesleyan Church, a small group of Methodist abolitionists. Scott presaged the coming split. The next year, the center could not hold, and the Methodist Episcopal Church split along regional lines, north and south.",null,0,cdnqb93,1rhwm4,askhistorians,top_week,4

Naugrith,"I love the idea of flyting - which was the ritual exchange of insults in what was the ancient equivilent of Rap Battles. The insults were delivered in verse, and were very imaginative. Sometimes the insults were a battle in themselves, sometimes the precursor to armed duels. You see it in the Illiad, but there are famous examples in Northern Europe, of Loki turning up to a party to insult all the gods, or the famous Scottish example of The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie in the 16th century where two poets take turns insulting each other.

Nrussg,"edit: after looking at /u/idjet and /u/qed1 's responses I wanted to modify this comment, I put the edit at the front so people see this before reading the passage and retained the wording of the original post to maintain the record. But, I was a bit hasty in writing this and didn't pay close attention to the period being specifically asked about. My response should be viewed as a later evolution of the evolution of the system described by the two others, rather than an argument against what they said (as it was originally intended.) 

/u/qed1 's answer is slightly misleading regarding how the inquisition actually functioned. While part of the function of the ""Spanish Inquisition,"" which was actually two separate branches of a larger system, did have a mandate to convert and later expel Jews and Muslims in the Iberian peninsula. However, this was only one facet of what inquisitional courts did (this makes more sense when you look at the other larger inquisitional courts in Venice and Rome, which didn't have the same religious diversity as Iberia.) In truth, inquisitional courts were just courts that handled religious issues at the allowance of the secular power in the region. They're strength and mandate were variable, for example, in the Kingdom of Castille (central Spain basically) the inquisition did not handle cases of sodomy, while in Aragon (think Barcelona) the inquisition did handle cases of sodomy. 
Going over what specific cases were handled by the inquisition would be too much, but Christians were prosecuted.

Now for the why. Inquisitional judicial systems were based off a different, divergent idea of how courts should work. We are generally use to the broadly English derived legal system (huge simplification, but this is the type of court with defendants, witness, prosecutors, etc.) Inquisitional justice was based on confession as the primary way for establishing if the accused was guilty, and confession at times necessitated torture.

Tiako,"Unfortunately the historical sources are confused and *far* too late to allow us to use them as a guide towards the sixth century political order with any confidence. Generally, the most fruitful analyses attempts to see Rome within the context of an Iron Age climate of political multiplicity and loose vertical bonds within a community (basically, the elites would not feel themselves particularly tied to lower orders in a community). This allows us to structure a series of useful comparisons to better understood societies, such as Archaic Greece, certain Central Asian groups and even Medieval Europe, although that carries a series of complications.

Basically, the idea is that these ""kings"" were more the leaders of diverse and noncommunal war bands who could form and serve as a result of endemic regional conflict.

Forgotten_Password_,"Now is my big chance! Well historically, Costa Rica always prided itself on having ""More teachers than soldiers"". The war itself, lasting during the year of 1948, pitted Jose Figueres (with the support of old coffee elites) against the Teodoro Picado Michalski regime, who was the successor of the former president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. In between all of this was a radical thinker by the name of Manuel Mora Valverde, whose marxist beliefs blended into the local economic and social situation of Costa Rica into something he coined as ""criollo Comunismo"" or ""Tico Comunismo"".


Valverde's Popular Vanguard Party supported both Calderón and Michalski's government and in doing so, had some political influence when it came to social and labour policies. In fact, many of Costa Rica's current social policies, such as social security, go back to Valverde's political advocacy. However, his leftist ideology and clear influence made him unpopular with the coffee growing elite, who controlled the biggest bank in the country at the time. They saw the reforms of both regimes as detrimental to their own political power by promoting unorthodox reforms. Enter Jose Figueres, a somewhat questionable character who was kicked out of Costa Rica in 1942 because he created ""a possible threat to national security"". However, by the end of WW2 and the rise of the Cold War, Figueres realized the support he could gain by becoming an Anti-Communist, fighting the Calderon-Communist political alliance.




Eventually, by 1948, Figueres trained an army and launched his insurrection amid an election crisis when Calderon's party annulled the presidential election results (With the support of the Congress). The fighting eventually led to a potential final stand off in San Jose, between what was left of an already small Costa Rica army, combined with political supporters of Calderon (PVP militia and Vanguardista militia), and Figueres rebel army. 


However, the fight for San Jose didn't end in bloodshed and instead, political negotiations occurred with a set of treaties/pacts. Among which included the Pact of Ochomogo (Conserving social reforms, labour laws, and maintaining the legality of unions) and the Pact of the Mexican Embassy, explicitly stating the end to conflict. 



Now, the constitution of 1948. It must be noted that Costa Rica already had a small army to begin with since it began to decline in the 1900s. The last major battle that utilized the armed forces occurred during the war against William Walker in the 1850s, which eventually led to the famous story of Juan Santamaría, burning a barricade amid the second battle of Rivas. Basically, when the constitution disbanded the army as an institution, what was left of it had already been disbanded amid the civil war by the War Minister in order to prevent the victors from installing themselves as a military junta.

Snickerdoodled,"Crime and Punishment in Eighteenth Century England by Frank McLynn has a chapter on women that addresses this.  In short, for capital crimes other than murder, women were reprieved from execution much more than men. Also, women were more likely to have charges lowered and  less likely to be sent for transportation than men for non capital larcenies. 


McLynn's explanation is that women were generally perceived to be less dangerous to the community/authority/social order, and the deterring effect of the death penalty didn't work so much for women, as ""the hanging of a women was more likely to excite pity for the victim than reinforce confidence in ""law and order""""

Also the concept of coverture might relate to your topic. Since a *feme covert*'s legal standing was eclipsed by her husband's, a married women who committed crimes with their husband were assumed to be acting at their husband's behest. On the flip side of this, wives who killed their husbands were not guilty of murder but petit treason, which was a more serious offense and was punished with burning.

Interestingly, The rates of execution for people indicted for willful murder were the same for men and women, about 1/5. Women charged with homicide were more likely to be accused of murder as opposed to manslaughter than men, which may relate to the higher chance of a women's murder victim being an intimate rather than a stranger.",null,0,cdnpxpt,1rhum8,askhistorians,top_week,3

akyser,"First, to slightly correct the myth, at least as told by Virgil: Aeneas' son Ascanius founded Alba Longa, and then roughly ten generations later, Romulus and Remus found Rome.

Despite Heinrich Schliemann's supposed ""Death Mask of Agamemnon"", none of the characters of the Trojan War cycle have been identified as being based on real, historical people.  Roma was one town out of a number of Latin towns.  They wound up conquering the whole Latin people, including Alba Longa, and spreading out from there to the other people on the Italian peninsula.  There is no evidence of this Trojan foundation, either in modern times or in ancient.  Livy, the greatest ancient historian of the early history of Rome, tells us the whole myth of the foundation, but even he admits he just likes the story, and it probably isn't true.  However, it's really hard to do this sort of archaeology, given that they're looking for a really small town underneath what has been one of the great cities of the world for the last ~2300 years.

However, the Greeks *did* come to Italy to found colonies.  They founded cities all over the Mediterranean, but there was such a concentration in southern Italy that it was known as Megale Hellas, Magna Graecia- Great Greece.  Ancient Greece may have started within the modern political borders of what we know as Greece, but the cities of southern Italy and western Turkey (Troy, Philadelphia, Ephesus) could make claims to be as impressive as Athens, Sparta, Corinth, or Thebes. Naples, as a city name, doesn't sound Greek anymore. But the adjectival form shows its roots better: Neapolitan, nea (new) polis (city).  There was also Tarentum on the southern coast and Syracuse on Sicily, to name a few of the major ones.  But this colonization of southern Italy happened around 8-700 BC, several hundred years after the probable dates of the Trojan War, after the Greeks went into a ""dark age"" without writing and then got it back again, adapting the Phoenician alphabet.  There are a couple places in southern Italy that still speak (a very different dialect of) Greek, though it's debatable if that really had its origins in Great Greece or in Byzantine times.

These large Greek city states so close to Rome during its foundational period are probably why the gods map so closely, but have different names.  The early Latin religion appears to have been animistic, and largely based on contracts with these spirits.  If you didn't get what you wanted from the gods, you must have broken the contract in some way.  The god or spirit of motherhood, for example, was Juno, and all of Hera's stories and traits were mapped on to the name Juno.  ~~But there was no overarching sky god to be in charge of everything.  So they adopted Zeus whole, only adding ""father"" after the name.  Zeus-pater -&gt; Jupiter.~~ See koine_lingua's correction below!

So the Greeks did come to Italy to found cities, but it almost certainly wasn't Rome, and it was centuries too late to be Aeneas or anyone else from the Trojan War, if they existed at all.",null,4,cdnftcr,1rhtyy,askhistorians,top_week,23

ssflanders,"The question seems to imply that before recorded music there was only classical music. Pop music before recording technology was much closer to what we call ""folk music"" today -- it was played and spread around by everyday people, not the elite orchestras in grand concert halls. Think of the songs everybody knew like Yankee Doodle Dandy or Swannee River, the songs that slaves sang in the fields, etc.

The idea of a ""professional musician"" was not unknown, but certainly very unusual in most people's experience. Usually you just performed it yourself, or listened while friends and neighbors performed it. With the growth of a prosperous middle class in the latter half of the 19th century (speaking of the U.S. here, although it was true elsewhere), a piano become something almost everybody had in their home, and the ability to play piano and sing was very widespread. The predecessor of recordings was printed sheet music, and sheet music publishers were the first wave of what we know now as the Music Business, and a song's popularity was measured in sheet music sales.

The first blockbuster pop hit was the sheet music of Alexander's Ragtime Band, a composition by Irving Berlin which borrowed heavily from traditional black folk music (a pattern which, incidentally, would continue through almost every form of pop music up through the present day).

Recording and broadcast technology essentially ended the practice of mass musical ability, beginning with the player piano, then wax disks and radios, and finally vinyl, TV, 8-track, cassette, CD, and mp3.

caffarelli,"Okay, the modern classical canon. Who actually listened to this stuff back then? 

* Was it a prerogative of the rich?

By and large, yes. Art takes money, rich people funded and kept most baroque/classical music going. Opera houses made their money a couple of ways, one was subscriptions (rich family would rent a box for the season), and then the floor seats which would be sold ad hoc to merchant class people. Here’s an interesting consideration -- if you bought a floor seat ticket, it was just benches, no assigned seats with numbers, so you’d customarily send a maid or manservant ahead of time to go physically save your seat. If you even went to opera on the CHEAP you probably had a servant or two. 

Rich patrons (right up to royalty, so state sponsorship almost like modern NEA grants!) would both fund opera houses, and directly patronize singers and composers. Lotsa rich people. 

But here was a way to get yourself some live music on the cheap if you were poor -- go to church! Organs, famous composers, real live castrati, quality music making all around. 

* Was going to operas expensive? 

Once again, by and large, yes. If you have access to Jstor check out [Patronizing Handel, Inventing Audiences: The Intersections of Class, Money, Music and History](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3518970?uid=3739656&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102794966243) which is a great breakdown for opera's unaffordability in 18th century England. I'll quote the choice bits with nice numbers: 

&gt;Households with family incomes above £200 comprised a tiny 3-4 per cent, some 53,000 families in all, of which perhaps 5,000—6,000 lived in London year-round or for the season. An income of £200 was probably too low to support regular attendance at the Italian opera and oratorio, given the high ticket and subscription prices for those entertainments. Raising the minimum to £400 reduces the potential purchasers to a minuscule 0.82 per cent nationwide (12,670 families in 1755). The labouring and destitute poor, among whom £20 annual family income was considered subsistence level, constituted the vast bulk of the population (84 per cent). Today's more egalitarian distribution of income (and therefore access to, for example, classical concerts) is in striking contrast. [...] It is apparent from table 3 that tickets for Italian opera and oratorio were 2.5 to 4 times the cost of those for ordinary dramatic productions [...]

* Were there cheaper copycats in cheaper theaters? 

Sort of. Not really knock offs, but there was staged music going on contemporary to opera that was more geared towards the middle class. *The Beggar’s Opera* was a “ballad opera” in English (not a “proper” opera because it doesn’t have recitative) that was EXTREMELY popular in its day, which was making fun of opera conventions. It’s still popular, it even has a later “remix” called *Threepenny Opera* which gives us the jazz standard “Mack the Knife.” But doing a knock off opera seria would have kinda sucked, the main draw was the famous celebrity singers and the lavish stagecraft, not the music. Comedy was usually a better seller. 

* Aliens? 

No aliens, unless you mean “foreigners.” Opera was very much an Italian export and therefore associated in the 18th century English mind with all sorts of negative foreign things like decadence, fashion, and “buggery.” All the eunuchs involved in the music business didn’t help it’s reputation much either. ;)

This is kinda a quick and dirty overview, but it’s hard to lump all the entire NPR Classical music station together in one comment! Add to that not all opera we call operas now were considered operas back then, like *Magic Flute.* If you have a question about a particular work I can probably tell you what classes might have originally consumed it.

In 1282 the Edwardian conquest of Wales and death of Llywelyn ein Llyw Olaf  (Llywelyn our last prince). This marked the end of an 'independent' Welsh principality and Edward II became the first English Prince of Wales. 1400 beginning of the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr (d.1415/1416) Although not much is known of him post 1412, his death has been blamed in Welsh folklore on the English.

1936 Burning of the bombing school, an RAF bombing school was built on a farmhouse on Penhros which had been home to countless poets and their patrons. The burning was justified because the Llŷn Peninsula was ‘an essential focus of this Welsh culture, the most aristocratic spiritual heritage of Wales.' [Saunders Lewis]

1960s growth of militant nationalist groups

Saunders Lewis describes Welsh Nationalism as;
&gt; ""What then is our nationalism?  It is this: to return to the principle of the Middle Ages; to repudiate the idea of political uniformity, and to expose its ill-effects; to plead therefore for the principle of unity and diversity.  To fight not for Welsh independence, but for the civilization of Wales.  To claim for Wales not independence but freedom.  And to claim for her a place in the League of Nations and in the community of Europe , by virtue of her civilization and its values""

Conservative cultural nationalists have placed an emphasis on preserving distinct features of medieval society in the 20th century. This has been criticised by the historian J.E. Lloyd as the medievalism of nationalist leaders of Wales easily creates a mystical an romantic image of an independent Wales, this view ignores the poverty and precariousness of life in the Middle Ages. Resurrecting these old traditions and mindsets is quite different from transmitting a living culture. Much of this idealisation is rooted in its literature, and at its focal point is the Welsh language as a protector of Classical and Christian traditions.
Gwynfor Evans sums up the importance of the Welsh language in Nationalism:
&gt; ""Wales has a great national heritage. The Welsh poetic tradition, for example, stretches back in unbroken line to the sixth century. For many centuries the Welsh language has been under attack and under siege. Its survival is the crowning glory of Welsh history. It is the enduring badge of our self-respect; the hall-mark of our identity"".

**Welsh Nationalism and historical injustices**

A narrative of historical injustice has been cultivated to justify contemporary political nationalism and its aims. This promotes links between historical 'injustices' and contemporary 'wrongs'.
One such example is the link made between the Acts Of Union 1536-1542/43 leading to 20th century political impotence, meaning a decline in the Welsh language, and economic decline.

Overall the rivalry has developed over time due to popular narratives becoming part of Welsh culture. Dr Ceinwen Thomas suggest the idea that the duty of the Welsh is to restore the heroic past of Wales. But by doing so should be aware that, as a subject nation Welsh history has been interpreted for them by their conquerors (the English) and those who have been educated in their schools. The history of the nation has been presented to the Welsh through English eyes.

You can see how this heritage has led to the rivalry we see today through Welsh rugby union captain Phill Bennet's pre match talk for England vs. Wales in 1977:
&gt;""Look what these bastards have done to Wales. They've taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our homes and live in them for a fortnight every year. What have they given us?

Properly stocked, you could hold out as long at your stocks held out and your water supply lasted.  There was no convenient bottled water at the time so the usual fall back was to be a cistern either in the shelter structure or under a sheltering structure for that purpose nearby.

Nature was included into the equation because it was expected that the first rain after the event(s) would wash away some of the fallout.

(Even military/presidential shelters could only take so many megatons directly.) This sort of thing becomes more important in the suburbs than it does the areas of direct targeting — i.e. in the vast regions where the blast effects are enough to collapse civilian structures and break windows (e.g. 1-5 psi overpressure) and the thermal effects are enough to burn flesh or start small fires.

* Protection from radioactive fallout. Nuclear weapons that detonate on or near the ground mix with debris and dirt and the result is that highly-radioactive by-products ""fall out"" of the nuclear cloud within a few hours to a few days of detonation. The initial radioactivity of these by-products can be _very_ high — enough to kill you, give you radiation sickness, or dramatically increase your lifetime cancer risk. However things this radioactive do not stick around long. The more radioactive something is, the shorter its half-life, and the less time it sticks around. The consequence of this is that for the first week or so, the area immediately downwind of the blast can be incredibly radioactive and dangerous. If you stay inside for that amount of time, then you avoid most of the radiation. After a week or so, the radiation drops to levels safe to travel through (though not necessarily to live in). Note that airbursts, which are used against ""soft"" targets like cities, do not create the same level of contamination at all.

Fallout shelters were never intended to save everyone. What they were intended to do was to increase the total survivability of the population. Even just making sure people don't walk through the contaminated areas in the first week or so can (in various simulations and models) save hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives. 

Now one can look at this and say... well. You've saved several million people, but we're still talking about many many millions dead. That doesn't seem like a great success to me. And there is something to that. On the other hand, if you are a government bureaucrat, and your options are ""don't do anything to try and save lives"" versus ""do what you can, even if it is inadequate,"" you can see why they went with the latter approach. And hey, a hundred thousand or a million saved lives is nothing to sniff at. 

I will note that my reading of the FCDA files indicates that most of them were boring, hard-working bureaucrats assigned a kind of impossible job under terrible conditions (including the fact that they were not cleared to know a lot of weapons effects information or information about the composition of the US or Soviet stockpiles). I have never seen anything that indicated to me that they were really trying to hood-wink the public or anything like that. Whether that was an inadvertent or inevitable consequence is a separate question, but the notion that these people were trying to pull a grand shuck doesn't seem right to me. 

The reason fallout shelters get such a bad rap is that their purpose is often misunderstood (they are not meant to protect you from a direct hit, they are not meant to be inhabited for months or years), and because survivability is a grim business. Civil Defense in general is easy to criticize. There is something to the notion that a nation that thinks it can ""survive"" nuclear war might be more eager to get into one, but I've never seen evidence that US civilian officials were actually was that keen on getting into a nuclear war. A lot of the criticisms of Civil Defense, however, are just rooted in a criticism of the broader Cold War nuclear context. Which, of course, one gets. But given that ""everybody just play nice and get rid of nukes"" was never really on the table in a realistic sense, I don't really see what that gets us, either as an understanding of the past or a prescription for the present.

thebullfrog72,"TL;DR Structural Engineering, Sources are fairly non-existent, I go through a pretty fringe argument at the end - it is useful in that it draws on common similarities and allows me to address each in turn. 

The pyramids that are so widespread are the Step Pyramid variety, which were built throughout the world. Although overshadowed by the Pyramids of Giza, Step Pyramids were the predecessor for these massive structures. 

Short answer, similar to why arches became ubiquitous; it's the best way to build large and tall structures that don't fall down, and remain stable over a long time. Without access to lighter building materials that would allow for greater vertical height, such as wood and metal, Step Pyramids were by far the most feasible, tall structures to build. The more ambitious Great Pyramid of Giza remained the tallest structure in the world until a new 150m spire was added to the Lincoln Cathedral in England, although that spire did collapse after just over 200 years. 

I'm not sure if you've tried to do any research on this yourself, but you will find yourself quickly in a realm of pseudoscience and pseudo-history that has come to dominate the topic. I'll go through one below.  

[This piece argues](http://thegreaterpicture.com/pyramids.html) that the pyramids around the world were built to honor aliens, using as evidence these common characteristics, some that are very common when looking at pyramid pseudo-science, and are the ones that on the surface make a connection seem clear:

&gt;The triangular form with a square base
&gt;

Engineering, like above, the best way to build a sturdy structure, one that is also as tall as possible. Having a cube structure would require more material for less height. 
 
&gt; The sides face the cardinal directions precisely

This claim only works with the Mayan step pyramids and the Egyptian Great Pyramids, it falls apart when dealing with the Temple of the Moon in Mexico and Borobudur in Indonesia. Both the Mayan and Egyptian cultures placed importance on solstice/equinox days, and worked to align their major, large-scale religious structures accordingly. 

&gt; They lie around the ""celestial equator"" (16) (the line that would be &gt;our equator if the Earth' axis wasn't tilted)

The Jared Diamond hate is mostly justified, but it was the place I encountered the counter-argument to the Europe-centric theory of geographic determinism, whereby a country's success is greatly affected by its distance from the equator. Prior to European advances, the reverse holds just as true, with numerous vast empires arising on this 'celestial equator,' closer to the equator than geographic determinism would account for. The climate allows for substantial agriculture, and the pseudo-science would extend to Mesopotamian and South East Asian civilizations, if they worked with the arguments. 

&gt; They contain all types of corridors and chambers

They were religious buildings, with the exception of Egypt meant to be used regularly, and Egyptian mythology provides the explanation for why large chambers, filled with supplies, would be necessary in their construction.  

&gt; They are made of stone (though most Chinese pyramids are made of &gt;a type of hard earth and some are even made of iron)

See available building materials above, various types of stone were used as they were around and provided durable structures. 

&gt; They are built the same way, on a base of large, uneven stone blocks &gt;that fit together seamlessly. This ground plane is extremely resistant to &gt;earthquakes

This point argues that they all build a strong base, and, without pointing to the Inca, touches on the idea of mortar-less structures. Although I'm a layman in engineering, mortar degrades and is still a major cause of old buildings being destroyed in earthquakes. Considering that earthquakes were a part of Egyptian mythology prior to the construction of the great pyramids, at the very least part of a god's attributes (see [Geb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geb)), it's not unlikely that the design of buildings which took over 20 years to build, involved tens of thousands of laborers and were made as tombs to their rulers and gods-to-be would take into consideration such destructive forces.   

&gt; Underground passages link the pyramids with each other

The Pharaoh's pyramids were linked with the similar so-called Queen's pyramids, not with each other. As these were tombs, rather than temple complexes which easily explain the use of tunnels between structures, it is a popular point. 

&gt;They are oriented on star(sign)s, especially Orion, Sirius, the Pleiades and Cygnus (Swan)

This comes off as similar to the argument that inter-empire contact must have necessary because of the ubiquity of sun/moon worship. Features of the sky, particularly when they represent in the mythologies of these empires the heavens, would make sense. 

Further, much of the arguments behind the specific alignments and the importance to Egypt of these star constellations has been debunked. Drawing parallels to constellations that come from another civilizations understanding of the night sky have no bearing on the way the Pyramids were constructed. [This argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_correlation_theory) revolves around the relationship of Orion's belt and the Pyramids at Giza. The concept of perfect symmetry doesn't hold up when the authors invert the maps in their own book.

MarcusDohrelius,"Medieval Europe borrowed exclusively from ancient medical precedents and intermixed these with spiritual causations like sin, fate, and other supernatural powers. The most prominent source was the ancient Greek, Hippocrates. He is where modern medicine gets its ""Hippocratic Oath."" He was the first to synthesise and record (despite there being earlier references, like the Egyptians) the idea of the four humours. These four humours were the cause of health. 

The four humors of Hippocratic medicine are black bile (Gk. melan chole), yellow bile (Gk. chole), phlegm (Gk. phlegma), and blood (Gk. haima). These are to be kept in balance or else sickness occurs. Increasing and decreasing these four elements was a central component of medieval, European medicine and some Islamic medicinal theory as well. Avicenna would be the most prominent amongst the Islamic medical theorists; he borrowed heavily from another ancient Greek, Galen. The four humours corresponded with the four states of hot,wet,cold, dry. Theophrastus, who was a successor to Aristotle in his school, would attribute the humours to aspects of character, thus one with too much blood was ""sanguine"".

An interesting medieval character to look at, though later than your stated dates(*The Canterbury Tales* are late 14th century), would be [Chaucer's Physician.](http://www.librarius.com/canttran/genpro/genpro413-446.htm).

lukeweiss,"It is absolutely the case from as early as we have reliable history. The Han conflict with the Xiongnu saw much mixing along the northern borders of the imperium, but was not the first such ""northernification"" (my term, just thought of it!). In fact, we are pretty comfortable with the image of the earliest ""dynasty"" (not an appropriate term for them, as they weren't ruling over an empire of any consequence), the Shang, as that of a semi-nomadic (or at least peripatetic), horse dependent chiefdom. This characterization is more like the later northern non-han peoples than that of the Han. So, and the work of Victor Mair, among others, has especially driven this point home, the influx/mixing of northern peoples with ""han"" peoples strikes to the very roots of chinese society.  
Flash forward to the post Han dynasty period, and we have a north dominated by invading northern peoples for the better part of 400 years. This period was capped off with the Tang Dynasty (618CE onward), a dynastic household of not-so-thinly-veiled mixed blood. The Li family were  clearly of mixed ""barbarian"" decent, but worked extremely hard both to hide that fact, and to legitimize their ancient family creds. They did this in two major ways:  
1. By literally re-writing the list of great families. A list that formerly gave primacy to the old guard families of the Shandong area. The power structure of the Tang was wrapped up in this change, as the Tang were eager to shift the familial power structure to the northwest, from the center/east. It is not clear how seriously the change was taken, but no matter the answer to that question, both sets of aristocratic groups wouldn't survive the Tang.  
2. Aligning themselves with that great ancient philosopher, Laozi. This was an astute move, the old master sharing the surname Li with the imperial house gave them instant credibility as potential holders of the mandate of heaven (a tenuous grip that could always be relinquished). Again, it is not all that clear how seriously this was taken, but the early Tang rulers drove home the connection time and again.   
After the Tang we see another influx of northern semi-nomadic peoples, this time upping the ante significantly. Chinese historiography for generations tried to minimize their importance - for example, the period is known as the ""Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms,"" a title that gives credit only to the areas ruled mostly by Han chinese. It ignores the significance of the northern regions under the Khitans, Shatuo Turks, and Tanguts, who all held power pretty solidly until Mongol expansion a few centuries later.     
These regions were full of Han chinese, and the new states of the Xi Xia and Khitans clearly modeled themselves politically after the Middle Kingdom. Many adapted and adopted new official scripts, that their imperial edicts could be read far and wide - a very chinese thing to do!  
So the mixing continued and continued. The Mongols tried desperately to maintain their non-Han status, but this only isolated the upper strata of the Mongol power structure. F.W. Mote mentions, in his history of middle period china *Imperial China 900-1800*, that the Mongols in Han China became destitute by the 14th century, because they had no official status, and a shrinking share of the imperial booty. Isolation was therefore bad for longevity.   
The Qing brought a massive influx of Manchus, who also tried to maintain cultural isolation. But again, this wasn't sustainable, and many mixed in with Han China. A small group, mostly those closest to the imperial family, remained ethnically isolated, and were on the long train back to Manchuria in 1911.   
So, TL:DR - Mixing of northern ethnicities with Han chinese is as old as chinese civilization itself. It only increased as time went by. Interestingly, it seems the only successful invaders NOT to stay for a while and mix it up in China were the Tibetans, who's 9th century invasion did not involve sticking around for breeding.

skyanvil,"Ethnic mixing happened far more often in Chinese history, particularly in Northern China, than most people think (more than even some modern Chinese think).

The short answer is, YES, Northern Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the North.  Even before that, Western Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the West.  And Southern Chinese also mixed with various tribes of the South.

Ancient Chinese maps indicated that China was surrounded by Barbarian tribes in North, West, and the South.  Border region people mixed a lot, and the Chinese had no prohibition of that.  Indeed, early Chinese partly spread out on the concept of ""civilizing"" the Barbarians by mixing with them, and attempting to IMPRESS the Barbarians with Chinese culture, Chinese agricultural technologies, Chinese customs and virtues.

When China was occupied by Barbarians, and even subsequently when China overthrew those dynasties, Han Chinese encouraged mixing with the Barbarians, which formed mixed-ethnic vanguard troops and mercenaries for the Chinese to guard their frontiers.

For example, after Ming Dynasty overthrew the Mongol Dynasty of Yuan, Ming Emperors employed vast numbers of Mongolian mercenaries, by promising them stable salary, and land for them to settle in China.  (This was very attractive offer to the Mongols, who traditionally only got paid well when they managed to take spoils in battle.  And in contrast, the Chinese were willing to pay them well to be on guard duty.)

So, slowly, the Mongol mercenaries settled in China, and mixed into the Chinese population.  Those who didn't settle in China, remained Mongolian nomads.

Bottomline:  1 of China's strengths is the ability to attract non-Chinese to mix into its population, with its riches of culture and technology.

MarcusDohrelius,"In 494 in the Early Roman Republic there was a *secessio plebis* or plebian revolt as part of the ongoing ""conflict of the orders"" with the patricians, who at the time were still closely related to the advisors of the recently deposed monarchy (509 B.C). Slave debt was a big issue, where, in a simplified explanation, Roman farmers who were full citizens would have their farms fall into disarray during wartimes and they would be forced to be indentured servants to pay it back. There was sense of honouring the veterans. So in 495B.C soldiers were exempted from this practice. That eased some tensions, but outrage at underrepresentation and exploitation amongst the plebeians was on the rise. 

[This map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Roman_conquest_of_Italy.PNG) is phenomenal and shows Rome's neighbours and its expansion during the Republic. The Volscii were a particular threat and in 494 the Plebs seized the opportunity and retreated to the *Mons Sacer* and refused their military service. This caused a panic and their demands were met with the creation of the sacrosanct office of the Tribune of the Plebs. 

Another revolution to check, led by Tribunes, would be the grain reforms of the Gracchi brothers in the late Republic. 

All of the accounts of the Plebian Seccessions can be found in Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita* and Appian on the Civil Wars for the Gracchi.

pharmaceus,"There are two separate problems here. 

If you are referring to the famines in the Soviet Union it wasn't just the result of collective farming (which in itself can be sufficiently efficient as seen in the kibbutzem ) but the fact that the collectivization was - besides ideological reasons -  a method of centralizing all agricultural products in one place and then expropriating it for further redistribution and export. Also it was an efficient tool of subjugating unruly peasants in Ukraine.

If you are referring to inefficiency of collective farming then it is an economic problem that has roots in how work is organized in a collective arrangement without even symbolic price systems.  An interesting take on a historical example can be found in *Conceived in Liberty vol.1* by Murray Rothbard who referring to the Thanksgiving legend put the causes of famine in American colonies on collectivist ideas and the ""miraculous""improvement on simply returning to more rational method of management.  Right now I can't think of a ready-made historical example but essentially it boils down to this: If a farm is run this way it puts the whole incentive system for really hard work upside down and agricultural production being very labour-intensive (and even more so in the past) is very easy to fail if everyone is not doing their best.",null,1,cdndrc2,1rhelo,askhistorians,top_week,2
HeloRising,"The issue tends to be with expectations rather than the farming system itself.

It's a problem seen in places like North Korea today; the government sets a target for a particular farm to reach and that target is nowhere near what that farm is able to produce. The target is arrived at with a formula that basically says this much land + this many people = this much food except farming is almost never that precise. This leads to farms inflating how much they've actually grown to meet quotas and a huge overestimation of the food supply.

If you're talking about an authoritarian government they may be ordering people to do jobs for which they lack the skills for. China made this mistake during the Great Leap Forward when it commanded collectives to melt everything down to produce steel in their backyards. Except very few people actually knew how to make steel and most of it was garbage.

QVCatullus,"One of the issues is going to be with the semantics of the question (and I hate when people answer questions here like this, but here I am doing it). It's difficult to point to an exact moment at which we can say that the empire 'split up' -- we do so in retrospect and with the benefit of hindsight, but it is less effective to make such claims from the point of view of the people living at the time.
Important thing to consider -- there had been multiple emperors ruling Rome simultaneously long before we would consider the empire divided; for example, Marcus Aurelius actually ruled alongside Lucius Verus until Verus died. Diocletian famously established the Tetrarchy, which established four simultaneous emperors of different status and with different zones of control, perhaps laying the foundation for a theory of multiple empires, but his system lasted about as long as he did; Constantine reunited the empire. 
Thus, the relationship would perhaps be best described as one in which the two parts of the empire saw each other as parts of the same ""nation"" -- a loaded word -- but with separate, and often rival courts. Two simultaneous emperors would often work against one another, and many of the major battles of the empire were fought by Romans against Romans, rather than foreign nations, so that doesn't mean that they always cooperated well, and it suggests that we ought not see competition and strife between the two 'halves' as suggesting that they viewed themselves as separate nations.
Note that when the western Empire 'fell,' the Ostrogoths were theoretically governing Italy on behalf of the eastern Empire -- there was no concept that Italy fell outside the purview of Constantinople. There continued to be a 'Byzantine' presence in Italy until the Normans, and Justinian I saw the invasions of Italy, Sicily, and Iberia as reconquests of Roman land rather than taking 'western' imperial territories.",null,0,cdnejac,1rhbz2,askhistorians,top_week,7

tinyshadow,"It is certainly true that Hitler persecuted Catholics in particular. You are correct that many in the Third Reich were Catholic, but you may not know that those individuals tended not to vote for Hitler and the Catholic churches often denounced the Nazi party fairly publicly. In the early 1930s, Hitler promised he would not silence other political parties or the churches. However, what would soon occur is now known by many historians as **Kirchenkampf** or the Church Struggle.


Kirchenkampf follows a clear chronological timeline. In regards to Catholics specifically, here's what happened:

1. Early 1933: Catholic political parties are dissolved. Hitler installs Ludwig Müller as Reichsbischof, or Reich Bishop, a man who would control the new conglomerate of Germany's 28 regional Protestant churches. There is no Catholic equivalent to this. 

2. Late 1933, early 1934: Continued Gleichschaltung, or coordination, which meant the dissolution of other organizations in favor of one unified state-run Nazi-based organization. This meant that Catholic Youth Leagues were totally dissolved, and Catholic children are forced into Hitler Youth programs. Meanwhile, a Protestant opposition has formed called the Confessing Church, led in part by Martin Neimoller. During the Night of the Long Knives, several Catholic leaders were targeted and assassinated. Hitler appoints anti-Catholic men to high-ranking positions with the Nazi regime, who go out of their way to persecute Catholics, albeit sporadically.

3. Late 1934 to early 1937: Hitler forces the removal of crucifixes from schools and bans daily religious periodicals as well as begins censoring weekly periodicals. The Nazis continue to dominate the Protestant church and replace Müller (who has failed to accomplish that goal conclusively) with Hans Kerrl. The Confessing Church protests loudly, and they are often violently silenced. This includes mass arrests of opposing pastors.

4. Early 1937 to 1939: Pope Pius XI issues Mit brennender Sorge, or With Burning Concern. It is smuggled into Germany and read in every Catholic church on one Sunday. In this, the Pope denounces Nazi ideology and criticized Nazism for contradicting Catholic dogma. It strongly condemned racism and even protected baptized Jews. The Gestapo visited nearly every Catholic church and took any copies that they found. Anyone who had a hand in the printing or publication of the paper had their business attacked and shut down. Indeed, the Pope's speech only seems to have provoked the Nazis, because from early 1937, Hitler *hated* Catholics. He went out of his way to make sure that they were persecuted. He began ""immorality trials"" which often suggested lewd and horrible behavior and actions from clergy, who would endure false trials and receive outrageous punishments for crimes that they did not commit (such as sexual perversion and homosexuality, among others). In the summer of that year, the Confessing Church is formally banned, and Martin Niemöller is arrested.

5. 1939–1945: There is all out war between Christianity and Nazism in the Third Reich. Countless clergy of both Protestant and Catholic denominations are arrested and put in concentration camps (so many that Dachau had ""The Priest Barracks"" - 95% of them were Catholic). Against their will, many clergy were drafted into the military services. Publications and sermons were restricted, censored, or even banned outright. Services were increasingly dissolved or banned from occurring. 

Whew. **tl;dr** - Yes, Catholics were singled out among the Christian denominations, which is not to say that Protestants had it any easier. However, Hitler did particularly dislike Catholicism, especially its separate organizations and its radical priests and nuns. His response to them was assassination, imprisonment, false trials, as well as dissolving their political and social organizations, ending their services, censoring and destroying their publications.

**Oh, and PS: Hitler's mother may have been very Catholic, but his father was not. As Hitler grew into adulthood, he began to hate Christianity more and more and preferred secular ideas, though he certainly understood the power of Christianity and used it early in Nazi ideology only to fully remove it later.**",null,0,cdnfew5,1rhbey,askhistorians,top_week,11

That is to say, they are descended from Aryans, but their 'purity' was diluted into the general south asian/ dravidian population. By the term 'Aryan' he was referring to the ancient, white, proto-european conquerors that settled/invaded the sub-continent and much of asia. Although as far as I am aware they originated somewhere near Iran(?). I always thought it was weird that Hitler always banged on about Aryans and then in the same breath held blonde hair and blue eyes in such high regard. This was because all the people I had met who identified as Aryan were south asian (i.e. black-dark hair, darker skin, etc.). 

However, I think the problem is in the semantics. By 'Aryan', Hitler meant the old school horse-riding peoples from east europe/west asia who bandied around conquering and settling much of europe and asia. Whilst, many south asian people, or people who are more familiar with that culture than western culture view the word 'Aryan' as denoting a current population, who (through years of intermingling) became largely intertwined with the indigenous population. In contrast, Nazis viewed the european breed of Aryan and pure-blood.

I think the one thing both Hitler and Indian people can agree on are that the Aryans were fair skinned. In hitlers mindset I think this translated into the blonde hair, blue eyes thing, whilst in the Indian mindset this translated into simply a fairer complexion in comparison to other ethnic groups in India (such as the darker Dravidians) - a skin tone similar to, say, Iranian people.

What I think is interesting is that in both cultures the notions of being Aryan is linked with superiority. Whilst we are all very familiar with Hitler's ramblings, it is important to also note that skin tone is very important in India, with society having a preference for lighter skinned people. Hence, this translates into people of Aryan descent (them being fairer skinned) as being seen as superior. A cousin of mine, when I asked her why she prefers men with lighter skin, even said it is because it makes them look more european... when you actually think about the implications of that view its pretty fucked up. Sometimes I think India is having some kind of post-colonial withdrawal issue. :/

Anyhow, in conclusion. Hitler's opinions of the Aryans in India was probably not very good. He would have been aware that the Aryans settled and colonised vast swathes of the asia and europe.    The Nazis viewed themselves as pure bred Aryans while they saw the Indian Aryans as being simply descendents of Aryans. 

To be honest, it is very difficult to think of any objective rhyme or reason for any extremist view, and if you try to find one you will probably be looking for a long time. Extremist philosophy and politics is steeped in biased views of history, and unscientific science. Hence, its not surprising that Hitler's views on who the Aryans were/are end up equally as hodge podged.

pharmaceus,"I think Churchill might be wrong a bit right here depending on two factors. How he defined ""late Victorian times"" and whether he rests his argument on the existence of central heating. [Central heating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_heating#History) is just one of ways to provide uniform temperature in a building - the other being a source of heat such as ceramic or iron stove. While I agree that Roman technology that many Imperial officials brought with them was both superior to anything people used Britain or much of Europe for that matter (with exception to certain monasteries) and effectively lost to general populace as an advancement I would seriously debate that someone who was able to put a stove in every habitable room and provide for servants to maintain them had it sufficiently worse than a person with central heating. On the continent stoves were in use as far as into 1950's and 1960's and they only went out of use because of the work that needs to be done - especially if you're living in a multi-story building in a city.

However Churchill might simply relate to the fact that because of English climate many people would not bother with having a stove everywhere and just rely on two fireplaces in main rooms to dissipate the warmth (which would be very ineffective). So it might be simply the case of tradition rather than technology or affordability.  In Russia stoves in every room were used by any person that could afford it as far as XVII century.

diana_mn,"Japan set a fairly unique course in its interactions with Western nations from the start. Even before Japan's famous ""opening to the West"" in 1854, they had observed a succession of Western powers militarily and economically defeating and humiliating China. Their main fear in their own relations with the West was that they might suffer a similar fate. 

Their initial interactions with Western powers seemed to confirm these fears, as a succession of nations forced acceptance of treaties granting themselves access, trade, and certain extra-territorial rights for their citizens within Japan itself. While military encounters never broke into open war as they had in China, the threat was persistent, and Japan's leaders were keenly aware that they were in no position to conduct a full scale war with Western powers in its current state.

The failure of the previous government (the Tokugawa lead shogunate) to resist the Western powers soon lead to its overthrow, under the popular rallying cry ""sonnō jōi,"" (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians). However the new government resisted a reactionary approach in ""expelling barbarians."" Instead they undertook a thorough study of the Western powers in order to understand what made the world's great powers so successful. 

The prime symbol of this effort was a famous around-the-world expedition lead by Prince Iwakura Tomomi. The Iwakura Mission had two main objectives. The first was to gather information about the modern world to inform Japan's own decision making about necessary reforms. The second was to renegotiate the unequal treaties Japan had been forced to accept under the prior regime. 

The mission was a huge success in meeting its first objective. The information brought back and the relationships forged with Western nations fired the imagination of Japan's reform-minded leaders, and gave many examples in technology, government, education, and commerce upon which to model their efforts. 

However when it came to the second objective - renegotiation of the unequal treaties - the mission utterly failed. It was such a failure that certain leaders within the mission were blamed for having even attempted such a thing before Japan had sufficient leverage at the negotiation table.

The insight that Japan gained from this failure was that Western powers like the United States, United Kingdom, and France did not view them as an equal power. Until Japan established itself as a peer to the world's great powers they would forever be treated as an inferior. The motivation to correct this was the overarching goal of Japan's policy for the next several decades. It not only fueled helpful reforms like democracy, universal education, industrialization, and free markets, but also lead Japan in an increasingly aggressive militaristic direction. 

So, to recap, Japan embraced Western ideas about modern government, economy, and technology as a direct response to Western intervention in Asia in general, and Japan specifically. Their relations with Western nations were hugely affected by their desire to be seen as an equal to Western powers, understanding this to be the key to being treated as an equal in diplomatic affairs. The wrenching changes required were in large part palatable under Japan's reform-minded Meiji government because the prior regime (under the shogunate) took the blame for getting Japan into its unequal mess in the first place.

Second: No, actually it's not safe to assume naturalism (realistic representation of observed visual reality) was any ancient artist's goals. Think of Christian icons, which are highly stylized and governed by strict protocols in representation. Greek sculpture excelled at naturalism. In the Renaissance, studies of optics and the development of receding perspective in drawing (not to mention use of the camera obscura) allowed for increased naturalism.

The art you linked to heavily relies on photography as a tool. Through photography, humans could see details, for instance at high speeds, that cannot be observed with the naked eye (such as the water splash in the cup with lemon slices). Conventions such as cutting images off with the edge of the picture plane only developed after the introduction of photography (as in the image of strawberries).

The introduction of photography in the 19th century freed painters from the need to represent observed reality, ushering in the many movements of the Modern Era. Photorealists of the 1960s and 1970s embraced representation, not of observed realities, but of the photographic surface.

Muskwatch,"Questions of matriarchy are tied up in questions of authority.  Within a western context when we think of patriarchy or matriarchy it's often with the idea of male or female leadership, with significant authority to give orders, make important decisions, and so on.  Within most Indigenous North American cultures this view doesn't really hold water entirely. Many of the nations in my area of North America (British Columbia) are matriarchally organized, so in that sense at least, matriarchy was commonly practiced.  However, that matriarchal organization might not have the same sort of power that you might think.  Power - the ability to influence others, at least in this area was heavily tied in to obligations developed through the potlatch system.  You cement connections with people, you build up your name, and as a result build up influence.  The matriarchal nature of your community would determine who you saw as relative, who your primary obligations were to (and there were often separate father side obligations as well as mother side).  Women did have a lot of power, they often controlled a lot of wealth, territory, rights, but it did not match up to the idea of a political leader as we might see it today or as it is sometimes portrayed.  

At the same time, the very egalitarian nature of many communities often meant that the division of labour between men and women was much more equal - families that make their living off the land generally work together, and value each other in a different way than agrarian societies, and spiritual leadership has almost always been with women in any community I've interacted with.",null,0,cdngykt,1rh3gw,askhistorians,top_week,3

rosemary85,"No! This is a modern myth.

The story that irrational numbers were a source of horror to the ancient Greeks seems to come indirectly from a book published in 1892, John Burnet's [*Early Greek Philosophy*, page 117:](http://archive.org/stream/burnetgreek00burnrich#page/116/mode/2up)

&gt; For the present, the incommensurability of the diagonal and the square remained, as has been said, a ""scandalous exception."" Our tradition says that Hippasos of Metapontion was drowned at sea for revealing this skeleton in the cupboard.

Hippasos is known from other sources to have been an important Pythagorean in the 5th century BCE. 

Burnet's use of quotation marks around ""scandalous exception"" suggests that he may have got this from a still earlier source, but I've not been able to isolate it by searching for that phrase in Google Books prior to 1892. Anyway, the more responsible online science writers that discuss Greek attitudes to irrationals cite Burnet as their ultimate source. I've also seen the same myth come up in very non-scientific contexts, like William Messner-Loebs' wonderful (but very inaccurate) *Epicurus the Sage*.

Unfortunately for all these people that cite Burnet as their authority, Burnet simply got it wrong. He himself, in a footnote, attributes this story to Iamblichos, *Life of Pythagoras* (§34) 247; but it's just not what Iamblichos says. In charity I'll assume that he misremembered it, rather than supposing that he never actually bothered to look at the text of Iamblichos. In Iamblichos, the story has nothing to do with irrational numbers, and Hippasos doesn't get murdered by his fellow Pythagoreans. Instead, Iamblichos says, 

&gt; Some say that a divinity took vengeance on him for making Pythagorean teachings public. For he perished in the sea, on the grounds of being impious, for revealing the the structure of the eikosagon -- that is to say, the dodecahedron, which is a single solid composed of five-sided shapes folded in a spherical manner.

So in other words, Hippasos drowned in a storm or shipwreck, and some people with vivid imaginations attributed it to divine vengeance. Burnet misremembered this story as being about irrational numbers, and compounded his error by adding the ""embellishment"" that Hippasos was deliberately drowned by his companions.

Long story short: there's no basis at all for supposing that the Greeks thought irrationals were a thing of horror. That misconception only comes from John Burnet having a brain-fart in the 1890s. Ancient mathematical writers that discuss irrationals treat them as any other mathematical problem. It's much more realistic to regard the discovery of irrationals as the *greatest achievement* of the Pythagorean school!

Beck2012,"I am afraid that the core of your question is against this subreddit main rule - history starts 20 years ago.

As for the historical relations between Vietnam and China - well, they've been historically quite hostile. Vietnam, quite succesfully, has been able for centuries to oppose Chinese effort to conquer it by military means. Sure, cultural influence of China on Vietnam is tremendous. But the war of 1979 was one of many.

Diffrence between Vietnam and Korea in a larger scope (not only 20th century) is that Korea was more welcoming of Chinese hegemony. Which was pretty much symbolic and China wasn't very eager to support its (de iure) vassals. INtervention in Korea-Japan war in late 16th century was crucial for China - they were protecting status quo in the region, Japan wanted to take the position of China as a regional hegemon.

As for intervention in 1979 - Vietnam was an ally of China's biggest rival (or even enemy) - USSR. Also, China was the only country close to Kampuchea (calling them allies, especially in 1979, would be exaggeration; even Chinese communists were pretty negative towards Pol Pot's politics and economic ideas - but they had no other choice than supporting them and, from time to time, scolding for idiotic ideas; remember that since 1978 China takes the route of liberalization under the rule of Deng Xiaoping, so agrarian state of Saloth Sar was far from the new economic policy of CPC).

Kim Il Sung was very crafty politician that was able to balance between USSR and China. And both countries needed him as a leader of a frontier nation of communist states (rivals to the position of leaders of communist movement in the world but still joint enemies of capitalist world). In the sino-russian split he decided to remain neutral but other countries had to decide - as I've written, neither of those powers could allow themselves to stop supporting NK, because one of the pillars of the East Asia strategy of both China and USSR was to keep the status quo and not to let the South to attack North Korea. Neither China, nor USSR could afford another Korean War, which was a catastrophy for Chinese economy.

Also, war of 1979 wasn't a full-scale war - again, china didn't want to spent to much resources on it, they just wanted to show Vietnam where its place is. They didn't succeed, forgetting that Vietnamese soldiers were one of the most exeprianced and best equipped in the world at that time - geography was also on their side. The main goal of Chinese army was to quickly break Vietnam and crush its imperialist ambitions. Remember, that the decisions in Cambodia came from Hanoi till the late 1990s (and some say that the influence is still enormous, Hun Sen was for years Vietnamese puppet, but now he changed his priorities to China - yesterday came a shipment of 12 Chinese helicopters to Cambodia, btw).

estherke,"No, because his premises were unscientific, his methods questionable and his experiments haphazard.


First, many of the experiments were based on peculiar Nazi racial theories about who was ""Aryan"" and who was not. The issue of the existence of distinct human races is problematic and controversial in and of itself. Certainly, no contemporary scientist will agree that there is such a thing as the Aryan race. Obviously, which such a flawed premise, it is hardly surprising that the experiments yielded no results.

&gt;in 1944, he began his own project on twins, [...] **Were there reproducible racially determined differences in serum following an infectious disease?** [...] Dr Mengele infected identical and fraternal twins, Jewish and Gypsy twins with the same quantity of typhoid bacteria, took blood at various times for chemical analysis in Berlin, and followed the course of the disease. According to [Jewish inmate doctor and forced assistant) Dr Nyiszli, he also worked with tuberculous twins. [...] Dr Mengele's letters and reports to  [Nazi research physician] Professor von Verschuer were probably destroyed by von Verschuer [who went on to pursue a successful academic career after denazification]. [...] Right up to the last moments of the war, Professor von Verschuer was still hoping for a major breakthrough. [...] **Dr Mengele and Professor von Verschuer did not solve their problem**. (Benno Muller-Hill, *Murderous Science*, 1998)

For more on the tuberculosis study in particular and why it was scientifically flawed for other than racist reasons, see Benno Muller-Hill, [*Genetics of susceptibility to tuberculosis: Mengele’s experiments in Auschwitz*](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~piecze/MengeleBennoMullerHill.pdf) (Nature, Vol 2, August 2001, pp 631-634). Essentially, Mengele and his supervisor **clung to an outdated theory**.

Mengele also used the twins in (extremely painful) experiments to try to change their eye colour, but failed. This was an attempt at research on phenogenetic eye pigmentation and eye colour heredity. A particular Nazi focus was to find out **whether the structure and colour of the eye could be used to determine the ""race""** (Jewish or Aryan) of the subject. (Benoît Massin, *Mengele, die Zwillingsforschung und die „Auschwitz-Dahlem Connection""*. In: Carola Sachse (Ed.): *Die Verbindung nach Auschwitz. Biowissenschaften und Menschenversuche an Kaiser-Wilhelm-Instituten. Dokumentation eines Symposiums.* Göttingen 2003)

Secondly, many ""experiments"" seemed to have sprouted from an impulse of the moment and were not part of an integrated study as were the two experiments described above. No original paperwork survives on the other experiments, we therefore rely on a great number of eyewitness testimony. Some of these bizarre experiments were: sewing twins together to create conjoined twins, surgeries such as organ removal, castration, and amputations.

A symposium uniting experts from the field of law, history and medicine was held at the University of Minnesota in 1989 to discuss the Nazi human experiments. It had this to say about why Mengele's research was useless:

&gt;The experiments were carried out under circumstances that were scarcely representative of the normal human condition. The debilitated physical conditions of many of the victims most certainly confounded results from the experimental procedures.  [...]

Zinoviev (head of the Comintern), Uritsky (People's Commissar of the North Commune), Sverdlov (Chairman of the Secretariat RCP), and Sokolnikov (Commissar for Finance) were all Jews with high positions in the Soviet Union's leadership. 

Hitler pointed to this as evidence that the Jews had conspired to overtake Russia and pull her out of a war, and then asserted that they had infiltrated Germany with the same intentions, and had made her weak.

And those Italian upstarts have been conquered and reconquered so many times that their ancient culture has been virtually annihilated. So why would I get upset about it?

As for why cultures seem to assimilate (instead of carrying that ""beef"" with them forever), is one day it becomes better to be a (say) Roman than a Carthaginian. Your country was destroyed, you certainly cant rebel, the Romans will discriminate against you if you self-identify as Carthaginian (or if *they* identify you as a Carthaginian), so at some point it just becomes too hard for the common person to resist.

But these are ancient examples. I think if you look more recently, youll find that these acculturation processes take many generations. Look at the American Natives, some have assimilated, but an equal number are still angry about their conquest. And the Russians, they still celebrate the ""Great Patriotic War"", their expulsion of a conquering German army. So there are a lot of these passions still boiling in modern society which many people still have not forgotten and are still outraged over. (Armenian Genocide, Bay of Pigs, American Revolution, US Civil War, World War One, and the other aspects of World War Two, just to name a few hot button issues). 

The subtext here Im picking up is a general question as to why people arent more outraged by wars, especially older ones. And, aside from the previous comments on conflicts in cultural memory, I would like to point out that war is natural. We humans, for whatever reason, really like to kill each other. Weve been doing it a while, and were getting quite good at it. So the process of conquering, and being conquered, is fundamentally part of human experience. The people of the past understood this a lot better than we do now (assuming you are American or European), given our prolonged period of peace. So on a fundamental level, its hard to get upset over somebody being conquered. Its a natural fact of life, and it has gone on millennia (its even in the Bible!). In fact Id bet itll go on for millennia more. 

Thats not to be Mr. Doom-and-Gloom over here, we humans have a remarkable ability to operate above our own genetic hard-wiring, its just that war is a historical constant. ",null,0,cdn4eza,1rgt2b,askhistorians,top_week,2

This is a very complicated topic and your question doesn't have a simple answer. There's a nugget of truth in this relating to events described in the primary sources, but popular perception of what happened has been heavily distorted in a way that bares little resemblance to the truth. Essentially, a number of factual events, misunderstandings, and outright myths have been confused with each other over time. This has ultimately produced this elaborate (but largely inaccurate) story that Cortés was an incarnation of Quetzalcoatl.

**Mesoamericans calling Europeans Gods**

There's a common tendency for European conquest sources to describe the natives referring to the Europeans as gods. Most of the Spanish accounts just take this for granted. The only first-hand account I've been able to find that seems to hint at what the natives might have actually thought is this quote from Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Bit of context, Cortés had just told the local Totonac people to imprison an Aztec tribute collector. They explained this was effectively a declaration of war, to which Cortés replied that he would take responsibility for it. The Totonacs were shocked:

&gt;The act they [the Totonac nobles] had witnessed was so astonishing and of such importance to them that they said no human beings dared to do such a thing, and it must be the work of teules. Therefore, from that moment they [natives] called us [Spanish] teules, which means gods or demons.

After this, the conquistadors start calling themselves ""teules,"" and the natives apparently do too.

There's a few issues with this though. First, ""Teule"" isn't a word. ""Teotl"" is, but it isn't a word in Totonac. It's a Nahuatl word. The Totonacs translated their word into Nahuatl, and then from there it was translated to Mayan, and from there to Spanish, where it was rendered as ""gods or demons."" It's hard to know what the original context of the phrase was because we don't know how it was used in the Totonac language. When later people continue calling the Spanish teotl, it's unclear if they actually thought the Spanish were divine or if they're just calling them that because the Spanish are calling themselves that.

**Possible Meanings**

The other problem comes with different concepts of divinity. The Mesoamerican concept of a ""teotl"" is not the same as the Grecko-Roman concept of a god. It's probably closer to the idea of a kami in the Shinto religion, in that it's not necessarily omnipotent or immortal. To put it another way, if you were to try to translate the major figures of the Christian religion into the Aztec world view, God, the Devil, all of the saints, all of the demons, all of the angels, and all of the prophets would be rendered as ""teotl"". For that matter, so would elves, goblins, fairies, or other creatures of Germanic folklore.

So when the natives were calling the Spanish ""teotl,"" they could have meant gods, or they could have just meant non-human. Or they could have meant that they were human, but simply had the backing of supernatural powers. For all we know, the Totonac lords could have meant it sarcastically. We only have the interaction recorded in Spanish, so there's no way to know. Either way, the Spanish thought that the natives thought they were gods and they began claiming divinity.They continually referred to themselves as 'teules.' When the Spanish arrived in Tenochtitlan, Motecuzoma put a stop to this immediately (Diaz del Castillo 2003 p207):

&gt;[Cortés], I know very well that these people of Tlaxcala with whom you are such good friends have told you that I am a sort of God or [teotl] ... I know well enough that you are wise and did not believe it but took it as a joke. Behold now, Señor [Cortés], my body is of flesh and bone like yours ... that I am a great king and inherit the riches of my ancestors is true, but not all the nonsense and lies that they have told you about me, although of course you treated it as a joke, as I did your thunder and lightning.

It doesn't take a PhD to see that while Motecuzoma is talking about himself here, he's also talking about Cortés. He's letting Cortés know that he knows he's just a human being, so he should stop claiming to be something else. Now, during the early colonial period the Spanish didn't have the nuanced understanding of this that we do now, and this ""Spaniards as gods"" thing was accepted as historical fact for a while.

**Cortes as Quetzalcoatl**

After the conquest, this myth got conflated with another myth: the returning god-king Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin. Some time (likely in the 13th century AD) there was a king of a city called Tula named Ce Acatl Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl. (IIRC, he was probably a real person as his name is carved on a pillar at the site of Tula, but much of his story has obviously been mythologized.) He was basically like a Mesoamerican ""King Arthur"" and is closely associated with the god Quetzalcoatl for whom he is named. (Often the two are equated with each other. Mesoamerican concepts of divinity are complicated and it wasn't uncommon for kings to associate themselves with gods.) The story goes that his nobles were jealous of his power, and so they tricked him into disgracing himself and forced him into exile. Before he left, he cursed those who betrayed him and vowed one day that he would return to reclaim his lost kingdom. He then got on boats and went east across the ocean. (If the story is true, he likely went to the Yucatan Peninsula, which is due east from the coast nearest to the Basin of Mexico.)
During the Early Colonial period, this story got conflated with Cortés. Supposedly the Aztecs believed that Cortés was a reincarnation of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin - supposedly because he arrived in the year One Reed. One Reed was the calendrical portion of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin's name (Ce Acatl). However, most modern scholars (for example, Mike Smith, Matthew Restall, etc.) consider this to be one of these post-hoc prophecy attributions. Cortés does not mention it in his letters to the King of Spain, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo only makes vague references to a prophecy about ""white men with beards"" who would rule over Mexico. However, Diaz del Castillo was writing decades after the fact, when this legend of Cortés-as-Quetzalcoatl had already been established. It seems more likely that the prophecy was attributed to Cortés after the conquest as a means of explaining what happened.

**EDIT**: As others have pointed out, the attribution of the Quetzalcoatl prophecy to Cortés is discussed by Sahagún, who is writing decades after the conquest but largely pulling the account from indigenous informants. However, as Restall (2003:112-114) demonstrates, this version of events was popularized by Christian missionaries like Motolinía in the late 1520s as a conversion tactic - it helped if the natives saw the conquest as divinely ordained. And as /u/400-Rabbits pointed out (referencing Brumfiel), many of Sahagún's informants were Christian Nahuas, who would have been influenced by these early missionaries. So yeah, just because it's mentioned in a colonial era source doesn't make it true.

rosemary85,"A book that adequately covered the literatures of *all* ancient cultures would be quite a sight! Let's see, if we set a cut-off point at, say, 400 CE we've got Sumerian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Ugaritic, Hittite/Hurrian, Greek, Israelite, Indian (Sanskrit, Tamil, and Pali), Chinese, and Roman. Some of these are much more copious than others: we've only got a few snippets in Sumerian; by contrast, we've got far more Greek literature than any of the others (though it isn't all literary), followed -- I think -- by Sanskrit and then Latin. If you extend the date a bit closer to the present you get lots more, like Syriac, Armenian, and so on.

Comparing them: how can you compare the literatures of a dozen cultures, when each culture's literature has a story of its own, with huge variation in styles and content? I wouldn't dare. A few comparative efforts have been made: Erich Auerbach's classic *Mimesis* (1946) devotes the first few chapters to comparing the styles of Greek, Israelite, and Roman literary works; a couple of recent books by Bruce Louden try to compare the Homeric epics to Israelite literature, though without any historical basis (*The Iliad: Structure, Myth, and Meaning* [2006]; *Homer's Odyssey and the Near East* [2011]).

Much more sane is the developmental approach that tries to isolate specific tropes and trace their development through many cultures' literatures and mythologies back to a hypothetical archetype, often Sumerian or Indo-European. This includes linguistic approaches, like Gregory Nagy's *Comparative Studies in Greek and Indic Meter* (1974) and Calvert Watkins' *How to Kill a Dragon* (1995), and mythological/typological approaches like M. L. West's *The East Face of Helicon* (1997) and *Indo-European Poetry and Myth* (2007). The good news is that, unlike the books I mentioned in the previous paragraph, studies like these are on pretty firm ground methodologically.

The bad news is that they also tend to be rather technical and forbidding. They deal with minutiae, rather than with grand things like ""world view"". I doubt very much that there is *anything* useful to be said about a monolithic world view: does the Hesiodic *Theogony* have more in common (in terms of world view) with Thucydides or Euclid than, say, with the *Ba'al Cycle*?

But later interactions, especially after the Roman annexing of Egypt, show a deep appreciation.  Of course there is Julius Caesar's famous interaction with Egypt. It is a mixed bag of admiration and superiority. He led the Egyptian queen Arsinoe IV through the streets in chains, but he also borrowed the Egyptian calendar. Lucan even goes so far as to attribute Caesar's stint in Egypt as his reason for seeking autocracy. But equally interesting is an incident with Vespasian. Many Egyptian deities would make their way into the Roman pantheon. Vespasian seems to accept the Egyptian god Serapis as his patron deity, even believing he has a vision and is given powers to heal. This is telling as the cult of the emperor as deity was more an Eastern and Egyptian precedent. Here is an excerpt from Tacitus' *Histories*


"" This deepened Vespasian's desire to visit the holy house of Serapis, for he wished to consult the god on matters of state. He had everyone else excluded from the temple, and went in alone, fixing his mind on the deity. Happening to glance round, he caught sight of a leading Egyptian named Basilides standing behind him. Now he knew that this man was detained by illness far from Alexandria at a place several days' journey distant. He inquired of the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple that day. He also inquired of those he met whether he had been seen in the city. Finally he sent off a party on horse, and ascertained that at the relevant time he had been eighty miles away.

South Africa destroyed their bombs (they had maybe half a dozen) in the 90s. Iraq, Switzerland, Sweden, have worked on obtaining these for sure, and maybe Brasil, Argentina, Syria, Taiwan and Lybia too.

physedka,"I found that the time spent getting my degree in history taught me how to think about and discuss history. Anyone can read books and regurgitate facts. That's the kind of information you pick up in grade school and lower level (100-200) college history classes. Higher level history classes (300+) are usually more concerned with understanding concepts (Why the French Revolution happened or how it affected the rest of the world, for example). Classes tend to get smaller and discussion becomes the primary objective of the professor. You also learn to look for things like bias or revisionism in history books and articles, rather than accept their opinions at face value. 

Since you're on a different degree path, I would suggest picking a specific area of history to study. You should be able to take a few history classes as electives, so focus in on something that really intrigues you and follow it up to the higher level classes. Gaining what I would call a full understanding of history is not really feasible, unless you're truly gifted and you dedicate your life to absorbing all the collected history of the world.

You can get round that fairly easily by looking at reading lists [here](http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/tripos-papers/part-i-papers-for-2013-2014). Whilst you're at uni you can still access the journal articles at well, and since pretty much every uni does a history degree there should be a decent coverage where-ever you're at.

If you're going to self-teach, I would say at least writing something at the end of each chapter is necessary - what picture the chapter presents etc. Then there's the need for consolidation; if you find a topic that interests you, read (parts of) at least three books on the topic, and write a few paragraphs on how they differ, what underlying assumptions, attitudes and approaches cause these differences, and how convincing you find these ideas.

The amount of teaching I receive isn't that great - I have 1 hour-long supervision once a week, and lectures are notoriously variable in quality. However, that hour addresses gaping holes that I wouldn't otherwise be able to notice, and to compensate for this you'd have to be good at consolidating and reasoning through your interepretations.

i_330,"A lot. For our purposes, we'll begin with the Russian Civil War. There were understandably some people who were sort of upset about the abdication of the tsar and the events of 1917. Those people are known as the Whites. The Whites put up a pretty good fight, but the Bolsheviks ended up defeating them. The Bolsheviks were now running the country out of Petrograd (which became Leningrad in 1925, after Lenin died) and the USSR was beginning to (sort of) be recognized as a legitimate state abroad.

In the meantime, it had been discovered that state ownership of the means of production was causing severe economic hardship, so Lenin developed the New Economic Plan (NEP), which allowed for limited private enterprise and, pretty crucially, mostly left the peasants alone (collective farming was a really unpopular idea, but I'll talk about that in greater detail once we get into the 1930s under Stalin). Basically, NEP held the Soviet Union back from famine, economic collapse and open revolt for most of the '20s. 

But in 1924, Lenin died, and a power struggle ensued. Stalin managed to come out on top, abolished NEP in 1928, and embarked on a very ambitious, destructive plan to bring the entire Soviet economy under state control. Chaos ensued. Stalin started by taking everything away from the peasants and establishing massive collective farms. The peasants were really, really not into this, to the point where they start slaughtering their livestock rather than surrender them to the state. At the same time, Stalin was on a ruthless campaign against kulaks (wealthy/wealthyish peasants) around this time, most of whom were shot or exiled to Siberia. Collectivization was also one of the factors that contributed to the Holodomor, a famine in Ukraine that killed somewhere between 2 and 5 million people. 

So that's what was going on with the agricultural sector. There was trouble afoot in other spheres of Soviet life, as well: Stalin was embarking on a massive campaign of executions known as the Great Terror. That went on on roughly from 1934-39, although there's a lot of disagreement on that. It's almost impossible to overstate how absolutely nuts the Great Terror was. There's an apocryphal story about a man who put his coffee mug down on a picture of Stalin's face in the newspaper, leaving a wet ring that a passing KGB officer happened to notice and arrested him on the spot for. That particular story is probably not true, but it gives you a sense of the prevailing tone in Soviet life during that period. Everyone was listening to/informing on everybody else. Forced ""migrations"" of ethnic minorities (Tatars, Kalmyks, Volga Germans, and many others) were happening on a massive scale. People were being arrested for literally nothing, tortured, forced to sign confessions, and either executed or sent to the gulag (an enormous system of prisons spanning the entire country--we're still not completely sure how many there were). People usually never came out of the gulag, but some people did and lived to write about it (the most famous is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, but the work of Varlam Shalamov is also highly recommended if you're at all curious about the gulag). Basically, what Stalin was doing was using a climate of paralyzing, all-encompassing terror to consolidate power at home. It was effective. Devastatingly effective. I'm doing my thesis on the legacy of Stalinism in Russia, and I'd argue that it still informs contemporary Russia in a MAJOR way, but I digress.

I gather from your question that you're primarily curious about domestic developments in Russia, but there is one foreign policy thing that I should probably mention: the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which is signed in 1939 and guarantees mutual non-aggression between Germany and the USSR in the event of another European war. In 1941, Hitler completely breaks this treaty and invades the Soviet Union, and that takes us up to the beginning of Soviet involvement in WWII.

That was a very long-winded and simultaneously simplistic account of what happened. Stalinism is far more complex and horrifying than can possibly be expressed in a Reddit post, but I think this more or less covers the major events. If you're curious, I can point you towards some further reading on this period.

g-gorilla-gorilla,"Just a note, Russia did not have to back out of WWI to deal with the revolution.  The revolution(s) occurred as Russia was still fighting.  One of the big issues on which the Bolsheviks came to power, over other rival groups, was their determination to immediately end the war (most other groups supported continuing Russia's participation in the war, which was quite unpopular).  

Additionally, while other posters will almost certainly (correctly) mention the horrible things that happened, it's worth remembering just how far the USSR came in this period.

* The Soviet-Polish War happens between 1919 and 1921. The Poles are able to fight them to a standstill, and it ends in the division of disputed Belorussian territory. This is important because it ends the idea of global revolution and makes the Soviet Union into a belligerent power expanding for its own sake.

* After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviets started to reach out and take control over their sphere of influence. They invade Finland in the Winter War, are stopped by winter and fierce resistance, and only win by having the bigger army. They take some disputed territory and a naval base, but I'm not sure if they thought they'd take the whole country. The Union's weak performance in the Polish and Finnish war contributed to Hitler's belief that it would quickly collapse when the Axis invaded. The Finns would fight again after the start of Barbarossa in the Continuation War, which they planned together with the German action.

* Russia gives an ultimatum to the Baltic States to accede to the Union. They give in, and Moscow later demands that Romania cede a region called Barbarossa. This, and the earlier Vienna Dictate which forced it to transfer Transylvania to Hungary, brings about a right-wing coup. Romania joins the Axis and participates in Barbarossa. 

* While the Pact was in effect, there was a lot of Soviet-German economic cooperation. The Russians would provide oil, ores, and grain in exchange for technical information and industrial and naval hardware. 

* There were a series of border clashes between Soviet Union (and its puppet Mongolia) and the Empire of Japan (and its puppet Manchukuo) in what is now northeastern China. They don't escalate, but it showed how ineffective the Japanese could be fighting a professional military on land.

Oxen_boxen,"&gt;What started WW2?


A number of things. The *formal* event was Germany and the USSR partitioning off Poland. Western allies didn't necessarily *like* the Soviet Union, but they still had contractual obligations and treaties to fight with Poland, and Germany was the new kid on the block- I think everyone at the start of WW2 figured that if they had to fight anyone, it'd be the Germans and not the Soviets that would be easier to deal with.


But you need to go a lot deeper than that. 


First, you need to appreciate WW1. Now, where most countries funded the war by taxes, Germany took the unusual route of paying it off via loans. Which wasn't traditionally a *bad* idea. Countries don't go bankrupt in a conventional sense- Once Germany took itself off the gold standard the value of it's currency was in effect a guarantee to German *labor* rather than a concrete concept like *gold*. 


But then the Germans lost the war. Which both stuck out as bizarre to the Germans- not one set of enemy boots stepped into German territory- and insulting. They were made to look like the *bad* guys when they were fighting on behalf of allies who were dealing with states who were endorsing *terrorism*. Archduke Ferdinand had been assassinated by a state funded terrorist organization. Not to say Germany wasn't looking for an excuse to flex it's military muscles- it had already thumped more than one state who reasonably should have been doing the thumping, not being the thumpee, but Germany wasn't in a position where it could just sit on it's laurels- it was late to the colonization party. *Too late*. North America was colonized, South America was colonized. Asia had been colonized. Africa too. There was essentially nothing *left* to claim. What's more, it'd take *decades* to roll out a fleet that'd stand up to the likes of the British empire, or any other major players. If Germany wanted to prosper, it would essentially have to be on the corpses of it's European rivals. 



*At any rate* after this huge humiliation in WW1 which felt like it was more a consequence of grossly incompetent politicians domestically, and vindictive ones abroad, they got handed down the Treaty of Versailles. Aside from asking that a ludicrous amount of money be paid in reparations- most estimates have it being more than the country was even *valued* at- they were still out for the debt accrued to pay for the war in the first place. And the way the reparations would be payed would be a flat rate, plus around 25% of the money they profited off exports. Essentially Germany was wedged between massive war debt, war reparations, and their export economy, which they were obviously dependent on, got slapped with a 25% tax. 


So three things happened- Germany went *off* the gold standard, the quality of goods took a nose dive because no one wanted to pay a premium for something which fundamentally hadn't *changed*, and the value of the Reichmark imploded. Hyperinflation ensued because Germany had to make good on it's reparations and debt, but couldn't afford to cover it on the gold standard. Once off it, everything became a self-perpetuating cycle. As Germany spent money, the value of it decreased, which caused them to print more. Eventually it got to the point where France and Belgium threw up their hands and said, ""enough!"" German currency was beyond worthless at this point (people would express money in logarithmic functions rather than write out 16, 18, 20 zeros) and demanded raw goods. When Germany could make good on these (there does seem to be an argument that some elements in the Wiemar republic did this on purpose) France then occupied sovereign German soil. For reference on just *how* inflated reich marks would get, look at the wikipedia article on German hyper-inflation. 



So now we have Germany with a crippled economy, worthless currency, and with foreign soldiers occupying sovereign German territory in the Ruhr. 



Now, we'll add in the other terms in the Treaty of Versailles. First, Germany had to turn over land to Poland. Whom they hadn't lost to, and hadn't really fought either. In fact, Poland hadn't even existed! Despite being a state which had been constantly traded between the Russian Empire (historically), the Austrians and the Prussians, it was only Germany who really got stung by this. 



Additionally, the Germans were basically told they couldn't maintain an army, *at all.* This'd become a major player in Hitler's early propaganda to justify action in Poland and the Battle of France- while being told to disarm, no one really bothered following through. The Treaty of Versailles told everyone to take their hands off the trigger for the guns they all had pointed at each other, but in all reality their other hand behind their back was doing something else *entirely*.



So WW1 was kind of a swift kick in the nuts for the Germans, and they were reasonably aggravated by it. They were the victims of rival nations in Europe, and subjects of what they saw as incompetent politicians domestically, and it was *their* quality of life that was getting obliterated as a result.



And then Hitler shows up. To be certain, while he was popular, he wasn't *that* popular. Hitler didn't get elected into office, so he kind of had to browbeat his way into it. ""Cheat"" if you will. He tells everyone it wasn't really their fault. He throws out the treaty of Versailles. He modernizes the German army (ok, lets be frank: The panzer 1 and panzer 2 were awful designs and the Germans had a poor understanding of forecasting where tank development would go, while dramatically over-spending to fight what would come from it) and goes after the ""real"" enemies within and restoring German dignity abroad- Hitler actually got Chamberlain to balk at the idea of standing up to Germany! But there was an eventual end to Germany being able to politic their way around things. 



First, there were the Bolshiveks who were ideological opposites to the Nazi party, who'd now basically thrown out any pretense of republic and democracy. Hitler wanted a nation that chose a sort of middle path- not pawns of capitalism, but not mindless cogs in a grand communist machine either. Furthermore there was that whole issue with Poland- while it may very well have been political rhetoric to keep folks at home happy, Polish leaders had said a couple of times they weren't going to stop with just the land they won from Versailles. Hitler used this as pretense to war- which he'd further use to justify fighting France and the British. You'll notice the French and British declared war on Germany, but not the Soviet Union. It's not like Germany took all of Poland- some of it went to the USSR, under a treaty no less! 



In other words, the short answer is that WW2 started because Nazi Germany needed something to ""colonize"", and needed political fodder to justify itself. The state wouldn't have been self-sustaining under Socialism without making value come from *somewhere.* A lot of this was extracted from minorities and whomever they happened to conquer. 

&gt;why did the Nazis really hate the Jews?

As for the bit about Jews, its *complicated.* The were a victim of circumstance and convenience. Hitler needed to sell his concept of the German monoculture, and it just so happened that either through willful disinterest, or ostracism, Jews weren't a part of that. And a number of wealthy Jews happened to own some compelling businesses. Jewish bankers helped fund the allies in WW1. Jewish media (This was a feature of Germany's propaganda, I don't know to what extent the Jews owned media rings in the early 20th century. In short, the Nazi party wanted to ""call out"" the Jewish media for being a bunch of spin doctors, turning a country like the US which still was fairly distrustful of states like Great Britain due to their large populations of Irish and German immigrants) helped draw the US into WW1 and portrayed the Germans as monsters where they were previously just fighting another European war. Hitler basically sold Germany the idea that the Jews were ruled by some sort of hive mind, and that the actions of one Jew, or a group of Jews in the US was doing was the sin of the *whole* race / religion. 


It's a classic miss-use of correlation and causation being misunderstood. The Nazi party could plausibly demonstrate that some Jews happened to be in positions where they could fund efforts to make sure Germany lost the first world war, ergo *all* Jews were a problem for the state. Add some pseudo-science making them see sub-human, and boom, public enemy number one. 


When you hide a lie or two behind a truth or three, your average person is never going to know the difference. If you dig *far* enough you can make *any* group look bad. 


This'd only be further fueled by a willful disinterest in establishing *what* to do with the Jews. Krystallnacht had been orchestrated by Goebells (Goerning?) to impress Hitler. At some level initially the Nazi party had even talked of simply deporting all Jews to Palestine. The *reasoning* behind what is probably the most *core* reason behind all of this is actually in how they proposed to *pay* for it- the Nazi part was to seize all property of these Jews and compensate them in machinery. Which of course would be done at a rate that favored the State. 


Basically the Nazi party needed a political scapegoat to justify themselves, they needed money because the ghosts of war's past still haunted the German economy, and it just so happened that if everyone hated an entire minority (or several groups) they would be *far* more willing to turn a blind eye when they get shipped off to labor camps. Making the Jews a band of minority villains covered *all* three bases.

pwfd1177,"Different historians will give you many different answers to that question.  For one of the better analyses of what fascism ""is,"" I would consult Stanley Payne's *A History of Fascism*.

In short, fascism is a radical, authoritarian, rightist response to Communism and liberalism.  A fascist regime will espouse a fervently ideology in its political culture, bordering on a religious zeal.  This zeal is espoused by a charismatic leader that reinforces his (really has to be a man) extreme nationalism with romantic symbols.  The regime will enforce this ideology with a mass mobilization and militarization of the population, leading to an emphasis on masculinity and the vibrancy of youth.  

Fascism emerged from the Italian futurism of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.  [Futurism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism) took hold as the ideology of several political figures in Italy before being adopted and molded by Benito Mussolini.  It would later be adopted by Adolf Hitler and taken to even greater extremes of militarization.

Is it bad?  What defines a ""bad"" regime?  Technically, one might be able to see a nation prosper under fascism, depending on the leader in question.  However, it might be difficult to see fascism as a long-term regime in a political system.  Mussolini maintained fascism for quite some time, but he did so with great subjection of his people and countless rights abuses.  The historical conditions necessary for fascism to emerge tend to make one consider it as a ""bad"" system I suppose, but with the right charismatic leader, one could probably see ""benevolent fascism.""  

I am a graduate student currently taking a course on the history of fascism, so if you would like any elaboration, please feel free to ask (I'm running out of the office now).",null,6,cdmxkpk,1rg6xc,askhistorians,top_week,13
depanneur,"The fundamental roots of ideological fascism lay in the changes caused by industrial society on traditional hierarchies and social institutions. It was philosophically based in a 19th century critique of liberalism and positivism, as well as the writings of Gustav Le Bon and George Sorel, who wrote of the importance of mass movements led by a leader and myth which would direct man’s chaotic tendencies into constructive avenues through some sort of dynamic activism.  The assumptions of these authors were based on a widespread ‘fin du siècle’ attitude towards the challenges imposed by an industrial society which alienated man; on one hand, their individuality was robbed by industrial society but at the same time they sought an avenue to assert this individuality. 

Fascism was consciously constructed as a response to the theories put forward by Le Bon, Sorel and others and was meant to not only expunge industrial alienation through mass participation in an organic society, but also to provide a quasi-religious alternative to Marxism which would overcome the inherent dichotomies of industrial society (individual v. society, private v. public etc.) through a powerful state. Fascism's solution to industrial alienation was mass participation in an organic state led by a charismatic leader. Mussolini believed that a totalitarian state would be able to multiply an individual's abilities and creativity if he submitted to its authority.  It was also an open-ended ideology which allowed it to attract a whole spectrum of dissatisfied individuals, from conservative anti-Bolsheviks to more radical socialistic corporatists. It must be emphasized that the aims of fascism were meant to produce a sort of national rebirth, and was thus inherently nationalist. Paradoxically, because all fascisms are tempered by their nations' historical and social particularities, there can be no monumental fascism, just a 'fascist minimum' that has to be generally defined. It was necessarily brutal as well because fascist activism took on a militaristic aspect due to the fact that most members of fascist squads were veterans of the First World War, their leaders were frontline officers during the war and both viewed the post-war world embodied in liberalism, socialism and sometimes conservatism as an enemy to be destroyed. Fascist activism could take the form of rural anti-socialist campaigns in Italy, SA streetfights with communists and arguably the SS' role in the attempted eradication of European Jewry. 

On less philosophical level, fascism was a movement of the bourgeois class meant to protect traditional hierarchies from social revolution and also to organize societies in ways which would continue its social advancement.  Indeed, fascist traditionalism always coincided with bourgeois values and prejudices; fascism always thought of itself as a cultural rather than socio-economic revolution, which made it attractive to the upper classes.  Fascism was an outlet for bourgeois frustrations and anxieties that would simultaneously protect their treasured hierarchies and private property. Corporatism, fascism’s sole contribution to economic thought, was meant to reorganize economic and social relations into guild-like structures of workers and bosses that in practice amounted to a façade which hid a complex system of public and private bureaucracies.  Fascists believed that society and the economy should transcend class divisions (perceived as a Marxist invention) and be organized into a collection of corporatist bodies united under the all-embracing state.

Fascism, as has been described, was fundamentally anti-socialist because of these bourgeois prejudices. In Germany and Italy, both regimes came to power largely because of their physical anti-socialist campaigns and because conservative elites wanted to eliminate the Left in parliament who had institutionalized their power through the recognition of union rights, not because of their ambitious plans for cultural revolution.  As well, fascism’s anti-liberalism had no small part to play in its popularity. Liberalism, during the inter-war period, had become associated with Wilson’s Fourteen Points and consequently the results of the Paris peace treaties, which gave resonance to the ideology in revisionist countries like Italy, Germany and Hungary. Fascism was also anti-Conservative in the context of a generational conflict between old (conservative) and younger (fascist) reactionaries. In reality, fascists always cooperated with conservatives to some extent, and fascist leaders, most notably Hitler, preferred conservatives to other fascists.

onthefailboat,"Well, the really big change occurred after the US took over in 1803.  The first change in 1769 wasn't all that much of a deal as far as slavery was concerned.  Most of the citizen brought over by the French were prisoners or very low class people, without the capital to purchase slaves.  The colony was kind of a backwater and neither nation could really control the smuggling and extralegal activities that were the colony's primary source of profit.  There were certainly slaves, but the underpopulated areas of the territory gave them plenty of room to develop their own lifestyles, relatively free of interference.  This led to a very African creole culture.

Furthermore, as Catholic nations, Spain and France shared many cultural similarities regarding their slaves.  Free people of color and manumitted slaves were both more common in French and Spanish colonies than in English colonies.  This high proportion of free people of color persisted after the US took over, but it slowly decreased over time until the Civil War.  Before the Civil War Louisianians often kept the distinctions between the various degrees of ""blackness"", such as quadroons and mulattos.  After the Civil War, the ""one drop"" way of looking at African-Americans began to dominate, though former slaves and free people of color frequently ran into friction between each other.  

We've also come to realize, when looking at slavery in the western hemisphere, that the laws that the imperial power passed bared little relation to what was happening on the ground, most of the time.  Both Spain and France passed laws that were pretty nice to slaves, but slave owners rarely obeyed those laws.  Slaves in the area may not even know that the territory had changed hands for a good while afterwards.  And once sugar began to dominate southern Louisiana owners did whatever was necessary to squeeze the most profit out of their farms.

brennabru,"I suppose you're asking about women at court. For richer women who were inside, maybe a silk or cloth slipper (A bit like a ballet slipper) or a shoe that came to the ankle with a strap across the foot, probably again made of expensive and not hard wearing cloth. Rich women in towns would wear shoes with built up heels to keep their dresses out of the filth in the streets. London was one only three or four big towns at the time, so it's possible they would have worn these to go out, or boots for riding.  
Other rural women may have simple leather shoes that came to the ankle. Think the sort of shoe with a buckle strap across the foot for wealthier women, or for poorer women just a plain closed shoe, still leather that was simple and stitched together and hardy. Of course there were some who went bare foot. I believe that the strap and buckle sort of shoe was popular across England as seen here, styles and decoration would have varied according to class. I hope I could help! http://revival.us/luxurytudorshoe.aspx P.s- don't trust The Tudors on costume! As lovely as they look, I don't think they were particularly historically accurate.
Oh I forgot about men. Not too sure, I'm less sure about this. Probably more closed shoes for lower classes, not the buckle and strap. It's possible clogs (Made of wood and leather) would have been popular for working men, but generally more closed shoes would have been worn. Also, shoes like slip on leather loafers with much of a heel. I know the king would have worn the strap and buckle shoe too, like women, but with more of a flat front. Different materials would have varied. I'm pretty sure they generally wore shoes over boots (Boots for riding), and to us they may have seemed quite slipper like in comparison to the shoes we wear today, but the were only for the floors of court. 

I am a history student hoping to specialise in domestic history from the early modern period (1450-1750).

gwenever,"Heels first arose during Elizabeth's reign and were worn by both women and men.  Style was largely influenced by Italy during this time period, and Venice popularized a platform shoe called a chopine.  This site has some great original shoes, but they really demonstrate [extreme examples](http://blog.lulus.com/fashion/lady-gaga-meets-her-match-the-chopine-shoe/).  There could be some fashion competitiveness in court and if fashion could be taken to the extreme, you could bet at least a handful of flashy nobles would try to acquire the finest materials, or tallest shoes.  Elizabeth, it is said, was fond of her small feet and as a result had the hems of some of her dresses shortened in order to show off flashy, bejeweled heels.  It was not common prior to Elizabeth for noble women's footwear to be visible.  

While Elizabeth encouraged the nobility to consider elevating foot fashion, her father Henry VIII was interested in more northern regions.  Henry VIIIs great pride were his shapely legs.  In the Tudor dynasty well muscled but elegant legs were a highly desirable trait for men, and young Henry had sexy gams.  He frequently wore hose or tight fitting breeches and wore leg garters to tighten his legwear and accentuate his legs.  It's very likely that his obsession with leg garters contributed to the leg ulcer that became a debilitating issue later in his life.  But Henry's most interesting contribution to fashion was probably the tremendous size of the codpiece, which reached its zenith during his reign.  [This pic](http://www.backtoclassics.com/gallery/hanstheyoungerholbein/henryviii/) shows Henry rockin the leg garters and codpiece that he made popular.  You can also see his shoes, which are the turnshoe style mentioned by brennabru.  [Here](http://oxthepunx.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/img_1446ed.jpg) we see Henry's armor, with impressive codpiece on display.  

During Elizabeth's reign the codpiece fell quickly out of fashion and reduced greatly in size.  Elizabeth had far more of an influence on bringing changing shoe fashions to England.  The first heeled incarnations were similar to clogs, with a wedge heel, and eventually evolved into what we think of as a heeled pump or court shoe today.  The shoes would be made out of any fabric, with wealthier citizens having elaborate embroidery and extra high tongues (a display of wealth since they could afford the extra fabric and decoration).  

Boots were worn for practical reasons, like hunting, and could be any height from ankle to hip.  Tall boots might have a slashed and bloused top, be folded, crenelated or other decorative styles.    ",null,0,cdn670p,1rg195,askhistorians,top_week,2

The Reign of Terror, the Napoleonic Wars, and conflicts like the Franco-Prussian War kept the country in a state of near-constant warfare. Modernization to the rural areas came about due to the need to move troops and conscripts from rural towns. 

Remember, the gap between the so-called First Republic, in 1789, and the so-called Third Republic and Belle Epoque, was only 82 years. In between, France had the royalist restoration, Napoleon was emperor twice, they embarked on a major European campaign, Napoleon's sons were emperors, and France stuck into every major conflict in between. France had 3 republican eras, a monarchist era, and two ""empires"" in 82 years. By the time there was a peaceful era, they were only 40-ish years away from World War I.

sodade,"From a sociologist's point of view:

The economy of France was very different from England's. They had a culture of government sponsored jobs, where you had to succeed in an exam and if you did, you received a job that you were pretty much guaranteed to have for life.
This has been often indicated as the main reason for the industrial revolution happening much later and on a much smaller scale in France than in England (and the rest of continental Europe, which was far more inclined to follow the English model). There was just no real incentive for it.

The initial poverty that was caused by the industrial revolution (the link between poverty and having large families has been well researched) and the boom in healthcare and modern technology that were eventual results of it were, I would guess, some of the main reasons for the different population increase rates.

The military argument doesn't completely hold up for me (though it may explain a part). After all, the industrial era wasn't exactly a peaceful period elsewhere in Europe. Furthermore, the Grande Armée was typically a lot smaller than most people seem to think, except for the Russian campaign.

DonaldFDraper,"There are a few reasons as to why Caesar was able to fight ""the barbarian horde"" that we see in Gaul. 

First, it is a matter of equipment. A Roman soldier of the Late Republic was simple but effective. Wearing a strong bronze or iron helmet that covered his head but gave him a  good view that isn't restrictive. The armor, a chain shirt called the lorica hamata, covers most of the chest and protects from slash attacks and arrows from a distance. The scutum is a tall shield that would he able to cover 80% of a man on a full standing stance (crouch a little and the entire body is covered up). Finally the gladius hispanolis is twenty eight inches of steel that is meant for the stab from behind the aforementioned shield. This is a standard set of equipment that every legionnaire was given by the State/Caesar.

The standard Gaul could have anything. It could range from primitive plate armor from the rich to being naked; swords, spears, and clubs were used; shields to would vary to size, shape, and purpose.

Roman; d, there is a political situation to consider. At the time, up until Vercingetorix, Gaul was fragmented and tribal. They were eager to see each other come to ruin, so Caesar exploited this in order to defeat a lot of small enemies in several battles rather than one giant army that could overwhelm him. Caesar had the advantage of being the only Roman in the province to give orders, making him the central command with a strong army.

Third is the main reason for Roman victory, training and organization. If there is anything Rome is best known for, it is their training. In battle, a single Roman soldier against a single Gaul, the Gaul would wipe the floor with the Roman; however, the more Romans you add, the more they work together and can overcome armies much larger than themselves.

The most important thing for a Roman legion is how well they work together. They twin and fight together, they understand that the shield beside them is also helping protecting themselves. So the real skill for Romans isn't fighting, but fighting together, they could conquer the world.

The Gauls didn't train in the same way. Combat was focused on individual skill rather than as a team. This feeds into the Roman method of battle,. They didn't fight together but rather attacked the enemy with little local tactical control. This is why Rome won, because of training and skill.

From a directive issued by General Keitel May 13, dictated by the Fuehrer:

&gt;*[Russians] suspected of criminal action will be brought at once before an officer. This officer will decide whether they are to be shot.* With regard to *offenses* committed against *enemy civilians by members of the Wehrmacht, prosecution is not obligatory* even where the deed is at the same time a military crime or offense.*

Another from July 23:
&gt;. . . forces available for establishing security will be sufficient only if all resistance is punished not by legal prosecution of the guilty, but by the spreading of such terror by the occupying forces as is alone appropriate to eradicate every inclination to resist amongst the population.

So Hitler had directed for a brutal invasion, where a large-scale application of the piercing tactics used in Poland would be matched by subjugation of the native peoples. His commanders were told to encourage outright brutality and that soldiers who committed acts typically seen as war crimes would not be punished. Such would the large expanses of Soviet land be initially seized.

********

Another directive of Hitler from May 13 outlined that Heinrich Himmler (head of the massive SS) would be given immense administrative power for the execution of ""special tasks"", independently of the Army and under his own responsibility, for the socio-political transformation of Russia. Occupied areas were to be cordoned by the military, keeping even the ""highest personalities of the Government and Party"" from infringing on the SS.

Undoubtedly most of these tasks would focus on the eradication of certain undesirable Slavic peoples. It was envisioned by Alfred Rosenberg, one of the original ""thinkers"" of the Nazi Party when it was just a handful of anti-Semites meeting in pubs and a bit of an idiot**, that Russian territory in the European continent be divided into ""Reich Commissariats"". In the Baltic, some Germanic peoples would be assimilated; most others, especially in Latvia and Estonia, would be ""banished"" and replaced by Germans, probably war veterans.

These local governments would basically be vassal states under complete control from Berlin, formed to give some semblance of native representation and government structure. Poland was to be the protectorate of Ostland, Ukraine some sort of ""independent state"" (of course allied to Germany), Caucasia ruled by a German ""plenipotentiary"". All throughout his rise to German political power and the bloodless conquests of the early Reich, Hitler preferred a veneer of legality, however thin, to honesty about his subjugation of weaker states.

Hitler had long envisioned, and even laid out in *Mein Kampf*, that the large territories of Eastern Europe should one day be used as farmland for the Reich. Rosenberg espoused with savage honesty on what this would mean for the remaining Russian peoples in a meeting just a few days before the invasion:
&gt;The job of feeding the German people stands at the top of the list of Germany's claims on the East . . . We see absolutely no reason for any obligation on our part to feed also the Russian people with the products of that surplus territory . . . The future will hold very hard years in store for the Russians.

That's putting it mildly, since the populations would be forced into agricultural labor and given no thought for their own sustenance! Goering makes it clear:

&gt;Any attempt to save the population there from death by starvation by importing surpluses from the black-soil zone would be at the expense of supplies to Europe. It would reduce Germany's staying power in the war, and would undermine Germany's and Europe's power to resist the [Allied] blockade. This must be clearly and absolutely understood.

Had the German invasion and occupation gone off as planned, a secret German conference concluded that ""many millions of persons will be starved to death"". Russia was to be brutally seized and its population terrorized and liquidated when they had outlived their usefulness to the Reich.

As an aside, the high-level German planners seemed to view possible Russian emigration positively, thinking some may move to live in Siberia. To answer your question about the Asian elements of Russian territory, the Nazis did not seem to much care; they wanted the farmlands, oil fields, and population centers, not frozen wasteland with nobody in it. Germany was soon to cozy up to Japan, who had designs on East Asia; the Reich wanted Eastern Europe.



*The emphasis is in the original directive

**It's easy to give Nazi leaders a hard time in retrospect, but Rosenberg truly does seem pretty dim. His crackpot ideas helped solidify the early social/racial platform of the NSDAP, but are just as dumb and poorly thought-out as your typical /r/conspiracy post or what have you. After Hitler's ascension to master of the Nazi party he was mostly shuffled to an ineffectual general advising role.

Since this keeps popping up, I'm going to put this here: Please do not try to discuss exactly how much alcohol during pregnancy has what effect or is/is not safe! It is a contentious question and is best not discussed here on a history focused subreddit. This is a question that is better asked on r/askscience. (It is also a somewhat a contentious topic in the science community as well.) Asking it here will get your post deleted!
**End Disclaimer**

I want to start with saying that its very dubious to try and diagnose mental disorders based on historical writings, take these with a grain of salt at best.

Firstly, lets start with a discussion of FASD itself.
This particular disorder has several particularly major symptoms to it. Deformities of limbs, deformities of the heart, deformities of the face, vision difficulties and hearing problems... Ancient and middle aged medical science was so underdeveloped that the most severe expressions of this disorder would die outright, as well as probably most moderate cases. The high mortality rate of children during these eras (well up to the 1700's) would do the sufferers of this disorder no favors. (It is quite possible the severe expression of it would have contributed to the infant mortality rate over time in ancient peoples, though this is difficult to determine. Possibly the high death rate may have acted to reduce the incidence of the disorder, while the disorder did not significantly contribute to the death rate.)

FASD does not occur in all pregnancies when alcohol is consumed. (What I mean by this is, it may have an effect, but be so completely unnoticeable as to be undiagnoseable) The factors that interact with it are many and complex, and we really don't have any particular idea as to why it affects some but not others at varying amounts. Time of consumption IS important though, drinking with in the first 3 months of pregnancy is MUCH more destructive to the fetus than it is in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. This is simply because much of the critical neurological development is occurring in the first 3 months, and alcohol has the greatest effects on these structures at this time. (Note that alcohol consumption does not affect the embryo in the first two weeks of conception, it doesn't do any damage until the blastocyst has implanted into the uterus and resource exchange occurs more directly.) Research is ongoing and is focused on mice and rat analogies, no one really wants to put actual kids through the problems and disability associated with FASD, so a true clinical study of this is difficult. You have to find mothers willing to not only be a part of the study but also willing to drink while pregnant. It is important to note that FASD only is expressed as an environmental condition, much like most teratogenic activity in the uterus. It does not impact the person's genes, as a result, a parent (or both) suffering from FASD will not produce an FASD baby unless the mother drinks while pregnant. The mental disorder occurs ONLY when the fetus is exposed to alcohol.

Finally, a major effect on this disorder is severity, which I touched on earlier but didn't really go into much discussion on. A ""textbook"" example of the disorder is understandably severe, and might have difficulty surviving even on modern medicine, depending on complications. A ""minorly"" affected FASD person may be nearly indistinguishable from the general population except by those who deal with and experience the disorder daily and know exactly what to look for in behavior and appearance. These persons function in society just fine, and will probably live a perfectly normal life (for whatever time they exist in)
A moderately disabled person is already at a severe disadvantage. Many of them would probably die to various causes, depending on their abilities to cope, some may be able to live a semi-normal life in their time period. Many will probably live in destitution, even by the standards of the time. Severely afflicted persons are unlikely to survive owing to lacking medication and a complete inability to survive on their own.
FASD is a major problem today due to the mass production and ready availability of alcohol. It is also strongly correlated with poverty, though it is present at all socio-economic levels.

And as to the historical perspective, since we haven't nailed down the requirements as to how much alcohol creates how much FASD, its difficult to say how prevalent the disorder may have been in ancient populations. Since interactions such as time, food intake, amount of alcohol consumption, and good ol' genetic resistances all play a role, its difficult to nail down an answer. Chances are that yes, it did occur in the past, its prevalence would be somewhat dependent on alcohol availability in ancient times. A quick search brings up some sources that suggest alcohol was readily available. However one key factor still exists. Specifically, how much alcohol are WOMEN consuming, and in how great a quantity per session. A small amount of alcohol every now and then might not give most children diagnosable FASD (though there is still a chance it will.)

The website, http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/Controversies/1114796842.html#.UpPZ-sTUDz4, claims that drinking to the point of being drunk was actually fairly rare. If this is the case, then chances are you'd have mostly ""light"" and ""moderate"" expressions of FASD, these persons would be able to cope and survive reasonably well. You would probably notice deviations from the norm among afflicted individuals, depending on prevalence, they would still have a harder time functioning than most would. Interestingly, if the majority of persons are FASD, those that are normal might learn to act like an FASD person to an extent, without actually having the disability...

TL/DR: Yes, FASD likely occurred in the past. It is not expressed at the genetic level, it only occurs if the mother drinks while pregnant. 

Final Note: The most critical point for fetus vulnerability to alcohol (and other teratogens) is the first trimester. Second trimester will still have some risk of strong effects, but they will be somewhat muted. Third trimester is mostly about weight gain and finishing off development, alcohol exposure here is not as damaging.

An alliance, besides the fact that it was more desirable for Austria in 1910 than in 1870 politically, is an animal of a different kind. You choose it for however long it serves your purpose, while still remaining sovereign. ",null,0,cdnb0cy,1rfwns,askhistorians,top_week,1
DonaldFDraper,"Hello, this is a question that was somewhat asked by [someone else](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1qujn6/was_napoleon_a_child_of_the_revolution/).

With what I had said earlier in respect to Napoleon being a child of the Revolution, I still asert that Napoleon is a more moderate continuation of the French Revolution. He pushed reforms throughout the Empire and created many long lasting inovations (like the Napoleonic Code).

Again, it must be noted that Napoleon was a devout Jacobin and was arreste following the fall of Robespiere for being too Jacobin as the Directory was looking to purge the more radical elements of French politics. 

Despite the royal titles, I still see Napoleonic France as a continuation of Revolutionary France. When Louis XVIII sat on the French throne, he allowed people to purchase Legion of Honor medals and military commands. Quickly the people were alienated and the constant warfare that Napoleon had endured seemed better than the Ancien Regieme. Thus, Napoleon was able to rally most of France behind him during his Hundred Days campaign, desptie the fact that France was exhausted from over twenty years of near-constant war.

If there's anything to say what might give the best example of the spirit of the French Revolution in Napoleonic France, it would be the Legion of Honor. It could only be awarded to soldiers whom have shown extreme bravery and merit, and was approved by Napoleon himself. It couldn't be bought or awarded for no reason, it was for the bravest of the brave.

In the end, I will argue that Napoleon was the moderate but final phase of the Revolution. One where royality existed but anyone could become a noble.

&gt;On a side note, for a popular view of this, look toward Les Miserables. The father of Marius Pontmercy was awarded with a the title of Baron by Napoleon for retreiving five enemy standards and throwing it to The Emperor's feat. While a Colonel in the story, the view is that Napoleon gave titles to those whom deserved it, not because they were born into it.

&gt;A second side note, most of the titles Napoleon handed out were victory titles, not actual noble holdings. Some were given thrones (Bernadotte was Prince of Pontecorvo, Berthier was Pince of Neuchâtel, and Murat was King of Naples. All three were French Marshals and shown their skill in battle) but most of the titles were simply ""Prince of the Moskova"" (Ney) which entitled the holder to a heritary pension of a certain amount of money. There are still people whom hold these titles, the great grandchild of Massena wrote the introduction to Napoleon's Marshals, a collection of essays edited by David Chandler.

Edited to include more information on the second side note.",null,0,cdmu0cv,1rfv9q,askhistorians,top_week,5

caffarelli,"If we're talking solo artists, stage names show up for opera signers pretty early, and are well established by the start of the 18th century, and they're pretty abstract to me. The stage name Farinelli/Farinello (aka Carlo Broschi) is unclear in origin, it was probably a diminutive of any early patron, but it was also Neapolitan slang for something close to ""rascal,"" so it probably worked on two levels. Porporino, nickname of the less well-known Antonio Uberti, was a diminutive of Porpora, his voice teacher, but it also means ""purple."" So the stage names are a little playful.

Normally, attack helicopters don't come with AA missiles. They are made for air-to-ground combat and not air-to-air. I don't think that the Ka-50 is capable of carrying a heatseeker missile, only the unguided and guided by EKRAN ones. 


There is no reason for the Ka50 carry a heat-seeker AA. It flies on ""low"" altitude and doesn't have any ""scanner"" to increase the range and efficacy of the heat-seeker. And what if it had? Well, you would change the missile pod for a scanner. And another missile pod for two or three heatseekers. So the chopper would not be so great on the air-to-ground combat but it would destroy any low flying enemy... It's a much better strategy giving the infantry some javelins and use the heli to destroy MBTs.


Also, note that something similar happens to the A10C and Su25. They are prepared to air-to-ground combat, however, they can carry heatseekers. The A10C can use one of it's stations to carry two AA missiles, same thing with the frogfoot. But the A10 has a lock range of almost 10km, compared to the 4km of the Su25. It makes the enemy think twice before engaging them? No, most fighters has a max lock range of 12km. That is why the A10 and Frogfoot uses their AA missiles against choppers!



So I'm sorry but choppers fighting each other is mainly a Battlefield thing. They can try to take each other down using unguided missile. But let's be honest...

pharmaceus,"In what period? From 3000BC to 1500AD American capitalism had absolutely nothing to do with it - in particular that I doubt that Aztec Maya or Inca cultures had capitalism let alone any contact with Asia.

Also regardless of whether you look for definition of capitalism to lassez-faire or marxist sources there is no such thing as ""American"" capitalism. Capitalism is an economic system that can be and is applied almost anywhere. Because there are cultural differences we can speak about ""x economic model"" or ""y economic model"" but it is largely incorrect to say ""Chinese capitalism"", ""American capitalism"", ""European capitalism"". 

To answer your question as I think you meant it - no. ""American capitalism"" is not the result. China for example had arguably in many ways higher standard of living than Europe until it got closed off from the rest of the world by Ming emperors in 15th century. The standard of living in most of Europe was just as high as in America throughout most of XIX century and up until WW1 and Western interventions in China and Japan in XIX century were not just American interventions. The British had much larger influence than Americans in China.

The comparison of standard of living of an average person in Asia and in America is difficult for a number of reasons and requires an indepth study that could fill a book. There were some factors that made Asian societies a bit more backward socially - most importantly more archaic government and social class systems - but in any other sense they caught on very quickly.

It was WW1 that put a stop to that advance because of the eruption of civil war in China and then WW2 that had a devastating effect. Most Americans are taught about how far more destructive the war was in Eastern Europe but rarely it is mentioned with respect to Asia. The Sino-Japanese war cost 20 million lives and war in the Pacific cost another 10-15 million if you count native populations of Philippines and Malaya.   After that only some countries were ""blessed"" by American capitalism and those were:

* Japan - which was a large and rapidly developing economy before WW2
* Taiwan - which was in essence old pre-Maoist China on a small island
* South Korea - which was largely a copy of Taiwan/Japan in a different culture.
* Singapore - which became a city-state with its own economic model based on old British capitalism
* Hong-Kong - which remained British territory with old British economic model until 1997.

Those countries were pretty much responsible for their own standards of living regardless of American influence and their own choices affected how well they did develop. As for the other side of American capitalism I would point out to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia which for the next 40 years after WW2 were under very strong influence of American capitalism but without introducing any reforms of their own. They kept American-supported dictators which killed millions of people or were bombed to dust by bombs made in American capitalist factories. It wasnt until late 1980's and 1990's that some things began to change but still it is a far cry from any capitalism - let alone ""American"" one.

However if you are asking whether ""capitalist"" economic solutions improved the standard of living in places where they have been introduced as opposed to ""non-capitalist"" solutions - yes. But it has little to do with America and everything with economic efficiency and other things that a Scotsman called Smith wrote about in 1776.",null,1,cdneerb,1rfrwi,askhistorians,top_week,1

Flavored_Crayons,"Spain's involvement in the Revolution proved to be very important. Before officially joining the war in 1779 the Spanish secretly supplied the rebels with much needed resources such as gunpowder. This was conducted mostly via Spanish Louisiana. When Spain actively joined the war in 1779 they immediately played a key role. The entrance of Spain as well as France gave them numerical advantages especially at sea. The proximity of the French and Spanish threat to the British West Indies forced the British to stratify their military even further. In addition, the entrance of Spain in the war bolstered the threat of a mainland invasion of Britain.

Those factors can be described as passive side-effects of the Spanish entrance in the war. Spain did actively accomplish several objectives which directly aided the war effort. One of the most successful ventures was the conquest of forts in the Mississippi valley and British West Florida . Bernado de Galves (who you eluded to) was the governor of Louisiana at the time. He and many other Spaniards sought to recapture Florida which had been ceded to the British after the Seven Years War. British Florida was a loyalist haven during the revolution as many loyalists flocked to the territory to avoid the conflict and persecutions. It also served as a strategic stronghold and supply line of the Gulf Coast. With this in mind Galvez sailed to the capital of West Florida, Pensacola, and captured it in 1781 effectively gaining Spanish control over all of Florida (East Florida was not as populous and considered an afterthought) and the entire Gulf Coast. This paid great dividends as it eliminated any chance for the British to use the Mississippi River not only for supplying troops by also denying them the chance to perform a western invasion. 

So as we can see the Spanish did play a role in the revolution. Did they effect the eventual outcome of the war? Possibly, but it can be safe to assume that French support outweighed Spanish in terms of significance. This is not to say the Spanish efforts were not necessarily important. Spanish support greatly diminishes British presence along the Gulf Coast and severed their access to the Mississippi. As for Bernardo de Galves, I know he was promoted to general after his capture of Pensacola so that may be the reason he marched by the side of Washington, as he was an acting Spanish general. However, that is speculative and I don't know for sure.

caffarelli,"There is an academic subscription database of primary source documents on LGBT history that might interest you, I did a review [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1oakdj/saturday_sources_october_12_2013/ccqaf02) (TL;DR: it kinda sucks.) 

You know about [A Queer History of the United States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10065595-a-queer-history-of-the-united-states) right? Big deal when it came out, very comprehensive. 

There is an overall lack of records for gay individuals and gay history in American archives, I can tell you first off, because I work in one and I am aggressively gung-ho about collecting in that area to correct this. There are various reasons archival holdings in traditional archives don't have good coverage of marginalized people of all types, the typical story is that in the early years the archives actively won't accept the materials, and then when they come around the people don't trust the conventional archives with their materials, so they end up elsewhere. There are many small LGBT archives scattered around in that vein, [rukus](http://rukus.org.uk/archives/) is my favorite. 

Coverage is improving though. One rather unhappy reason: archives usually get stuff when people die, and lots of the big gay rights people are of the right age to start dying about now. [For instance, the Barbara Gittings papers](http://archives.nypl.org/mss/6397) are totally processed and available for use, and she was a big deal. 

In addition to lots of archives trying to correct the gaps in their records with living people of a retirement home age (we get a lot of stuff from olded people who need to move out of their homes) AND getting stuff from Late Greats, there's also a lot of wonderful local-level gay oral history projects going on with older gay folks.

onthefailboat,"There were a number of laws to try and limit the punishment of slaves to something fairly reasonable.  If you're looking at Spanish colonies, you have to start with the indigenous labor of the sixteenth century.  Bartolome de las Casas wrote several tracts opposing native labor on religious and humanitarian grounds and instigated several laws, like the New Laws and the Laws of the Indies.  It should be mentioned, however, that he suggested African labor instead of native labor, so how humanitarian he was is debatable.  Spanish laws, called *cedulas*, were supposed to protect slaves and make sure that they converted to Catholicism, but they were only occasionally enforced at the best of times.  In Spanish colonies, slaves could bring cases before courts and/or the church against their master if they were being abused or not brought into the church, which was very important to the Spanish.  In fact, there are examples of slaves using religion as a defense.  ""My master is so abusive that he made me renounce God and go to the devil"" sort of thing.

These laws were not terribly effective, however.  Many plantations were far away from the city where the courts were.  Though an official was supposed to check out the plantation, the fact of the matter is that they rarely did or could be bribed by the owner.  Even in the city, where slaves might have had access to the courts, it was likely that the master would be believed over the slave, unless there was overwhelming evidence of cruelty.  

During the 19th century, the Spanish seem to have backed away from stopping the owners' cruelty in favor of receiving more profit.  Cuba had become their main source of sugar, which was highly profitable.  To keep sugar production high they let the owners do what was necessary to keep the slaves working.  The mortality rate for sugar slaves was phenomenal, because of the cruelty and drive of their owners, but also because sugar production is destructive regardless.

pharmaceus,Larger population. in 1914 Germany had ~60 million people while Britain had ~40 million. If you have more people working with similar efficiency it is just a question of time. Germany took a bit to start since they were late with the first wave of industrial revolution (1750-1800) and the second wave (1850-1900) was not as prominent as in Britain because the country was only undergoing unification and German states had different degrees of industrialization at the time of establishment of German Empire in 1871. After that 40 years is more than enough to take over if you have larger workforce.,null,0,cdmwjj7,1rfmrg,askhistorians,top_week,2
King_of_Men,"Germany had several advantages. First, as pharmaceus mentions, was the larger population. Second, their emphasis in education was different: Britain educated its upper classes to be leaders and administrators and looked down on science and technology; Germany had much less of the ""ew, teknikol stuff"" attitude. The research university is a German invention. Then, consider that Britain had got its industrial lead in textiles and iron; Germany outcompeted it largely in chemicals, optics, and steel, where the lead didn't really exist - these were newish industries. Britain also had a lot of already-installed machinery that gradually became obsolete in the face of new technology; Germany could get a leg up by installing the newest stuff right away. 

An example of the British educational attitude from Kipling's ""Stalky &amp; Co"", which is moderately autobiographical: 

&gt; ""I've found out how the houses are built. Let me get up. The floor-joists of one room are the ceiling-joists of the room below.""

&gt; ""Don't be so filthy technical."" 

Well, really now. This is in service to a complex plan of vengeance, involving insults about not bathing and a dead cat. And what's the response to vital intelligence, without which no revenge can be carried out? ""Don't be so filthy technical""! It's all the more telling in that Kipling is not writing propaganda for anything in particular, unless it's the superiority of public-school education for making officers. It's just a piece of colour. So it presumably follows that it's the sort of thing a British schoolboy would be likely to say. And boy, doesn't it give you confidence in their leadership?

ArtemisSolie,"The where and how is a bit difficult to pinpoint, as religious art of martyrs has always been popular. In my own expirence of the Catholic faith, my first answer to this would be to think of St. John The Baptist...but when we look at imagery of him, he is oftentimes not in fact shown holding his own head--rather, it is on a platter as told in the story. We then should look to other saints whose beheading helped define them in the history of saints. It could be argued that the popularization of St. Denis of Paris, as noted by Butler in *The Lives of the Saints*, was the patron saint of France, and Bishop of Paris, and perhaps serves as the answer to your question. 

It is, I would say, St. Denis whose figure popularized the cehpalophoric images you're referring to. St. Denis preached the word of Christianity, and was ultimately beheaded for it, but before dying he walked a substantial distance while holding his head, or so the story goes, thanks to his religious purity and divinity. With a following dating to 400 AD, it would be [King Dagobert who would take St. Denis' sainthood to a nationalistic level.](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04721a.htm)--this popularization from 600AD onward of course would mean the production of religious imagery corresponding to St. Denis' figure. The popularization then, of not just St. Denis' figure but the Catholic church in general, we can see, continued right up until the Reformation and the religious civil wars in France in the 16th century. The St. Denis Basilica today remains as a testament of his popularity in the 12th century.  Imagery of St. Denis holding his head date back to these times, and is shown in the Notre Dame, the St. Denis Basilica, and many other places in Paris such as Montmartre. Cehpalophorism can also be seen referred to in literature, such as Dante's 14th century *Divine Comedy*, *Sir Gwain and the Green Knight* dating again to the 14th century, and even more recently, in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, in which the black knight is reduced to no more than a talking head. 

Overall, I would say that the cehpalophoric saints depictions originated thanks to the popularization of St. Denis between 600 AD, and the 15th century in France. ",null,0,cdmw3br,1rfllc,askhistorians,top_week,7
MarcusDohrelius,"In 993 [Pope John XV](http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/4636415/2/stock-photo-4636415-pope-john-xv.jpg) was the first pope to officially make someone a saint. Until that point, it had been a more localised veneration. That doesn't mean that there was not some bolstering that took place from official recognition, just that it wasn't a formalised process (Cambridge Medieval history volume 4.)

St Martin is a good place to start. Saint Martin was not martyred nor did he ever carry his head around. Why him? Sulpicius' account. Sulpicius was his biographer. And man, did he sensationalise. It almost reads like Martin of Tours was some sort of super hero: Martin deflects fire, Martin calls storms to raze idols, Martin deflects a tree some pagans dropped on him etc. (there are dozens of examples like this, [dozens!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI) ). Scholars have different takes on Sulpicius' account. You have to take into account genre, what is the ""truth"" is not always ""true"", and the historical context and purpose. Clare Stancliffe has an excellent book called *St. Martin and his Hagiographer* that is a very fair treatment. Others like T.D Barnes, who is brilliant and at times divisive in the field, seems to take great umbrage with the [chronological problems](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iqxFfcRzqh8C&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=t.d+barnes+on+martin+of+tours&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7v-_9QMGcV&amp;sig=laKePwaU72S9iOehDF_jfkQe3QQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qLuTUoSqGIeohAf6z4Bo&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=t.d%20barnes%20on%20martin%20of%20tours&amp;f=false). Why is Martin relevant, again? The sensationalism. 

The Edict of Milan in 313 changed everything. Or at least it symbolises the great change brought on by Constantine. This lead the way for great councils like the one at Nicaea in 325, Constantinople in 381, and Chalcedon in 451. Already, in the early 4th century there is a sense of reverence for those that survived and were martyred in ""the great persecutions."" This usually is referring to the Diocletian persecution. This lead to veneration, and what better reminder of a blessed ""new age"" than a tangible reminder of the saints' sacrifice. Thus the rise of relics and things attributed to them. Perhaps this was a workable model for a worshipful piety but things could get out of hand. 

You have to remember that, as literacy, the spread and exchange of writings, and the economy went downhill in Western Rome in late antiquity, people reverted much more to an agrarian, sustenance, and localised way of life. I am not arguing for a complete catastrophist way of looking at things, only saying that there was a notable decline. In many ways, it is clear there was a decline, even if there wasn't a ""fall"". Thus, many of the fertility, harvest, maternity etc. deities were replaced. The god of... the patron saint of... This does not mean that saints were ""worshipped"" like the Christian God, but just that their function may have in some instances replaced earlier pagan tradition. This is not an explanation of sainthood, as it goes back to the Apostolic Age, but it is merely how some (especially amongst the recently converted) communities purposed them. This is a simplification, but it will have to suffice.

I better get to the [good stuff](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090416101205/harrypotter/images/1/19/Nearly_headless_nick_petrified_basilisk.jpg) before we lose our heads... terrible just terrible. 

Setting all of this up with some contextualisation, keeping in mind the veneration of martyrs and also the growing cult of saints, let's look at some examples of Cephalophoric lore. Oh, one more note before the examples: hagiography would remain a really popular genre, even into later medieval England with the Carolingian renaissance reintroducing Latin accounts. This is probably where accounts like ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" derive some origin. 

St Pantaleon, c. 305, was martyred under Diocletian. Here is an excerpt from the Catholic Encyclopedia:
 ""An attempt was made to behead him, but the sword bent, and the executioners were converted. Pantaleon implored heaven to forgive them, for which reason he also received the name of Panteleemon (the all-compassionate). It was not until he himself desired it that it was possible to behead him.""

Nicasius, Bishop of 5th century Rheims:
Nicasius was beheaded by the Vandals. It is said that he was reciting Psalm 119:5 when he was then decapitated as he said ""My soul is attached unto dust."" But then his severed head continued to recite ""Revive me, Lord, with your words. 

Saint Denis, probably [the most famous cephalophore](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Saintdenis.gif). 
It is reported that he was martyred during the terrible Decian persecutions in the mid-third century. He was reportedly a missionary to Gaul, according to Gregory of Tours. After he was beheaded, he picked up his head and walked 10km/6miles with his head. The spot he finally ceased at, is now, by some accounts, commemorated by [St Denis Cathedral](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1246/767914888_066c1e620b.jpg). 
 
Which brings me to the point that France is most rich in the cephalophoric tradition. With legendary saints such as 
[St. Valerie](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Limoges_Crypt_03_Tomb_of_St_Valerie.jpg). I can't think of any Orthodox examples, though many Western saints are venerated in the by the Orthodox tradition. Perhaps some Byzantine expert knows. Anyway, hope that gets you started and contextualises things a bit.

spanktruck,"The answer is: depends who you ask.

One theory is that people misunderstood burial customs that placed the skull on the torso, which ehhhhhh. 

There is a strong connection cephalophores with the miraculous deeds of martyred saints--waking up, grabbing their beheaded head, and going about their way. In this way, they follow the tradition of saints who survive against all odds (lions quiet, executioners take pity, chains are loosed), to the point that the saint in question was briefly able to overcome death (cf. Acts of Paul and Thecla). If this is the case, then the cephalophores are an extension of the martyr cult, elaborated to such an extent that they manage to cheat death for a time to further devote themselves to the word of God. 

(As a sub-question of this, was St Denis 'patient zero' of this, or was his head-holding depictions merely the earliest known example of a train of religious thought that was known or gaining currency at the time, especially in the symbolism of conquering death?)

Another theory, by Montgomery in the book *Disembodied Heads in Medieval and Early Modern Culture*, links cephalophores and the practice of gathering parts of saints in reliquaries. Thomas Aquinas was apparently beheaded after death (13th century), so as to gather relics from his body. Montgomery links cephalophores with the rise of relics and reliquaries, which itself seems to date from late antiquity, [as this article on Victricius states](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0254.00083/abstract), and which itself leads to the cult of the saints, famously explored in Brown's The Cult of the Saints (1981). 

For Montgomery, then, cephalophores (in the model of St. Denis, who walked, and not in the model of those saints that simply spoke the gospel without moving from place to place) were an attempt to legitimize relics and locuses of power by imbuing their burial places with the spectre of their 'choice'. I find this unconvincing because Polycarp has people feasting at the graveside of martyrs, so it already seemed relatively legitimate. But I do like his idea of relics-cephalophores being linked, but perhaps not as causally as that. 

According to Wendy Meyer's introduction to her translation of the works of St. John Chrysotom, believers might attempt to be buried next to a martyr by the third century (itself documented in the Life of Polycarp, a non-canonical tale of a martyr). 

Mayer argues that the cult of the saints is a distinctly non-Christian set of practices--pilgrimages, some works on violent death (Maccabees), engagement with the dead, etc. 

To quote Mayer, 15-16:

&gt;In association a ""distinct theology of relics and the resurrection"" arose, which held that relics neither made a place impure [my note: a common belief at the time] nor had a neutral impact, but in fact purified the place where they resided, a reversal of traditional beliefs which paved the way for the placement of relics initially inside places of worship and ultimately within churches located inside city precincts. 

It is possible that St. Denis was the first cephalophore saint; alternatively, cephalophore saints originated with martyrs (including but not limited to Denis) holding their heads as a symbol of their spiritual triumph over death, since one of Jesus' powers--and a key component of the messianic eschatology seen in some, but not all, gospels--is the defeat of death. For more, Rosalind C. Love has some excellent footnotes on the historiography of the question in her Three Eleventh-Century Anglo-Latin Saints Lives (1996), page 60-61.

earthpresidentnixon,"I apologize if this reads as a bit cobbled-together but I hope it's at least in the direction of what you're looking for. My main sources are Nicholas Sammond's Babes in Tomorrowland and Steven Watts' The Magic Kingdom, but most criticism of ""classic"" Disney films usually has a lot of interesting history as well. I also recommend Richard Schickel.

The image of Disney that both he and his company worked so hard to perpetuate is that the man embodied ""essentially American values."" Sammond includes a very interesting quote from Fortune magazine in 1934, which profiled Disney and described him as combining Abraham Lincoln's humble origins and work ethic, Horatio Alger's entrepreneurial determination, and Henry Ford's industrial efficiency and management. His early animation-- here I'm referencing everything from the 1920s until 1937-- is characterized by a number of conventions, particularly sentimentality and the satirization of high cultural signifiers. Essentially, the themes of Disney's films were populist. Disney was ""one of us""-- he didn't go in for the highbrow and elitist, his interests and preoccupations were folksy, humorous, and common, and the sources of much of his stories were popular folklore. (Even the phrase ""Silly Symphonies"" suggests highbrow entertainment being brought to a popular level.) 

Consider the role of the movie theater in 1920s and 1930s America: this was a cheap form of entertainment that was not only accessible by, but hugely popular with, every class. The most popular stars of the era were those who frequently played down-on-their-luck characters: Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Shirley Temple (a bit later). This was a format that was constructing ""American-ness"" while simultaneously perpetuating it: self-denial and delayed gratification, hard work, consistent humour supplemented by emotional depth. However, early films were ""immoral,"" the lives of movie stars famously dissolute (Fatty Arbuckle in 1922, the introduction of the Hays Code in 1930), and there was a tremendous debate about the role and influence of these films on the minds of young people (a particularly influential study from 1932 compared the effect of movies on the minds of young people to the effect of World War I on the minds of combatants). What's important here is that people believed that the types of films children saw would influence the type of people those children would become.

Enter Disney, who provides reliably moral, genuinely entertaining film that quickly becomes very technologically sophisticated and appears to perpetuate real American values: not only of the success of scrappy underdogs and the virtues of thrift and perseverance in his films, but also through the image of himself perpetuated through a staggering amount of product licensing, even in the mid-thirties. Disney characters were mischievous, certainly, but they were clean and happy, romantic yet sexless. Mickey Mouse's eyeballs never popped out of his head when big titted Minnie sang jazz, for example. Basically, if your kids went to see Disney films, they might grow up to become like him, so you were quite happy to let them spend their afternoons at the theater. Magazines like Photoplay profiled him quite breathlessly. It also really is hard to overstate his influence on film and animation technology, but also on the general shape of film narrative: if you take a bit of time to watch pre-1928 animation on Youtube (1928 = the release of Steamboat Willie), it really is astonishing how, well, primitive and even amateur it appears compared to even Disney's earliest work. Tex Avery and Chuck Jones, who worked on Looney Tunes for Warner Bros in the thirties, did great work, but in general it was a case of other studios desperately trying to keep up with Disney. Max Fleischer (Betty Boop) is pretty much the only person who could come close, and he didn't have the marketing strength of the Disney Studio behind him.

Also, the image the studio perpetuated of itself in the thirties played a significant role in the public perception of Disney the man. The studio workers were simultaneously depicted as (I'm borrowing Sammond's words here) ""models of industrial efficiency [and] members of one big, happy family, with Walt as their avuncular leader."" The Fordist philosophy of manufacturing was of course still very much the ideal at that time, so imagine the significance of the Disney Studio during the Great Depression: a success story both in terms of industrial output and the warmth and sentimentality of family life. The release of Snow White sort of cemented everything, too: it was a huge artistic gamble, and still remains one of the most successful animated films of all time in terms of artistic influence (Sergei Eisenstein and Orson Welles both cited it as an influence).

Basically, what you have so far is: Disney's concept of himself as a quintessential American artist-manufacturer, relentlessly marketed. He undoubtedly believed it himself, and for the most part it was true.

Continuing briefly into the fifties and sixties, when the Studio's animated films were uneven and sometimes floundering, Disney himself hosted tv shows like The Wonderful World of Disney. His various nature shows were testaments to the ideas of the Wild West and the American frontier, helping cement Disney's image as a real American treasure, and his Buckminster Fuller-ful vision for the future of America (geodesic domes everywhere!) were popular and, people believed, only a matter of time. Disney intended to be at the forefront of that development. He was both visionary and traditional.

Despite his apparently populist thematic preoccupations, however, people like to talk about Disney's anti-union leanings. To be sure, he was very anti-union. After the success of Snow White, Disney didn't promote or give raises but gave ""salary adjustments"" to the animators he considered the most exceptional. In 1941, his animators went on strike (after, but not because, he accused the union leader of being a Bolshevik). After the strike was finally resolved, Disney (the individual) largely gave up on pushing the ""big happy family"" picture of the Studio; everyone knew it wasn't true, but mostly Disney didn't feel like he could trust anyone anymore. Later full-length films aren't directed by him; instead he later committed himself to television. There's no question that he was immensely unpopular among the animators that left after the strike, although a few of them eventually came back.

What is interesting to note here is that, despite the glee of the other studios at the apparent crumbling of the Disney Family, the animators' union was first formed when Max Fleischer fired every one of his staff animators who had signed with an artists' union. Warner Bros was also very unhappy with the new union and tried to lock them out but failed. Disney's animators, pre-Snow White, were among the best paid in the industry, but the production of Snow White was so risky and bloated that they all had to take large paycuts and work overtime; when the film was successful, they were understandably bitter that things weren't put back to rights. Being anti-union was pretty par for the course in the late thirties and forties, sadly. Disney was not the exception to the rule.

Anyway that's all I can tell you about the man himself. I haven't read Neal Gabler's biography which is supposed to be fantastic, but I do know that his daughter was infuriated by its publication and the negative image of him she believed it portrayed. Insofar as he can be judged good or bad, Disney was one of a breed of American industrial capitalist-- comparisons to Henry Ford and Rockefeller are apt-- ruthless but determined. I don't know if it's true whether or not he'd go around randomly accusing his dissident workers of being Communist, but it's certainly true that he was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in the 1950s, along with prominent film industry right wingers like John Wayne and Clark Gable (and Hedda Hopper!) (and Ayn Rand!!), which was extremely anti-Communist and a big support of the House Un-American Activities Committee (the blacklist). I think it's important to judge him independently of what the Disney Studio has become; you can chalk up a lot of the ""evil"" commonly associated with it now to Michael Eisner, who arguably was trying to follow in Walt's footsteps, but obviously was about sixty years out of date.

Hope that helps!

Edit: breaking up the wall of text, but also, in response to charges of anti-Semitism and racism: I've heard the anti-Semitic stuff before-- mostly that he and Leni Riefenstahl were ""good friends,"" and that he was bitter because a Jewish producer had stolen his Oswald character (both of these are unsubstantiated although he did like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will pre-1938) but Neal Gabler denies that he was any more anti-Semitic than his contemporaries. As for racism, again, all the evidence I've read or seen doesn't suggest tendencies any more racist than his contemporaries. People point to Song of the South and the crows in Dumbo but these works seem to me to be motivated by a (obviously woefully misguided) attempt at humour rather than to denigrate Blacks. In many ways, Walt was way ahead of his times; in others, he was very much a product of them.",null,8,cdmwfdt,1rfd7h,askhistorians,top_week,62

ArtemisSolie,"The best book I can recommend you on Walt Disney is Neal Gabler's *Walt Disney: The Triumph of The American Imagination.* Within it, Gabler goes into extensive detail on every aspect of Walt's life, drawing on first hand sources, as well as second hand account of what it was like to live and work with Walt. 

From my understanding of Gabler, Walt Disney was a product of not only his time, but his upbringing. Raised into a distinctively religiously conservative family, Walt was likely discouraged from interaction with people of different skin colour, sexual orientations, or even religions. I also recall Gabler commenting on the extreme discipline that Walt faced from his father, perhaps pointing towards why he was a controlling or somewhat forcefully organized person. His upbringing, coupled with the extremely racist era in which he lived, his prejudice is quite obvious. Perhaps you should ask yourself then--Was every white person pre-civil rights movement a bad person? The answer would be No. They were simply ignorant and unaware. Walt's extreme influence on the American way of life and public media can perhaps be used as an argument against the answer here, but the fact remains that Walt was merely a product of his upbringing and times.

earthpresidentnixon,"I apologize if this reads as a bit cobbled-together but I hope it's at least in the direction of what you're looking for. My main sources are Nicholas Sammond's Babes in Tomorrowland and Steven Watts' The Magic Kingdom, but most criticism of ""classic"" Disney films usually has a lot of interesting history as well. I also recommend Richard Schickel.

The image of Disney that both he and his company worked so hard to perpetuate is that the man embodied ""essentially American values."" Sammond includes a very interesting quote from Fortune magazine in 1934, which profiled Disney and described him as combining Abraham Lincoln's humble origins and work ethic, Horatio Alger's entrepreneurial determination, and Henry Ford's industrial efficiency and management. His early animation-- here I'm referencing everything from the 1920s until 1937-- is characterized by a number of conventions, particularly sentimentality and the satirization of high cultural signifiers. Essentially, the themes of Disney's films were populist. Disney was ""one of us""-- he didn't go in for the highbrow and elitist, his interests and preoccupations were folksy, humorous, and common, and the sources of much of his stories were popular folklore. (Even the phrase ""Silly Symphonies"" suggests highbrow entertainment being brought to a popular level.) 

Consider the role of the movie theater in 1920s and 1930s America: this was a cheap form of entertainment that was not only accessible by, but hugely popular with, every class. The most popular stars of the era were those who frequently played down-on-their-luck characters: Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Shirley Temple (a bit later). This was a format that was constructing ""American-ness"" while simultaneously perpetuating it: self-denial and delayed gratification, hard work, consistent humour supplemented by emotional depth. However, early films were ""immoral,"" the lives of movie stars famously dissolute (Fatty Arbuckle in 1922, the introduction of the Hays Code in 1930), and there was a tremendous debate about the role and influence of these films on the minds of young people (a particularly influential study from 1932 compared the effect of movies on the minds of young people to the effect of World War I on the minds of combatants). What's important here is that people believed that the types of films children saw would influence the type of people those children would become.

Enter Disney, who provides reliably moral, genuinely entertaining film that quickly becomes very technologically sophisticated and appears to perpetuate real American values: not only of the success of scrappy underdogs and the virtues of thrift and perseverance in his films, but also through the image of himself perpetuated through a staggering amount of product licensing, even in the mid-thirties. Disney characters were mischievous, certainly, but they were clean and happy, romantic yet sexless. Mickey Mouse's eyeballs never popped out of his head when big titted Minnie sang jazz, for example. Basically, if your kids went to see Disney films, they might grow up to become like him, so you were quite happy to let them spend their afternoons at the theater. Magazines like Photoplay profiled him quite breathlessly. It also really is hard to overstate his influence on film and animation technology, but also on the general shape of film narrative: if you take a bit of time to watch pre-1928 animation on Youtube (1928 = the release of Steamboat Willie), it really is astonishing how, well, primitive and even amateur it appears compared to even Disney's earliest work. Tex Avery and Chuck Jones, who worked on Looney Tunes for Warner Bros in the thirties, did great work, but in general it was a case of other studios desperately trying to keep up with Disney. Max Fleischer (Betty Boop) is pretty much the only person who could come close, and he didn't have the marketing strength of the Disney Studio behind him.

Also, the image the studio perpetuated of itself in the thirties played a significant role in the public perception of Disney the man. The studio workers were simultaneously depicted as (I'm borrowing Sammond's words here) ""models of industrial efficiency [and] members of one big, happy family, with Walt as their avuncular leader."" The Fordist philosophy of manufacturing was of course still very much the ideal at that time, so imagine the significance of the Disney Studio during the Great Depression: a success story both in terms of industrial output and the warmth and sentimentality of family life. The release of Snow White sort of cemented everything, too: it was a huge artistic gamble, and still remains one of the most successful animated films of all time in terms of artistic influence (Sergei Eisenstein and Orson Welles both cited it as an influence).

Basically, what you have so far is: Disney's concept of himself as a quintessential American artist-manufacturer, relentlessly marketed. He undoubtedly believed it himself, and for the most part it was true.

Continuing briefly into the fifties and sixties, when the Studio's animated films were uneven and sometimes floundering, Disney himself hosted tv shows like The Wonderful World of Disney. His various nature shows were testaments to the ideas of the Wild West and the American frontier, helping cement Disney's image as a real American treasure, and his Buckminster Fuller-ful vision for the future of America (geodesic domes everywhere!) were popular and, people believed, only a matter of time. Disney intended to be at the forefront of that development. He was both visionary and traditional.

Despite his apparently populist thematic preoccupations, however, people like to talk about Disney's anti-union leanings. To be sure, he was very anti-union. After the success of Snow White, Disney didn't promote or give raises but gave ""salary adjustments"" to the animators he considered the most exceptional. In 1941, his animators went on strike (after, but not because, he accused the union leader of being a Bolshevik). After the strike was finally resolved, Disney (the individual) largely gave up on pushing the ""big happy family"" picture of the Studio; everyone knew it wasn't true, but mostly Disney didn't feel like he could trust anyone anymore. Later full-length films aren't directed by him; instead he later committed himself to television. There's no question that he was immensely unpopular among the animators that left after the strike, although a few of them eventually came back.

What is interesting to note here is that, despite the glee of the other studios at the apparent crumbling of the Disney Family, the animators' union was first formed when Max Fleischer fired every one of his staff animators who had signed with an artists' union. Warner Bros was also very unhappy with the new union and tried to lock them out but failed. Disney's animators, pre-Snow White, were among the best paid in the industry, but the production of Snow White was so risky and bloated that they all had to take large paycuts and work overtime; when the film was successful, they were understandably bitter that things weren't put back to rights. Being anti-union was pretty par for the course in the late thirties and forties, sadly. Disney was not the exception to the rule.

Anyway that's all I can tell you about the man himself. I haven't read Neal Gabler's biography which is supposed to be fantastic, but I do know that his daughter was infuriated by its publication and the negative image of him she believed it portrayed. Insofar as he can be judged good or bad, Disney was one of a breed of American industrial capitalist-- comparisons to Henry Ford and Rockefeller are apt-- ruthless but determined. I don't know if it's true whether or not he'd go around randomly accusing his dissident workers of being Communist, but it's certainly true that he was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in the 1950s, along with prominent film industry right wingers like John Wayne and Clark Gable (and Hedda Hopper!) (and Ayn Rand!!), which was extremely anti-Communist and a big support of the House Un-American Activities Committee (the blacklist). I think it's important to judge him independently of what the Disney Studio has become; you can chalk up a lot of the ""evil"" commonly associated with it now to Michael Eisner, who arguably was trying to follow in Walt's footsteps, but obviously was about sixty years out of date.

Hope that helps!

Edit: breaking up the wall of text, but also, in response to charges of anti-Semitism and racism: I've heard the anti-Semitic stuff before-- mostly that he and Leni Riefenstahl were ""good friends,"" and that he was bitter because a Jewish producer had stolen his Oswald character (both of these are unsubstantiated although he did like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will pre-1938) but Neal Gabler denies that he was any more anti-Semitic than his contemporaries. As for racism, again, all the evidence I've read or seen doesn't suggest tendencies any more racist than his contemporaries. People point to Song of the South and the crows in Dumbo but these works seem to me to be motivated by a (obviously woefully misguided) attempt at humour rather than to denigrate Blacks. In many ways, Walt was way ahead of his times; in others, he was very much a product of them.",null,8,cdmwfdt,1rfd7h,askhistorians,top_week,62

FeatofClay,"""A color barrier"" (to me) suggests a situation where a significant number of athletes in an ethnic group are playing the sport, but are being kept out of leagues due to bias.  Hockey presents a different situation.  Hockey is not a very ethnically diverse sport; there aren't that many black hockey players at any level.  Therefore I think it's an open question whether it's access to the sport, or racial bias, that keeps black players out of the NHL.  

The first black hockey player in the NHL, Willie O'Ree, joined the roster in 1958, which was certainly later than the MLB and NBA dates.  There has been plenty written about the racially-oriented abuse he got from fans.

leavenworth,"[Sir William Stanley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_(Battle_of_Bosworth), the younger son of the 1st Baron Stanley, basically made a career out of reversals. 

He was a soldier during the War of the Roses. His family was aligned with the Lancasters; however, over several decades, William helped the Yorks defeat the Lancasters, then helped the Tudors defeat the Yorks, and then finally was caught conspiring against Henry Tudor. He and his brother, Thomas, had a reputation for staying firmly in one camp throughout the whole war, and that camp was Camp Stanley. 

Background: the War of the Roses centered around two lines in the House of Plantagenet. There were the Yorks, whose herald was a [white rose](http://www.scottish-country-dancing-dictionary.com/images/white-rose-of-york.jpg), and the Lancasters, whose herald was a [red rose](http://www.jewelsdujour.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Roseof-Lancaster.jpg). Towards the end of the war, the throne passed back and forth between [Henry VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England) of Lancaster and [Edward IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England) of York, with Henry ruling until 1461, then Edward ruling from 61 to 70, then Henry coming back and ruling from 70 to 71, and then Edward returning and ruling until 1483. In 1471, William Stanley captured Margaret of Anjou, Henry VI's wife and a major Lancaster player. He was a Yorkist hero and received land and honors under Edward. He continued to be well regarded under Edward's brother, the next king of England, Richard III, who took the throne in 1483.

Right after Richard took the throne, a guy named [Henry Tudor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England) began gaining support. He had a Lancaster claim through his mother, and soon was betrothed to Edward IV's eldest daughter Elizabeth, Richard III's niece, and a York. (When he was crowned and they were married, he created [a new Herald for House Tudor, a white and red rose](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Tudor_Rose.jpg). Symbolism!) It became increasingly clear that Henry Tudor was planning on taking the throne. William was still considered a staunch Yorkist, but his older brother, Thomas, was married to Henry Tudor's mom, so Richard III was a little worried about where the Stanley's allegiance might lie in the upcoming battles. He stripped her of her titles and gave them to Thomas Stanley, thinking that would appease the brothers. 

Henry Tudor's and Richard III's armies met at the Battle of Bosworth in August of 1485. The Stanley brothers were summoned by both sides before the battle, but they deferred, preferring to see where the winds blew on that specific day. Richard III actually wrote to Thomas Stanley and warned him that he had his eldest son and heir and that he would execute him if the Stanleys did not show up for battle. In an epic ""oh snap"" moment, Thomas wrote back, ""Sire - I have other sons."" During the Battle, Richard III decided to defeat Henry himself, and went after him. His guard was outnumbered and he was separated from the rest of his large army; seeing this, our good friend William Stanley decided he was a loyal Lancaster after all and joined Henry Tudor's forces with his men. Richard III was unhorsed - unlike Shakespeare's Richard, however, the real Richard III was offered several horses and turned them all down before he was killed by Henry Tudor's forces.

William Stanley, now a Lancaster/Tudor hero, once again enjoyed a very comfortable, even wealthier position. The new king Henry VII gave him *more* honors and lands, including the post of [Lord Chamberlain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain). But you know that bit of advice you always give people when they date someone who is in a relationship? ""If they're cheating on their current partner with you, then they're probably going to cheat on you with someone else""? Yeah, Henry VII learned that about ten years later, when William was accused of conspiring to help [Perkin Warbeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkin_Warbeck) overthrow Henry VII. 

Who was Perkin Warbeck? Without getting too much into it, Richard III had [two nephews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_in_the_Tower) who'd had a better claim on the throne than him, who mysteriously disappeared about three months after their father, Edward IV's, death. They were most likely killed, but this has never been confirmed, so Warbeck was one of the people who popped up claiming to be royalty (kind of like a [Anna Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Anderson)/Anastasia situation). Anyway, Sir William admitted that if Warbeck was Edward IV's real son, then he wouldn't take arms against him and suggested that, sure, maybe Warbeck had a claim to the crown. Since his brother, Thomas, was still in good standing, it's possible that Sir William thought himself safe; however, Henry VII was worried about the message such lenience would send, and so William Stanley was executed as a traitor. 

Or, more accurately, William Stanley was executed for being a traitor for the wrong side, because the other two times actually went pretty well for him. ",null,3,cdmtogu,1rf8su,askhistorians,top_week,13
Spinoza42,"The liberal turn of the British Quakers was quite a reversal. In the 1850s and 1860s the British Quakers had started to move towards a more Evangelical position. Members who questioned the importance of the Bible or of Jesus' resurrection were censured or sometimes removed from the Society. Meetings that had been mostly or completely silent for years or decades were stirred up by inspired speakers, who refocused the Quakers' attention to the Bible and the figure of Jesus.

But by 1920 the British Quakers had completely turned this around. For many Christianity became not much more than heritage, and the British Yearly Meeting as a whole began to accept that such a view existed within it. Quakerism became more of a way of life than a message. 

This stunning reversal of fortunes of the liberals and the evangelicals can be explained by a third group which switched its allegiance: the traditionalists. Early on the traditionalists had supported the evangelicals, fearing that the liberal criticisms of Bible and Jesus would destroy the Quakers as a Christian organization. The evangelicals' support of reading the bible in meeting, and other forms of more ""programmed"" meeting might be constructed as innovation, but if it would ensure that ""unsound"" doctrine would be compensated by sound and Christian religion, then so be it.

But the evangelicals overplayed their hand. In 1887 American Evangelical Quakers had made a joint statement, the Richmond Declaration. In 1888 this statement was submitted to the British Yearly Meeting, where it met with resistance. The declaration was seen as a creed, and as giving too little recognition of the inner light. This marked a turning point for the traditionalists, who came to see the evangelicals as a greater threat to the Quaker identity than the liberals. Over the next thirty years British Quakerism would be modernized spectacularly, and completely change its relationship to the rest of Christianity and the wider world.

The question remains whether this movement would have happened without the Richmond Declaration as well. The modern world was challenging all Christian denominations, which meant that sooner or later all of them had to choose to either accept modernity or contrast themselves to it. That the British Quakers chose to largely accept it is surprising, and that they largely rejected the evangelical spirit of the third great awakening is altogether baffling. The discussion of the Richmond Declaration really seems to be a turning point.",null,2,cdmxvxw,1rf8su,askhistorians,top_week,11
sn0wdizzle,"One of the most important changes in New Deal history was when United States Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts systematically switched voting blocs and started consistently voting to uphold New Deal legislation.

[Prior to the this switch, the Supreme Court had struck down most of FDR's 'first New Deal.'](http://www.dlt.ncssm.edu/lmtm/docs/newdeal/script.pdf) This annoyed FDR so greatly that he proposed a law which would allow the President to appoint six additional justices (for a maximum of 12), one for every sitting justice older than 70.5. The move was incredibly controversial and it caused significant grief to him at the time. He wasn't deterred however and tasked future SC justice Robert Jackson to write a book defending the President's power to do this from a legal and historical stand point. Instead of backing down, he doubled down.

So anyway, the bill goes forward and ultimately is killed with a 70-20 vote (which sent it back to the committee). This happened on July 22, 1937. Even though FDR lost the legislative battle to 'pack the court,' he won the Court because in *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish* Justice Roberts (decision published that spring) switched from generally voting with the conservative bloc to voting with the liberal bloc. In the rest of cases for that SC term, Roberts voted with the pro FDR bloc, voting to uphold as constitutional little programs like the NLRA and twice, the social security tax.

If you've heard of it, you know it as the switch in time that saved nine.  What is regrettable, however, is that we don't know why he switched as he, like Hugo Black, burned most of his notes^1.  Was he concerned for institutional integrity? Did he want to be on team Roosevelt? There is speculation in [Feldman's Scorpions] (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/books/review/ACohen-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) that it was institutional legitimacy (I'll make sure when I return home) and that is one of the more recent good sources on the issue.

LordSariel,"Many people don't know this, but the initial Franco-American Alliance of 1778 was not a planned event.

Benjamin Franklin, and his fellow diplomats Silas Deane and Arthur Lee, were sent to France with a ""Model Treaty"" draft that was ratified by Congress in 1776. This draft, and the orders that accompanied it, explicitly stated that the Commissioners to Paris were to seek a commercial alliance with France. In the minds of Congress, this commercial diplomacy would infuse the American cause with some much needed money, and simultaneously increase American credit abroad. Ideally this would allow for money to build and crew ships to protect an increase in shipping, as well as allow the United States to purchase supplies on their own in Europe. To compound this, Congress deliberately tried to avoid any entanglement in the complex web of European affairs, hoping for a purely capitalist alliance.

However upon arrival in France, the Commissioners were woefully unprepared to meet this steep task, and the virtually non-existent U.S. navy was scarcely a match for the British domination of the High Seas. So, in an unprecedented change of tact, Franklin pursued, and successfully negotiated, a political alliance in addition to the commercial one. This explicitly brought France into the war on behalf of the United States, but was on friendly terms, and without sacrificing too much autonomy of the nascent American Union. More importantly, Franklin did this without the knowledge of the Congress, who had not received any of his dispatches 11 months, prompting some historians to call the diplomacy ""the great improvisation.""",null,3,cdn8eae,1rf8su,askhistorians,top_week,8

[Prior to the this switch, the Supreme Court had struck down most of FDR's 'first New Deal.'](http://www.dlt.ncssm.edu/lmtm/docs/newdeal/script.pdf) This annoyed FDR so greatly that he proposed a law which would allow the President to appoint six additional justices (for a maximum of 12), one for every sitting justice older than 70.5. The move was incredibly controversial and it caused significant grief to him at the time. He wasn't deterred however and tasked future SC justice Robert Jackson to write a book defending the President's power to do this from a legal and historical stand point. Instead of backing down, he doubled down.

So anyway, the bill goes forward and ultimately is killed with a 70-20 vote (which sent it back to the committee). This happened on July 22, 1937. Even though FDR lost the legislative battle to 'pack the court,' he won the Court because in *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish* Justice Roberts (decision published that spring) switched from generally voting with the conservative bloc to voting with the liberal bloc. In the rest of cases for that SC term, Roberts voted with the pro FDR bloc, voting to uphold as constitutional little programs like the NLRA and twice, the social security tax.

If you've heard of it, you know it as the switch in time that saved nine.  What is regrettable, however, is that we don't know why he switched as he, like Hugo Black, burned most of his notes^1.  Was he concerned for institutional integrity? Did he want to be on team Roosevelt? There is speculation in [Feldman's Scorpions] (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/books/review/ACohen-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) that it was institutional legitimacy (I'll make sure when I return home) and that is one of the more recent good sources on the issue.

LordSariel,"Many people don't know this, but the initial Franco-American Alliance of 1778 was not a planned event.

Benjamin Franklin, and his fellow diplomats Silas Deane and Arthur Lee, were sent to France with a ""Model Treaty"" draft that was ratified by Congress in 1776. This draft, and the orders that accompanied it, explicitly stated that the Commissioners to Paris were to seek a commercial alliance with France. In the minds of Congress, this commercial diplomacy would infuse the American cause with some much needed money, and simultaneously increase American credit abroad. Ideally this would allow for money to build and crew ships to protect an increase in shipping, as well as allow the United States to purchase supplies on their own in Europe. To compound this, Congress deliberately tried to avoid any entanglement in the complex web of European affairs, hoping for a purely capitalist alliance.

However upon arrival in France, the Commissioners were woefully unprepared to meet this steep task, and the virtually non-existent U.S. navy was scarcely a match for the British domination of the High Seas. So, in an unprecedented change of tact, Franklin pursued, and successfully negotiated, a political alliance in addition to the commercial one. This explicitly brought France into the war on behalf of the United States, but was on friendly terms, and without sacrificing too much autonomy of the nascent American Union. More importantly, Franklin did this without the knowledge of the Congress, who had not received any of his dispatches 11 months, prompting some historians to call the diplomacy ""the great improvisation.""",null,3,cdn8eae,1rf8su,askhistorians,top_week,8

Starting off with a hunter-gatherer environments, it is a common misconception that the work week was longer than is it today.  Even including work that would not be classified as hunting or gathering, the average workday would be well below 5 hours! [1]  There would only be a few (2 to 4) days that would be considered a workday as well.  So for the average week, there would be 8 to 16 hours of work accomplished.  Richard Lee describes a hunter-gatherer environment where ""They spent between twelve and nineteen hours per week obtaining food, devoting their ample leisure to social interactions, ritual dancing and the creation of glorious rock art."" [1a]

Jumping forward to the industrial revolution, the workweek was extended greatly from before.  Were workers before were bound to the day/night cycle, now the workers could work into the hours of darkness.  Another factor is that most jobs now did not depend on the season, and could be done year round.  It is common to hear of schedules consisting of six grueling 16 hour days in a single week. [2]

Labor laws, unions, as well as a strong movement my Henry Ford (who believed in a shorter work hours) gradually caused the amount of work hours in a week roughly get cut in half and doubling the average wage at the time.  Henry Ford was a large catalyst in American culture, setting the example for other work centers.  [3]

Each culture treats breaks in the week in a different way.  A very common cause is religion.  Most of the western world is Monday-Friday (or Saturday), with Sunday set aside for the traditional day of the Sabbath.  Several Muslim countries work Sunday-Thursday or Saturday- Wednesday due to Friday’s prayer, Jumu'ah.

Around 82 days off and 82 half days, versus a modern 104 full days off for weekends (plus any vacation time). Medievals also worked a lot less in winter.

 The shorter weekend probably sounds harsh to many modern people, but when I think of how many busy activities most of us try to cram into a weekend versus a full day of rest I'm not sure the medievals didn't have a lot more actual down time.

 The Romans didn't have a weekend, but they did have a lot of feast days, so many that some months were essentially half months.

Upon realising this, some people look towards non-western or non-mainstream views on the subject - but these often just swing in the opposite direction. I've actually got a book here called 'A different view on Stalin'. While it does dispel some of the myths about the man propagated in mainstream historiography, it's also blatantly written by a Stalinist looking to whitewash history. While I'm not saying the answer is in the middle (it's not), when reading about Mao you'll have to be acutely aware of the controversial nature of pretty much every work about him. Look for works by authors that don't have a point to prove (either way) - a good rule of thumb is to look for the most boring works.

Samuel_Gompers,"First, taxes do not equal communism. One can support all sorts of left-wing ideas and not be a communist; in fact, you can be virulently *anti*-communist. There is no transitive property in public policy, as useful a propaganda tool as that idea may be. There are many examples of groups within the post-war American liberal coalition fracturing over the issue of Communism, such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations and, more specifically, the United Auto Workers. To look more politically, the Democratic Party split three ways in 1948, first over the issue of race, leading to Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats, and second (among many reasons) over the issue of how the United States should deal with communism and the Soviet Union, leading to Henry Wallace and the Progressive Party. 

Second, American public policy changed drastically during World War II. There are several ways to pay for a war, which includes borrowing money, raising taxes, and printing money. During WWII, the U.S. government preferred the first two options, relying on significant hikes in marginal tax rates and borrowing money from the American public through War Bonds. Remember also that there are multiple types of taxes, not just the income tax they talk about in ""Mad Men"" (my favorite show, by the way). Corporate taxes also went up during the war, both as a method of funding and as an attempt to prevent profiteering. Many of these taxes remained in place in some form or another after the war in an attempt to bring down the debt the Government had incurred. To another degree, these taxes were also used to fund the expanded programs of the post-New Deal state, though signature programs like Social Security often had their own dedicated taxes outside of the standard income tax.

Additionally, it is important to bear in mind the difference between the marginal tax rate (and to know what marginal rates mean) and the effective tax rate. Basically, though someone's income may have put them in a bracket where part of their income was taxed at above 90 percent, through various deductions and loopholes, as well as the fact that marginal rates by definition only apply to part of one's income, the effective total rates were much lower than the highest marginal rate was. It is even more important to know that there were **many** more income brackets as far as personal income taxes were concerned. For example, in 2013, there were seven tax brackets; in 1944, there were **twenty four**. Additionally, the vast majority of these tax brackets were well above the median income; incomes in the highest brackets were also very rare.  In 1947 (this is as early as Census info goes), median income was approximately $3000. This would put the median family in the *second* tax bracket, again, out of ***twenty four***, the marginal rate of which was 22 percent. The *vast* majority of Americans were not affected by the tax rates which the elite class, which ""Mad Men"" for the most part portrays, paid.

Now, there was always resistance to this type of policy from a traditional, conservative movement within the Republican Party which opposed such taxes and programs on principle, though would begrudgingly accept them to do things like pay off war debt. This faction of the Republican Party, however, was out of power for most of the mid-20th century. For a good history of the changing nature of American political coalitions, [see these two comments here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nolzz/why_was_there_such_a_huge_shift_in_the_core/cckrkh5). The key was that conservatives also favored decreases in spending. New ideas in economics, however, namely E. Cary Brown's concept of a full employment budget, led to a push to cut taxes from the left. There is very bad trend of polemic history which calls John F. Kennedy conservative, for example, because he cut taxes. Kennedy did indeed pass the largest tax cut in decades, but the motivation was to fix what he called a ""growth deficit"" (IIRC, I can pull out an econ history notebook if I really have to) by stimulating consumer demand while maintaining levels of government spending. I think it was Paul Samuelson who Kennedy sent to Congress to plead that taxes be cut without commensurate cuts in spending. This type of demand side, Keynesian tax cut, however, focused on the lowest brackets and not only kept a large number of brackets, but kept rates within the top ones at high levels. 

If you really want me to talk about the way Reagan type conservatives cut taxes with supply side justifications (though Reagan's rhetoric, if not policy, often echoed demand side reasoning), I will consider it. That period of time is the genesis of modern attitudes about taxes as well as the drastically reduced number of brackets. ",null,3,cdmpy0l,1ren5a,askhistorians,top_week,44

Samuel_Gompers,"First, taxes do not equal communism. One can support all sorts of left-wing ideas and not be a communist; in fact, you can be virulently *anti*-communist. There is no transitive property in public policy, as useful a propaganda tool as that idea may be. There are many examples of groups within the post-war American liberal coalition fracturing over the issue of Communism, such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations and, more specifically, the United Auto Workers. To look more politically, the Democratic Party split three ways in 1948, first over the issue of race, leading to Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats, and second (among many reasons) over the issue of how the United States should deal with communism and the Soviet Union, leading to Henry Wallace and the Progressive Party. 

Second, American public policy changed drastically during World War II. There are several ways to pay for a war, which includes borrowing money, raising taxes, and printing money. During WWII, the U.S. government preferred the first two options, relying on significant hikes in marginal tax rates and borrowing money from the American public through War Bonds. Remember also that there are multiple types of taxes, not just the income tax they talk about in ""Mad Men"" (my favorite show, by the way). Corporate taxes also went up during the war, both as a method of funding and as an attempt to prevent profiteering. Many of these taxes remained in place in some form or another after the war in an attempt to bring down the debt the Government had incurred. To another degree, these taxes were also used to fund the expanded programs of the post-New Deal state, though signature programs like Social Security often had their own dedicated taxes outside of the standard income tax.

Commustar,"**West Africa**

   Everything I have read suggests that Roman trade on this front consisted of exchanging goods at Roman trading posts with berber traders of the Garamantes kingdom, centered in the Fezzan region of south-western Libya. 
   
   There seem to be two schools of thought on the Garamantes. One school of thought, as expressed by Katya Schorle in *Saharan Frontierss: Space and Mobility in Northwest Africa*
 in chapter 3 ""Saharan Trade in Classical Antiquity"" holds that the Garamantes were a centralized kingdom that established well regulated trade routes spanning from the Roman frontier to the Middle Niger region. This theory naturally lends credence to the idea of merchants making the entire trek from the region of Carthage all the way across the sahara to Djenne-Djeno.

On the other hand, Sonja Magnavita presents the view in [this article](http://afriques.revues.org/1145) that trade was ""down-the-line"". That is, that trade items were carried from oasis to oasis, where they changed hands many times. Thus, the merchant that brought the beads found at Kissi in Burkina Faso would be far removed from whomever first brought these beads south across the Roman frontier. 

Whatever is the truth, there is no written evidence that would suggest that a Roman trader would have made it deep into the Sahara. Although, an inventive explanation for that advanced by some scholars is that Roman and Byzantine merchants did not write down such travels, in order to maintain trade secrets.

Barring an extraordinary discovery of a written testimony, we won't be able to say conclusively that a Roman either did or did not travel deep into the Sahara.

**East Africa**

 We are much more fortunate in our sources here. The *Periplus of the Erythrean Sea* is a travelogue that discusses the coasts of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, focusing on the ports, cultures and trade items likely to be encountered. The Periplus most likely dates to the mid-1st century CE, and its author seems to from Roman Egypt. 

The Periplus describes ports beyond the horn of africa, and down the coast of East Africa (which the author locates as ""Azania""). It is somewhat difficult to be certain where the locations referred to are located now. Unfortunately, there has been a decided lack of archaeological research about this time period in Eastern Africa.

However, some circumstantial support for the Periplus is the fact that there have been finds of Roman trade items along the western coast of India, and even some indications of Roman contact along the eastern coast of India. So, it certainly seems feasible that the Romans may have reached the coast of East Africa, perhaps as far as Mogadishu or even further.",null,0,cdojayb,1rek43,askhistorians,top_week,2
tobbinator,"In the Anarchist controlled areas of Catalonia and Aragón, the local government and police forces were dissolved and replaced by locally formed Committees made up of the local working population. Orwell describes that:
&gt; Along with the collectivization of industry and transport
there was an attempt to set up the rough beginnings of a workers'
government by means of local committees, workers' patrols to replace the
old pro-capitalist police forces, workers' militias based on the trade
unions, and so forth.

These worker patrols more or less replaced the local police operations, and were organised by the said revolutionary committees and the large trade unions, especially the CNT (the socialist UGT was more favourable of a central control by the Republican government). After the initial uprising, there were only 5,000 government armed men in Barcelona, compared to over 30,000 CNT militia (Thomas, Hugh. *The Spanish Civil War*). 

The anarchists aimed to reduce crime in their controlled areas by communicating with and collectivising workplaces in order to raise productivity and wages, hopefully deterring them from criminal activities, as well as these worker patrols to keep a watch over the streets. 

Justice was divided between the Republican government and the local committees, depending on the local allegiance. There isn't much detail (that I know of) on the processes for crime and punishment by the local committees, but I suspect the defendant in question's fate was put to a vote in the community. In the revolutionary areas held by the more Republican friendly revolutionaries (UGT, PCE aligned), the state often administered justice. Most criminals were imprisoned, and the International Brigades even operated their own prison camp with over 4,000 prisoners, Camp Lukácz ([source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3653035/A-revelatory-account-of-the-Spanish-civil-war.html)).

MP3PlayerBroke,"While not a historian, I've always been fascinated by that period of history and learned about it here and there over the years.  My knowledge is limited and I can only address a few points.

The novel was based on Record of the Three Kingdoms (the historical text), A New Account of Tales of the World (which a Chinese teacher of mine described as tabloid stories of the time), as well as local stories that were popular among the people of the time.

A lot of the stories in the novel are made up, and some quotes from the original historical records were changed in the novel to skew characters a certain way.  For example, in the novel, Cao Cao says ""I'd rather do wrong to the rest of the world than have the rest of the world do wrong to me"" after he mistakenly killed the family of his father's friend.  The original historical text had fewer characters (as in words) and could have been interpreted in a few different ways, most of which don't necessarily paint him as this sociopath/egomaniac.

The novel had a skew in favor of Liu Bei's Shu Han regime as the legitimate regime of all China, on the grounds that Liu was a descendant of the Han imperial family.  The reason could have been that during the Ming Dynasty (when the novel was written), there was an emphasis on the legitimacy of Han rule over China, having just ended the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty.  The historical records, on the other hand, may have had a little pro-Cao bias because it was written during the Jin Dynasty, which was the successor to Cao's Wei regime.

Wikipedia has a list of [fictitious stories in the novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictitious_stories_in_Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms).

If you know Chinese, I recommend [this series of talks ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_xrYY3jLCw&amp;list=PLBKYZjqmKjb9YMxybfFGqIp0wa9Gdsgh2) that Professor Yi Zhongtian gave on the Three Kingdoms period.  In this series, Professor Yi goes over events and people from that period of history by looking at different sources, which include Record of the Three Kingdoms and its annotations by Pei Songzhi, as well as the novel.  He also gives his own professional opinions on what might have been an accurate explanation for things.

Superplaner,"This question is perhaps better suited for askscience, at least in part. I will however do what I can to throw some light on the topic.

&gt; So if the cold war escalated to total nuclear war, what would happen?

MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) is the most likely case. Assuming one side launches a preemptive stirke, attempting to neutralize as much of the enemy strategic arsenal as possible. There is no real defence against an ICBM or SLBM. The ICBM is simply too fast and flies to high and the SLBM, while ""low and slow"" in so far as missiles go, is fired too close to the point of impact for an effective defense to be used. Even if the first strike was 100 % effective, neutralizing the entire land based strategic arsenal of the enemy, there are still enough mobile launchers (mainly submarines and aircraft in the US case, the USSR also had a significant number of mobile ICBM launchers). This ""second strike"" capability was sufficient to cause damage similar to the first strike, resulting in what is known as mutually assured destruction.

&gt; How many nukes were there to fire?

1982 figures:  
US figures: 2000 individual launchers, 11000 warheads for a total of 4100 megatonnes.

USSR figures: 2400 launchers, 10000 warheads for a total of 8200 megatonnes.

&gt; What cities would likely be targeted? 

Impossible to say for sure but assume that ALL major metropolitan areas (say 1M people or more) would be targeted in a second strike or tertiary retalitory strike. The US and USSR both had over 2000 launchers (methods of delivery capable of nuclear strike) during the cold war, most of these MRVs or MIRVs capable of carrying 10-12 warheads each. A single Trident can carry 12 warheads, each capable of individual targeting. A single missile can deliver 300 times the megatonage of the Hiroshima bomb. An Ohio Class submarine carries up to 24 of these. Meaning that it can deliver the equivalent destruction of 7200 Hiroshima bombs. There are 14 active Ohio class submarines with nuclear strike capabilities which puts the second strike capability at roughly 100000 times that of Hiroshima. Each warhead can be individually targeted meaning that a single Ohio class sub can take out upwards of 288 targets so long as they are relatively closely grouped (or 4000+ targets for the Ohio fleet in all). 

&gt; What would the suspected casualty rate be?

Essentially total. Tough the initial blasts may ""only"" kill a few hundred million (depending on what the target is) the resulting radiation, firestorms, fallout and nuclear winter would wipe out the vast majority of the worlds population of everything. 

The explosions and radiation aren't the real killers of a nuclear war, the fires are. What happens when an entire city is set ablaze is that massive amounts of particles are lifted high into the atmosphere, potentially remaining there for a very long time. This reduces the amount of sunlight that can penetrate the atmosphere, effectively cooling the earths surface.

The Journal of Geophysical Research published an interesting study in 2007 that mentions two scenarios, one with 150 Tg of particles, another with 50 Tgs. The 150 Tg scenario is projected to lower the temperature by up for 8 degrees (compare this to the last ice age which, at its coldest point, was only 5 degrees cooler than today). This would effectively make agriculture impossible in very large parts of the world, especially on a scale that can match the output we're seeing today. The effects would also be long lasting with an estimated temperature drop of -4 degrees even after a decade. The reduced temperature would also slow the hydrological cycle resulting in ~50 % less rainfall globally which further reduces agricultural potential. 

The same article mentions a 1986 study that points out that even the loss of agricultural output for one year would lead to the death of most of the human race. 

Exposure, starvation and dehydration would likely kill far more than the blasts and radition would, regardless of how far from the blasts you are. 

&gt; How would this nuclear bombardment affect the existence of governments in USSR, USA and other involved countries? Would it mean a potential total governmental collapse?

In essence a complete lack of government control. All non-shielded electronic devises would be knocked out as a result of the massive EMP shockwaves. Society would sieze to function almost immediately. Communication would be nearly impossible, especially on a large scale. With most major cities in flames, there would be little left to govern. 

&gt; What plans did these governments have in place if nuclear war did occur, were there plans for additional attacks such as naval or troop deployment?

i_330,"It really depends--the Soviets took it case by case. With Belarus, it's important to remember that while the Soviet Union was one country, it wasn't all Russia. Belarus was sort of constituted from land that the Soviets took from Lithuania and Poland between 1700 and 1917, and was incorporated as a Soviet socialist republic in 1945. This was after the 1944 constitutional reforms that allowed each republic to have its own branch of the Red Army, constitution, etc. Technically speaking, Belarus sort of joined the Soviet Union on its own--obviously there was coercion going on, but it wasn't just taken over and absorbed. In 1991, Belarus wasn't a constituent republic of the USSR anymore because the USSR didn't exist, so it went solo and now it's an independent country.

Kyrgyzstan is a little more puzzling. Everything I can find says that while Kyrgyzstan started out as part of Russia after the revolution, it ""became"" the Kyrgyz SSR in the '30s, but I can't determine why. Some speculation: Stalin might have used it to sort of placate the Kyrgyz and prevent a possible uprising, or he might have decided that trying to Russify them was too much trouble, and he might as well just let them have an autonomous SSR and leave it at that. This second idea is problematic because it raises the question of why Tatarstan (similarly Turkic-speaking, Muslim, and fiercely proud of it) wasn't given an SSR. So basically, I don't know what happened with Kyrgyzstan. If there are any Central Asia experts here, come at me, because now I'm kind of curious.

I really can't speak to Tuva because I know nothing about it, but Chechnya is an interesting case. Chechnya has never been AT ALL happy about being part of Russia. The Russians have been bothering (read: invading) them since the turn of the 19th century. Ever since, whenever the Chechens think Russia is looking weak, there's an uprising to try to shake them off. Unsurprisingly, they declared independence in 1991, which Russia refused to recognize, and that's where you get the First Chechen War. The Russians manage to defeat them after protracted violence in 1996 (they basically had to raze Grozny), but war flared up again in 1999. Would it have been easier to let Chechnya go? Absolutely, but you have to take into consideration the situation in Russia during the Chechen Wars. During the First Chechen War, Yeltsin was in power, and the domestic situation in Russia was going to hell (crime everywhere, the Mafia, crashing economy, etc). Yeltsin didn't want to be perceived as weaker than he already was, so he pursued the Chechen War to demonstrate that he was still in charge. Likewise, Putin used the Second Chechen War to shore up his popularity and demonstrate that he wasn't going to mess around when it came to security/counterterrorism in Russia. Allowing Chechnya to be independent would have saved Russia a lot of trouble and soldiers, but it also would have created a radical Islamic state on Russia's border and made Russia look weak and pathetic at a time when it didn't need any more of that. 

So basically, there's no blanket answer to this question. It's a very complicated calculus of how states came into the USSR, how they exited, what their ethnic composition was, and their prerevolutionary history with Russia. ",null,0,cdndsrx,1reawl,askhistorians,top_week,1

SplendourFalls,"At the time - 1789 - Gibbon's book was controversial for its scathing attack on the Church and how it had, he argued, destructively supplanted traditional Roman culture. The adoption of Christianity is upheld as one of the leading causes of the downfall of Roman civilisation and Gibbon implies Christianity is responsible for the 'societal decline' that followed the collapse of Roman power. 

Nowadays it's controversial because Gibbon, and Chapter XV in particular, is one of the progenitors of the 'Christian Dark Ages' myth which you still see trumpeted around on /r/atheism and other less informed subreddits, all over the internet and throughout many amateur historical discussions and debates about religion - this myth that Christianity somehow suppressed scientific progress and stifled learning, and that the whole post-Roman period was an age of backwardness and general decaying of society overseen by a monolithic and tyrannical Church, which is categorically untrue at  best and downright laughable at worst.

The myth still exists because it's a popular one and it *does* get taught to schoolchildren in black-and-white, two-dimensional history curricula where everything is neatly divided into periods. I'm not necessarily against that, but when you start really getting into history, one of the most important things to do is abandon this idea of the 'Dark Ages' because at a serious historical level the idea just does not hold up.

SplendourFalls,"Well, the costumes and props are generally pretty solid, which is a big step up from Braveheart which featured some bizarre and completely invented wardrobes. 

The 'One tyrant 3000 miles away, or 3000 tyrants one mile away?' quote is also a real one, though it's attributed to a loyalist, clergyman Mather Byles.

Also there's a scene where Mel Gibson uses his kids as child soldiers - this happened, on both sides. 

The nature of warfare is simplified, but fairly enough for a movie - it's emphasised that the Continental Army cannot go, as Gibson puts it, 'muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats' but the militia can have great success by turning to guerrilla tactics. This is the kind of thing you might find in a school textbook. It's a simplification, but it's not a crime. The Continental Army did beat the British Army in set-piece battles, sometimes without French help.

On the other hand:

Slaves who fought for the Continental Army were not freed and were not paid - both happen in the film. Slaves who fought for the British *were* freed in accordance with Dunmore's Proclamation of 1775. The Declaration of Independence does hint at this. One of the grievances against the Crown is that the 1775 emancipation 'excited domestic insurrections' - colonial slave-owners feared a revolt. 

After the war, of course, many freed slaves fell back into slavery unless they had made their way to England. For their part the British certainly didn't help them as much as they could have, and abandoned many freed blacks to their fate in the South when they began to pull out of the colonies. 

The contribution of the French was vastly underplayed but it really was too much to hope for them to be fairly represented in a patriotic Hollywood film. 

The episode where the moustache-twirling, Disney-villain Brits lock innocent civilians in a church and burn it down is also complete fiction and was inspired by the [Oradour-sur-Glane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oradour-sur-Glane) massacre of *1944*.  

That being said, the attitude of the British towards captured Americans is reasonably accurate. Captured Americans were not regarded as prisoners of war as, like the Brits say, they are legally traitors, given how 'international law' worked at the time. Americans weren't regarded as prisoners of war until 1782, one year before the end of the war.

However it's important to note, despite being declared traitors, the official policy was still to negotiate a settlement to the war and, wanting to avoid alienating the Americans, the British avoided hanging the captured, though the conditions prisoners were kept in were inhumane to say the least and several thousand died of neglect or disease. 

I don't really think I need to go into Mel Gibson cutting down innumerable redcoats with a tomahawk. 

The real-life inspiration for Gibson's character (Francis Marion) was less of a principled, moral man and more of a psychopath with a reputation for raping his slaves and killing Indians for fun, but as it's not explicitly stated that Martin is based on Marion we can let that pass. 

The final battle, where Cornwallis is defeated in South Carolina, is fictitious. It's inspired by the Battle of the Cowpens, where similar tactics that you see in the movie were used by the Continental Army and militia to score a victory over the British.

BeondTheGrave,"Two suggestions, narrow your topic and then read as much as you can stand. 

On narrowing your topics, most history books (even textbooks!) pick a specific period, region, or event to discuss. Take, for example, a book I once read concerning the history of the United Kingdom from 1815-1914. And the follow up was a book on the growth of the welfare system, 1945-1989. The problem with bigger books (I think) like the ""History of the Western World"" type books are that they gloss over so much, youll probably not get much out of them. Even more important is making a real connection with what youre reading. If you like Rome, read about that. If youre into political history, read about that. Hell, if youre into music, read about that! 

And that brings up another big point, history is a lot of reading. There are really cool podcasts out there to listen to, /r/lectures, /r/documentaries , but history really is based primarily in reading. You can read a little, like every time you poop, or a lot (like an all consuming passion for books and history). But if you are *interested* in what you are reading, it makes the pages go quickly.

Betsy149,"There was a good deal of anti-slavery feeling at the top of the food chain; for example, Prince Albert's first public position was as the president of (can't remember the exact name) a British anti-slavery organization.  And, it was primarily the (dying) Prince Albert's intervention that settled the Trent Affair down without dragging Britain into the Civil War.

The opinion in the Confederacy was that they would receive British recognition because of cotton; unfortunately for the Confederacy, Indian cotton was beginning to come on-line (the Suez Canal, though, did not open until 1869).  What I did **not** realize until answering this question was that the British were importing significant amounts of wheat from the North.

Moreover, what did the British really have to gain from recognizing Mason &amp; Slidell?  If the Confederacy had been successful in achieving their goals, plenty of time then to recognize them.  Until then, why buy into trouble?

The main reason is because we have a long standing history of poor children attending school in America without a consistent source of funding for their schooling, and their families could not afford uniforms. 

1. Schools are local affairs in America and essentially always have been, and receive relatively little overarching influence from either a state or a federal level. Modern American schools are organized on a “school district” level, which is *loosely* by county but not strictly limited to that boundary. In my hometown we had 2 major school districts, who were pretty different in terms of policy but neither had uniforms, and a private school, which did have uniforms. Decisions about uniforms/no uniforms are made on a local district level. [Funding for schools was historically sort of cobbled together from taxes, subscriptions from parents (sliding scale), and charities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hdsww/in_america_before_the_true_establishment_of/) If uniforms would have been adopted by an early school in 19th century America, funding for these special school clothes would have had to fall on the parents, and many on the low income scale couldn’t have afforded it. Most clothes for poor children in the 19th century would have been cut-down from used adult clothes[1], a poor mother would have had to buy fabric and make a uniform for each child, which was just not viable. Cheap ready-made clothing wasn’t available to most people until the beginning of the 20th century. 

2. So we’ve got the possibility for uniforms with cheap ready-made factory clothes at the start of the 20th century or so, but where are they? Now we must look at America’s widespread rural poverty. I’m talking the classic, walked-uphill-both-ways-in-the-snow, working on the farm in the summer, one room schoolhouse 1920s Depression schooling going on in this rural poverty. This might be a bit of a mind-bender, but current school children (maybe 5-10 year olds) in many parts of America are only about 3 generations away from a one-room schoolhouse. (So the great-grandchildren of people who went to school in a one-room schoolhouse.) Either my grandparents and their generation (people now in their 80s-90s) would have gone to school in their normal clothes or they wouldn’t have gone at all. Families in my area in the Midwest (which is relatively rural) simply could not have afforded school uniforms prior to maybe the 1950s, and old habits (and cultural memories of poor times) die hard. 

3. The first public school district to adopt uniforms in the US was [The Long Beach Unified School District in 1994.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach_Unified_School_District#School_uniforms_and_single_gender_classes) It’s almost 2014 so I’ll squeak it in with the 20-year-rule, but it very well demonstrates that public school uniforms (requiring a relatively high amount of disposable income for the majority of school families PLUS a good ready-made market) have only been a viable option pretty recently in American history.

gingerkid1234,"Because they weren't starting from scratch.  It's a very common misconception that Israel was willed into existence by the Western powers and UN, but that's the final chapter of how Israel came to exist.  That's what I suspect you're talking about when you say that it ""popped into existence and immediately had independence declared upon it"" (though I think you have a typo in there, which I corrected based on what I think you meant).  Independence had been hoped for for decades, and the Jewish community declared it.  Granted, it was with the international go-ahead (kind-of), but it wasn't externally controlled.

As a consequence, the Jewish community had various paramilitaries, which had previously been involved in circumventing British restrictions on immigration, fighting the British, and fighting the Arabs.  Jewish-Arab violence had been ungoing since the 1920s  The largest and most mainstream of these, the Haganah, essentially became the IDF, with the other, more radical ones eventually folded in (though not without problems).  This meant that there was a significant proportion of local Jews who already had a command infrastructure and weapons.

An additional smaller point is that the war of independence didn't begin overnight.  Violence had been escalating for the decade-ish prior.  Once the UN voted to partition, the British essentially stopped being one of the sides in the conflict, and the Jewish-Arab violence intensified.  While the nearby Arab countries didn't invade until independence, the war was very much under way.  It wasn't just various guerilla attacks, either, though neither side was fighting with a recognized (or even declared) state.  See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine).

On the political end, things were controlled by the Jewish National Council (together with the Jewish Agency), which was sort of a representative body for the Jewish community in Palestine during the British Mandatory period.  It functioned as sort of a proto-government, and became the provisional government of Israel until elections were held post-war.  There were other national institutions around, such as the Histadrut, the Jewish labor union in Palestine.

I'm not sure if you have heard, but the New Museum of Contemporary Art is in the process of opening an incubator aimed at young creative professionals next door to its building in New York City.  I am curious to hear your thoughts about a museum collecting entrepreneurs. Do you think this is within the purview of the museum as an institutional type?

How do you feel about the increasing overlap of the spheres of private collection and cultural institution? Do private museums like the Pinault Foundation's Punta Della Dogana, the Broad's upcoming building in LA, or the Deste Foundation expand public encounters with contemporary art/artists, or is it enforcing a ""Top 40"" phenomenon, reducing the diversity that comes with a specific institutional mission?

Finally, do you have to take the monorail every damn day? I would imagine you have an already laborious commute before you get to the parking garage, that and then having to crawl up the hill for 20 minutes would drive me crazy.

gnomemania,"Good afternoon Dr. Potts,

I am interested in the idea of restoring and displaying art that is uncovered via noninvasive x-ray imaging. For example, earlier this year, the Getty had a mock-up of Rembrandt’s *Old Man in Military Costume* transported and scanned to see if they could obtain a better image of an underlying portrait. If the hidden painting was such that it could be recreated or restored somehow, do you feel that preliminary work has a place in the museum, too, or only the finished product? And what causes a museum to look for hidden works behind an established painting, other than noticing the under layers during restoration? I think the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam did their entire collection and found a good percentage contained underlying works – would the Getty ever do the same (if it hasn't already)?

2. I work for a small company that sells stone supplies and the Getty Trust is one of our customers. Does the Getty intentionally purchase from small businesses in the area as opposed to big box stores? It's a noble effort if so.

There was a show of many of them up at Pepperdine earlier this year that was stunning and it drove home for me what a gap there is in the collection and display up at the Getty.

I'm not sure if you have heard, but the New Museum of Contemporary Art is in the process of opening an incubator aimed at young creative professionals next door to its building in New York City.  I am curious to hear your thoughts about a museum collecting entrepreneurs. Do you think this is within the purview of the museum as an institutional type?

How do you feel about the increasing overlap of the spheres of private collection and cultural institution? Do private museums like the Pinault Foundation's Punta Della Dogana, the Broad's upcoming building in LA, or the Deste Foundation expand public encounters with contemporary art/artists, or is it enforcing a ""Top 40"" phenomenon, reducing the diversity that comes with a specific institutional mission?

Finally, do you have to take the monorail every damn day? I would imagine you have an already laborious commute before you get to the parking garage, that and then having to crawl up the hill for 20 minutes would drive me crazy.

gnomemania,"Good afternoon Dr. Potts,

I am interested in the idea of restoring and displaying art that is uncovered via noninvasive x-ray imaging. For example, earlier this year, the Getty had a mock-up of Rembrandt’s *Old Man in Military Costume* transported and scanned to see if they could obtain a better image of an underlying portrait. If the hidden painting was such that it could be recreated or restored somehow, do you feel that preliminary work has a place in the museum, too, or only the finished product? And what causes a museum to look for hidden works behind an established painting, other than noticing the under layers during restoration? I think the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam did their entire collection and found a good percentage contained underlying works – would the Getty ever do the same (if it hasn't already)?

2. I work for a small company that sells stone supplies and the Getty Trust is one of our customers. Does the Getty intentionally purchase from small businesses in the area as opposed to big box stores? It's a noble effort if so.

The swastika is an equilateral cross with its arms bent at right angles, in either right-facing (卐) form or its mirrored left-facing (卍) form. Before Hitler, it was used in about 1870 by the Austrian Pan-German followers of Schoenerer, an Austrian anti-Semitic politician. Its Nazi use was linked to the belief in the Aryan cultural descent of the German people.

Vincenti,"In 1913, Hitler left Vienna (where he had often been homeless and destitute) for Germany, at the age of 24. He had no job or permanent residence. He had failed to be accepted into art school after attempting the tests, and though he knew he had a good chance of being accepted to architecture school, he never applied. 

While he had always had a personal longing for Germany, it's likely he left Austria for Germany at the time he did to avoid compulsory military service. Not as an act of cowardice, but because he found it repulsive to have a military where Slavs, Jews, and other minority races of the Austro-Hungarian empire could serve. Since 1910, at age 21, Hitler had been subject to compulsory military service in Austria, but authorities had been unable to locate him while he lived in Vienna; unsurprising since he had no permanent residence or employment. He was later found by authorities in Munich and was examined in Salzburg in 1914 and found unfit for service due to poor health.

On August 3, 1914 he petitioned King Ludwig III of Bavaria to be able to volunteer in a Bavarian regiment, and his request was granted. By all accounts he served bravely and proficiently, receiving both the Iron Cross First and Second Class, and was wounded twice. He was in hospital recovering from a gas attack when the news came of the Kaiser's abdication and thus the defeat of Germany in WWI. Interestingly, though he served in the war and lived in Germany for some years, he did not become a German citizen until he had risen greatly in German politics, in order to be eligible for the Chancellorship.

After a retroactive change to the visa system in Cuba, they were turned away, and subsequently were unable to gain entry to the US.  Eventually some of the passengers were allowed into the UK, but most could only gain entry into the Netherlands, France, or Belgium, which were of course under Nazi occupation anyway.

The British also could've removed or relaxed the Jewish immigration quota in Palestine, but they were unwilling to risk more unrest from Arabs (a point which caused much resentment towards the British among Jews during the period), since they were the ones taking the fall for the Arabs' unrest in the form of the Arab Revolt of the late 30s and other unrest.  This factored into the political discussions in Britain at the time, but ultimately didn't matter.

The perhaps-more-important example is the Evian conference, where a whole bunch of countries met to try and figure out where to send Jewish refugees.  They all seemed to agree that the Jews should be helped in leaving, but no one would actually take them, with the exception of the Dominican Republic.  But by the time that could be arranged, the war had begun.

For during the war, the Jews were trapped behind German lines--there wasn't a whole lot that could be done.  The only thing that could've been was bombing the camps, which the Allies decided wasn't in the best interest of ending the war.  Additionally, the death camps, whose bombing would've saved the largest number of people, were in Poland, relatively out of range of the US and British bombing runs I think.

&gt;Also, lets say there were Germans who were against the genocide, but did nothing about it. Why would they not help?

Personal risk, I assume.  There actually was a successful protest by a bunch of German women at the deportation of their Jewish husbands--the men were spared.  But that doesn't mean people would've felt safe protesting, especially if it wasn't their family.

Additionally, the Nazis took pains to attempt to have the genocide occur behind closed doors, so-to-speak.  Even if it was pretty obvious to Germans what was occurring (though how obvious is subject to some debate), it wasn't something most Germans would've had to come face-to-face with regularly.",null,1,cdmc7xl,1rdtld,askhistorians,top_week,4

tinyshadow,"Herbert Hoover first and foremost believed in volunteerism and private charity. He did not encourage federal intervention whatsoever. He expected that the Great Depression (which wasn't considered that during Hoover's years just yet) would be solved if everyone worked together. The National Historic Site of his childhood home in Iowa states his belief quite clearly: 

*Committed to individualism and opposed to direct Federal intervention, he hoped at first that local governments and traditional charitable organizations could solve the problems that arose.  When the massive unemployment and poverty of the 1930s overwhelmed the political system, public opinion soon transformed this internationally famous humanitarian into “the man with ice water in his veins.”* [Source](http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/herbert_hoover_nhs.html).

Hoover really meant ""rely on private charity."" Here's a fine example of that belief: when a 10-year-old Ohio girl wrote Hoover saying she and her friends were collecting blankets, clothing, and food and wanted to send them to Washington D.C. for him to distribute to the needy, he wrote her back:

*My dear Barbara, 
I have your very sweet letter of November 10th. It is a beautiful undertaking. I would suggest, however, that instead of sending the contributions which you collect to me, that you should distribute them to those in need in your own locality. 
Yours faithfully, 
Herbert Hoover.* [Source](http://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1373).

I'm not sure if you want to call this a ""policy,"" but it was his firm belief which he constantly implemented between 1929-1933.

Also, to note - Truman's a little biased. In 1946, Truman asked the former president to tour ""around the world compiling estimates of the effects of famine and starvation.""

LordSariel,"I cannot comment on the exact number of Union vs Confederate memorials in the country, but I've recently been scholastically exploring the concept of ""History of Memory."" It's especially relevant in French History, but I actually got started on the subject based on the ""Lost Cause Narrative"" that arose following the American Civil War, and relates to your topic about how the war is remembered in terms of physical statues or monuments.

It has been noted by Historians like Caroline Janney that the Civil War is the only war in which the losers have written the History instead of the Winners. The so-called Lost Cause Narrative sought to attach a justification to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people for a cause that ultimately proved unattainable. Janney points especially to General Order No. 9, issued by Confederate General Robert E. Lee, which was read to his troops the day after Appomattox.  The speech hails them for being ""brave survivors of so many hard fought battles"" and ultimately concludes that his army was ""compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources"" fielded by the North. 

Basically the origin of the claim that Southerners clung to, roughly summarized as ""we had fought valiantly, and we tried, but we were overrun."" One that deliberately ignored many of the much more structural problems of the Confederacy, and their racialized goals. Her book, which is incredibly fascinating and titled ""Remembering The Civil War"" goes on to unpack the development of the Lost-Cause Narrative, and highlights how the Civil War came to be remembered as the War of Northern Aggression by the Southerners. A brief summary of her argument is that the Northern policies during reconstruction actually framed and favored the ultimate renegotiation of the War's legacy.

Caroline Janney, *Remembering The Civil War*. 
Also read Drew Gilpin Faust's *This Republic of Suffering* to better comprehend the sheer amount of death and destruction that was wrought by the conflict, and why both sides *needed* to secure a justification.

tinyshadow,"This is a very interesting question. As a starting point, it should be noted that many Northern battlefields and Northern towns did not allow any decorations or memorials for the Confederate cause or Confederate dead. For example, at Gettysburg, the first Confederate monument was erected in 1884 to the 2nd Maryland Infantry, CSA and ""met a great deal of resistance from the battlefield commission authorities."" After this monument, the next seems to have been in 1904, and after that, Confederate veterans stop doing regimental monuments and started doing state monuments at Gettysburg. [Source](http://www.gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/Confederate/2MD.php). 

Likewise, only until 1900 after the Spanish-American War did Arlington National Cemetery make a section for Confederate war dead. [Source](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/visitorinformation/MonumentMemorials/Confederate.aspx).

But what is certainly true about the South is that those who carried its legacy were tenacious and absolutely reveled in marking and memorializing the Lost Cause. By 1900, three organizations (the Ladies Memorial Association, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the United Confederate Veterans) had undertaken a movement across the South to honor Confederate veterans. They dotted the entire South with markers and monuments. These range in size and material; they can be as big as state buildings or as small as a plaque; they can be marble, fieldstone, bronze, iron, etc. As one encyclopedia notes, ""The most common style is a shaft supported by a pedestal and topped by the figure of a Confederate soldier, but other styles include obelisks, columns, boulders, arches, tablets, cenotaphs, fountains, benches, and even one totem pole."" [Source](http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/confederate-monuments).

Many monuments to the Confederacy were built immediately after the war in the 1860s and 1870s. They did not stop building then, however, and continued into the 20th and now 21st century.

To use one state as an example, let's take Georgia and show the break-down for Confederate monument-building:

* 1865-1900: ~25 monuments  
* 1900-1920: ~60+ monuments 
* 1920-1980: ~25+ monuments
* 1980-2005: ~30 more monuments 

Now, these don't include smaller works, such as plaques or simple memorials. Instead, these are large monuments. [Source](http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/confederate-monuments).

At Gettysburg, many of the Confederate monuments were built around the reunion years (think anything ending in 1-5) and the big centennial in 1961-1965. This suggests that while the North has perhaps eased off its Civil War memory, the South continued to push ahead and try to get more monuments and memorials for the Confederate dead.

These are the in-chronological-order dedication dates for the Confederate monuments at Gettysburg:

1. Virginia = 1917 
2. North Carolina = 1929 
3. Alabama = 1933 
4. Georgia = 1961
5. South Carolina = 1963
6. Florida = 1963 
7. Texas = 1964 
8. Arkansas = 1966 
9. Louisiana = 1971
10. Tennessee = 1972
11. Mississippi = 1973
12. Maryland = 1994

In contrast, the seemingly most common time period for Union monuments built at Gettysburg was around 1884-1890. West Virginia's seem a little late in 1898. All in all, this proves the point: the North finished most of its memorial making early on, but the South continued for a long, long, *long* time and, in some places, even continues today.",null,4,cdmdi0v,1rdjfq,askhistorians,top_week,36
Shartastic,"Finally, something I can answer! I don't have the concrete numbers, but I can state with almost positive certainty that yes, this is true.

The interesting thing is that most of the Confederate monuments didn't go up until the 1890s-1920s. The most prominent groups erecting these monuments were women's organizations, like local Ladies Auxiliary Clubs and the most common group, after their organization in 1894, the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

The early monuments which went up immediately after the war were small plaques and such that were put in cemeteries. Especially in areas under heavy rule in Reconstruction, some of these monuments tried to divorce the soldier from the war, praising him for his courage, without mentioning the cause. But for the most part, there were few of these early monuments as the aid organizations for the veterans (again, mostly organized by women) had the dilemma of ""bread or stone"" - that is, they could either spend their money to put up monuments for the dead, or they could feed the living veterans. Most opted to spend more on the living veterans, so this early period (1865-1880) sees only small muted monuments, mostly in cemeteries.

After the failure of Reconstruction (which is another topic in itself, but for the point of this, I'll generalize with just that), there was another push for national unification (in spirit). Most of white America was able to reform a common bond while trying to put the issues of the past behind them, but of course this new unity just further cemented the racial hierarchy present in the nation. So it was during this nadir of race relations (1890-1920), when most of the monuments were erected praising the Confederate dead. There was a spirit of nostalgia that swept the country and veterans from both sides would often meet to reminisce over their shared experiences. There was a new mythology of the Confederate cause that began to emerge during this time, which was now being permanently erected on the landscape in granite. The monuments of this period were often grander, had plaques not only honoring the Confederate soldier, but offering some explanation of why he fought, generally using the kind of vague terminology that means something different to whoever is reading the plaque. The key difference now though, is that these monuments were also now being placed in public spaces. In front of city halls, in downtown parks, in front of court houses, state capitols, etc. The memory of the war is no longer something that you would go to a cemetery to reflect on in *private* tranquility. Now it's a matter of *public* celebration. Not only that, but it's meant to instruct the community as to how they should feel about and honor the Confederate dead/cause. This last point is the most salient, especially in areas with large black populations. Not only were they already being oppressed through Jim Crow laws and lynchings, but now they had to regularly view monuments to the soldiers who fought for the country that wanted to keep them in chains. The Confederate memorialization impulse mostly died off after World War I. I don't quite remember why right now, but I can recommend a few books that cover these topics succinctly.

To end though, I'll cite some of my favorite UDC monuments. First, as I mentioned with the monuments not only honoring a white supremacist past (I use this loaded term loosely to mean a past in which whites were dominant over blacks), the monuments also served as active tools for white supremacy as well. The UDC put up many water fountains in Southern city parks, each with its plaque honoring the Confederate dead, as well as them always being placed in pairs: one labelled ""Colored.""

My favorite is the one in Union City, TN, only because most monuments use vague terms honoring the ""brave sacrifice of the soldier in the most noble cause"" or ""protecting the values that he believed in"" (never actually defining the cause or values, but they were well-known in the mind of the Southern reader). [The one for Obion County](http://i.imgur.com/dEEoUiO.jpg?1) on the other hand is quite explicit in exactly what it means. It honors the soldier who was ""killed in battle, who was starved in federal prison, and who has preserved Anglo-Saxon civilization in the South."" (er. 1909)

I've done extensive research on the topic of Confederate monuments and the memory of war, so I'd be happy to answer anything else if I can. Or provide more monument pictures since I've got thousands that I took during the course of my research. Or just provide books if you'd like to read about it yourself.

Now, these don't include smaller works, such as plaques or simple memorials. Instead, these are large monuments. [Source](http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/confederate-monuments).

At Gettysburg, many of the Confederate monuments were built around the reunion years (think anything ending in 1-5) and the big centennial in 1961-1965. This suggests that while the North has perhaps eased off its Civil War memory, the South continued to push ahead and try to get more monuments and memorials for the Confederate dead.

These are the in-chronological-order dedication dates for the Confederate monuments at Gettysburg:

1. Virginia = 1917 
2. North Carolina = 1929 
3. Alabama = 1933 
4. Georgia = 1961
5. South Carolina = 1963
6. Florida = 1963 
7. Texas = 1964 
8. Arkansas = 1966 
9. Louisiana = 1971
10. Tennessee = 1972
11. Mississippi = 1973
12. Maryland = 1994

In contrast, the seemingly most common time period for Union monuments built at Gettysburg was around 1884-1890. West Virginia's seem a little late in 1898. All in all, this proves the point: the North finished most of its memorial making early on, but the South continued for a long, long, *long* time and, in some places, even continues today.",null,4,cdmdi0v,1rdjfq,askhistorians,top_week,36
Shartastic,"Finally, something I can answer! I don't have the concrete numbers, but I can state with almost positive certainty that yes, this is true.

The interesting thing is that most of the Confederate monuments didn't go up until the 1890s-1920s. The most prominent groups erecting these monuments were women's organizations, like local Ladies Auxiliary Clubs and the most common group, after their organization in 1894, the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

The early monuments which went up immediately after the war were small plaques and such that were put in cemeteries. Especially in areas under heavy rule in Reconstruction, some of these monuments tried to divorce the soldier from the war, praising him for his courage, without mentioning the cause. But for the most part, there were few of these early monuments as the aid organizations for the veterans (again, mostly organized by women) had the dilemma of ""bread or stone"" - that is, they could either spend their money to put up monuments for the dead, or they could feed the living veterans. Most opted to spend more on the living veterans, so this early period (1865-1880) sees only small muted monuments, mostly in cemeteries.

After the failure of Reconstruction (which is another topic in itself, but for the point of this, I'll generalize with just that), there was another push for national unification (in spirit). Most of white America was able to reform a common bond while trying to put the issues of the past behind them, but of course this new unity just further cemented the racial hierarchy present in the nation. So it was during this nadir of race relations (1890-1920), when most of the monuments were erected praising the Confederate dead. There was a spirit of nostalgia that swept the country and veterans from both sides would often meet to reminisce over their shared experiences. There was a new mythology of the Confederate cause that began to emerge during this time, which was now being permanently erected on the landscape in granite. The monuments of this period were often grander, had plaques not only honoring the Confederate soldier, but offering some explanation of why he fought, generally using the kind of vague terminology that means something different to whoever is reading the plaque. The key difference now though, is that these monuments were also now being placed in public spaces. In front of city halls, in downtown parks, in front of court houses, state capitols, etc. The memory of the war is no longer something that you would go to a cemetery to reflect on in *private* tranquility. Now it's a matter of *public* celebration. Not only that, but it's meant to instruct the community as to how they should feel about and honor the Confederate dead/cause. This last point is the most salient, especially in areas with large black populations. Not only were they already being oppressed through Jim Crow laws and lynchings, but now they had to regularly view monuments to the soldiers who fought for the country that wanted to keep them in chains. The Confederate memorialization impulse mostly died off after World War I. I don't quite remember why right now, but I can recommend a few books that cover these topics succinctly.

To end though, I'll cite some of my favorite UDC monuments. First, as I mentioned with the monuments not only honoring a white supremacist past (I use this loaded term loosely to mean a past in which whites were dominant over blacks), the monuments also served as active tools for white supremacy as well. The UDC put up many water fountains in Southern city parks, each with its plaque honoring the Confederate dead, as well as them always being placed in pairs: one labelled ""Colored.""

My favorite is the one in Union City, TN, only because most monuments use vague terms honoring the ""brave sacrifice of the soldier in the most noble cause"" or ""protecting the values that he believed in"" (never actually defining the cause or values, but they were well-known in the mind of the Southern reader). [The one for Obion County](http://i.imgur.com/dEEoUiO.jpg?1) on the other hand is quite explicit in exactly what it means. It honors the soldier who was ""killed in battle, who was starved in federal prison, and who has preserved Anglo-Saxon civilization in the South."" (er. 1909)

I've done extensive research on the topic of Confederate monuments and the memory of war, so I'd be happy to answer anything else if I can. Or provide more monument pictures since I've got thousands that I took during the course of my research. Or just provide books if you'd like to read about it yourself.

KaiserKvast,"I don't often watch or even find all that many movies set in the 18th century as there doesn't seem to be that big of a quantity of them. However, a few movies come to mind if you ignore historical accuracies and focuses on how accurately the movie portrays food, fashion and courtesies. The movie ""Maria Antoinette"" released in 2006 springs to mind (takes place in the very end of the 18th century). It explores food, fashion and Versailles courtesy rather good and gives a pretty good idea about how life for french royalty could have been in certain situations. On top of that it's an okay movie. Do keep in mind that it takes place late 18th century and might not be a top portrayal of how people dressed for most of the 18th century. 


You've already seen Barry Lyndon otherwise I would have recommended that movie. There's always ""The Last of the Mohicans"" though, it's based on the novel by the same name and takes place during the Seven years war. It's a good movie in itself and actually has really well-made costumes and props. Really enjoyable movie which should without a doubt provide some good headers on clothing and fashion at the time.

(You could argue that the transformation was preordained from the time Sulla crossed the Rubicon and Marius reorganized the army to have a structure favoring loyalty to generals more than loyalty to the state, or you could argue that there was nothing inevitable about it even after Caesar's death, until Octavian actually started using the title of princeps, but many people see Caesar as having a pretty big role.)

Bismarck managed to convince Wilhelm I not to press on, to keep France and Russia from intervening. None the less, Prussia actually made huge territorial gains, albeit in the north of Germany.

LIPCSB,"The LK was significantly smaller, as you note.  It had to be--the Soviet N-1 booster was not as powerful as the Saturn V due to its use of kerosene in the upper stages rather than hydrogen.  It did have a companion module (a modified Soyuz, cousins of which are still in service today), but to save weight, there was no docking tunnel on the LK--the cosmonaut was expected to climb out of the Soyuz and use handholds to climb over to the LK before landing.  These drawings depict the overall mission profile rather well.  http://spacemodels.nuxit.net/n1/n1_miss.htm

As for why the Soviets could send robots but not people, it came down to launch capacity.  Their lander got as far as tests in Earth Orbit, and the capsule worked out after a while.  Their moon launcher, though, was unsuccessful, for a number of reasons--no testing of stages on a test stand before launch, inefficient resource allocation (they had a whole separate lunar program going unrelated to the N-1 system) due to office politics, a comparatively late start (Saturn development actually goes back to the 1950s--the hardware was repurposed to Moon flights from its original space-station-centric goal).  Without that Moon launcher (or experience in docking refueling upper stages in orbit), they couldn't send a man to land on the Moon.

Maklodes,"Monarchy as a system of government predated Christianity in Europe, and existed in places where Christianity (and monotheism in general) never had much influence. Macedon and the diadochi successor states were all monarchic well before Christianity. Rome basically became a monarchy thirty years before Jesus was born, and was a monarchy for about 400 years before it became Christian. Some of the Germanic kingdoms that arose in the west after the collapse of Roman authority created their kingdoms before they were Christianized (such as the Anglo-Saxons and the Franks). (The Goths, though, were Christian (albeit a somewhat heretical variety (Arian) before they conquered significant territory) Outside of Europe, of course, kingdoms like Japan and Thailand have had monarchic governments without Christianity or any other monotheistic theology.

The interaction between religion and politics has been very complex in Europe.

Right now I'm imagining that the battle has two major decision points. 

Point 1: In the first one you have to demonstrate some type of basic tactical combat knowledge. Your opponent does something, and the player gets a few options of how to respond to his move.

* Do something tactically insightful and continue fighting.

* Do something that seems like a good idea, but isn't, because of a detail the player may have missed.

* Make a rookie mistake.

Point 2: Then in the second decision point, I want to illustrate the difference between fighting in the yard and fighting on the battlefield. You see some kind of opening and get some options.

* Do something tactically sound that would only work in the yard, winning the practice battle.

* Do something else tactically sound that would only work in the yard, winning the practice battle.

* Fight dirty, winning the practice battle.

* Make a rookie mistake, losing.

For the practice battle, everything is nonlethal, and the protagonist and player are both able to learn from their mistakes. In the real battle, when the player gets to the second point, using a ""yard tactic"" will get her non-lethally injured and up the stakes, and she'll have to fight dirty in order to survive (opening up a third decision point, but not killing her outright.).

My big problem is that I can't come up with clever things for her and opponent to do that aren't either too technical or hollywood-style-fakery.

I have an alternate idea that would involve her getting into her opponents' heads more, and using their psychology against them.

xi_yangyang,"At the time, China had a very large population of lower class people, and Communist ideas were very appealing. Many people were drawn to the idea that the bourgeois were evil because they were on a higher class. Thus, the idea of removing such evils grew into the huge movement it became because of the idea of total social equality and its appeal to the lower class. Doctors, teachers, scholars, etc. were persecuted because of their higher education and class. Eventually, religion, art, etc. was attacked not only because they were seen as superstition and an instrument of the ruling class, but also because it was reminiscent of the “old society.” In addition, the removal of any sources of culture and ideas other than the Communist Party helped solidify their hold on China. Children were taught from an early age that Communism was the greatest, and this brainwashing created the idea that anything from the old society was bad, and they were encouraged to work hard for this new utopia. Non-Communist people and ideas were foreign and threats to Chinese society, so they were destroyed. 

So, to answer your question, many people were taught that Communism was the only way as well as a sign of hope for the lower-class.

tidyupinhere,"To understand the Cultural Revolution, you have to understand a bit about Mao, the history of communism in China, and the age-old social traditions that run deep in the Chinese psyche.

The people at the core of the Cultural Revolution were the youth. In the years prior, Mao had reorganized peasant society from traditional communities to state-run communes. Families were uprooted, sometimes split apart. Children were taken from their parents' care and put into state care, where they were imbued with a vast amount of propaganda condemning communism and anti-""bourgeois"" (capitalist) behaviour, and a vast amount revering Mao.

Mao orchestrated the Cultural Revolution, but did not control it, especially not in the later phases. It began when he had a conflict with his political rivals. He leveraged his popularity against them by publishing [more propaganda](http://triplehelixblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/china-propaganda.jpg), painting them as bourgeois men.

With the youth on his side, he changed the target to anyone doing ""bourgeois"" things. The meaning of this word was vague and, once the Revolution was in full swing, was widely interpreted. 

Mao played to the youths' desires by encouraging them to realize their autonomous power. China has a long history of deference to one's elders. Mao told the youth they no longer had to do this: they could choose their own lovers, choose their own career, make what they wanted out of life. Frustrated and resentful youths stabbed their parents in the back.

It got out of Mao's control, but he let it go for a while until it was clear his political rivals were adequately muzzled (he ousted a few too, iirc). Then he asked the youth to moderate their behaviour, and had them shipped off to the countryside to reacquaint themselves with hard labour. It took a while, but he effectively squelched the movement and leveraged himself into more power.

Ann Landers got her start first after taking over the advice column 'Ask Ann Landers' in the Chicago Sun Times.  The old author, Ruth Crowley, had passed away and the paper was looking for a replacement and Lederer got the job.

Pauline Philips started writing her advice column, 'Dear Abby' in the San Francisco Chronicle very shortly after her sister.  This actually started quite a feud between the twins, because Philips never told Lederer that she was going to start her own column, and Lederer took it as a direct attack that her sister would want to be her competition and not talk to her about it beforehand.  They eventually buried the hatchet years later, however.

Advice columns in general have been around since the late 1600s.  They were originally general advice on subjects such as etiquette or hostessing.  Also, remember that back then and up until very recently, newspapers were much more popular.  Without the internet, smartphones, etc, newspapers were the primary means of spreading news.

As far as their popularity goes, they were both witty and honest.  They both became very popular.  I'm not sure if there was really much competition except for each other.  Almost every paper from that time had either Ann Landers or Dear Abby syndicated in it.  The closest competition I can think of is maybe Emily Post.

XChiliPepperX,"Well, ironically enough, Eppie Lederer(Ann Landers) and Pauline Phillips(Abigail van Buren) were identical twin sisters.  Ann Landers got her start first after taking over the advice column 'Ask Ann Landers' in the Chicago Sun Times.  The old author, Ruth Crowley, had passed away and the paper was looking for a replacement and Lederer got the job.

Pauline Philips started writing her advice column, 'Dear Abby' in the San Francisco Chronicle very shortly after her sister.  This actually started quite a feud between the twins, because Philips never told Lederer that she was going to start her own column, and Lederer took it as a direct attack that her sister would want to be her competition and not talk to her about it beforehand.  They eventually buried the hatchet years later, however.

Advice columns in general have been around since the late 1600s.  They were originally general advice on subjects such as etiquette or hostessing.  Also, remember that back then and up until very recently, newspapers were much more popular.  Without the internet, smartphones, etc, newspapers were the primary means of spreading news.

As far as their popularity goes, they were both witty and honest.  They both became very popular.  I'm not sure if there was really much competition except for each other.  Almost every paper from that time had either Ann Landers or Dear Abby syndicated in it.  The closest competition I can think of is maybe Emily Post.  She was well respected for her advice on etiquette during that time, and did briefly have a column, but she was more of a general writer than a columnist.  Maybe someone else here has more insight on that part of your question.",null,3,cdm7o31,1rd2bi,askhistorians,top_week,15

xi_yangyang,"During the Middle Ages, Iceland became part of Norway after the struggles of the Sturlung Era. It became one of the poorest countries in Europe after the Black Plague struck twice. In addition, the poor farming climate and volcanic eruptions made survival very difficult when Iceland depended on farming. Denmark became Iceland’s main controller in the 1600s after the Norwegian royal line ended. Iceland’s economy fell drastically because Denmark did not require its wool and fish, and it was not protected by Denmark. During the Turkish Abductions, Iceland was raided by the Barbary Pirates and many Icelandics were sold into slavery. Iceland was also converted to Lutheranism after Denmark converted. In the 16- and 1700s, Denmark imposed the Danish-Icelandic Trade Monopoly, a mercantilist policy which forbade it from trading with any country other than Denmark. The Mist Hardships, which struck in the 1780s, was caused by a volcanic eruption and resulted in a famine, which killed most of the livestock and nearly 20% of the population.",null,1,cdm59nm,1rd0rl,askhistorians,top_week,4

khosikulu,"By ""through"" I assume you mean ""up to the period of,"" because proto-Bantu speakers worked iron by around 1000 BCE and took that toolkit with them into the Great Lakes region and beyond.

The old model was diffusionist, basically suggesting that all ironworking technology came in some form from one origin outside of Africa (usually Anatolia).  Archaeological, linguistic, and cultural evidence now promotes a model of independent events within Africa; in the mountains of Aïr, for example, we have iron slag that dates back at least to 1000BCE (elsewhere in the Great Lakes there are some disputed dates before that, and [Zangato &amp; Holl](http://www.african-archaeology.de/index.php?page_id=154&amp;journal_id=24&amp;pdf_id=172) actually are trying to push it back past 2000BCE--read also the critical responses in that issue if you can), many centuries before iron's regular appearance in the Nile Valley and across North Africa.  

Although some do still cling to the old model of diffusion, the question now really involves where iron technology emerged south of the Sahara and when, because there are a number of sites from Lake Chad to Lake Tanganyika with similar antiquity.  Jan Vansina wrote an article in 2006 (in *History in Africa*) mobilizing linguistic evidence to suggest that proto-Bantu-speakers took the technology from other West African groups first, but he remains agnostic about whether to join the chorus against the old Asia diffusion model; [see this article if you can access it](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4895863889).  The language around ironworking, and the social position of ironworking, are traceable, and point to African origins--although whether it's one origin south of the Sahara or several that sort of ""merged"" over time, we still don't know.  We also, as per Chris Ehret (2003), still don't have a clear picture of how it spread across those societies, but it spread quickly with all other forms of knowledge carried or transmitted by Bantu-speakers.  

So in short, historical and archaeological study still haven't settled the question permanently.  Some linguistic analysis suggests proto-Bantu acquisition of ironworking culture, but not the origin of the transmitted knowledge; a few archaeologists are pushing for older and older dates for early ironworking in north central Africa.  The original link, if there is any, hasn't actually been found.  Most Africanists seem to accept the strong possibility of independent invention south of the Sahara, but the where and the when (and ""by whom?"") are far from conclusively settled.",null,1,cdm1y14,1rcyss,askhistorians,top_week,4
piper06w,"I've studied this a bit, but can only really give you a proper answer to the  second part of the question regarding property, as well as a little bit of an overview of the first bit, and some literature recommendations. I do know that the U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems predated the wall, and actually West German U-bahn trains would pass through Frederichstrasse, though not stop, so there wasn't too much of an issue that I can recall in joining the mass trasit systems. As for times and dates, I unfortunately do not know. 

As for property in East Berlin, it was actually quite the opposite. Property values in East Berlin plummeted, largely due to the mass exodus of the Ossies. A lot of this property was quickly snatched up by squatters, and a lot of redevelopment of land, especially land around the buffer zone and in areas either vacant or planned to be developed by the GDR. As for the ideology change, there wasn't exactly a mass shift to the left in German politics. In fact, the Easterners largely supported Helmut Kohl, and supported him for 8 more years until his defeat in 1998.That's not to say that there isn't still remnants of Ostalgie manifesting itself politically, if you look at the recent elections, the support for the communist party manifested itself largely around old GDR borders. But ostalgie is mostly manifested culturally, rather than actually wishing to return to the GDR.

thebullfrog72,"TL;DR No: not how the alliance worked, wouldn't make sense for Japan, impossible to pull off. 

Formal military plans, no. In fact, it would be very unlikely for the two Axis powers to discuss any such plans, as an important part of Nazi-Japanese relations was that the two empires did not overlap. 

From the Nuremberg trials, we have [this copy] (http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/imt/03/htm/t375.htm?size=2) of a Nazi Order outlining what cooperation would mean. The two realms would remain entirely separate, working together economically, and it's important to note that nowhere in the document is the Middle East or even India (a necessary precursor to Japanese intervention in the Middle East) mentioned. 

Two other major reasons why this plan wouldn't be considered is the strategic goals of the TriPartite Pact and the feasibility. For Nazi Germany, Japanese involvement was crucial in that it tied down British colonial forces, which it did quite successfully in its invasions of Burma and Singapore. By invading Burma, Britain was forced to maintain a garrison within its important territory of India, limiting the amount of reinforcements it could send to fight in the Mediterranean theatre. This actually worked; by 1942, India Command had mostly stopped sending forces to fight in the North African campaign or to defend the Middle East, and were focused entirely on defending India from an invasion from Burma, which they successfully repelled two years later. 

Japan's conquest in South-East Asia, particularly within Burma, were focused on accomplishing both the goal of hampering the British ability to attack Japan in the Pacific Theatre but also for the strategic resources, particularly the oil fields, that could be obtained in Burma. 

Regarding feasibility, this has as much to do with timing as anything. Japan's invasion of Burma was complete in 1942. With the Pacific Theatre beginning, it would be imprudent of Imperial Japan to devote further resources to attack India, not to mention the subsequent garrisoned British lands in Persia and then Iraq. In addition, on the Nazi side, a link-up would require devoting more personnel to the North Africa campaign to win the Battle of El-Alamein, thereby gaining access to Egypt, and through it, the Middle East. 

Greater cooperation between the Nazi and Japanese militaries could have proved beneficial to the Axis war plans, but were never a major focus for either country. For a while joint attack on the Soviet Union on both fronts was an option, but never occurred and Japan was not included in the Operation Barbarossa planning or execution. Any such action would have likely changed the face of the war between the USSR and the Nazis, as the Soviets were able to bring in reinforcements from the East that had been protecting against such a threat. The absence of this threat was confirmed repeatedly through espionage. 

In the end, any such plans would have been highly unfeasible, and if the situation was changed such that they could actually link up in the Middle East, it would probably be tactically unsound to do.  ",null,0,cdmjufc,1rcwqk,askhistorians,top_week,2
l_mack,"The clenched fist was not unique to leftist action during the Spanish Civil War. From what I gather, the clenched fist as a workers' symbol began to spread during the wave of labour agitation during the 1880s. It was broadly popularized through two famous paintings: Robert Köehler's ""[The Strike](http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artwork.php?artworkid=10758&amp;size=large)"" and his ""[The Socialist](http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=1451)."" 

By 1917, the Industrial Workers of the World had appropriated the symbol to represent workers' revolutionary intentions and the importance of syndicalism. It was also used extensively by the German Communist Party (KPD) during the 1920s. In terms of the Spanish Civil War, historians Gottfried Korff and Larry Peterson argue that ""the clenched fist first became an international left-wing symbol [during the Spanish Civil War] and was later taken up by European and American youth in the 1960s and 1970s, sometimes ironically,"" which perhaps relates to your own discussion of the black power appropriation of the symbol.

I think that a very informative article for you to read would be:

Gottfried Korff and Larry Peterson, ""From Brotherly Handshake to Clenched Fist: On Political Metaphors for the Workers' Hand,"" *International Labor and Working-Class History* 42 (Fall, 1992), pp. 70-81. 

This is where I've gotten most of my own knowledge of this symbol, and it likely serves your purposes quite well - although it does not explore the use of the symbol in the Spanish Civil War specifically. ",null,4,cdm0lgk,1rcv5e,askhistorians,top_week,24

The Clenched fist is a broadly used gesture in socialist circles. The International Workers of the World used the clenched (or raised) fist as their symbol as early as 1917. Among socialists it is common to raise your fist to the last chorus of ""The Internationale"" in large parts of Europe.
This article from NYT has more on the history of the clenched fist: [Raised Fist](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/raised-fist-salute-has-varied-meanings/) Also look at the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_fist)",null,4,cdlxlt5,1rcv5e,askhistorians,top_week,10
tobbinator,"During the Spanish Civil War it was used not only by the Left wing elements within the Republic but also by some of the Right Opposition in the Republic. Orwell in *Homage to Catalonia* describes it just as the ""anti-fascist salute"", implying that it had become a symbol of those in opposition to Franco, who was seen as a fascist by those on the Loyalist side. 

As for why it seems to have become a strong emblem of the Spanish Civil War, I'd say that would be because of the strength and size of the left wing militias (the CNT-aligned Durruti Column alone had 8,000 militiamen in 1937) as well as the very ideological nature of the war as a whole; internationally it was seen as a defence of democracy and freedom fighting against a fascist menace due to the attraction the Republic had towards many intellectuals and journalists, including Hemingway, Picasso and Orwell who were heavily involved in the conflict. In addition there's the very romanticised view of the revolutionaries, who were met with surprising success but crushed, and International Brigadiers, who went to a foreign land to fight an ideological enemy voluntarily.

JarlGrimnar0311,"There was a very serious concern that some of his higher military command, especially General Curtis Lamay, were too eager to get into a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. Lamay had been pushing aggressive policies before Kennedy with having modified air force bombers loaded with signals intelligence equipment fly right along the Soviet Border antagonizing them and advocating for pre-emptive nuclear war. Lemay during the Cuban Missile Crisis was also a strong advocate of bombing Cuba and opposed the naval blockade, going so far as to advocate invading Cuba even after the crisis had ended and the Soviets agreed to withdraw the nuclear missiles. 

As far as a actual fear of a coup attempt, I can't quote or cite any actual historical documents, but from what I know and read of a lot of the higher ranking members of the military at the time, the fear of the domino effect of communism, the idea of monolithic communism, Cuba having become so friendly to the Soviet Union, and the fact that many of the higher ranking military in Kennedy's administration had been hardened by World War Two experiences all helped to create a highly unstable and dangerous atmosphere during that time of the Cold War.

jhd3nm,"*Could* they?  Yes, certainly.  Was it a likely possiblilty?   Not at all.  You have to understand- secession fervor, and war fervor, had been cranked up to a fever pitch in the South.  The states of the CSA didn't just sit down and say ""Gee, let's secede"".  There was a concerted effort by the anti-Unionists to propagandize secession which went hand-in-hand with a hawkish stance towards the Union. 

Many of the noted proponents of secession(called the ""Fire Eaters"") had a virulent hatred of the North- Edmund Ruffin being one famous example: credited with firing one of the first shots at Ft. Sumter, he killed himself after Lee surrendered, writing in his diary:

&gt;And now with my latest writing and utterance, and with what will [be] near to my latest breath, I here repeat, &amp; would willingly proclaim, my unmitigated hatred to Yankee rule—to all political, social and business connections with Yankees, &amp; to the perfidious, malignant, &amp; vile Yankee race.

So, in reality, by the time of Ft. Sumter, there was little that could have been done.  It would have been like trying to stop a massive freight train barreling full-speed towards war.

Obligatory-Reference,"This is entering the realm of /r/HistoricalWhatIf, but I'll give it a shot.

I would say it was possible in the short term, but probably not in the long term. Some people in the North, including incoming Secretary of State William Seward, wanted to give up Fort Sumter to the Confederacy. There was a belief that doing so would 'calm down' the South, so that hopefully secessionist fever would run its course.

&gt; [Seward] wanted to give up Sumter for political as well as military reasons. Such a gesture of peace and good will, he told Lincoln, would reassure the upper South and strengthen unionists in Confederate states.

-James McPherson, *Battle Cry of Freedom*

From the South's point of view, there's no way they could have let Fort Sumter stand indefinitely. It was, for all intents and purposes, a foreign fort in their territory, and there was concern that public opinion would turn against the new government if they didn't do something.

&gt;""The spirit and even the patriotism of the people is oozing out under this do-nothing policy...""

dualmanias,"By the time the attack on Fort Sumter began, the Confederacy was still forming and shaping its self. The simple answer is no, war could not have been avoided. Here are some of the factors why:  
  
South Carolina was the first state to leave the union on the 20th of December, 1860. A little over a month after President Abraham Lincoln had been elected.  
(up to this point many in the ""north"" had been anti slavery but it was not an overall major point in the agenda of the administration, nor did Lincoln run on a serious anti-slavery platform. Many prominent voices pushed for its abolition but it was still an issue that was easier to ignore than address as a whole.)  
  
By the start of February, 1861 several more states had seceded from the union and joined the confederacy. A constitution was drawn and adopted on the 8th of February and its elected president the following day.  
  
In the few short months from an American President to a northern and southern presidency, a lot of rhetoric, scheming, plotting, and reinforcing of positions and causes came to the forefront. Slavery became a prominent issue. Lincoln had argued as tensions grew that he would not abolish slavery but would not allow the nation to be divided either. This was a major talking point in his inaugural address on March 4th. You could view this as the first absolutely clear ""public"" stance Lincoln held on the whole affair. However, ""privately"" the administrations thought process could have, and perhaps was very different. In any case, it was a direct attempt to avoid war but also a clear assertion that secession would not be accepted. You can essentially view it as a promise of war rather than a deceleration of war if all other options have been exhausted and the nation could not be preserved.  
  
South Carolina, leading the charge so to speak towards secession knew that a conflict was unavoidable. Unlike many of the other states that had left the union, SC had a large presence of Federal troops on its soil. Most notably, the sea forts which protected American commerce and its shipping lanes. Fort Moultrie which was commanded by Major Robert Anderson, responsible for all of the harbor defense and all of its related garrisons , was the initial headquarters but fearing attack, Anderson switched his command to Fort Sumter.  
  
While the politicians debated, Anderson had already prepared as best as he could for the coming fight. Interesting fact, because SC had already left the union, Federal troops had no means for resupply. Food and munitions had been blockaded from the forts since January. The first shots of the Civil War actually happened on January 9th when SC vessels enforced their blockade and turned around northern supply ships.  
  
The growing situation of the forts and the blockade of SC waters from the north became the hotbed issue that directly escalated it into an armed conflict. Despite repeated calls to abandon the forts and remand control to the Confederacy, Anderson refused, meanwhile his men grew closer to facing starvation. Knowing that many of the Forts would be out of supplies and rations soon, Lincoln ordered a small fleet to attempt to sneak past the blockade and resupply the forts.  
  
Numerous attempts were made to find a way out of the situation but in the end Anderson would not leave, nor surrender. (and why would he, it would meant treason and surrendering to even bigger traitor in a way)  
  
Long story short, with union troops stationed on their soil, refusing to leave and an increasing number of Union ships attempting to force their way in, the south had little choice. On Friday, April 12, 1861 in the wee hours of the morning, they opened fire.  
  
Shortly after, war was officially declared by both sides.

Dreamyimp,"From what I found Italy was very useless is WWII. The only reason that Italy joined the war in the first place was so that Mussolini's ego could be compensated, as in he wanted more land for Italy and wanted to be known around the world for helping Italy becoming a world power, which he failed to meet. One of the biggest reasons Italy failed to become a strong military force in WWII was because they were simply unready to fight. They were still armed with the technology that the country had previously used in WWI. Also a majority of their artillery was horse drawn. They also had only a fraction of the production power of the larger countries(Germany, France, Britain). 

Mussolini's Italy was also filled with incompetent leaders and soldiers that didn't have the will to fight. Mussolini only filled his military corps with generals that were loyal to him and his cause, disregarding the semi-competent Generals that were appointed before he became leader. Quite literally Mussolini and his Nationalist friends were the only ones that wanted to fight, causing much of the soldiers in Italy unwilling to fight.

Italy allowed Germany to fight in North Africa, which could have allowed them to close the Suez Canal and gain access to middle eastern oil. Italy failed miserably in that front.

In any case, the Queen makes a point of staying out of politics and allowing government to make its own decisions.  This has been the case with all recent monarchs in the 20th century (and beyond).  Constitutionally, the 3 powers the British Monarch possess are:

Appointment of the Prime Minister.  In theory the Queen could appoint anyone she feels it up to the job, in reality she appoints whoever the public elects.  However, in the case of a hung parliament she can step in.  This has happened once, in 1974, when Harold Wilson was appointed.  It could have happened in 2010 also, but they decided to form a coalition instead. 

Dissolution of parliament.  In theory, the Queen could dissolve parliament if they were not up to the job.  This has not happened since  1834 and is unlikely to ever happen again as it would cause a constitutional crisis of epic proportions.  The dissolution of parliament after the 1974 election was done at the Prime Minister's request.

Royal Prerogative.  As I stated all British Government business is done in the Queen's name so in theory she is in charge, however she is constrained by the constitution (you can thank the Civil War for that).  In practise, the Queen's role is purely ceremonial and she only acts on the advice of parliament.  The current queen has been around since 1952, and is is well known that she takes a keen interest in government affairs.  British Prime Ministers will often ask her for advice before acting and she hosts weekly meetings.

The privy council is the epicentre of what the British journalist Henry Fairlie called 'The Establishment' in the 1950s. This term refers to the fact that in Britain power is exercised socially. It is not centralised with Capitalists or Politicians or Royals and Nobles or The Media or The Church or The Police or The Army or The Intelligentsia or any other specific group. Instead it manifests when these groups all coalesce around common goals.  This has been true of English history since the end of the Roman era.

Jordan42,"Let me offer a bit of extra context that might be helpful. The people who wrote the Declaration of Independence, and who were at the leadership helm during the American War for Independence were guided by what was referred to as the ""Law of Nations"". Now, this wasn't a strict set of rules, but was most fully articulated by Emerich de Vattel in his 1758 book *The Law of Nations*, to which many American ""Founding Fathers"" often referred.

One basic tenet of this protean, Eurocentric code was that for a state to be legitimate, it had to be treaty-worthy -- that is, it had to conform to the norms of European states, which involved the ability to enforce treaties and to maintain some military capability. Within this context, one might argue that the Franco-American Treaty agreed in 1778 was crucial in making the Declaration of Independence a ""legal"" document. However, this was less an acknowledgement of American strength and treaty-worthiness than an opportunistic move by France. In his excellent book on this topic, Eliga Gould argues that the U.S. wasn't truly seen as ""treaty worthy"" until the Jay Treaty of 1795. Until then, Britain didn't really respect American independence, even if it grudgingly acknowledged it in the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The Pinckney Treaty with Spain, ratified in 1796 would have confirmed this. Prior to these treaties, Spain and Britain did not truly acknowledge the sovereignty of the United States. From this perspective, the United States could not truly consider itself as independent, in a context where independence meant full membership in a European-defined community of nations, until the mid-1790s.

Tiako,"I'm assuming the question is for the Imperial period.

Roman recruitment is something of a complex topic, and one that has a fair amount of difficulty around it. The best answer is probably that there was no single way of getting recruits that applied in all situations, all times, and all places. The process was probably not terribly formalized, and seems a bit ad hoc. A theory that was once popular was the idea of the Roman army as a self-sustaining institution, that the pool of recruits was drawn largely from the various orphans and children legitimate and illegitimate that any military fort is going to accumulate. This is probably not correct, although undoubtedly was part of the story, both because it has no real evidence for it an because legionaries proper (who were increasingly a minority within the army as a whole) were citizens, a category that doesn't include orphans.

Conscription did happen, although it was never a levee-en-masse affair implemented across the empire. Rather, it would be targeted for specific regions and specific circumstances--the Romans tended to view certain people as producing better soldiers, and they weren't above coercion as a strategy of getting recruits from them. Most notoriously, the Batavian revolt of 69 CE was triggered by overly heavy handed recruitment methods, as Batavians were seen as some of the best material for soldiers. Probably the majority of soldiers were willing recruits, fleeing from rural poverty into the fairly solid and stable military institution.

As for how they maintained it, it is best to remember that the Roman army actually wasn't that large. That is, the amount of money required to maintain it was significantly less than the aggregate amount of money required for the pre-Roman military situation of multiple competing polities. This is an important principle behind certain views of the Roman economy.",null,0,cdlwkkn,1rchua,askhistorians,top_week,10
Spoonfeedme,"Expanding on Tiako and dawbles' comments, it also really depends what period we are talking about exactly. The Republican period was far different than the Imperial period that followed, and recruiting practices differed.

It's also important to note that, as Tiako mentioned, the army wasn't actually that large by modern standards; for a population that might have reached almost sixty million, the imperial army had less than thirty legions under arms for most of its existence, which would have been approximately 150,000  'regulars' and about an equal number of auxiliaries, so we can say roughly 300,000 men under arms. The auxiliaries would have come from both inhabitants of the Empire as well as neighboring territories. We have to make a distinction between them.

The Legions themselves were theoretically manned by Roman citizens, while the auxiliaries basically took the role of the 'allies' of the Republic. The idea that you would receive citizenship after your term of service was actually directed towards auxiliaries. The Emperor Caracalla made every free man in the empire a citizen in 212 to possibly to offset falls in recruitment among current citizens.

That possible fall in recruitment probably had something to do with money. Let's talk about economics. Rome itself and Italy had a high slave population that continued to grow into the Imperial period. This meant a high percentage of people in Italy would be basically urban poor; Rome itself could have had a population approaching one million in the early Imperial period for example. The legions offered an attractive and stable career choice. If one had familial connections, one could leverage those into even more attractive postings; most officers would have been men who basically bribed their way into such postings. 

I think we can probably safely assume the majority of the Imperial legion, at least under the Principate, was thus simply recruited under the idea of a decent job for decent pay. However, the costs of maintaining a standing army is incredible. The army itself was basically **the** budget line for the Roman Empire. Not only was it costly to maintain in terms of regular financing, each successive emperor was obliged to pay donatives to the army. Legionary pay itself was increased over time (inflation) likely in order to continue to be able to recruit. However, these increases were highly irregular; the first increase came a century after the Imperial period started, the second a century after that. When factoring in the likely levels of inflation caused by economic growth and the not so irregular devaluation of coins by debasing them, in absolute terms it would likely be that legionary pay actually fell over time. Finding money to pay the army was a constant challenge, and some think that the faillure of the Roman economy to be able to support the army was one of the main reasons for the Empire's downfall (Peter Heather is one notable proponent of this).

But there are also those auxiliaries I mentioned. This is a far more complicated answer because they could have been recruited in many different forms because the units themselves came in so many different forms. Some auxiliary units were levy's from conquered/subject tribes. Some would have been freely recruited men from non-citizen areas looking to gain citizenship and a job. These units still received (lesser) pay so there would be some who would be attracted by the status of citizenship. Because auxiliaries also generally receive less attention from writers, less survives from letters, and fewer inscriptions remain, we unfortunately know a lot less about them in many ways.

If you'd like to know more about the economic theories of Rome's decline, Peter Heather's 'Decline of the Roman Empire' is a good place to start. In terms of more info on legion recruitment, Adrian Goldsworthy's 'Complete Roman Army' and Pat Southern's 'The Roman Army'.

No stupid questions. 

In England there are many people with Jamaican heritage. There are people from various countries in Africa. These might mostly be countries that England once colonized or traded with heavily. 

There are strong commercial and cultural links between southern Europe and North Africa. Keep in mind that the Mediterranean was the major body of water for many societies for many centuries. 

In France you might find communities originating from Algeria, Mali, or Senegal, for example.

These deserters called themselves the Knight Company after their captain, Newt Knight, and set up their headquarters in the swamps of Leaf River, Mississippi. Generally around this time Mississippi was relatively poor comparably to their southern counterparts. The Confederate government passed the ""Twenty-Negro Law"" which exempted all slave owners who owned more than 20 slaves to be exempt from service. This prompted the desertion of the Knight Company from the Confederate army. Newt Knight's comrade, Jasper Collins, remarked, “This law … makes it a rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight”. To make matters worse the Confederates had a system in place called ""Tax-in-kind"" where tax collectors took what they wanted from the populace to sustain the Confederate army and government. This had a massive effect on poor whites who were already struggling to make ends meet. Women and children were starving to death as their husbands were risking their lives against disease and yankee muskets. Newt Knight left his post in 1863, following the Siege of Vicksburg, with 125 men from Jones, Jasper, Smith, and Covington county to defend their families and ward off Confederate troops rounding up deserters. The Knight Company would attack supply routes and Confederate columns and then disappear back into the swamps. Newt and his Knight Company were so successful at disrupting the Confederates that the news travelled to Jefferson Davis. Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk informed President Jefferson Davis that Jones County was in “open rebellion” and the combatants were “… proclaiming themselves ‘Southern Yankees,’ and resolved to resist by force of arms all efforts to capture them.” The Natchez Courier reported in its July 12, 1864, edition that Jones County had seceded from the Confederacy.

caesar10022,"Probably the most famous area conquered under the Umayyads was the Iberian Peninsula, known as al-Andalus to the Arabs. The conquests of al-Andalus were quick, and the narrative goes that they began when an invasion force under Tariq ibn Zayid landed in Gibraltar in 711. The army he commanded, around 15,000 troops, was composed mainly of Berbers from North Africa (converts to Islam), along with a contingent of elite Arabs. The Visigothic elites were replaced in Iberia by a new Berber-Arab aristocracy, and al-Andalus would remain a stronghold of Islamic culture until the 15th century.

There's a very good reason why they are often called the ""Islamic Conquests"" in modern scholarship rather than simply the ""Arab Conquests"" these days. There were a significant number of groups who chose to participate in the conquests of the near east who weren't Arabs at all. This included Persian forces like the famed asawira cavalry. That's not even considering the Berbers of North Africa (who's conversion to Islam in the early period is questionable, to say the least). Elsewhere, it wasn't even a requirement to be a Muslim. The most famous case of an Arab group who participated in the conquests but chose to retain their Christianity in the early period are the Banu Taghlib.

archaeontologist,"Although I can't speak to the specifics of the Estonian situation, I feel the need to intervene here, seeing as the only other comment is an ahistorical polemic.

The notion of foreign conquest bringing 'civilization and prosperity' has a long, trans-European history of justifying imperial expansion. It is firmly rooted in a 19th century political and intellectual climate - the age of imperialism, where older and younger empires expanded their colonial holdings. Intellectual conceptions of an advanced Europe at the vanguard of historical progress were both formed through these imperial encounters with non-European subjects, and informed how empires negotiated the positions of these 'others'. Belief in technological, social, political and moral progress supported hierarchical understandings of nations, where different peoples could be plotted on a singular, linear path of development. In this vision, 'less-developed' peoples were situated on a path towards modernity (at the forefront of which was, of course, Western Europe), and colonial intervention could beneficially lead these 'children' of mankind down this path.

This is NOT a particularly Russian view - its intellectual origins can be located in Enlightenment thought, and its political origins in the imperial debates of late-18th c. England. And for all its reactionary connotations today, understandings of colonialism as a civilizing mission was NOT limited to conservative demagogues - recent scholarship into colonial politics and 19th century political culture has stressed the ties between nascent liberalism and apologetics of empire (particularly fascinating are the imperialist doctrines of James and John Stuart Mill, as well as Tocqueville's justification of the conquest of Algeria). Furthermore, the development of the social sciences of Sociology and Anthropology in the late-19th century can be tied to this drive to 'understand' and 'aid' the uncivilized colonial other. For the latest scholarship on liberal imperialism and justifications of imperial conquest in the 19th century, see:

* Sankar Muthu, *Enlightenment Against Empire* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003).

* Jennifer Pitts, *A Turn to Empire: The Rise of Imperial Liberalism in Britain and France* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005).

* Karuna Mantena, *Alibis of Empire: Henry Maine and the Ends of Liberal Imperialism* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010).

Of course, I've painted a rough and quick picture of this period - the notion of empire and civilizing the colonial other was a thoroughly ambiguous one, perpetrated in political projects, scientific discourses, and literary productions, but also contested and debated in these same mediums.

It's even more complex in the Eastern European case, where the Russian Empire justified its own 19th c. expansion in the east as a civilizing mission, while Western European political and cultural thought portrayed Russia itself as a backwards nation, itself in need of civilization. I find it incredibly alarming that the poster below me ruthlessly criticizes Imperial Russia for using a discourse of backwards 'others' in need of civilizing, while he uses the exact same discourse to look down upon 'murderous', Russian 'barbarians'. In fact, there is a long history of what can be called 'Russian Orientalism' (in the Saidian sense), where W. European cultural and scientific discourses have constructed a backwards, uncivilized E. Europe against which to define their own 'Europeaness'. For recent works on this topic, see:

Against his comment (as well as 19th century imperialism and its modern intellectual influence, seen in the interview you describe above [unfortunately, certain 19th c. notions have yet to vanish from the public consciousness]), it is not the task of historians to 'rank' peoples and nations in a hierarchy of progress, or wield a binary lens of 'civilization/savagery' - the goal is instead to *historicize* these discourses and their lingering effects, and ask *how* this particular vision of the world was constructed.

In the particular instance you site above, it seems to be a naive, modern expression of this civilization/barbarism binary with roots in the 19th c. (and, unfortunately, still latent in much popular thought to this day), probably with the added influence of the Soviet nationalities policy. If you're interested, I would be more than happy to recommend some books on Russia's historical engagement with its multi-ethnic polity, up to and including the Soviet period.


And one last thing: the quote by Noxchi below on Russia's engagement with the Caucasus is entirely inaccurate. In writing ""the xenophobic and bleak Russian could only discern 'savages' and 'blacks'"", the complex, variegated history of interactions between Imperial Russia and these southern neighbors is entirely erased. Leaving aside shifting imperial political mechanisms of negotiating difference, 19th century Russian culture saw complex strategies of understanding this region - from the 'nobel savage' of romantic lyrical poetry and travelogues of the first decades of the 19th century (exemplified in Pushkin's ""A Prisoner in the Caucasus"") to Tolstoy's incredible novel *Hadji Murat* (published posthumously in 1912), which superbly examines the conflicts of colonial empire and whose richly presented Caucasian protagonist (who is the furthest thing from a 'savage') is used to direct a withering critique against the imperial policies of a far more barbaric Tsar Nicholas I. For a history on 19th c. Russia's rich engagement with the Caucasus, see:

The ""viking"" image is just one portrayal of the vikings, much of it by the enemies and victims of the norse people and raiders. In reality the Norse impact on, say, the British Isles was somewhat comparable to the Roman impact. There were raids, there was pillaging, but there was also trade and settlement. During the early 2nd millenium the norse spread out and colonized a lot of remote areas, including the British Isles, Brittany, Iceland, Greenland, even parts of Nova Scotia, and much of the land around the Volga River in Eastern Europe.

This is little different from the spread of the Romans, Greeks, or Phoenicians in the Mediterranean.

Neither would agree to the other becoming the capital, and both had support of different states (generally the Western states favoured Melbourne, and Queensland supported Sydney). I believe the agreement was that the capital could remain in New South Wales' borders but that it had to be at least 100KM from Sydney, and that the area was to be ceded by NSW to the federal government (thus becoming the separate Australian Capital Territory).

It's pretty much impossible to measure it correctly sine all the prices were made up from economical standpoint. Most of the economy was working on make-believe statistics as anyone who remembers that time will confirm so taking any figures from that time is pretty pointless.  As for exports and imports there was an old joke in my home country (Poland) that ""we give the soviets coal and in return they take steel from us"". 

Also in no way was it ""doing well until Khrushchev"". It is an often made claim that confuses (*heavily* propagandized) general attempts at re-building the country after the war with economic growth.  As a matter of fact most of the cities and the country was still spotted with ruined buildings and dilapidated infrastructure. You can find photographs from the 1960's of cities to see how much of it was still standing. I have an album with black and white pictures of my home town from 1960's - it's mostly ruin despite being 15-20 years after the war. While it is important to remember that the extent of destruction in the East was far greater than in the west - you can tell how an economy is doing by comparing the speed and effectiveness of re-building efforts. In West Germany most cities have been rebuilt by 1970's - in the soviet bloc not every ruined building was torn down and even then there were huge empty spaces left in the middle of towns. 

To answer your question - soviet planned economy was a disaster that did little to increase the standard of living of regular people. The countries in the soviet bloc that were considered ""wealthiest"" in 1989 were those which were least devastated by war like Czechoslovakia (Czech part) and those that were more open to the west like Yugoslavia (until civil war). East germany is often considered to be a ""richer"" soviet country but that's because people were escaping west until the erection of Berlin wall - some couple million people.

Broadly speaking, the idea of Western exceptionalism hinges on an outdated Whiggish historical outlook that history is constantly and inevitably progressing to some ultimate state of betterment (typically culminating in the rise of liberal democracy).  This idea is itself a Western construct and no historian really subscribes to the belief anymore.  History is not so neat as Whig historians would believe; it's much more chaotic, non-linear, and pluralist.  Historical pluralism recognizes that history can be viewed from a variety of perspectives.  For instance, many people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America take issue, to put it mildly, with the idea of Western exceptionalism.  Moreover, the term carries a great deal of racist or otherwise bigoted thought toward the non-white peoples of the world.

Georgy_K_Zhukov,"Baseball evolved over much of the 19th century, but if you want to pick any one point of ""origination"", the American Civil War is where what we think of as baseball really started to appear.

Bat and ball games had been around for ages, being played in Great Britain for centuries, and they no doubt came to America from there. Cricket, baseball and rounders all have their origins somewhere back there.

Now, with baseball specifically we start to see regional variations that kind of, sort of resemble baseball being played in America in the first half of the 19th century. The Knickerbocker rules - which date to 1845 - were the dominant set of rules being played in the area of New York, but they were by no means the only set of rules. The game would be kind of recognizable to a modern observer, but rules such as making an out on a catch after one bounce would be pretty weird now. It also lacked 'balls', although three strikes was a rule.

Now, as I said, the Civil War was a key component of the rise of baseball. When the war started, hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers from all other the country found themselves camped together and with a lot of downtime. Baseball became an exceptionally popular game for them, and with New Yorkers everywhere, the Knickerbocker rules found themselves to be the most popular used, essentially becoming the de facto rules for Union Army baseball. When the war ended and the Army disbanded most of its men, soldiers headed home, bringing with them either a new game, or else a new set of rules for one they had already played.

In the wake of the war, amateur athletic clubs started sprouting up all over, and within only a few years, the first Professional club was founded in Cincinnati, in 1869. More clubs followed, and in 1876, the National League was founded (It was not the first league though, as there had been a pre-war association, the NABBP, that governed amateur clubs in the New York Area). The rules continued to evolve beyond that point - [here is a handy list](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rulechng.shtml) - but by 1889 or so (with the introduction of 'four balls'. It had been as high as nine in the past) I would say the game very much resembled what we have today.

So there you go, as with most games (Basketball is the only one I can think of off hand that was essentially created out of thin air), it was a slow, evolutionary process from earlier ones. That being said, the most important point in its development was the American Civil War, which not only helped to speed up standardization of the rules, but created a nation wide network of fans and players.",null,1,cdltumo,1rc005,askhistorians,top_week,6

English would have been introduced in the 1500s when English language also became more common in England as well. I hope an English historian will pop in and correct me, I'm more suited to Scottish histories.

BeondTheGrave,"I assume you are talking about strategic air power (the bombing campaigns of Germany specifically), as opposed to operational or tactical air power. 

And the answer to your question probably the Red Army. Their constant, grinding battle with the German forces occupied over 60% of all German divisions for the entire 41-45 conflict, and most Germans were killed by Soviets, not ""Allies"" (to lump together the Americans, Commonwealths, and other ""westfront-ers"").

The major problem with the Strategic Bombing campaigns is a question of how useful were they? The main aim of the bombing campaigns (especially the American ones, the British focused primarily on De-housing) was to grind the German economy to a halt. This was mainly accomplished  by first destroying *all* factories, but then transitioned to destroy ""bottleneck"" factories. These would be places that produced goods critical for all other industries, like ball bearings. Cut off the ball bearings, and everything from tank turrets to plane engines to heavy machinery grinds to a halt right? Wrong. It was discovered that the German economy had the annoying tendency to decentralize, distribute, and regenerate otherwise destroyed production. And this regularly happened so quickly that the German economy (or war effort) never ground to any serious halt. While there were certainly disruptions, the German economy regularly produced more weapons, and in greater numbers, than it had previously. So the American strategy of economic destruction generally failed. 

But then we need to Ploesti and oil. In 1943 the Americans began to bomb the Ploesti oil field in Romania. This was the major oil supplier for Nazi Germany. By 1944 the Americans had shifted their major focus to attacking oil refineries, and oil production (as a part of the bottleneck strategy). Aside from a brief respite during the transportation bombing phase of Operation Overlord, the Americans kept up series pressure on both Ploesti and the German oil refineries. This had a massive effect on German oil production, and by 1945 they were experiencing major shortages. So the Strategic bombing campaign had a tremendous effect on Germany. The problem was, it took a really long time, and nobody realized what worked until it was already over. 

But by 1945, (even by 1943) the Red Army had already won the war. It was merely a question of what the world would look like afterwards. On the other hand, the Bombing Campaigns did distract a major amount of *Luftwaffe* squadrons and flak batteries (remember that that dreaded 88mm was originally a flak gun. Imagine how Germany would have fared if more of them were in Tigers, instead of guarding Germany's skies. On top of that, keep in mind that Germany had basically stripped the Eastern Front of aviation by 1943, with most of its fighters going to defend the against bomber raids. This gave the Soviet air arm air superiority). So its a really complicated issue, and requires a lot of hair splitting and debate on what was really important. If I had to come down on one side or another (to solve your debate) Id say the Red Army, but thats what kind of guy I am. But that is not to discount the impact of the air campaigns against Germany. I just have deep problems concerning Strategic Air campaigns. ",null,1,cdlmxo2,1rbqih,askhistorians,top_week,4

Studies during the war showed that barely any bombs hit their targets and when they did they tended to do less damage than expected.  This was one of the reasons for the decision to start the Dehousing bombing campaign (also known as Terror Bombing) in which it was decided to destroy the majority of houses in dozens of German cities.  It was hoped that blowing up their homes would so demoralise the German population that they'd basically give up.  

According to Ian Kershaw the German's ability to produce war goods, which actually increased as the Allied bombing increased, didn't collapse until the Germans lost the territory where they got either their resources from or the factories were located.

A common expectation was that there will be no border control or tariffs for intra-CIS trade. However, customs emerged rather quickly, tariffs were used to control internal markets. Customs and tariffs was one of main reasons of dramatic drop in industrial production across ex-USSR states.

Acritas,"&gt;So I am curious to what were your statistical chances to survive Stalingrad serving in the Russian army by gender?
--- 

Formal answer is *average women survival rate during Stalingrad battle was much higher*. 

Caveat - direct comparison is impossible and incorrect, IMO. You see, women did not serve in USSR infantry as grunts. And that's where the bulk of losses were. They have served in many special or supporting roles though and were critical for Stalingrad defense. 

See my post about 1077th AA regiment. It was instrumental in not letting germans to enter the city on 1st push, got  wiped out in 2 days - but it's not typical at all. It happened only because there was no other forces in vicinity, capable to stop german tanks.

&gt;Any numbers would be fantastic, especially percentages.
---

I am not aware of any gender-specific research of USSR losses at Stalingrad. 

Very difficult to assemble numbers and %%. You'd have to go thru all loss reports (and that's millions of names). Sometimes it's not possible to tell from last name whether it's a woman or man (e.g. *-ko, -yh* suffixes don't reflect a gender, while other common suffixes, like *-ov/-ova, -in/-ina* - do). Loss reports do not mention a gender, just a name and place of birth. Most of women fought but were assigned to special roles (combat medic, signal spc., sniper etc.) in regular 'male' units, not in 'female' units. All-female units were mostly in air force - fighter, bombers. Even pairs of female snipers were attached to male infantry units.

koliano,"Ottoman History is not my field of study, so I'm sure someone else will be able to give a more comprehensive answer, but I can tell you that a key concept in addressing this question is the Millet system.

The Millet system gave a very effective sort of self-government to non-Muslim citizens of the empire. Living in a millet, one would abide by the religious community's own laws, pay taxes to their own representatives, and generally live in peace without interference from the Ottomans, as long as one recognized the political power of the empire- or, depending on where and when you were, the power of the ayans, petty (but sometimes quite powerful) regional lords.

There were millets for Christians of many different types: mostly divisions that skirted the line between sectarian and ethnic: Armenian, Greek, Syrian, etc. The Jews had millets as well, and unfortunately for the minority Muslims, Druze and Shiites and the like, they ended up lumped in with the majority Sunnis.

I have never heard of Pagan millets. That doesn't mean there were no pagans in the Ottoman Empire, just that they weren't numerous and well-organized enough to receive religio-political autonomy.

Thus, while Islam was 'supreme', as in, if your dispute involves a Muslim you have to go through the Islamic legal system and not your millet's, everything still worked pretty well. After all, it had to. The Ottoman Empire was the bridge between the East and the West. It included a mindblowing variety of peoples and religions and cultures.

As for how effective the millet system was, well, one of the funniest quotes from the late, late Imperial period comes from a disgruntled leader of the Greek Orthodox church: responding to the new reforms which sought to establish universal equality regardless of religion. ""The State has made us equal with the Jews. We were satisfied with Muslim superiority."" What this illustrates is that despite living in a state ruled by what was for centuries the wellspring of Islamic authority, non-Muslim communities felt surprisingly comfortable and unrestrained.

As for 'converting people to Islam', you may be referring to the Devşirme system: the process by which mainly Christian youth would be forcibly recruited (or stolen, depending on your perspective) at a young age into the Janissary Order, over time a cadre of elite warriors who became a dominant political force in the Empire.

The system had its ups and downs. Obviously, nobody wants their child to be taken as a glorified slave soldier, on the other hand, the Janissaries were *really, really glorified slave soldiers*. Boys who likely had no chance at being anything other than Balkan peasants would instead have a chance to become politically significant- all the way up to the position of grand vizier.

Sükrü Hanioglu's brilliant 'A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire](http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Late-Ottoman-Empire/dp/0691146179/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385284584&amp;sr=1-2), a great primer on the time period and the empire itself.",null,1,cdlriq1,1rbdvf,askhistorians,top_week,5

It's a touchy subject to delve too deeply into, without discussing the historical accuracy of religious beliefs. You can measure the movement of the Roman holiday Saturnalia though.

Gadarn,"Crusader Kings basically uses a simplified model of feudal relationships. These ranks and relationships varied between regions/kingdoms but, for the most part, the Crusader Kings model is accurate as long as one remembers that it is just a basic overview.

The system was more complex in a number of ways and, as I mentioned previously, had variations among different kingdoms. It's important to keep in mind that the period that encompasses feudal society (the combination of feudalism and manorialism) lasted centuries and was always changing.

For example, in Anglo-Saxon England (prior to 1066) an Earl was a noble directly below the king but after the Norman conquest the rank of Earl, while continuing to exist, became the equivalent of a Norman count. The first English dukedoms were created 300 years later under Edward III.

Another example of how the medieval system was more complex is the rank of Marquess. A marquess ruled a march, just like a count rules a county, but generally a march was on the borders of the realm so a marquess was trusted to defend the kingdom's borders. As such, a marquess was of higher rank than a count.

We haven't even mentioned knights yet. A knight was lower in rank than all of those from the game that you have mentioned; basically a professional soldier who was granted land by his liege in return for his service. While technically any free man could be granted knighthood, in practice this was very rare, with potential knights singled out in childhood from among the children of existing knights/nobility.

Beyond the simple relationships the game depicts, the description of 12th century English feudalism at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism) has a pretty good description of how complicated the whole thing could get.

Astrogator,"What is meaningful dissent and resistance? Where does opposition end, and dissent begin? Where does active resistance start? Is the woman, standing in line at the bakery, telling a joke about Marshal Görings incapacity to protect the Reich from allied air attacks just voicing dissent? Is it an act of defiance and resistance against the regimes claim to totality? What about someone deserting from the Wehrmacht because he disagreed with the regime's aims? What about someone deserting because he was afraid? It's a murky field. It's a field that has been a battleground for German political for a long time. One of our former chancellors, Willy Brandt, was as Herbert Frahm a member of the socialist resistance and the resistance in Norway. This got him branded as a traitor by his political opponents. The deserters from the Wehrmacht (about two 2-300.000 were long denied) official recognition and pardon, and hat to fight the stigma of traitors as well. The members of the ""Rote Kapelle"" resistance group were hailed as heroes in the GDR and the Soviet Union, presented with the 'Hero of the Soviet Union' medal, and unjustly branded as a 5th column from Moscow and forgotten in the west. It's really murky. What is resistance in the face of a regime that has at its core the goal of total control over the private and the political? Or, the other way around, what is not?

There was quite a bit of what one could reasonably call resistance, spanning the whole field from passive opposition to armed resistance. But German resistance faced difficulties the resistance groups in occupied countries did not face. Firstly, resistance meant treason. There was no way around it, and for many that was an obstacle too difficult to overcome. Secondly, there were not only a few Quislings and cooperators, like in occupied countries: there was the majority of the German people that could denounce you, act as informants for the regime, or would oppose you. Thirdly, many of the resistance fighters were complicit in the crimes of the regime as well. This was particularly a problem for the resistance among the officers. Many of them had not only seen the war crimes on the Eastern Front, but hat participated in them in some form. Von Boeselager, for example, was involed in the brutal and inhuman warfare against the partisans in the back of the front. 

That doesn't mean that there was no meaningful resistance. But there was considerably less than in other countries. 

One oft-cited example is the church. Groups like the 'Bekennende Kirche', or the names of Bonhoeffer or Niemöller are well known. But the church was also mainly concerned with keeping the doctrinal and organizational integrity and sovereignty of the church intact in the face of NS encroachment. This was particularly successful in the case of the catholic church, and the regime never managed to get control over the catholic unions and many of their churches. But the catholic church was more interested in a defensive and reactionary defense of their milieu, they were interested in peaceful coexistence with the regime (albeit on their terms), and they were indeed afraid of Bolshevism. 
The resistance that originated from the church was not a platform for the organization of political resistance, and it could not be, that was clear to Bonhoeffer, too. There was of course resistance that was motivated by religious principles, but the church as an organization did not practice political resistance. It was pastors and ministers that acted on their own, like Theophil Wurm with his sermons against the Euthanasia or the murder of the Jews, or Bishop Count von Galen, who was convinced of the duty of the church to resist against a destructive regime, but who didn't find much support for active resistance among his colleagues.

Then there were the Jehovas witnesses, who were probably one of the most practically effective resistance movements. Their members, due to their faith, were opposed to serving in the army, and practiced conscientous objection in the face of the active conscription. And even after their religion was outlawed, they kept practicing, and also kept up a network of information, printing pamphlets and keeping up their organization. Most of them were not broken, not even in the KZs. There were a few other conscientous objectors, who were punished by death, but the Jehovas witnesses were by far the most numerous.

Other religious groups also practiced forms of resistance. The Quakers built up a network to help politically and racially pursued persons, tried to help individual prisoners, by intervention on their behalf with the authorities, or by sending packets, with the support of the American Quakers. The Seventh-Day-church practiced conscientous objection and refused to make the Hitler salute. Individuals like the Mormon Helmut Hübbener practiced religiously motiated resistance on their own. He spread foreign news that he listened to illegally and spread pamphlets to enlighten people about the true character of the NS-regime and the nature of German warfare, imprisoned in 1942. 

All this religious motivated resistance was in general not political in nature, it didn't aim to throw down the regime, but it was an act of defiance against a totalitarian regime that didn't leave them room to practice their faith freely. 

There was also the resistance of youth groups, like the Edelweiß- and Kittelbach-Piraten, the different *Meuten*, the Swing-Youth and so on. Youth resistance is also a difficult field. Youths are notoriously rebellious against authority. This is of course more prominent in an authoritarian context. There is an interesting area of tension there between dissent and consent, between embracing the new ideals of the new man, the cult of masculinity and adventure on the one hand, and the desire for cultural autonomy on the other hand, between not being 'like everybody else'. Some might have just been in it for the music, or the dream of a freer world. 

There was Jewish resistance, many young Jews featured prominently among the communist youth organizations, like the group around Herbert Baum, or the *dj 1.11.* of Helle Hirsch, who planned a bombing of the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg, but was imprisoned and executed. Another Jewish group was the 'Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens' (central union of German citizens of Jewish belief), who put up a defiant propaganda campaign against the defamations of the Regime, 1934 f.e. they published a brochure against the allegations of Jewish ritual murders, tried to help other Jews emigrate and cooperated with the social-democrat Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. Other groups continued circulating and publishing illegal material and pamphlets, trying to leak inormation to the public about the plans of the regime. An estimated 3.000 German Jews were active in the resistance from 1933 to 1945, many of them with communist groups, fighting amongst Titos and the Italian partisans, and participating in other resistance groups in Germany itself.  

There were countless small and individual acts, of individuals hiding and saving one or two Jews (many of whom died during bombings since they couldn't go into the public shelters), alone and independently, of others helping people escape across the border to Switzerland - some did this out of conviction, for strangers, others for close friends, others in turn to make some money off the refugees. There are cases of women protesting in front of the police station until their Jewish husbands were released, of soldiers refusing to participate in executions, of officers refusing to carry out illegal orders, others collecting information about crimes and war crimes. But all these individual acts are hard to generalize, since the motives are so different and personal. 

I've written a lot about the resistance among the communists (and why it so horribly failed), which was numerically the most important the socialists, Georg Elser and last-days resistance [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1muijr/in_wwii_germany_were_there_citizenbased_antinazi/); and about some of the difficulties the military resistance faced [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1n6io3/why_didnt_the_germans_just_shoot_hitler_instead/ccfue9s). 

To reiterate something I wrote earlier on the same topic: As a whole, German Resistance remained fragmented and ineffective throughout the war. And it always remained a small fraction of the population.

I apologize if I have been a bit generalizing here, but I tried to keep it short. If there are any questions, I'd be glad to answer.

peabodygreen,"At the moment I am taking a class on Nazi cultural policy, so I will answer your question to the best of my knowledge from the books I have read.

The laws the Nazis implemented encouraged ""degenerates"" to leave society, so over time many of those that fit that description--Jews, the physically deformed, gypsies--left Germany for countries such as Poland and France. There was not much outright dissent considering these laws affected a select group.

Additionally, the Nazi aesthetic was very alienating and encouraged appreciation for realistic form. Any art that did not fit this was banned. This was done through the Ministry of Propaganda and Public Enlightenment, headed by Goebbels. To combat the increasing laws that barred them from public life, Jewish populations actually created their own organizations that would enable them to continue working and teaching Jewish children. They were confined in certain areas of certain cities. Some sympathizing non-Jews would attend these events of Jewish musicians and Jewish artists to preserve the presence in society, but it was by no means a predominate movement.

Within German society in particular, there wasn't actually a lot of lash against these laws. Hitler was a very popular guy, even if people did make fun of his fervor and humorous mustache. After the Treaty of Versailles, which the German people saw as a reparation for WWI that they did not agree upon, the increasing poverty, and the ceded land they were forced to give up, Hitler was like a breath of fresh air. Yes, the laws were extremely harsh, but many saw them as necessary for the improvement and preservation of German society.

WinterWolf77,"The Ottoman Empire's participation in WWI directly caused its dissolution as an empire... but the end of the Ottoman Sultanate as an imperial power was likely an inevitable occurrence as a result of its loss of strength relative to other world powers.  Its total destruction as a political entity occurred in 1922 (after the war) and was done, arguably, because the leader of the Turkish nationalists (Mustafa Kemal Ataturk) just wanted the Ottomans gone.  For this topic, I won't get into the details of Ataturk. In very short and simplified summary, he blamed the Ottomans and Islam for what happened to the Ottoman Empire in World War I.

After the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent/the Lawgiver (1494 - 1566), the Ottoman Empire began to suffer a steady decline (although some historians would have my head off for using that word). A more accurate way to describe Ottoman ""decline"" would be to say that its strength (economic, military, political, etc.) relative to its top competitors (France, Russia, Britain) became weaker and weaker.  In terms of technological, military, and geopolitical impact, European imperial powers began to hugely outpace the Ottomans.

Being outpaced in these fields by another power isn't necessarily a guarantee of a political entity's destruction (the Vatican is a good example, the state of Italy has held a decisive military advantage over the Vatican for a long time, but the Vatican is still around).  However, the Ottomans geopolitical position made them an important target for imperial powers.  Talk to any historian of Russia long enough and they'll eventually tell you about Russia's historical obsession with obtaining a Mediterranean port.  The easiest way for them to do that was to go through the Ottomans. There were numerous other reasons why the Russians and Ottomans clashed almost constantly throughout their history, but this port issue is particularly relevant because it worried France and Britain (who really didn't want another imperial power sailing around the Mediterranean).

The Crimean War (1853-1856) had the Ottomans fighting the Russians again, but with the French and British assisting the Ottomans directly. As long as an imperial tug of war continued between the European imperial wars, the Ottomans served as a useful buffer state (a sad state of affairs compared to the 1500s when they were considered the terror of all Europe).

World War I is hugely significant for the Ottomans because it ended the tug of war.  Russia, France, and Britain found a reason to stand united... and they no longer needed the Ottomans as a buffer state.  The Ottoman government, ruled by a group called ""The Young Turks"", saw WWI as a chance to stop the Empire's steady decline into irrelevance. More desperately, the Ottomans HAD to join Germany. If the Ottomans didn't ally with Germany and beat the Allies, then the Empire was likely to be forcibly dissolved by the Allies.  This is particularly reflected in the failed Gallipoli Campaign (1915 - 1916) of World War I, where the French and British attempted to knock the Ottomans out of the war. Ataturk made a name for himself in this fighting.

Did Ottoman participation in WWI lead to their downfall? Absolutely. This war ended their empire.  But their empire had been coming to an end for some time now. To an extent, they were forced to fight in WWI or perish as an empire.  If WWI had not happened... would the Ottomans still be here?  Nobody knows of course, but the Ottomans had been trending towards disintegration for a long time when WWI rolled around. They weren't called ""the sick man of Europe"" for no reason.",null,0,cdm6p3f,1rb6p1,askhistorians,top_week,2
Xaethon,"Also a further question I would like to add to this, is that due to the Ottoman Empire facing its downfall and dissolution in WWI, could the outlook of WWII have been any different should there have been an Ottoman Empire still present, and not the states the emerged from its ruins with no fighting power in the grand scheme of things with the USSR, British Empire, and the US and other allies?",null,0,cdlxceh,1rb6p1,askhistorians,top_week,1
fdedio,"I can shed some light on this for World War I.

As both Germany and France were working on war strategies against each other, each had a plan for Switzerland as well.

The French plan was called [Operation H, for Helvetica](http://www.schweizer-festungen.ch/1914-18_ww1.htm#Plan%20H) (link in German).

Germany had a similar plan (for which I can't right now find a reference, my apologies.

However, in 1912, Switzerland hosted German emperor Wilhelm II. for a large-scale army maneuver, called [Kaisermanöver 1912](http://www.derbund.ch/bern/stadt/Grosser-Bahnhof-fuer-den-deutschen-Kaiser/story/15524995?track).

Military planners from other European powers were in attendance as well.

While [Switzerland has a long reputation of providing mercenary troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Guard), its standing army had not been tested in warfare in centuries, and was thus not thought of too highly in Europe.

To the surprise of many, including and especially Emperor Wilhelm, the maneuver was extremely well executed.

Combined with the natural defenses of Switzerland (which, after all, is a very mountainous country, to put it mildly), [and the fortresses that had been built to enhance these](http://bit.ly/1c2X8c3), this impressed foreign military planners so much that pretty much all invasion plans were put on hold, and not carried out afterwards.",null,0,cdly0dx,1rb5q3,askhistorians,top_week,3
pharmaceus,"I think that everyone is addressing the problem from the wrong angle. Switzerland did not emerge as a significantly richer nation until after both World Wars. And the wealth of the country is quite relative - it comes as the result of a high purchasing power of Swiss Franc relative to other currencies. For the length of duration of Bretton Woods agreement (1948-1973) the USD had a much higher purchasing power and thus you get the higher GDP ration. The Swiss franc was considered a much more stable currency - more stable than even the west German Mark - the US Dollar was not so stable as it was considered fundamental for global economy. It was in the most recent years that Switzerland skyrocketed to insane levels of nominal wealth - compared to Norway - but that is all in relative terms. Once you take purchasing power into account it becomes evident that high prices translate to much lower real wealth within the country. Switzerland's riches weren't backed by any significant resource supply or industrial base - the Swiss were simply careful not to waste their wealth and capital away on wars like other countries.  Compare those lists:

**Historical nominal GDP per capita**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_future_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita

in 1960 Switzerland has GDP per capita of approx 1776 USD  while Canada has 2295USD, the US 2880USD and Sweden 1983 USD.  In comparison France has 1320 and UK 1380 - that is not a huge difference for countries devastated by war.

**Historical GDP per region - adjusted for purchasing power**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_PPP

Compare the number between Switzerland, Sweden and  Germany, France, UK starting from 1820. You can clearly see that while both Switzerland and Sweden have a steady growth in GDP other countries have large fluctuations depending on the growth of population (Unification of Germany in 1870) and wars.

To sum things up from strategic standpoint Switzerland is not worth the effort because once you get rid of their relative position in the world economy by invading them you wipe out most of their wealth which in case of Sweden and Switzerland was significantly boosted by their neutrality which allowed for financial and other vulnerable industries to find a safe haven during wartime and shortly afterwards.

If you look at a list of historic English Dukes, for instance, a majority of the defunct lines were ended because the last Duke was on the losing end of a rebellion and not replaced, not just because of death of the last title holder. The dynasty died when the title died, even though there were family members who it could have passed to.

young_dick,"I will only answer part of your question from what knowledge I have.  My family has resided in far eastern Kentucky for over two hundred years.  They fought on both sides for very similar reasons really.  The reason the people in my family joined the army wasn't because slavery, taxation, or a crooked election.  In these small back woods towns there were no large plantations only family farms. Most of these people lived in object poverty so having the option to buy a slave was impossible.  As for the elections Appalachia has a history of mistrust of the government in general, they are clannish, and self sufficient people.  Many did not or could not travel the miles into town to participate in elections even if they could they were ill informed. So this mattered little to them.  My family and I could assume many others in the Appalachian region fought in the war because of a sense of ""outsiders"" coming into the region.  At the idea of these ides of war and outsiders coming in some men left to fight and defend their homes and towns.  After the war those who returned it was the same they had always lived.  Isolation and poverty.  There were few slaves to be set free because blacks have always been an extreme minority in Appalachia. This is one account and perspective from my family.

TheVitruvianDan,"I had Faramerz Dabhoiwala as a tutor last year and he was in the middle of a huge tour promoting his book The Origins of Sex in which he explores differing conceptions of this kind of stuff over time. One of his points was that in the Middle Ages in England female and male bodies were seen as the inverse of each other (ie the ovaries were internal testes, the vagina an inverted penis). Tied to this was the belief that therefore, just as a man had to orgasm to release semen, in order to conceive a woman had to reach orgasm. This was problematic in cases of rape obviously as if the woman fell pregnant it was assumed she enjoyed it

How this changes later on is less clear but it seems that eventually the opposite view came to be held - women were entirely different from men and consequently there was no reason to assume that they even COULD orgasm. And certainly that they shouldn't.

This is a very general outline of Dabhoiwala's views (I was not actually studying this topic and this came from conversations with him) nor do I know how accepted they are. I recommend you find his book and read that.",null,0,cdltepy,1rb290,askhistorians,top_week,3
bitparity,"Reddit tends to go through phases with regards to ""The Dark Ages"", depending upon what political point you're trying to make with that period (which itself is a microcosm with how ""The Dark Ages"" is wielded in actual academic historiography).  I think I saw a recent /r/atheism post where they were actively trying to revive that term for... reasons that are rather obvious (Christianity leading to ignorance, etc.).  On the opposing side, people also take the tack of Cracked.com, which enjoys a certain contrarian streak in some of their articles with the whole ""the real truth behind X"", thus the idea of ""the dark ages as not dark at all.""

Professionally, ""The Dark Ages"" is not used to define the era historiographically.  However, that does not stop that term from being used academically, even if for no other purpose than as a frame of reference that the historians are seeking to clarify.  A good example being famed historian John Haldon describing the most chaotic period of Byzantine history: 

*""The seventh century (in Byzantium), traditionally, belongs to the 'Dark Ages', in the fullest sense of the phrase, a period when both the sources available to the historian are fewer than in earlier or later times, and when the exigencies of the struggle to survive made the production of a widely based secular literature both less relevant to the cultural identity of the dominant elite and subordinate to the demand for political and theological certainties.""*

You'll notice despite the fact Haldon puts ""Dark Ages"" in quotes, it's still usefully illustrative of his point. 

In many ways, its similar to the nomenclature of ""byzantine/roman empire"".  Is it misleading?  Is it a perjorative or a useful categorization?  As well, both of these terms are argued fiercely in both the academic and the lay (specifically, the computer wargaming) communities, which is a microcosm of the debate regarding ""how dark were the dark ages?""  

It's true, ""the dark ages"" were not ""as dark"" as traditionally thought.  But as I pointed out in another post, the thoughts on that period of time boil down into 3 statements.

1. The era was as bad as everyone thought it was.
2. The era wasn't as bad as everyone thought it was.
3. The era wasn't bad at all.

You'll notice the one position missing from this list.  ""The era was in fact great for everyone.""  The best that people argue for is a semi-relative neutral position from the late Roman era.  Which should be as good as any indicator that some kind of traumatic transformation occurred in this period.

So given this framing and going back to your question, you're asking if it's wrong to call the period ""The Dark Ages"".

Here's an unsatisfactory answer: You do what you like :)  Ultimately, what matters is you understand why you're using or not using the term.  Are you using it for a convenient shorthand for a particular period in history that everybody knows?  Are you trying to indicate your belief in that period as one of socio-economic and technological regression?  Are you NOT using it because you believe that the need to acknowledge the advancements made during that age outweigh the convenience of its use?  And so on.

tl;dr - You call it what you want.  Everyone, including the academics, is still arguing about the fundamental question of that term, ""how dark was it really?""  There is in fact, no answer.  Thus, you do what you want with that term.  Just understand why you use it.  ",null,1,cdlh7mr,1rb1lj,askhistorians,top_week,15
Gadarn,"One of the main problems is that 'dark' is meant as a pejorative term that is not only not helpful - it sets up a damaging connotation - but it isn't very accurate in a number of ways.  There is simply no reason, as historians, to use the term ""Dark Ages"" when we can simply label that same period ""Early Middle Ages"" and avoid making a value judgement.

Beyond that, ""Europe between 450 CE and 1000 CE"" wasn't necessarily ""quite dark compared to the Roman Empire before it"". 3rd century Rome wasn't exactly ideal when it came to political stability - by comparison, many Early Medieval kingdoms/regions were far more 'bright'.

""Dark Ages"" also ignores the learning and cultural 'advancement' taking place. Ireland was a beacon of learning from the 7th century on, and I would argue that the Book of Kells speaks for itself when it comes to the cultural works created during this period. We owe much of our knowledge of Greek and Roman literature to the Carolingians and they were doing their own work too, including attempting the first public school system; hardly simply a ""bright spot"".

So when it comes down to it, it isn't helpful to use a pejorative term to blanket such a large period that simply can't be described in such a way. It is much more useful for historians to use more neutral language that ensures the reader isn't making a value judgement right from the start.",null,1,cdlgi27,1rb1lj,askhistorians,top_week,12

1. Do the Great Purges have a primarily psychological and personal explanation, stemming from Stalin's paranoia?

2. Were the stated reasons for the Purges, combatting various military and/or capitalist conspiracies against the USSR or against Communism, the genuine motivation?

There is quite a bit of debate on #1, but pretty much no debate on #2 (nobody seriously believes the official charges were anything but invented).

On #1, though, one can distinguish something like three positions (possibly more), and there is some shift in their relative strengths since the 1970s or so. A decent capsule summary of the (fairly large) literature can be found in Alex Bellamy's *Massacres and Morality: Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity*, starting on p. 106. A first-person account of the post-1970s developments can be found in Sheila Fitzpatrick's article ""Revisionism in Soviet History"", *History and Theory* 46(4): 77-91.

The first view is the one you allude to: that it was indeed primarily Stalin's personal paranoia leading him to attempt to liquidate any perceived threat or alternative source of power. In this view, it was primarily a top-down affair coordinated by Stalin, a series of irrational violent rages and seeing plots behind every corner. A second view is that it was indeed mainly planned by Stalin, but for more deliberate, rational, and less psychological reasons: this view holds that Stalin viewed terror as a key tool in building the industrial state, maintaining order, and maintaining his control over the party. Among Soviet dissidents, Roy Medvedev and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn are classic exponents of these two views: Medvedev ascribed Stalinism in large part to Stalin's personal paranoia, while Solzhenitsyn instead saw Stalin as a coldly rational, methodical planner of totalitarianism.

Against those two classic views—Stalin the paranoid madman, and Stalin the ruthless dictator—a third view has gained more prominence among historians since the 1970s ""revisionist"" [1] work of Sheila Fitzpatrick, Moshe Lewin, etc. It argues that there was not one single phenomenon, but rather a number of different events with somewhat different explanations, and somewhat downplays the omnipotent/omniscient role of Stalin (though only somewhat, as he clearly had enormous power). For one thing, this school sees the show-trial purges of Old Bolsheviks, and the much larger liquidations and deportations of mass populations such as the Ukrainians and the kulaks, as considerably different phenomena, and also tends to emphasize the role of social and bureaucratic forces in the latter. This group of historians tend to see Stalin as a bit less cynical, perhaps, and more interested in actually strengthening the USSR—not against the actually stated conspiracies, but against Stalin's and the bureaucracy's view of weaknesses in the system that could be corrected. Hence the purge of the Old Bolsheviks is seen by Fitzpatrick as, in part, a genuine attempt to replace old idealist revolutionaries with a new generation of scientifically trained cadres trained in the Soviet academies. And both Lewin and Fitzpatrick see many of the mass liquidations and deportations as attempts to reshape Soviet society by simply ruthlessly removing elements that didn't seem to fit into its vision.

In short: nobody really doubts that the various conspiracies were invented pretexts to carry out purges, but whether the real motivation for these purges was Stalin's paranoia, or something else, is more debated.

Desperada,"Plans over what to do with Nazi leadership were debated between the Allied leadership and shifted throughout the course of the war. I don't believe its truly possible to definitively state that any single course of action would have been planned and followed through had Hitler been taken alive. While the Moscow Declaration of 1943 did state that punishment for crimes with no specific geographic locale would be handled jointly by the Allied powers, this could be open to interpretation. As the Red Army reached Berlin significantly before the other Allied powers, if Hitler we're alive he would have surely been under Soviet custody. Whether Stalin would claim that the extreme Soviet losses in the course of the war gave a specific geographic locale for (many of) Hitler's crimes and thus allowed themselves to take charge in meting out punishment is a highly likely possibility, it cannot be positively concluded. 

As for what the specific punishment would have been, as I previously mentioned the thoughts of the Allied leadership on the matter of general post-victory punishment shifted as the war progressed and concluded. There was disagreement over how to punish Nazis generally upon the war's conclusion at the Tehran Conference in 1943. The intent of Stalin (who would have had custody of Hitler) at the conference can be seen in his suggestion to simply summarily execute roughly 50,000 German officers. A simple summary execution (whether under official Red Army auspices or more akin to the fate of Muammar Gaddafi), is certainly one likely possibility. Although the other Allied leaders were somewhat less bloodthirsty than Stalin in their thinking regarding the punishment of Nazi leadership, immediately executing Hitler and definitely ending the war in Europe is a likely scenario.

On the note of trials, it is highly unlikely that Hitler would have been prosecuted by the German people. The judiciary of Germany was comprised just about exclusively of Nazi party members. The only Germans who could even theoretically prosecute Hitler somewhat reliably would have been those with communist leanings, which simply puts the ball into Stalin's court regardless. Were a trial to be held under strictly Soviet custody, there is absolutely no doubt that the event would be a show trial in Moscow leading to inevitable execution. If Stalin were instead to abide by the previous arrangement for joint decision making on the punishment of Nazi leadership, Hitler would have been tried jointly by the Allies at Nuremburg or potentially separately at a unique trial for himself alone. It should be noted that, essentially, all roads lead to execution. Any plans for the Denazification of Germany would have been seriously hampered by Hitler still being alive. The risk of Hitler returning, being freed, or acting as a living figurehead for a potential resurgence of Nazism would simply be too great. The only real questions are the exact method leading up to execution, and the extent of involvement from Truman and Churchill in it.

The TLDR: Post-war plans for the Nazi leadership in general differed between the Allied leadership.

Qweniden,"Lets look at wine first:

Wine for most of history was not ""aged"" per se.  Though there were some exceptions, the goal for most producers of wine were to get the product to market and sold before the harvest of the next year.  This is because before the advent of the combination of the glass bottle, a cork stopper and sulfites as a preservative wine would simply spoil within a year.  So aging was a bad thing for most of wine's history.

In the 18th century the above mentioned technological advances all came together and people (particularly the British) started developing a taste for aged wine.  But it was the consumer who would age the wine after purchasing so that there were no large capital costs borne by the growers or middlemen merchants.

So TLDR: growers and merchants did not have to age the product when that style was desirable/possible. It was the consumer who would age their own wines.

Whiskey:

As popular tastes transformed and the consumers wanted whiskeys that gained the flavors, colors and concentration that barrel aging brings there was already an existing base of manufactures that were turning out whiskeys to be drank young.  Since they were existing companies backed by wealthy families with cashflow already coming in it would not have been too difficult to capitalize the aging process.  When distilleries did need more capital than they could get via sales-driven cash flow there would have been banks to lend the money for operating costs just like any business would have access to.

In the battle of Stalingrad, some civilians escaped or were evacuated before fighting reached the city, but the vast majority were not allowed to leave until the battle was well underway. This caused thousands of civilian casualties.

The presence of civilians added some interesting elements to the battle for Stalingrad. While many did remain in hiding as much as possible, they still needed to leave for food, water, and other necessities. Some were forced into serving the German attackers. Others fought against the Germans as part of irregular forces. 

At least one German soldier actually used the presence of the civilians to gain a (temporary) tactical advantage: he dressed up as an old woman in order to gather water at a stream each day; while gathering water, he observed Soviet positions, which allowed him to serve as a sort of spotter for German artillery.

dolan0,"Her position only makes sense when you consider the circumstances that the French were in; when they turned to Jeanne, they were essentially out of ideas. Turning to her was either an act of desperate faith, or a last-ditch effort to improve morale by turning the conflict into a religious war. Even then, with their backs against the wall, the French nobility proceeded very cautiously.

Her claim of divine guidance, and the miraculous stories associated with her, garnered a great deal of support among the peasantry. After being rebuffed by the royal court several times, she impressed a couple minor nobles who got her an audience with a count, at which she correctly predicted the outcome of the Battle of the Herrings. That scored her an audience with the Dauphin, who sent her to be examined by the religious authorities (if she proved heretical, the political fallout would have been disastrous.)

With a clean bill of orthodoxy, they sent her to the Siege of Orleans, which proved to be the turning point of the war. Historians disagree about her actual command role, but as a symbol, she was certainly important.

white_light-king,"Navigation, meaning specifically finding where you are and how to get where you want to go, at sea was rather difficult, but the ""book learning"" involved in navigation wasn't extensive.  You might think of 18th century navigation as having three skill groups:

1) Book learning, which would comprise the ability to read, ability to do arithmetic, geometry and a specific subset called spherical trigonometry used for celestial navigation.

2) Practical techniques for navigation.  How to take a sun or star sighting (to determine latitude) how to measure speed with a log line.  How to read a nautical chart, and how to make one, etc.  

3) Seamanship, understanding currents, leeway, weather, how the sea and land interact and so forth.  This would help a navigator estimate how much error could be introduced into his navigation from real world stuff.

James Cook went to sea as a teenager in colliers (ships that carry coal off the English and Scottish coast.)  I believe before he went to see he had already received enough education to read and do arithmetic.  He spent five or more years picking up the practical elements of navigation (points 2 and 3.)  Picking up the book learning was relatively easy given Cook's interest and aptitude because it's not really all that much math.  In modern times it's basically just what we call ""high school math.""  In the 18th century it wasn't often taught as a matter of routine, so it'd require a self-motivated, curious student who could afford the books and had the spare time.

So to sum up, the book learning part is relatively easy if you had a basic early education.  The practical techniques are relatively easy and would be taught to promising sailors routinely as an apprenticeship.  But mastery requires a good amount of experience of all the things that can go wrong At Sea.

DaphneDK,"Suetonius describes Nero in some detail. Although he wrote quite a time after his death, so it may have been inaccurate. Some of the physical features may also have been deliberately invented by Suetonius to illustrate moral lessons.

""[Nero] was about the average height, his body marked with spots and malodorous, his hair light blond, his features regular rather than attractive, his eyes blue and somewhat weak, his neck over thick, his belly prominent, and his legs very slender. His health was good, for though indulging in every kind of riotous excess, he was ill but three times in all during the fourteen years of his reign, and even then not enough to give up wine or any of his usual habits. He was utterly shameless in the care of his person and in his dress, always having his hair arranged in tiers of curls, and during the trip to Greece also letting it grow long and hang down behind; and he often appeared in public in a dining-robe, with a handkerchief bound about his neck, ungirt and unshod.""

vonadler,"Generally, things were in Malmö as they were in the rest of Sweden - tense at times, relaxed at times.

At the time, there was no brigde and few that worked on the other side of the Sound. Those that did were mostly involved in ferry traffic, coastal shipping or fishing.

How would life look in Malmö? Let's take a look.

As the war broke out on the 3rd of September 1939, Sweden declared itself neutral, and the Prime Minister, Per-Albin Hansson of the Social Democrats declared in a speech on the radio that ""our readiness is good"". Which was a lie concerning the military, but true regarding food and raw materials. Generally, most people in Sweden expected a repetition of ww1, which had left the Nordic countries (with exception of Finland towards the end) untouched. The problems facing Sweden then had been the British blockade, a lack of food and raw materials creating hunger and unemployment, combined with a political fight for universal suffrage and parliamentarism that almost ended up in a revolution 1917.

1939, the situation was much better. The framework of neutral shipping through the blockade had been agreed upon with both the British and the Germans, and a small number of merchant vessels, 459 in total, were allowed through, bringing in much needed meat and grain (from Canada, USA, Brazil and Argentina primarily), oil (from Venezuela) and a small amount of tobacco (from USA) and some other goods. 10 ships were sunk by both sides, mostly by mines during this traffic. There were also large stockpiles of food, raw materials and other goods in storage in Sweden.

Malmö was (and is) the 3rd largest city of Sweden and an industrial and economical centre. Malmö was also the centre of the fledgling (and pretty pathetic) Swedish nazi movement. Gunnar Sträng, social democrat and future Minister of Finance recounts meeting a bunch of nazis at a hotel, and noting that when making death lists (while rowdy and quite drunk) prominent social democrats ended up on the list AFTER prominent nazis of the competing party. The various nazi groups gathered 0,7% of the vote 1936, which was the best result they managed to get. Generally, the city was dominated by the social democrats.

Generally, the Swedes never forgave the Germans for their invasion of Denmark and Norway, and the willingness to defend the country against a German invasion was very high.

The rationing was hard during the war, and dropped to its lowest point in autumn 1942, when it consisted of;

Per day allowance;

22g meat and pork.

67g sugar.

4g cheese.

36g fat (oil, butter, cream etc).

3g coffee.

170g flour.

One also gets 8 eggs per month.

Vegetables, milk (3% fat), potatoes, wild game, fish, fruit and berries were never rationed. However, vegetables are impossible to get out of season, and mostly consists of what can be grown locally - turnips, cabbage and carrots, with some cucumbers and tomatoes thrown in. Milk and potatoes are readily available. Wild game is only available during the hunting season, and in limited supply - you had to know a hunter to get any. Fish was available as long as the sea was open (which was 8-10 months a year, depending on if you were in the Baltic or North Sea and which of the hard war winters it was) and you were reasonable close to the coast. Fruit was available during the season, and only locally grown - mostly pears and apples, but also some cherries. Berries you had to pick yourself in season.

Scania would have decent access to Baltic fish and to fruit (pear and apple orchards are common), but far less wild game and berries than other parts of the country. ""Non-coupon"" food became common. Eating badger, fox or crow stew at the restaurant (since it counted as wild game and was not rationed) was not uncommon.

Having a friend at a farm could allow you to buy meat and other food that had been sneaked away from the ration system - the black market thrived. There were also a substantial market for trading rations - thsoe that did not smoke often traded away their tobacco ration to those that did, for clothes, food, coffee or other rations.

All rubber and petroleum products were reserved for the military, and most cars were confined to storage. Some ran their cars on produced gas, burning charcoal and using wooden tires. So did much of the army, and the air force ran its older planes on a 85% ethanol 15% gasoline mix and castor oil for lubrication. I have met a ground technician who worked on the light bombers running this mix, and he stated that the castor oil fermented in the hot engine and smelled so bad the pilots puked in the cockpit. His laconic statement was ""Those planes were no fun to work on.""

Alcohol was rationed since before the war. A man could get up to 1 litre of *brännvin* (vodka) per month, Weak beer (3,5%) could be had at shops or restaurants, while stronger beer was only available by doctor's note from a drugstore. At a restaurant, one could only have strong spirits with food, ""two whites and a brown"" which meant two 5cl vodka shots and 5cl of cognac with the coffee. ""Weak grog"" was also available, 3cl of vodka or cognac mixed with 33cl of soft drink or fizzy water, max two per visit. It was common to send the food, called the ""paragraph sandwhich"" back and get the money back after ordering. It is said the same portion of food could be served hundreds of times during one evening. Women had half the ration on everything compared to men.

People biked and walked far more, and the city was under curfew, or blackdown, meaning that accidents were more common. Crime also went up.

Socially, it was a time of upheaval. The unemployment which had existed before the war dissapeared practically overnight. To replace coal and coke, which could only be had in limited supply from Germany (as opposed to liberal and cheap from Britain before the war) charcoal was made in enormous quantities, and the cities filled up with large piles of firewood - armies of men and regiments of women (to handle cooking and cleaning for a work team) travelled to the forests to cut down the trees needed for this. Large amounts of men were called into the army - In May 1940, 400 000 men were in the field, in September 1943, 300 000. The army never had less than 100 000 men called in during any time of the war. Add local defence meets (small exersises for the older soldiers), home guard training and the requirements of the military for production, and the civilian market suddenly experienced a lack of labour.

House servants had been common before the war, paying a miniscule pay and providing food and boarding were enough to have several young girls applying for a maid position. However, with *Lottakåren*, the women's auxiliary services, regular work with the men absent, office work with the huge administration around rationing etc, young women could find other positions. House servants pretty much disappeared during the war, and never really returned afterwards.

Another group that pretty much ceased to be during the war was *statare*, a position of farm labourer where the pay was had in goods from the farm, where contracts were signed for a year. Generally, these people could not save up, had deplorable living conditions and only a single week per year to switch estate at which they were employed - with the lack of savings, this was usually impossible, making this position eerily like that of a serf. However, during the war other jobs were available and when paying in produce was forbidden in 1945, the group had already almost ceased to exist, with many of them movin gto the cities to take jobs in the industry or to the forests to work with lumber (both of which was paid in money).

A Malmö citizen would most likely serve in one of the local regiments, I6 Norra Skånska Regementet (infantry), I7 Södra Skånska Regementet (infantry), A3 Wendes Artilleriregemente (artillery), A10M/Lv4 Skånska Luftvärnskåren (anti-aircraft), F10 Kungliga Skånska Flygflottiljen (fighters) were all part of the Scanian local regiments. If he was older than 47, he would serve in the local defence, and probably man one of the 1 063 bunkers of the 500km long Per-Albin Line that protected coast of Scania (which mostly was soft sand beaches suitable for a landing). He could also serve at one of the emplaced batteries (Batteri Helsingborg, Batteri Viken, Batteri Trelleborg and Batteri Ystad, each with 4x21cm guns). People with work vital to the war effort (such as on the railroads, the tank factory at Landskrona, ammunition factory etc) would not be called up after their initial conscription, but rather placed in the local Home Guard at their place of work.",null,4,cdm1c3n,1racc5,askhistorians,top_week,12

Worse, they had the reserves of manpower to back that up. At a pinch, they would free slaves, recruit gladiators, give privileges to allied cities, admit subject peoples to citizenship - anything to stamp new legions out of the earth and *fight on*.

They're quite large though - It took me about 30-40 minutes to download the 6 volumes of the 7th session of the 12th Parliament in 1917, covering 18 January to 20 September. It's 3.7 GB. Took me about five minutes to search and find that Vimy - where the Canadian national war memorial is located - is mentioned 70 times, but Hill 70 where famous Canadian General Arthur Currie wanted to place the war monument is mentioned... 0 times.  He believed Hill 70 was actually a greater accomplishment than Vimy in terms of the Canadian soldier tactical and operational success.  This suggests why it was probably never going to be built there if no one even mentioned it.

intangible-tangerine,"The word for Iran and Iranians inside Iran itself has been Iran and Iranian or variations thereof such as Arya, Iranshah or Aryānām at least since the time of the collation of the Zorastrian Avesta texts, dated roughly between the 2nd and 6th centuries BC. 

""xšviwi.išvatəmō airyanąm""
“most swift-arrowed of the Aryas. (Yasht, Hymn no 8, verse 6) 

It also occurs in the Achaemenid inscriptions of the latter part of that era.

The word was not historically limited to modern Iran and was used broadly in the wider region as a self descritive adjective for various peoples. 


See this related thread on the etymology of the word 'Aryan' and its use through history http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dh1er/i_am_an_iranianpersian_and_have_a_question_about/ 


The word 'Persian' and its variations was in use in Old and Middle Persian but within Iran it referred to people from Persis (modern day Fars Province). It was the Greeks who carried the word 'Persian' to the West where it came to stand for the whole of Iran and not just a single region.

An analogy may be made between the modern common confusion between 'Hollland' and 'The Netherlands.'

Exile was the most common form of punishment for aristocrats since the Middle Ages, simply because it avoided the messy political problems of having to kill someone important.

Improved technology and increased speeds of communication had begun to invalidate the distance, and thus security and effectiveness, provided through exile.

In the case of Napoleon this is an especially important note because his exile is a tacit admission of his status and clout. However it is always a controversial topic because he technically *was not* a noble by birth or blood, and *could* have been killed like any other insurrectionary leader. However he *was* crowned emperor by the Pope. So it leads into understandably complex waters about his political status, and whether or not he meets the requisite protections of the ruling status-quo.

In deciding his fate, the Congress of Vienna was very conscious of the implications that his legacy would have upon the development of France, so recently removed from their Revolutionary Spirit of the 1790's. They ultimately decided to try and avoid making Napoleon into a martyr, and exiled him. In doing so, however, the European nations essentially reaffirmed the values of meritocracy by which Napoleon rose to the title of Emperor when they treated him as an equal instead of as a low-born peasant.

The most recent executions of a head of state were Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette and the last thing the Concert of Europe wanted was another French Revolution. As can be shown by the battle of Waterloo, Napoleon still had many allies and supporters in France and his death may have incited a rebellion. 

The Concert of Europe and the Congress of Vienna wanted a stable, compliant France which is why they reinstated the Bourbon dynasty though a nephew (or some other relation). Napoleon's power and influence did not dissipate with his exile though. A few decades down the line, his **nephew**, Napoleon III ascended the throne.

archaeontologist,"The huge stores (Target, Walmart, etc.) that we all know and love today are the offspring of the department store, which as a phenomena really began to appear in Great Britain, France, and the United States in the 1840s and 50s. 

Huge stores need both 1) relatively cheap, mass produced goods to fill them and 2) a growing social class with the means and patterns of consumption to support them. The first of these requirements was enabled by the industrial revolution and novel technologies for producing and distributing goods at remarkable paces/prices. The second is a result of the rising bourgeois society of mid-19th c. Western Europe, a class whose disposable income and consumption habits (concerned not only with necessity but also with fashion &amp; novelty) enabled the 'retail revolution' of the department stores.

Thus the rise of the department store was both an economic and a social development beginning in the mid-19th century, centered around W. Europe's new practices of production, distribution and consumption. That's about all I know - I wish I could tell you more, as it's a really fascinating subject.

I can, however, recommend a work of fiction that can give you insight into this period:

* Émile Zola, *The Ladies' Paradise* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992).

This novel, published in 1883, is a story of commercial triumph chronicling just this topic - the rise of the Parisian department store. Zola is well known today for his more political naturalist works (on coal miners, etc.) and his role in the Dreyfus affair. However, this lesser-known novel has recently gained a healthy amount of attention for its depictions of consumer capitalism and bourgeois life in the mid-19th century - this latest edition from the University of California Press has a fantastic introduction written by Kristin Ross, the literary critic and French cultural historian (also, the author of the excellent *The Emergence of Social Space: Rimbaud and the Paris Commune* and *Fast Cars, Clean Bodies: Decolonization and the Reordering of French Culture*, both of which I thoroughly recommend).

rosemary85,"Here I was imagining Ambarenya was going to answer this... and then I see you're the one that posted it!

To get a *really* authoritative answer to this you'd probably need to ask someone like Geoff Horrocks directly. Until I started reading up on this question, my understanding had been that from late antiquity onwards, the phonology of Greek was essentially the same as Modern Greek. That would make 

* κατάφρακτοι = ka-TA-frak-tee

* Ῥωμαίοι = ro-MEH-ee

But for each diphthong, it turns out, you need to do a separate check to see how and when its pronunciation changed. Allen's *Vox Graeca* has this to say about οι (p. 77):

&gt; **οι** &amp;nbsp; Here also a diphthongal pronunciation is clearly indicated at least until Roman times... At a later date οι became confused with υ; thus (c. 240 AD) ποιανεψιωνα = πυαν[εψιωνα], indicating a pronunciation [ū] for both...

This reduces the question to how υ was pronounced in any given period. At p. 64 Allen tells us that confusion between υ and ι started fairly early on -- they were already confused in Indo-Greek coins by the 2nd century BCE (but only because Indo-Aryan didn't have a rounded front vowel), and even in the 4th cent. BCE we find ἥμυσυ for ἥμισυ in one inscription. But he finds these to be isolated cases, and concludes that υ was still not fully equivalent to ι until at least after the 4th cent. CE (because Wulfila/Ulfilas was still using y to transliterate Greek υ at that date). He goes on (p. 65)

&gt; Confusion of υ with ι is first occasionally found in Egyptian papyri of the 2-3 c. AD, but this is probably a regional peculiarity; and the eventual change of [ü] to [i] seems not to be general until around the end of the millennium. The Byzantine naming of the letter as ὗ ψιλόν still suggests a pronunciation [ü]; for ψιλός is commonly used by Byzantine writers as the opposed term to δίφθογγος, and so in this case to distinguish the spelling υ from οι (which had come to have the same phonetic value: cf. p. 76 on ἒ ψιλόν), and not from ι.

So the upshot seems to be that, perhaps until the time of Photios or thereabouts, οι was pronounced identically to υ; **but** both were still distinguished from ι. That is, ι was unrounded, but οι/υ was still at least somewhat rounded.

**Edit.** I've taken a look at Horrocks' *Greek: a history of the language*, and he's in good agreement with Allen (though his book is a lot harder to find your way around, because it's arranged chronologically rather than by topic). At p. 168 he mentions in passing the merger of οι and υ in the Roman era, and at p. 274 he writes

&gt; The shift of /y/ &gt; /i/, already apparent in some substandard varieties in the ancient world, was probably completed for all speakers of mainstream dialects by the 10th/11th century (see Macharadze (1980) for the evidence of Georgian loans, and cf. Browning (1983: 56-7)). The major exception is provided by Tsakonian...

**Edit 2.** The above only deals with one part of your question, of course. Can I leave it to you to look at the books I mentioned for the other points? In particular I'll mention that the phonetic value of β in Byzantine Greek is a bit hazy: it was used to transcribe Latin *b*, of course, but sometimes also *v* (e.g. Malalas is already writing Vergil's name as Βεργίλλιος by the 6th century; cf. Οὐαλέριος for *Valerius*; perhaps this really reflects variance in the Latin pronunciation of *v*, though). I don't know when it lost the value /b/ (in Modern Greek /b/ is usually represented by μπ).",null,2,cdl4kra,1ra00f,askhistorians,top_week,10
Spinoza42,"1) Stunned to be given such importance. Most people don't think historiography really matters.

2) I think to a considerable degree the reverse is true. A living person is guaranteed a certain minimal level of scrutiny and care, while a person dead, especially long dead, can be used to tell whatever story you're trying to tell, regardless of the exact facts of his life.

3) Sometimes a person can have so many secrets that it might be safer to write a ""true"" history of them later, without fears of repercussions. So there might indeed be a chilling effect of litigation and prosecution that people would try to avoid. But the problems of looking back through time in my opinion are more severe than that. And in the digital age anonymous publication should not be a problem. 

4) It definitely has had an effect. As a teacher I was often conscious that my statements should not be too controversial, regardless of what I believed. But political interpretations way heavy on some events of the past as well. Topics like the holocaust, crusades, labor union movement, in the US the Civil War are as capable of stirring up political controversy as the life of a living figure like George Bush.

Altogether I think it's a cop out, whether he is aware of that or not. If any human can judge his fellow man fairly and accurately, it's his contemporaries.

lukeweiss,"What stuff are you referring to? What kind of manufacturing? and, when?

From the 11th Century onward, China was the single largest manufacturing economy in the world, with Porcelain and raw/finished silks leading the way. The silk industry was mostly household, but the Porcelains were often produced in massive factories, and could be gathered easily for export, as exemplified in the Zheng He voyages. If you are referring to any of the intervening time and/or the modern day, the answers stem from the Song Dynasty period referenced above.   

So, how do we answer your questions? Well, here goes:   

1. Population. to make a lot of stuff, you need a lot of people. China's population has been the largest under one organized government for about 2200 years, with small interruptions that grew lesser over the centuries. By 600 CE, the population was around 50-60million. 1100, we are talking twice that. Some dips due to plague and wars only delayed the inevitable - 15th century Ming populations were around 120-130million, and the Qing began their reign over a population of roughly 150million. from 1650-1800 this population as much as doubled. That's right, the population of China in 1800 was pretty close to that of the US TODAY. So, lots of people, lots of potential.  

2. Commerce, ingenuity, entrepreneurship.  

China underwent what several economic historians have described as not one, but two commercial revolutions. The first took place under the Song, in the 10th-13th centuries. The Song were the first to successfully use fiat money, which didn't last forever, but still, cash money in the 11th century! One of the other elements of most dynastic governments was low-tax, relatively laisse-faire economic policy. Sure there were occasionally government industries/monopolies, but they were fewer and fewer as time went on. For instance, Ming officials set up a taxation depository for all salt produced in the empire. Salt would pour in to the depots, then would be picked up by private distributors, the government pulling in their tax haul in the process. This was no small endeavor, with all but three provinces producing salt in some form or another at the time.   
Anyway, most industries were small and non-governmental, many un-taxed and/or regulated. What this meant was an explosion, with the population bursts in all three of the last dynasties, of commerce. In the Song, the big new thing was Champa rice, and the big cultural thing was book culture (printing and champa rice were introduced around the same time, at the end of the 10th century). In the Ming, there was the burst of international trade and later, the influx of new world crops. The Qing saw the full flowering of new world crops, and also saw the malthusian rise (to 1800 or so) and fall (1800-1900 crisis) that inevitably followed.   
Throughout all this you have this incredible ingenius flow of new goods and technologies, from mining, to fired goods, to arms and artillery, to paper, household furniture, etc, etc, etc. With low government oversight, and the emergence of national markets for goods, we are talking about lots and lots and lots of diverse ""stuff"" made by lots of diverse people.   
This is the smithian dream. A government that focuses on infrastructure, and low-targetted taxation. An economy dominated by small businesses with national market outlook. Pretty incredible.   
Anyway, that leads us to the last 113 years. What happened to China that we think the last 30 are anomolous?    
Well, there was the major crisis of about 1840-1950 - loss of crops, wars, famine, bad policy, lost wars with Britain and Japan, several times, etc, etc, etc. Then there was some upsurge, quickly knocked to the side by Mao and the great leap. This caused the famine that informed all of our opinions about china who grew up in the 60's-80's - poor, starving china.   
But then a funny thing happened - the party decided to revert to dynastic economic practices, to a certain extent. They unleashed the economic forces that lay dormant for almost two generations. The result - you guessed it - lots and lots of stuff!",null,1,cdl59wp,1r9wht,askhistorians,top_week,4

Most of what happened was verified. A few things the scholars questioned was that they didn't think that slaves in that area were regularly whipped to the extent described in the book, since it would detract from their value and decrease the amount of work they were able to do. But this doesn't mean they weren't whipped really severely, even being whipped to death. The severe whipping that the slave Patsey is subjected to in the movie is straight from the book and there's no reason to doubt it is true as described. There are plenty of instances of slaves being whipped to death in the historical record, and we've got lots of photos of slaves whose backs are covered in whipping scars.

Astrogator,"That is an extremely convoluted and complicated question, if simply for the fact that the Romans conquered a ton of native civilizations over more than five centuries. 

First, your question is already making a few assumptions, for example that the Romans were being less advanced than the civilizations they conquered. They were evidently more advanced militarily if they could conquer as many of them as they did, just for a start. There are so many cultural and social differences between the people that became part of the Roman Empire that it is really useless to make such a claim in the first place. Then, how would you measure advancement? How would you measure destruction of advancement? Knowledge in general doesn't easily get destroyed. And the Romans were pretty good assimilators. 

The most amazing thing to me is that they managed to mold it all into an Empire in the first place. The institutions were simply not there when the Empire expanded as rapidly as it did during the two centuries around the year 1. They had to find new ways of administrating the conquered territories, and to integrate them, and in the beginning, they often failed, evidenced by the countless local revolts. The Pannonians (then part of Illyricum), after being freshly conquered, revolted *every year* for ten years straight until the Romans could pacify them. 
Generally, established political and economic structures, where they already existed, were kept after conquest, integrating the local established elite into the new provincial organization, quickly making them Roman citizens and thus depriving possible resistance groups of leadership (ideally, of course). Those leaders could, in time, rise to equestrian or senatorial rank. Others acquired citizenship by service in the auxiliary troops, and many did. Being part of the Empire meant a rise in opportunities for a lot of people, particularly as soldiers or traders. 

The amazing thing is that by the end of the second century AD, all these natives had become Romans after a fashion, some more, some less quickly, and by 212 every freeborn inhabitant of the Empire became a *cives Romanus* by decree of the Emperor. The nature of this process is debated. It has been seen as a process of Rome imposing her values on newly conquered natives, making them 'Roman', stressing the active Roman part. Other interpretations, influenced by postcolonialism, have put the natives in the foreground, stressing the process of emulation and mutual influence of the different cultural traditions, evident for example in Religion, where Romans added local deities into their pantheon (interpretatio romana). The debate has not ended, and there are a lot more nuances to consider. 

To the matter of improving lives: I'll again talk about Pannonia. Before the Romans came, it was the place of devastating wars and tribal feuds. When the Boii, a celctic tribe who had carved themselves a little empire on the lower Danube around modern Bratislava and Vienna, were defeated by the Dacian king Burebista in the first century, they were defeated so resoundingly that their empire vanished, they became subject to the neighbouring Norii, and their lands became known to Pliny as the ""boian desert"" (*deserta boiorum*). The Boii themselves had only come to Pannonia from Bohemia after evading the pressure of Germanic tribes from the north. This is an example of Rome really bringing *pax romana*, a measure of stability. Those people had been roving around Central Europe for two centuries, I think they might have welcomed a period of safety and prosperity. There is the simple rise of material culture during Roman times in the archaeological record that directly shows a rise in prosperity. Houses, cities being built, coins hoarded, decorations made, beautiful villae being built in the countryside and so on. 

There's no saying whether it 'generally' improved the lives of the conquered. Many died during the conquest, many more died in revolts. There was a lot more social mobility, and while evidence for upwards mobility is easy to come by, there is circumstantial evidence for downward mobility as well. The trend to set messages in stone soared during the first and second centuries, possibly marking a desire to set ones achievements in stone as well, showing a sense of insecurity, guarding them against possible future misfortunes. People were proud of having become Roman citizens, proud of having become successful soldiers, traders, priests, mayors, magistrates or otherwise members of the local elite. Others were proudly showing off their cultural heritage in a new Roman context, wearing their traditional clothes or ornaments, women often more so than the men. In some places, the Romans learned new technologies and cultural practices from those they conquered, in some they brought things that had never been seen before. In the East, Latin never replaced Greek as the lingua franca, and hellenic cultural tradition was always dominant over Romes. But I'd say they surely improved the lives of some, maybe the majority. 

After reading your question again, I think your discussion partner might hace been talking about the myth surrounding the burning of the library of Alexandria, since that one is pretty popular. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1nqrl0/carl_sagan_the_library_of_alexandria_and_the/) a pretty amusing deconstruction of a particular version of that myth.

AlextheXander,"To provide another viewpoint than the one very eloquently and accurately put forth by Astrogator let me recommend '[An Imperial Posession: Britain in the Roman Empire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Imperial-Possession-Britain-Penguin-History/dp/0140148221/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385213657&amp;sr=1- 1&amp;keywords=an+imperial+possession+britain+in+the+roman+empire)' by the archaeologist David Mattingly. Its a few years since i've read it and it was before i began studying Archaeology so my summary of his books is sparse and unprofessional. 

One of his central points is that Rome, historically in Academia, has been exempt from the otherwise scathing critique of Imperial power structure. Where we tend to see Empires as constructs of Exploitaiton and Subjugation we've viewed The Roman Empire in a much more benign light. Even going so far as to believe Roman occupation a positive force in the regions they conquered. 

David Mattingly essentially tries to put the 'E' back in Empire and paints a picture of an Empire mainly interested in the natural resources to be exploited in Britain with little regard for the local people. To facilitate this, Rome adopted a policy of allying with the local Elite because this, more or less, ensured the pasification of the native lower classes. 

Mattingly covers a lot more besides an analysis of Empire. He goes into great detail to, archaeologically, describe the lives of stationed roman soldiers and Urban/rural dwellers. I highly recommend the book if you're interested in a take on Rome's influence on the regions under its dominion. ",null,0,cdl5lbg,1r9mqu,askhistorians,top_week,5
King_of_Men,"&gt; apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order... what have the Romans done for us? 

I know joke answers are not permitted, but I'm making a serious point, as was the movie: The Romans really did build a lot of infrastructure. In Britain, their roads were still in use (because after some centuries of entropy they were *still* the best ones around!) as late as the reign of King Alfred. Infrastructure tends to be underrated, but it's *really important*. They also put down bandits and pirates, and made the Med (plus Britain) into a single trade zone for the first time; consider all the benefits of globalisation, without the problems caused by it happening in a single century and not giving people time to adjust. 

It's true that the Romans were unlikely to introduce much *technology*, per se, to a conquered people; but that's not the only form of being advanced. There was a hell of a lot of capital investment going on, which likely would not have occurred in the patchwork of tribes and cities that you, presumably, get in the counterfactual world where Rome did not exist. 

I suggest that, in measuring ""improved lives"", scholarship tends to be highly overrated, partly because the people doing the rating are themselves scholars. The average peasant was perhaps not likely to care whether the Romans introduced a lot of new philosophy or not; in fact he was unlikely to hear about it if they did. On the other hand, a road that would let him bring his produce to the big market in town, for a much improved price - not to mention participating in a money economy so he could buy stuff from the other side of the Med! - that was a big, visible improvement.

Rome was indeed an incredible city - it was the largest city in the ancient world (with the possible exception of a Chinese city - I'm not terribly well versed in the Far East), and had the grandeur to match up. However, what *Gladiator* doesn't show is that most of Rome wasn't exactly grand. The city was filthy, disorganized, and one of the first great, documented instances of pollution is shown (The Tiber River was Rome's sewage outflow) - which the Romans responded to by building their famed aqueducts (The first one is generally assigned to 312 BCE).

One of the biggest things that *Gladiator* doesn't bother showing is that disorganization that I mentioned earlier. In Rome, many streets weren't named, houses were unnumbered/named, and the vast majority of the populace lived in cramped tenement housing known as *insulae*.

To take your questions in reverse order:

San Juan de Tenochtitlan (as it was known in the early colonial era) was not fortified during the early period of Spanish rule. It was, in fact, widely depopulated and almost abandoned in the first few decades after the Conquest. Notably, Cortés opted to base himself in nearby [Cuauhnahuac/Cuernavaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Cort%C3%A9s,_Cuernavaca). Tenochtitlan, at the end of the 3 month siege by the combined forces of the Tlaxcalans, Texcocoans, Spanish, and other indigenous groups, was virtually destroyed. In part this was a result of the Mexica themselves tearing up the city to build barricades and breastworks as the siege wore on, but was largely a result of the Spanish/Indian tactics during the latter part of the siege.

**The Siege**

The Siege of Tenochtitlan really had two phases: a long hard slog across the causeways onto the city proper and the subsequent advance of the allied forces across the city, forcing the Mexica back into a defensive position in Tenochtitlan's sister city, Tlatelolco. [Here's a map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Tenochtitlan-medium.png/725px-Tenochtitlan-medium.png), to help with the making of sense of things.

The causeway portion of the siege was mostly typified by a cat-and-mouse game between the brigantines the Spanish shipbuilder Martín López had put together (that such an expert was on the expedition at all was a *huge* boon to the Spanish, see their attempt at building a catapult). The Mexica used ambush tactics and placed stakes in the shallow waters of Lake Texcoco to restrict the movement of the deeper draft brigantines. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who accompanied Cortés and ended up writing what is the definitive Conquistador account, best describes the early part of the causeway slog thusly:

&gt; When we left a bridge or barricade unguarded after having captured it with much labour, the enemy would retake and deepen it that same night, and construct stronger defences^1

Eventually though, the combined forces of the Spanish and the numerous indigenous allies ground down the Mexica, and the Spanish reached the outskirts of the city. The problem the Spanish faced in the streets of Tenochtitlan was that they were unable to effectively deploy their most powerful weapons, cavalry and they were also open ambushes and attack from the rooftops of buildings. They solved this problem via the tactics they had developed on the causeways: filling in canals and pulling down buildings. Essentially, the Spanish and their allies systematically destroyed the city as they advanced across it. 

This passage, again from BDdC, is from when the Spanish were still advancing across the causeway, but contemplating how to further their advance into the city. It shows the debate of tactics, and which ones were ultimately adopted, since Cortés ended up suffering a huge defeat (and almost getting captured) by *not* following the advice below:

&gt; ... [S]ome of us said it was not good avice to or a good idea to intrude ourselves so entirely into the heart of the City, but we should remain as we were, fighting and **pulling down and levelling the houses**

**~~Quick~~ Post-Siege Wrap-Up**

After Cuauhtemoc was captured the immediate war against the Mexica essentially ended, though resistance by both Mexica loyalists and groups not wishing to transfer the allegiance continued. The twin city of Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco, however, was devastated. The main aqueduct into the city had been cut early in the siege, a smallpox epidemic had ravaged the population, and the siege itself took place during harvest time, which meant that the urban population of Tenochtitlan was unable to get the rural agrarian products on which it relied. The city was a starving, thirsty, razed, and pestilent wasteland, in other words. Here's BDdC again:

&gt; I have read about the destruction of Jerusalem but I know not for certain if there was a greater mortality than this, for the greater number of the warriors from all the provinces and towns subject to Mexico who had crowded in [to the city] most of them died, and as I have already said, thus the land and the lake and the palisades were all full of dead bodies, and it stank so much that no one could endure it...

The Spanish would eventually rebuild the Chapultepec aqueduct (only to let it fall into disrepair) and make some other efforts to restore the city, but it would be centuries before it achieved the population level it had during the Pre-Hispanic period. Part of this had to do with the destruction and/or abandonment of indigenous hydraulic controls, which in the seasonally flooded Valley of Mexico led to some catastrophic events that almost caused the city itself to be abandoned. I wrote a little more in-depth about this in a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jxsq2/what_was_the_native_mexican_reaction_to_the/cbjuls6).

There was really no threat of invasion though. While the final battle between the Mexica and the Native/Spanish forces is often lumped together as the ""Siege of Tenochtitlan"" there were skirmishes and battles happening around the Lake Texcoco basin. The fall of the concentrated Mexica-aligned forces in Tlatelolco, however, was a significant enough blow to the loyalist forces, both in morale and real terms, to make resistance to the imposition of a new regime moot. Cuitlahuac, who preceded Cuauhtemoc for a few weeks before succumbing to smallpox, had actually made it a policy to condense the leadership of tributary states into Tenochtitlan. There are some interesting political reasons for this which are beyond the scope of your questions, but suffice to say that the fall of Tenochtitlan marked the end of real resistance. The Spanish had allied themselves with enough indigenous powers that they jointly controlled a significant amount of the Valley of Mexico even before the Siege.

There were no Chichimec invasions, or even a threat. The Aztecs^2 themselves were really the result of Chichimec migrations/invasions in the centuries after the fall of Teotihuacan. By the Aztec Imperial period though (early 15th Century), the region had sufficiently stabilized and urbanized to make the introgressions of semi-nomads from the North a moot point. Far more pertinent were the surrounding state actors like the Tarascans and Mixtec, who focused on their own sovereignty following the collapse of the political order (and widespread pestilence) rather than devising plans to conquer the Valley of Mexico.

**Pre-Hispanic Fortifications**

I actually wrote an entire post about [Post-Classic Mesoamerican sieges](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1coe7f/siege_warfare_in_precolombus_americas_how/c9ixz4h). The takeaway is that siege warfare was not a particularly prevalent part of the Aztec period and it's immediate fore-bearers. Wars were instead fought with vast numbers of troops drafted from the general population on a kind of seasonal basis. When the dry season (i.e., Winter) rolled around, armies would march. When the wet season resumed, those same troops would be needed for agricultural work. 

Siege warfare did occur, as I note in the previous post, but the real duty of pro-longed warfare fell to professional warriors (i.e., the nobility) during *xochiyaoyotin* (Flower Wars). These more ritualistic and governed combats allowed the professional warrior classes of the nobility to hone their skills; achieve status and honor through taking captives; and slowly grind down less extensive enemies, just as in a siege. For further reading on this (since it's a bit of a tangent at this point), I would recommend Hassig's *Aztec Warfare*, which is literally the book on the subject. 

**Answering Your Question, Finally**

Tenochtitlan was guarded not by walls, but by men (and lots of water). One thing to keep in mind about the rise of the Mexica is that is was explosive. In the early 1400s they were vassals to the Tepanecs on the Western shore of Lake Texcoco. By the mid 1400s, they had subjugated, or allied with, the entirety of the Basin of Mexico and were expanding outward. 

That the Aztec Empire was truly an alliance between the dominant group on the Western shores of Texcoco (the Tepanecs) and the dominant group on the Eastern shores of Texcoco (the Acolhua) with an upstart military power on an island between them explains a great deal. What it explains in this case is the lack of massive fortifications in Tenochtitlan proper. The city really expanded only after it had already secured the support of the biggest military and political powers in the region; it's threats were beyond the Valley of Mexico, not necessarily within it. And even when domestic conflicts arose, the fact that Tenochtitlan was located on an island accessible only by canoe or causeway, *and* that it grew to be the largest polity in the region by far, meant that routes to attack it were limited and its best defense was its people. Note above that Cortés main obstacle was simply making across the causeways to the city, which had been ravaged by disease, dehydration, and hunger. 

This is not to say the city was completely defenseless. The causeways themselves had sections would could be removed and towers and strong points which could be manned by troops. Tenochtitlan, however, was a city of canals, not walls. It was surrounded by both allies and a lake. It was the combination of regional revolt along with introduced diseases that worked to bring it down.

reddripper,"I think you are mistaken. There are plenty of similar fortifications in other places apart from in Europe.

In Arabia, we have city fortification, usually topped with a stronghold called al-qasr, which survived as place-names in Iberia as Alcazar. In oasis, local Arab clans built castles called qasbah as a secure living place, that function exactly like European castles, as it was used as refugee in times of nomads' raids. The Arabs also build fortified caravanserai to secure trade route, the best surviving of them are in Jordan. Fortifications in Arab worlds, both built by local families or by ruling dynasties, is today an important tourist destination in Morocco, Yemen and Oman.

In China, apart from the famous Great Wall, all major cities had fortification. The city wall in Xian is now one of well preserved. In Northern China, as most population during pre-modern era lived in big cities, local strongholds are rare, as the fortifications efforts were mostly directed toward the building of city walls. However in Southern China, where many people lived in hard to reach villages, and where conflict between clans or ethnic groups were common (for example, Hakka-Punti war), the local clan built rounded communal houses which provide protections against rival clans' attacks. This rounded houses are called tulou (土楼).

Also, I don't suppose I need to mention the well documented prevalence of Japanese castles, that is used by the local daimyo during the shogunates.  The Japanese also built several of this type of fortifications in Korea during their failed invasion.

Tiako,"To call ancient demography an art rather than a science is something of an insult to the rigor of art. Before the Middle Ages, for which we have government documents that help us determine the size of towns, we are largely dependent on archaeology to tell us how large settlements are. Because the archaeology of a settlement is very rarely complete, and even where it is we can not say for certain how many people lived in a given space, archaeologists rely on combining multiple different data sets to building a guess at how many people lived in a given settlement. This includes scarps of relevant ancient literature, scientific determinations of how productive the agriculture of a settlement's hinterland is, and a rather holistic method of seeing how much space is enclosed by a wall circuit and guessing the population density based on comparative evidence. It is all very uncertain, but this doesn't stop people from guessing, and these guesses can still be very intelligent.

Ian Morris, a prominent archaeologist of Greece, estimates a population of classical Athens at 35-40,000 inhabitants within the city of Athens, an perhaps a further 25,000 people living near the harbor of the Piraeus. Sparta is frustratingly difficult to work with. Due to its extensive imperial control of the countryside, some estimates put it at a roughly equal level, perhaps 40,000. However, literary evidence leads us to believe that the region was not extensively urbanized, and so the more likely model conceives of it as a large region made up of fairly conventional towns of no more 5-10,000 inhabitants.

Morris's article is available [free here](http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf) if you want to see the reasoning, though be aware it is involved in a set of debates you might not be interested in if you are just curious about populations levels.",null,1,cdkzhvo,1r9cni,askhistorians,top_week,14
T-mac2,"According to Victor Davis Hanson there were 40,000 adult-male-citizens in Athens at the start of the war and about 16,000 by the end. He also estimates (while mentioning that figures are difficult to obtain) that ""well over 100,000 Athenians of all classes (well apart from imperial subjects and allies) died as a direct result of the war...Attica [lost] an aggregate third of the population."" That would mean a population of around 300,000 for the region of Attica.

I think it is harder to find information on the Spartan losses (especially on non-Spartiates) but there were only ~1,500 Spartiates by Leuctra (371 BC).

Tiako,"As /u/nemtrif says, Marcus Aurelius was actually the first of the emperors to have a legitimate heir. All the others were forced by sheer biological necessity to adopt a son, and perhaps because all of them were really rather clever men, they tended to favor other rather clever men. It was an enormous stroke of good luck for the empire.

Remember that as much as it is often said that Rome had no clear line of succession, it tended to give very clear favoritism to biological descent. This makes for a rather complicated dissonance with the rather pragmatic ideology of the empire that tended to emphasize the emperor as an individual suited to the post by his individual qualities. This tended to lead to a great deal of murder and civil war and the like, but at least there were only a handful of boy-kings.",null,2,cdkzlaq,1r9clu,askhistorians,top_week,21

Without Ramones first UK tour there are about half a dozen prominent UK punk bands who probably wouldn't exist as they site that band and tour with their direct inspiration to start a band.

From the first paragraph of the Wikipedia entry on Ramones:

&gt;  Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the punk rock movement in both the United States and, *perhaps to a greater extent, in the United Kingdom.* 

(emphasis mine)

The UK scene can be credited with injecting a politcal (or just as often, faux or pseudo-political) energy as well as many of the fashion and stylistic elements (ransom note printing, etc.) associated with punk via Vivianne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren.

I must say I don't know as much about West Coast punk which was isolated compared to the NY and UK which were co-mingling quite a bit. Scenes where happening in LA and the Bay area, the midwest and DC scenes are also worth noting.

Eventually scenes popped up across the US, a DIY touring network of small town all ages venues that persisted even a punk slid from mainstream view but paved the way for the ""2nd wave"" in the 90s (Green Day, Blink) the Warped tour, etc.

*Punk Diary 1970-1979* by George Gilmarc (St. Martin's Press, may be out of print? I've seen it used and probably on amazon) is a good reference of the early UK scene.

The documentary ""Another State of Mind"" covers the early Southern California punk scene with a bit on DC and Steven Blush's *American Hardcore* (Feral House, 2001) is yet another ""oral history"" style text that pretty broad but captures a lot of perspectives.

backgrinder,"Fire ships. It's borderline for you, since it's really a tactical innovation. But fire ships could be a massive leveler. Henry Morgan used fire ships and deception at Maracaibo when he was trapped in an inland lagoon by a Spanish fleet. He was laughably outgunned, the Spanish fleets tender, a 10 gun ship had as many cannon as his flagship. Morgans vessels were small and configured to carry men and loot, not weapons platforms. The Spanish had 3 heavy galleons that should have destroyed him but he turned his flagship into a fireship and destroyed the Spanish fleet. 

 As far as your other examples they are all good, but they all probably require a little context. None of them are super weapons in the sense of using machine guns against cavemen armed with rocks and sticks. The Macedonian phalanx was strong, but in battle after battle it was Alexanders cavalry that broke the Persians. Stirrups and bows were useful inventions, but the Mongols were able to defeat enemy after enemy by their aggressive and innovative use of mobility and flexible battlefield tactics. The longbow at Agincourt deserves it's reputation, but that battle may have turned as much on weather as the bow: torrential rains so soaked the field that the French could not maintain their standard combined arms doctrine and had to advance piecemeal, with their cavalry uncovered by their own bows and infantry.

kevink123,"Answering this question first requires an in-depth exploration of the Qing's unique Eight Banner System so that we may contrast it with the far more conventional Green Standard Army.

The Eight Banners trace their origins to the reign of Nurhaci (posthumously recognized as the first Qing Emperor) in the early 17th century when the nascent Jurchen state still called itself the Jin. The system was modeled upon traditional hunting methods from Northeast Asia, in which 8-10 hunters would surround a large mass of forest and slowly drive the encircled game to the center. In essence, the system grouped the many diverse peoples from Nurhaci's rapid conquests of Northeast Asia into cohesive, loyal military units. Previously, Nurhaci's armies were plagued by factionalism, tribal-based loyalties, and old family feuds. The Banner System cut through these traditions, and placed each soldier in a military unit ruled by headsman that was unwavering in their loyalty to Nurhaci alone. In this way, Nurhaci overcame tribalism to create an army over whom his command was absolute. A soldier's position in his ""Banner"" was permanent and hereditary. It expanded beyond the military and into his daily life: as the families in a Banner provided soldiers to fill the unit, so too did the Banner's bureaucracy provide for the family's daily needs. The system, in those early days, created a highly militarized and decisively loyal military in a time where Nurhaci might otherwise have been plagued by crippling decentralization and lineage based command structures.^1

Initially, there were only four banners: the Yellow, White, Red, and Blue. In 1615, Nurhaci expanded the system to include a total of Eight Banners, having added the Bordered Yellow, Bordered White, Bordered Red, and Bordered Blue Banners. In the 1630's, Hong Taiji (Nurhaci's successor) separated the Banners along ethnic lines. As a result, distinct ""Mongol"" and ""Manchu"" Banners were created. By 1642, after the conquest of Liaodong, Han Chinese banners were created as well, often called the ""*hanjun*"" or ""martial Han"" banners. As a result, By 1644 (when the Qing seized Beijing), the Eight Banners were actually 24 different banners: the Manchu Red, the Mongolian Bordered White, the *Hanjun* Blue, etc etc etc. In terms of numbers, the *Hanjun* Banners were the largest by far, and the Mongolian units were certainly the smallest. The Banner System caused the three ethnic groups to grow ethnically and culturally closer over the course of the dynasty, and fostered within all of them a common ""Manchu"" identity despite their respective Han, Mongolian, or Jurchen origins.^2

The size of the Banner System was surprisingly large. During the conquest beginning in 1644, The Manchu Army's adult male population (not including slaves) was around 300,000. By the early ~~17th~~ 18th century, the total Banner Population (including wives and families, who were also important member of the Banner System's social structure) numbered at least 2.5 million, and perhaps as high as 5 million. Geographically, the Banner population was concentrated in Beijing (~50%), Northeast China (~20%), and throughout the garrisons of their Empire (~30%).^3

Despite their impressive size and growth, the Banners were too small to maintain security within their domain. As a result, the Qing relied on the Green Standard units to maintain stability. This was possible owing to the units' immense size. Throughout the Dynasty, the Green Standard armies were about three times the size of their Eight Banner counterparts. Ethnicity was a primary difference between the Green Standard and Eight Banner units. Although there were exceptions, the soldier in the Green Standard units were almost exclusively Han Chinese. Bannermen could become officers in Green Standard units, but almost exclusively soldiered for the Eight Banners. What's more, the Green Standard were simply an enlistment based unit. This was in contrast to the intricate Banner System, which went far beyond just a military unit. Whereas the Banners were a hereditary social/military unit that managed every aspect of its members lives from cradle to grave, the Green Standard were simple term based enlistment units.^4

EDIT: I should clarify that there is a distinct difference between the ""Han Chinese"" (that filled the ranks of the Green Standard infantry) and the ""Martial Han"" or ""*Hanjun*"" (members of the Han Banners). The *Hanjun* were descendants of the large populations of Han outside the Ming state that were integrated into the Manchu state prior to the conquest of the Ming. Their early entrance into the Qing at a time when manpower was sorely needed spurred the creation of Eight additional *Hanjun* banners. After there entrance into the Eight Banners, these *Hanjun* increasingly diverged from the cultural practices and identities of the Han Chinese throughout China proper. As stated above, *Hanjun* naturally forged a common Manchu identity with the members of the Mongol and Manchu banners over time (though they forever remained second class bannermen in the eyes of the Mongols and Manchus). The Han Chinese throughout China would also label the *Hanjun* as Manchus.

riskbreaker2987,"/u/koine_lingua was absolutely correct in that other thread, and there is a very simple answer to your question: No, we don't have anything that survives which can authentically be attributed to Muhammad.

With that said, the early Arabic historical tradition attributes all sorts of letters or statements from Muhammad to other rulers or leaders in the Near East during his lifetime. But there are numerous problems with these early Arabic sources, namely that none of them are written down until centuries after the lifetime of the Prophet. That's not to say that we don't find material that is very likely authentic in this tradition - we certainly do. But it does mean that we don't have any actual letters that were ""written"" by Muhammad (or his scribes) which survive. 

Edit: To talk just a bit more about this, why would a letter be falsely attributed to Muhammad? In some instances, like the ""letter"" in the initial question, it would be in order to [gain benefits](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1r7w2m/forgotten_history_prophet_muhammad_saw_letters_to/cdl3x7o) when it came to taxation, protection, or similar. Sometimes, the Arabic tradition also records things like Muhammad writing a letter to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius inviting him to embrace Islam and no harm would come to the Byzantines. Depending on the source, Heraclius can react differently to the letter. My favorite reaction is one found in al-Azdī’s *Futūḥ al-Shām* where he personally wants to convert, but his advisers suggest he shouldn't. Once the Byzantine army is crushed at Yarmūk, Heraclius is deeply angry at his advisers since he didn't want to fight them anyway.

So, why create a story like this? Because it presents the Prophet very positively, and these authors who are writing so much later than the lifetime of the Prophet present him as they imagine he must have been like: deeply religious, fair, saintly - a paragon of virtue. He is their final Prophet, after all. And thematically, including a letter like this suggests that the conquests were only necessary because the ""true"" message was ignored. Fighting didn't have to happen - Islam was open to everyone who committed to its tenants, and the Byzantine and Sasanian rulers ignored the call and were punished for it.

It also seems to reflect or to be related to the theoretical issue that had developed in Islamic administrative law concerning the taxation of particular places depending on whether they had been conquered by force or had surrendered peacefully (e.g. the Kitāb al-Kharāj or Abu Yusuf). It is no accident that Christians began to refer to such documents by the ninth century after about a century of threats to church buildings and pressures for conversion/apostasy. By employing them Christians were raising the ante.

From reading the Victorians and their immediate successors, you'll get the sense that they felt their tutelage would not be indefinite (or unchanging) but would in any case extend well past their own lifetimes.

Naturally, the people most opposed to British domination did not agree with the imperial government's model of engagement and limited self-government, nor with what the Government of India propounded, but it was a gradualist model at least.

Samuel_I,"Yes, there most certainly were!

One of the easiest ways to demonstrate this is by looking at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The army of Harold of Wessex had just made it to the south of England after fighting off a force sent from the Kingdom of Norway at Stamford Bridge. His army was comprised almost entirely of infantry, with the housecarls as his elite backbone. They were a type of landed-man that typically fought with a kite-shield and a large two-handed axe. The majority of his forces, however, would have been levies armed with spears and shields. The Normans under William of Normandy were a mixed force. He had command of standard levy infantry, various ranged units such as archers and javelinmen, and cavalry. 

The *Gesta Guillelmi* and the Bayeux Tapestry are two of our most important sources for this battle.

Harold of Wessex chose to implement what we now call the shield wall. His troops stood in a tight formation and locked their shields together in order to better absorb an enemy attack, thus making it easier for his housecarls to counterattack when his foes floundered. William used his mixed force by applying his three types of soldiers intermittently in order to gain their maximum effectiveness. Ranged units to begin, infantry to assault, cavalry to break them or, should the infantry fail, recoup losses on the field. In fact, it is commonly suggested that Harold of Wessex himself died of an arrow to the eye, as the Bayeux Tapestry would seem to suggest.

In the end, William was victorious. It was not because he possessed superior equipment that Harold did not have access to, but rather because the military traditions and necessities of his army gave him an edge, namely, his mixed force. Why they differed so much is a difficult question to answer. We have multiple accounts from Bede to those of Alfred the Great that describe Anglo-Saxon battles and the way they were fought. The shield wall and housecarl were ingrained into their culture and were how they were accustomed to fighting battles. However, Normandy and William produced something different. Horseman and archers were apparently more necessary to his success in securing Normandy under his rule. In doing so, he found a set of strategies and soldiers that were sound against most armies of the day (largely static, infantry armies). He found something worked and he implemented it. Culture and necessity came together to generate a winning combination.",null,0,cdkz3wt,1r91wv,askhistorians,top_week,7
Lilaith,"Notable differences were certainly there, but they differed from general to general, and what kind of terrain/troops were there. The vision of the militairy staff was hugely important. Take the 100 years war for instance:

During the 100 years war between England and France(1337 - 1453) England under Edward III almost won the war before 1365 by innovating. 
Before the war, armies would largely consist of knights, professional hired soldiers and any footsoldiers brought by lords in the army. Edward however changed this, mass recruited english farmers and gave them the famous longbows. He also was the first to prefer skill over nobility(Roger Mortimer, his Fieldmarschalk, was of low noble rank, NOT the kingslayer with the same name) and used clever tactics. These innovations, and the fact the English did not put their lives blindly on the line believing god would save them made them almost won the war. This is most clearly shown in battles such as at Crécy and Poiters, where heavily outnumbered English forces managed to defeat French knight-armies. To make it clear: The prince of Wales defeated the French at Poiters(5400 soldiers, mainly archers vs 17500 soldiers, mainly knights) by making clever use of the terrain. The French king Jean II decided storming the hill on which the English were defending would grant him victory, although he knew the English were trapped and barely had food left. He preferred to battle them, rather than make them surrender. It ended catastrophically, with many knights killed or taken hostage, Jean II and his youngest song becomming hostages. This is a turning point in the war, since Jean's son, Charles, turns out to be a great king(later named Le Sage, the wise). In his 16 year long reign he recaptures almost everything the English had achieved, again by innovating(he innovates greatly with artillery) and clever use of politics/tactics.

conclusion: tactics and preferences can differ greatly. It relies however on the personal skill and preference of generals and the politics and finances of kings. A good king can achieve great things, a bad one can destroy even more. If you want to generalize greatly however, sure, differences existed. The French used knights and hired soldiers, the English used their famous longbows while the Italian citystates preferred crossbowarchers.

LIPCSB,"The belief in some primordial ""Aryan Master Race"" came to prominence a short time after the Indo-European language family was discovered.  Analysis of ancient sanskrit texts revealed that, linguistically, the peoples of Europe, India, and Iran draw from some cultural progenitor.  This discovery was most clearly articulated in the late 18th century by Sir William Jones, who reached this conclusion through his study of the Rig Veda.  

German romantics leaped onto the idea, in their quest to find some mythical ""Pure Germany"" uncontaminated by foreign ways.  The Germans Herder and Von Humboldt in particular propagated the idea that language and cultural identity were inseparable ideas.  

These ideas were further mixed with the ideas of Social Darwinism after ""On the Origin of Species"" was published.  If the purest sense of Germany could be derived from the peasants' folk-tales, then the purest Germans must surely have been the first, uncontaminated by mixture with ""lesser"" races.  Thus was born the idea of the Aryan Master Race.  The Rig Veda's authors described themselves as Aryan, and so this was obviously the name of the oldest Germans--who, obviously, were blond, blue-eyed, tall, brilliant, and generally the best people who ever lived.  

What was once a generally neutral field of cultural study mutated into a nationalist struggle to justify their own superiority by claiming the purest blood of Western Civilization.  Jones and his contemporaries said the Aryans must have originated somewhere between Iran and the Himalayas.  By the early 20th century, German archaeologists were insisting that the Aryan homeland was obviously in Northern Germany.  

This is the basis for the idea of the ""Aryan"" race.  Hitler might not have given the occultists the time of day, but the idea of the Germans (and ""Nordic"" people in general) being of some superior, unmixed stock was pretty mainstream.  You didn't need to buy into occult claptrap to subscribe to the idea of German superiority by virtue of ancestral birthright.  

(Source: The Horse, The Wheel, and Language, by David W. Anthony)

That explains the terminology (""Aryan"") and why people cared (""because these were the first Germans, obviously"").  The symbolism follows from that--swastikas were found in a lot of archaeological sites, including Troy, and are notoriously common in India.  Obviously, it's a symbol of great importance to the Aryans!  

Its influence on German foreign policy comes down to a pseudo-scientific belief in racial struggle between the Aryans and the non-Aryan groups (""Slavs are obviously Asian--you can tell by their skulls!"" was a common line of reasoning).  German Aryans could only survive according to this narrative by wiping out their neighbors and taking their land.  ",null,1,cdktaz3,1r8z41,askhistorians,top_week,5

folsom_prison,"I can't speak for Canada, but in the case of Britain is widely welcomed. 

In the 1930s many British people were hoping that serious changes would be introduced to alleviate poverty. When the Beveridge report was released in 1942 it struck a chord with a generation of people who had only know severe austerity. Health care reform became part of a wider mandate for major changes in the quality of life for the average person. These were presented within the report in the rather Victorian terms of the five 'Giant evils;' idleness, ignorance, want, squalor, and disease. (Unemployment, education, poverty, sanitation + housing, and health.) 

That being said, there were naturally many wealthier people who did not want to see a 'socialist utopia' created in their country. The Conservative government was partially opposed to widespread changes. They eventually reversed some of the nationalisations that occurred after the Second World War. However it is a testament to the success, and popularity, of the NHS that it was not dismantled following Labour's defeat in the 1951 election. 

In short - No. Partially due to the post war environment they were introduced in, and partially due to a genuine desire to see changes.

Spoonfeedme,"To answer for Canada, it was a difficult process. The staunchest opposition was from Doctors, who, ironically, are now probably the greatest supporters of socialized medicine in Canada.

Tommy Douglas was the man who started it, and he laid the foundation for the national system while Premier of Saskatchewan. It took him years, and ultimately it was not passed until he was out of office. He left office in 1961, and in 1962, the doctors of that province went on strike. The strike was broken due to the importation of foreign doctors (ironically one of the worries of Doctors prior to the strike) and lack of public support. Once the doctors in Saskatchewan broke, and public support for the system grew, the ability for the Canadian Medical Association to continue to effectively oppose it nationally ended.

It is important to note that the development of socialized medicine in Canada is very different from the United Kingdom. Saskatchewan and Alberta both had majority public systems prior to the implementation of universal healthcare nationwide, and the system itself continues to be run by the provinces with quality guaranteed by federal payments. The 'universality' of healthcare has developed through successive legislation (up to and including the present day).

EdwardJamesAlmost,"Garfield's assassination was by a frustrated man looking for a post of federal patronage. As Speaker of the House, Garfield had assailed the practice of large scale uprooting of civil servants as reward for campaign support. For whatever reason, his assassin then blamed the new President when he did not (surprise) largely uproot civil servants and put (him, for example) in comfortable federal posts. Politicians became fearful of the implications, and federal appointments became much less strict than the standards Garfield wanted to impose. Simultaneously, many of the previous patronage jobs became more and more subsumed by municipal machines, and a single national figure was less likely (or at least never was assassinated for this stated reason) to take full public anger. But patronage prior to Garfield had been an incredibly partisan and resentful affair, leading to many of the local notables who campaigned one way or another to have incentives to do so. Melville and Hawthorne even wrote about the system as a given in American business and politics (in the 1840s).

McKinley's assassination was different. He was shot by an ideological anarchist at a time when anarchism was ascendent on the American political fringe. Labor riots had taken place commonly in the previous 20 years, and in the following 20 other groups like the US Communist Party began to agitate.

Irishfafnir,"The idea that the Whig party is the Federalists re-branded has been on going for a number of years, and was one employed by the Jacksonians during their own time as a means of slandering Whigs. However in the capstone book of Whig History *The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party* forever slams shut the case that Whigs were Federalists re-branded, if anything Whigs could claim a stronger connection to Republicanism than Democrats. But lets look at the three things that made up the American system, which is commonly viewed at the center point of Whig political economic ideology.

1- Support for a national bank- On the surface this seems like a slam dunk in favor of Federalism, but a looker close reveals otherwise. Hamilton's bank was smaller and designed to give large loans for ninety days to wealthy merchants and to prevent the formation of state banks. Hamilton's designs for the bank reveal the Federalist desire for a world that looked East towards a mercantile republic dominated by aristocratic men. BOTUS II by contrast was aimed at managing the already numerous state banks, who primarily secured credit for western farmers. Perhaps most revealing Federalists voted against BOTUS II 38-15

2- Internal Improvements- Internal Improvements aren't really a party issue in the early republic. Both Federalists and Republicans called for internal improvements. However Clay's internal improvement program was based on Albert Gallatin's 1807 report while serving as Thomas Jefferson's secretary of state. Moreover Republican and Whig internal improvements were aimed at improving the vast interior, in contrast to the Federalist outlook of looking East.

3- Protective tariff- The protective tariff is clearly a Republican tariff. Hamilton's tariff proposals were not actually protective but were for revenue, during his time the price of foreign manufactures had declined, he believed that additional duties would not seriously affect customer prices. Hamilton offered no protection to established industries threatened by more efficient foreign competition only new manufacturing. Moreover Hamilton wasn't a big fan of protective tariffs considering bounties and direct government payments to business stating they were ""the best and most efficacious means of exchanging manufactures"" ( moreover we know now his policies encourage exported items rather then goods for domestic use). 

Madison and Clay's tariff was a true protective tariff, aimed at protecting domestic manufacturing and only giving free rates for those goods which Americans were incapable of producing( which even had the support of Jefferson), goods that could completely satisfy American demands had very high tariff rates, and those that could only partially fill had 20-25% rates. Moreover the Madison tariff reflected a rejection of British domination of the world, and is a reflection of American foreign policy in the years leading up to the war of 1812. Federalists voted for the tariff 25-23

4- Fear of Executive Power- Whigs were brought together as much because of Jackson than because of a shared economic policy. In this regard Whigs express hallmark Jeffersonian fears of executive power. In practice this is often reflected in Whig candidates offering to only serve one term or refusing to veto legislation. While Federalists often attacked Jefferson for being a hypocritically strong President, you don't see the same fear of executive rule during the first party system.


5-The Military- While Whigs preferred a strong military, they supported the army over the navy whereas Federalists had supported the Navy over the army. This is a reflection of Federalist ideology which sought to build a nation as a mercantile republic similar to Britain. Especially post 1800 Federalists often offered Luke-warm support for the army as it was increasingly viewed as a means of enforcing the embargo or preparing the nation for war against Britain. 

6- The Community- One of the strongest similarities between Federalists and Whigs is the emphasis on the community in the development of an individual. Both parties thought that it required a well developed and inter connected community to develop a republican citizen. By contrast democrats tended to emphasize the individual over the community.

7- Respect for the rule of law- Both Federalists and Whigs believed that the established rule of law had to be recognized. Revolutions were  often met with alarm or welcoming caution at best. For the Whigs this meant that Dorr's Rebellion and the revolutions of 1848 were not embraced in the same way as Democrats triumphed the sovereignty of the people. For Federalists the upper members of society had to be respected and any social revolution had to be put down ( IE: Alien&amp; Sedition Acts)

It's [replete with errors](http://www.livius.org/opinion/opinion0013.html) and makes very little use of modern scholarship (especially on the Achaemenid side), thus leaving the reader with an extremely skewed understanding of what actual scholars have said on the topic. More disturbingly, he helps perpetuate the ""East vs. West"" mentality and the nonsense that ""Western civilization"" (whatever the heck that is) would not have survived had ""the Greeks"" (he really means the Athenians) fell under Persian control, as if ""the West"" today can trace its origins down a linear path back to fifth-century B.C. Greece.

caustic_banana,"It's incredibly difficult to say ""why"" for such a broad question like this, but I can offer at least one point of view.

Only about 30 Roman Emperors ever reigned for longer than 10 years.  That simply just doesn't leave a ton of time to have a family, especially when lots of the men who would become Emperor spent a long portion of their lives playing military and political games in order to acquire their position of power, rather than marrying and producing offspring.

Rome was never a heredity monarchy and most positions in Roman government were and always had been elected.  Tie those two things together, and there was little impetus for Emperors to pop out kids solely to continue the line, so long as their family's house endured in some fashion.

Im sorry I can't offer anything more concrete; this is a topic I've never heard explored at a scholarly level.  Good question.",null,2,cdkr82z,1r8p4t,askhistorians,top_week,21

Bernardito,"Essentially, Chomsky's claim is the following:

""On October 11, 1961, Kennedy ordered dispatch of a US Air Force Farmgate squadron to South Vietnam, 12 planes especially equipped for counterinsurgency warfare (combat modified T-28 fighter bomber trainers, SC-47s, and B-26 bombers), soon authorized ""to fly coordinated missions with Vietnamese personnel in support of Vietnamese ground forces."" On December 16, Defense Secretary McNamara authorized their participation in combat operations. These were the first steps in engaging US forces directly in bombing and other combat operations in South Vietnam from 1962, along with sabotage missions in the North. These 1961-1962 actions laid the groundwork for the huge expansion of the war in later years."" (sources given: *Foreign Relations of the United States*, Vietnam, 1961-1963, I, 343; III, 4n. Gibbons, US Government, 70-1, citing Air Force history.)

Now, luckily for us, this source is available online. Perhaps the most telling of all the documents that Chomsky wants us to read is *Foreign Relations of the United States*, 1961–1963 Volume III, Vietnam, January–August 1963, Document 71:

&gt; U.S. supported offensive sorties though increasing have not reached the tempo cited. Actual statistics for U.S. fixed wing aircraft for the past 6 months reveal a total of 2450 offensive sorties for an average of 480 per month of which an average of 100 were interdiction. 183 (Farmgate) interdiction missions have been flown thus far in March 1963 which is indicative of the increase in this area. [...] RVNAF pilots unaccompanied by U.S. advisors fly the majority of interdiction missions. No interdiction missions are executed by USAF pilots exclusively.

Another document, *Foreign Relations of the United States*, 1961–1963
Volume III, Vietnam, January–August 1963, Document 100, clears this up even further:

&gt; During the past six months about 7,000 combat support sorties, or a little more than 1,000 per month, have been flown in SVN. About 2,500 of these, or 35%, have been flown by Farmgate (combined US/ VNAF crews). Of these 7,000 combat support sorties, VNAF has flown about 1,900 interdiction missions, while Farmgate aircraft have flown about 600 such missions. Thus, Farmgate has flown about 415 combat support sorties per month over the past six months, of which about 100 per month have been interdiction missions. Accordingly, Farmgate combat support sorties have amounted to about 35% of the total such sorties flown in SVN over the past six months, while Farmgate interdiction sorties have counted for less than 10% of that total.

Essentially, the USAF during the period of 1961 and 1964 never flew an independent mission. The VNAF took care of the majority of the combat support and combined VNAF/USAF crews were involved in providing combat support as well. However, the impression that the quote you provide wants us to get is that the USAF were the ones doing the bombing, while this was not the case. ",null,1,cdkq14v,1r8ohg,askhistorians,top_week,4
American_Graffiti,"**Adolescence as a Social and Cultural Construction**

A quick note first, in case someone is confused about how adolescence can ""come to be"" - concepts like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood are all social and culturally constructed identities, which *give meaning to* but are not *defined* by the process of human growth and development.  There have always been children, and children have always developed (physically, mentally, psychologically) in more or less the same way that they do today.  

But much of what we think of as ""natural"" for children and adolescents is actually culturally defined.  In the past, most children and youth did not spend 12+ years attending school full time, and they did not live the kind of protected, carefully supervised life that they do today.  In western society prior to the twentieth century, the vast majority of young people *worked* from a very young age, and their status and role in society was defined by more by their race, class, marital status and occupation than it was by their age.  

**The Origins of Childhood**

In western society, children weren't really considered a distinct social group, who experienced a specific life stage called ""childhood"" until the seventeenth century, and it's not really until the late eighteenth century/early nineteenth century that ""modern"" notions of childhood as a time of innocence, growth, and learning - during which children needed to be carefully protected and nurtured - really catches on.  Even then, it primarily catches on among middle-class and upper-class people, while working-class, black, and immigrant children still spend most of their time working, and in close proximity to a lot of talk and behaviour that we would consider ""adults only"" stuff today.

**The Roots of Adolescence: Social Change in the 19th Century and G. Stanley Hall**

Adolescence as we know it only originated in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century.  Officially, the term was invented by an American psychologist named G. Stanley Hall.  He published a book in 1905 called *Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education* which coined the term.  But the origins of adolescence really lie in the nineteenth century, in broader economic, social, and demographic changes like urbanization, immigration, and the industrial revolution.  

One key factor was that the American economy got more and more complex over time, and there began to be a growing demand for *well educated,* skilled workers who had spent a few years in school and were well suited to run an increasingly technologized, ""managerial"" state and economy.  So young people started to stay in school for longer.  

But there's another consideration too.  As immigrants and rural migrants poured into large cities during the late nineteenth centuries, young workers who were working on the street and in factories for wages started to find themselves with a lot more independence that they'd had in smaller towns and rural communities, or when they'd worked in close proximity to their parents or other adults in a ""shop"" setting.  Middle-class people like Hall started to notice a lot more young people running around in the streets, unsupervised, and engaging in misbehavior (theft, fighting, prostitution, sex, etc) which made them worry about the future of American society (have you *seen* what the kids are doing these days!?)

**The Child Study Movement and Hall's Recapitulation Theory**

Hall was one of the founders of the Child Study Movement, and of child psychology as a ""scientific"" discipline.  He spent a lot of time just observing children in the process of growing up during the late nineteenth century, and ultimately decided that in a modern, industrialized society, children needed more time to develop into adults than they had in the past. The easiest way to explain this is through Hall's theory of recapitulation.  Like many nineteenth century Americans, Hall believed that human societies and civilizations developed over time from a state of ""savagery"" into a state of ""civilization,"" gradually become more and more civilized, complex, and rational. Each of these stages, in this theory, had to be worked through in turn, like a series of steps, and if societies didn't go through the steps in the right order or didn't develop properly, they'd get stuck somewhere along the way.

When he looked at developing adolescents, Hall thought he saw a similar process at work there: he thought there was a single, set developmental path that children followed on their way to becoming adults, and he observed what he interpreted as a lot of ""savage,"" and ""tribal"" behaviour in adolescents (this might sound familiar to parents/teachers who are reading this!).  

**Hall's Conclusions**

What Hall ended up concluding, in the end, was that the urban, industrialized environment of the late 1800s was making young people take *longer* to work through all of the different states/stages of psychological and moral development that they needed to go through in order to become healthy adults.  So he advocated giving young Americans more time and more space to grow up, and permitting them to *act* like ""little savages"" for a while, so that they could get that out of their system and move on.  The big danger, as he saw it, was that forcing them to grow up too fast would get young people ""stuck"" in one of those stages, where they would continue acting like un-civilized people (violent, poor impulse control, etc) through their whole adult life.  

So he advocated giving them space, but in a carefully monitored/controlled environment - Hall also subscribed to Victorian morals, after all, so it was *very, very important* to him that young people be supervised, and directed toward expending all of their savagery and energy on wholesome pursuits like sports, being outdoors, exploring nature, etc.  Like many other child-rearing experts around this time, he was kind of obsessed with masturbation, and teaching young people sexual self control. 

**Adolescence after Hall**

So that's it! Hall's idea made a lot of sense to people at the time, and really caught on as a means of explaining and justifying the new roles (delayed entry into the labor force, extended schooling) that young people were taking on around that time.  His ideas lead directly to [rapidly expanding school enrolments](http://i.imgur.com/JHm6WLW.png), organizations like the YMCA and the boy scouts, and a whole host of other institutions and practices that helped to define and spread the concept of adolescence over the course of the 20th Century.

Note that most of his ideas (like the recapitulation theory) were discredited pretty quickly though - his importance really just lies in his ""invention"" of adolescence.

Irishfafnir,"Over reliance on Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton and Washington's relationship is well known and predates his time as President but it was his over reliance on Hamilton during and after his Presidency that greatly increased political tensions, contributed to the rise of the Republican party and contributed to Adams loss in 1800. 

Initially Washington had leaned very heavily on James Madison, who was the most effective politician in the house, but Washington eventually turned to his cabinet largely out of constitutional reasons. His cabinet was initially a good mix of geography and political persuasion.  The political arguing between Jefferson and Hamilton is known well, but initially Washington was far less biased than one would think, for instance he very nearly vetoed BOTUS I. As political tensions mounted Washington increasingly relied on Hamilton at the expense of the moderates and what would be Jeffersonians within his cabinet. For instance the negotiations between Jay and the British were run through Hamilton( the secretary of the treasury) and not state. Edmund Randolph (the secretary of state) was left almost entirely in the dark and consequently so was the ambasaddor to France, James Monroe. Jay and Hamilton's working around of the Pro-French Virginians  put both Monroe and Randolph into the near impossible position of attempting to explain the Jay Treaty to their still nominal allies in France which contributed to the more famous hostilities of Adams presidency.

After Jefferson's departure there was no remaining Republican leaning members of Washington's cabinet, only Randolph and mostly high federalists. In 1795 a letter written by Edmund Randolph to France had been seized by the British who turned it over to Alexander Hamilton, who informed Washington that it contained treasonous material to the United States. Washington, never actually read the letter nor did he have someone else read it relying solely on the opinion and word of Hamilton. He confronted Randolph in a cabinet meeting forcing him to resign. Within the 18th century society of honor, Washington's actions were highly offensive made evident by Randolph taking the unusual steps of publicly attacking Washington in his [A Vindication of Mr. Randolph's Resignation](http://books.google.com/books?id=JzZcAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Edmund+Randolph#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) at about the same time Monroe was also removed from France. These removals meant that there was now no Republicans holding high office within the United States, and only one moderate Federalist(Lee). Jefferson and Madison in particular saw the removal of Randolph as the last straw, and any lingering sentiments towards reconciling with the Federalists was highly unlikely. Jefferson in a pained letter even wrote to Washington, telling him of how dangerous he felt Hamilton was to Washington. 

Adams too many problems during his presidency to get into at any length but one of the ones not of his creation was because of Washington. Adams had expanded the armed forces of the United States (either to oppose France or as some Federalists hopped to stop domestic violence ie: Republican). At this highly partisan time Adams thought that only Washington could be offered command of the army to ensure that the army held the support of all Americans. Perhaps showing the severity of the time, Washington actually accepted but refused to have anyone other than Hamilton as his second in command. Adams huffed and puffed but was left with little choice but to accept Hamilton. Hamilton was not the man to bring the nation together, especially at the head of an army one of his best friends Gouvernor Morris wrote of Hamilton

""Our poor friend Hamilton bestrode his hobby to the great annoyance of his friends, and not without injury to himself.. He well knew that his favorite form (of government) was inadmissible, unless as the result of civil war; and I suspect that his belief in that which he called an 'approaching crisis' arose from a conviction that the king of government most suitable in his opinion, to this extensive country, could established no other way"".

Hamilton's appointment panicked Republicans even more so, many who now openly thought that the army's purpose was to crush the Republican movement. Jefferson sent out letters to Republican leaders imploring them to avoid giving the Federalists any reason whatsoever for using the army against them. In doing so Jefferson allowed the public to arrive at their own conclusion regarding the army, which contributed to his victory in 1800. Adams had planned to appoint moderates in Pennsylvania and New York to high offices within the army (the two states he needed to win to secure his election) but Hamilton ensured that only high federalists and no Republicans were appointed to command, again reinforcing the Jeffersonian fear. It was at this point that Adams realized he had lost complete control of the Federalist party and he attempted to reassert his authority through sacking his cabinet(minus Lee) and negotiations with France, causing a civil war within the party.

Had Washington continued to rely on moderate Republicans like Madison and appointed a bi-partisan cabinet much of the political infighting that resulted in the two party system could have been lessened or delayed.

outside of that I'm not sure what else you can really hold Washington accountable for major political mistakes. Ellis in *American Creation* holds the entirety of the founding generation responsible for failing to find a solution for the natives and slavery. However Ellis notes in the book (for the Creek confederacy for instance) the Federal government held few tools on hand to deal with many of the issues affecting the Creek.

A_Su,"Wow finally a question that is my speciality. Wohoo! Your question is a bit broad and vague so I will divide it up into three areas of discussion; politics, economy, and culture. Also my focus will be on largely structural reasons.

Politically, the Yuan unified the geographic area of China (Song, Jin, and XiXia) thus unifying a disparate ""China"" after 100 - 300 years of disunity depending on what measure you use. As a result, they bequeathed a lasting territorial benchmark or legacy to live up to for future dynasties/ nations of 'China'. Both the Qing and PRC have claimed legitimacy as the successors of the Yuan regime (in a roundabout way) to supposed Yuan territories, such as Tibet. Furthermore, Chinese political and military structure in both the Ming and Qing dynasties was heavily influenced by Yuan forms. For instance, the military rose to a strong position of power in Ming bureaucracy and politics, whereas in the Song they were subjugated. In addition, the Ming enfeoffed rebellious or unwanted princes in far off military districts such as Yunan, not unlike Mongol custom. Lastly, in the Qing dynasty Mongol forms of political legitimation, such as descent from Chinggis Khan and his personal vessels were used by the incipient Qing and Aisin Giorio clan to cement alliances. 

Economically, the Mongol conquests in short accelerated the decline of China's north plain economy in favour of its southern regions. Though this decline had been ongoing for centuries, the devastation the Mongols wrought on the Jin dynasty left the north poor. Also, several theories point to an ecological decline of the Mongolian grasslands following the Mongol conquests - most likely due to overgrazing to increase and maintain the supply of Mongolian ponies. In addition, contacts with the Middle East and the rest of the world were increased both by the land 'Pax Mongolica' or overland trade routes and by sea shipping. 

Lastly, culturally the Mongol conquests did change some aspects of Chinese culture. Numerous Middle Easterners moved into China, and Islam began making major headways into Xinjiang, Gansu, and notably Yunnan. Buttons were introduced, which changed Chinese clothes forever. New languages such as the Phagspa script and the Mongol script were developed which later influenced Hangul, and the Manchu language. In addition, Neo-Confucian thought gained a wider political appeal and support under the Yuan. 

Now that I have summarized some of the effects of the Mongol conquest, I shall answer some of your other questions.

The Mongols never did completely assimilate into Chinese society, contrary to what a lot of old school PRC scholars believe. Many Mongol Khans and nobles  didn't and perhaps couldn't learn Chinese effectively, and continued to speak Mongol. If anything, as the conflict between the Khubilai and Arik Boke attests to, a growing divide appeared between the sedentarized Mongols who took the trappings of Chinese culture and the nomads back home. A similar situation developed in all of the Mongol successor Khanates with the exception of the golden Horde. Despite prohibitions, many Mongols intermarried with Chinese and vice versa. Some Mongols became Chinese, and some Chinese became Mongol. But overall, the garrisons stationed in China began to acquire more and more Chinese characteristics. According to John Dardess in Conquerors and Confucians, the Yuan dynasty was undergoing a transition in the 1340s-60s to change from a conquest elite to a sinified-dynasty, but this process was arrested for a number of reasons, which will be discussed below. 

Ultimately, the Yuan dynasty failed to a combination of bad luck, political intrigue, and an inability to adapt to a changing political climate. As far as bad luck goes, the Yuan faced a number of climatic challenges that created famines, droughts, and storms which wrecked peasant life. This, in combination with the aftermath of the bubonic plague left large tracts of China devastated economically, especially from the 1320s onwards. Unlike the Ming, which were extremely lucky by dynastic standards, the Yuan faced a large number of disasters from which they could not alleviate economically. 

Political Intrigue also weakened the dynasty greatly. Aside from Khubilai, and the last Khan of the Yuan, all the middle rulers only ruled for a few years before being killed or replaced. Consequently, there was no stable political environment in which all the efforts of the dynasty could be used to alleviate the economic distress that the peasantry faced. Also, Khubilai's expensive and fruitless endeavours in Java, Japan, Myanmar, Daiviet, and Champa drained a lot of the wealth and manpower of the Yuan, and left the political administration in deficit. In response the Yuan admin used tax farmers, which only exacerbated their unsustainable revenue problems to make up the shortfall. 

Lastly, an inability to change fast enough greatly impeded the ability fo the Yuan to survive. Due to sedentarization, Mongol armies stationed in China no longer possessed the marital qualities that their great-grandfathers possed when they conquered China. As a result, the admin could not easily or quickly put down rebellions such as the Red Turbans which rendered large parts of southern China as de facto independent. In addition, court intrigue also prevented the installation of far reaching reforms that could have changed the bureaucracy to more efficiently deal with economic problems that weakened the state. As a result of the rebellions, many of the Mongol elite were undecided to become more Chinese or maintain their Mongol heritage. The indecision ultimately, prevented them from adapting to be more favourable to Southern China. Lastly, though the seperation and discrimination of the people of the Yuan into four categories was useful in the initial administration of the country, it became a major liability later on. Due to its discrimination against Southern Chinese, the Yuan were never able to bring them into the political fold and turn them into a bastion of support for the regime. Thus, a combination of these reasons ultimately prevented the Yuan from maintaining their control over the Chinese populace. ",null,0,cdl3wv2,1r8jga,askhistorians,top_week,5

Brighterthan1000suns,"It impacted the lives of African Americans on multiple levels. Most historians put the emphasis on the military involvement of the black population: overture in officialdom, acceptance of A-A in the Air Corps, change of rules in the selective service, ability to showcase A-A's value in combat, etc. Ultimately, WWII lead to the desegregation of the armed forces.

Unfortunately, historians tend to limit their scope of study to this aspect of the special conjuncture of the period, therefore missing a great part of the whole picture. WWII greatly impacted the political, juridical and economical life of A-A.

At the time, there was what is often being call a Second Great Migration. Sometimes, historians refer to this migration as simply the second large wave of a general trend that started during WWI (The ''First'' Great Migration). Whatever you want to call it, the fact remains that, mostly looking for jobs, people from the South-East moved Westward and Northward in great numbers. Among the migrants, a majority, obviously, was white, but proportionately, blacks moved out of the South at a higher rate. This migration was directly linked to the War Economy and played a major role in changing the everyday life of millions of A-A (even among those who didn't move). This migration was also marked by and exodus from rural lands towards urban dwellings. 

This reality greatly improved the electoral power of the black population for several reasons - some more obvious than others.

It also enabled blacks to politicize themselves. A-A Activism sky-rocketed during the period (contrarily to what some historians say): civil rights organizations were born between 1939 and 1945; nationwide campaign were set in place by such organizations, old and new, and by A-A newspapers, reaching unprecedented popularity; the NAACP grew ten-fold during the war, with nearly 500,000 members at the end of the war; etc.

To be brief, WWII provided an opportunity of political empowerment for A-A. Black leaders were conscious of this opportunity and put forth measures and strategies to seize it. However, this is not consensual among historians. Quite the contrary, many believed that the period was characterized by slow political progress for A-A. In my opinion, this is mostly due to the fact that while the Executive branch was mostly liberal during WWII, Congress was not. Indeed, few laws were enacted to give A-A any form of political rights, but political power is obviously not limited to actual political rights.

Economically, the gap between whites and blacks was narrowed (but clearly not eliminated) during the Second World War. Education and alphabetization of blacks also progressed due to WWII. Imprisonment of blacks went down. Unemployment was not that much of an issue at the beginning of the war, but job insecurity and lower salaries were. Blacks especially despised the ''last hired; first fired'' reality. The war helped to elevate salaries and somewhat strengthened their job security (then again, several reasons; one of them being that black leadership worked alongside unions) - which was two main a-a preoccupations. Urbanization of the black population also contributed to a change in their economic life (as well as their political life-especially by providing them electoral leverage...). Etc.

There were several landmark court-rulings during WWII. The Supreme Court's decision in Smith v. Allwright (1944) necessarily comes to mind - as it discredited White Primaries in Texas (and elsewhere in the South by extension). Several equal pay suits were won in State courts. A relatively liberal Supreme court was set in place. By gaining members, the NAACP was more apt to defend more cases in court...

I'm currently procrastinating, so I'll end it there. If you want more info on the subject, feel free to ask. I'll provide you with some insightful readings, but be warned that this is not a consensual period/topic for historians (like most periods and most topics) and that most scholars tend to diminish, erroneously (in my opinion), the importance of WWII for the Civil Rights Movement. I took much of the information I have on the subject from my personal research. I am currently writing my master's thesis on the subject.

That means that I'm procrastinating by writing on the actual subject I should be writing on... for real. Anyway, if you want more info on a specific point, I'll be glad to provide.",null,0,cdmgb7f,1r8evg,askhistorians,top_week,2

idjet,"Heresy in Southern France between Toulouse, the Mediterranean and the Pyrenees mountains was extinguished by what we now can see as a three stages of conflict:


**1140-1208: preaching against heresy**

The Catholic Church identified the 'foxes in the vineyard' - the heretics in Southern France - in the mid 12th century. The first stage of dealing with this heresy was preaching missions. These began with [Cistercian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians) monks like [Bernard de Clairvaux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Clairvaux) who actually travelled south and debated 'heretics' in public in mid 12th century. By 1200 we see the first Papal 'licensed' mendicant preachers in Southern France: Dominic Guzman was one of the first and he later became the saint for whom the Dominican order is named. These Catholic medicant preachers, or the travelling poor preachers, were an attempt by some quarters of the Catholic Church to combat the heretical 'good men' and 'good women' (bon homes, bon femnas) who travelled Southern France from town to town living the life of apostolic poverty and preaching. Most 'heresy' of the high middle ages carried a spirit of apostolic living.

During this period the papacy convened several councils to outlaw various heresies, named and unnamed. Punishments were also prescribed including penances such as forced pilgrimages, excommunication, confiscation of property, prison.

Most proper books on the Cathars will deal with this period to some degree or another. I recommend these books:
A Most Holy War: The Albigensian Crusade and the Battle for Christendom, Mark Pegg (Oxford, 2009), The Cathars, Malcolm Lambert (Wiley-Blackwell, 1998), The Cathars: Dualist Heretics in Languedoc in the High Middle Ages, Malcolm Barber (Routledge, 2000)

*see note below about the term Cathar and the related beliefs


**1209-1229: military operations**

After the murder of papal legate Pierre de Castelnau, supposedly by supporters of one of the greatest counts of southern France, Raymond Count of Toulouse, [Pope Innocent III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocent_III) was able to gather sufficient momentum for an actual crusade into Southern France. While Innocent III sought the involvement of the King of France, Phillip Augustus refused on the grounds that the southern counts were his vassals had not been declared heretics and as such he would not march against his vassals and their property. However, Phillip did permit his northern vassals to campaign in the south should they wish, and many did. The northern French host was eventually lead in military and political matters by [Simon de Montfort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort,_5th_Earl_of_Leicester), and found its religious leader in papal legate [Arnaud Amalric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaud-Amaury). The crusade has become known as the *Albigensian Crusade*, or in some writings of the time, the war of Southern France or war against the Southern Counts.

The [Albigensian Crusade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade) between 1209 and 1229 can be broadly broken into 3 stages: the first stage is the initial conquest of these territories through through siege warfare and few open battles. Through this period the most important counts including the [Trencavels of Carcassonne and Albi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Roger_Trencavel), counts of Foix and Comminges, and [Raymond Count of Toulouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_VI_of_Toulouse) were either killed or displaced and the King of Aragon, Pedro II, died in battle south of Toulouse in Muret. This first part of the war of the south closed with the death of Simon de Montfort in summer of 1218 during an over half-year siege of Toulouse.

Simon's son Amaury proved an ineffective replacement as leader of the southern wars and from 1218 through about 1225 we see second stage in the Crusade: the 'reconquest' of southern lands by the son of the Count of Toulouse, also confusingly called Raymond. Many of the territories which had fallen to Montfort took advantage of the absence of Montfort's strong military dictatorship and personality and shifted allegiances to Raymond and other counts: local northern garrisons were killed or ousted. 

By the mid 1220's after involvement of relations of the King of France and the final declarations of Count Raymond as heretic, Louis VIII took up the crusades directly and marched massive French armies into the south. By 1229 the Treaty of Paris-Meaux between the King of France and Count Raymond was signed which brought to a close the major military operations in the south. 

During the entire period 1209-1229 there were a number of incidences of burning of heretics in small villages and in cities, usually right after successful sieges.

For just a military overview of the crusades, I recommend  Laurence W. Marvin's Occitan War: A Military and Political History of the Albigensian Crusade, 1209-1218 (Cambridge, 2009) . Although he stops with Montfort's death, it gives a good look at the functioning of the wars. 


**1229-1350: the first medieval inquisition**

Into various treaties which resulted from the Crusades were written requirements including:

* towns which were viewed as hotbeds of heresy must erect new or improve and augment existing Catholic Churches

* taxes were levied which were to be contributed directly to Catholic Church

* Counts, Viscounts and other local lords were required to fund abbeys or schools, and this is how the University of Toulouse came to be

* Counts and other lords were required to politically, militarily and legally support the eradication of heresy through the financial and legal support of inquisitions in heretical depravity

The inquisition was not a formalized practice or institution, nor was it directed with central authority. Various local bishops (Toulouse, Pamiers, Narbonne, etc), abbots and friars of local orders (Dominicans of Toulouse) were granted authority from time to time by the Pope to pursue and root out heresy. The political authorities, through their nascent policing arms (*bayles*), were to imprison and at times execute those found by the inquisitors to be irredeemable, or to fine the heretics, to confiscate property, or to apply yellow crosses as a public label or to force pilgrimages.

Mark Pegg's The Corruption of Angels: The Great Inquisition of 1245-1246 (Princeton, 2001) is a very readable introduction to how this early inquisition functioned in Toulouse. Rene Wies' The Yellow Cross: The Story of the Last Cathars' Rebellion Against the Inquisition, 1290-1329  (2002) is good on detail as well, although calling it a rebellion is wrong.


\*note: bear in mind that the term 'Cathar' was *never used as a label for heretics in the south of France before, during or directly after the Albigensian Crusades* by any northern or southern noble, clergy or *crezen* (believer) themself. The term Cathar was applied, likely accidentally, by church historians later. Furthermore there is very little to substantiate that any heresy in southern France in the High Middle Ages constituted anything like dualism or Manichaeism.

This situation changed during WW1. WW1 was extremely expensive for the UK and they had to borrow vast sums from the US. The US emerged from WW1 with about 50% of the world's gold reserves, while the UK was forced off the gold standard and did not return until 1925 (for only six years). The US had also created the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913 so they were able to take advantage of the situation. The Federal Reserve Bank plays a similar role as the Bank of England did.

The United States fully saw itself as part of an Atlantic World and particularly whatever happened in Britain had enormous repercussions in the United States. Abolitionists on both sides of the Atlantic stayed in contact and influenced one another. Pro-Slavery advocates frequently cited British abolition in the West Indies in their defense of slavery. For instance during  introduction of the first gag rule ( which would have ""gagged"" any measure regarding abolition) politicians who noted that there was virtually no abolition movement of note within the United States were countered by arguments that initially there had been little support of abolition within Britain. During the nullification crisis the British West Indies was frequently cited in support of the nullifer camp, and at least one prominent nullifer had conducted extensive business in the British West Indies. *Moral Capital* argues ( convincingly) that the rise of British abolitionism has its' roots in the ideological battles of the American revolution as both Americans and the British entered the idea of slavery as a wrong, in a large public right. The idea became increasingly enshrined and helped end the slave trade for both nations and American abolition within most of the Northern United States.

In 1777 the Vermont Republic (not yet part of the United States at that time) abolished slavery in its constitution.

In 1794, France abolished slavery in all its possessions during the French Revolution.  Napoleon restored slavery for many French colonies in 1802.

In 1804 Haiti declares independence (from France) and abolishes slavery.

In 1807 the Grand Duchy of Warsaw abolishes serfdom.

In 1807 Prussia abolishes serfdom

In 1811 Spain abolishes slavery in Spain and in all colonies except Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo

In 1811 Chile abolishes slavery for all born after that time (but leaves existing slaves as slaves – frees them in 1823)

In 1821 Gran Columbia abolishes slavery

In 1822 Greece abolishes slavery

In 1829 Mexico again (after several previous attempts which were not fully implemented), abolishes slavery).


In 1830 Uruguay abolishes slavery

In 1831 Bolivia abolishes slavery

In 1833 Britain abolishes slavery throughout the British Empire.

In the 1850s Argentina, Peru, and Venezuela abolished slavery

In 1861 Russia frees its serfs

In 1863 slavery abolished in Dutch colonies

XenophonTheAthenian,"Oh god the question to end all questions. Warfare was something the Greeks thought *a lot* about, from Homer on. We're going to have to narrow this down quite a bit.

So for starters, we really don't know anything about warfare in the Mycenaean Period or the Dark Age. We can guess, but that doesn't tell us a whole lot. In reality our first real understanding of warfare comes from Homer, who we can't rely on to actually tell us anything about how wars were really fought. What the Homeric Poems *can* tell us, however, is how warfare was *viewed* at the end of the Dark Age. Modern readers of the Homeric Poems, particularly the *Iliad* often mistake the predominance of violence in Homer as a glorification of war. It is, in no way, such a thing. The war of the heroes is considered glorious and noble, but it's still horrifying. Homer frequently gives us very detailed descriptions of warriors meeting horrific deaths. Sometimes the purpose of this is to show just how impressive a fighter the victor was, but sometimes it's there to draw our attention to just what's really happening when these guys are going at it. Particularly, Homer often points out just how much grief war causes--in fact, the overbearing grief of battle is one of the major catalysts in Homer, acting on Achilles (with Patroclus' death), Priam (with Hector's death), and even Zeus himself (an entire book of the *Iliad* is devoted to Zeus' grief over the fact that his son Sarpedon is fated to die). The epic combats over the bodies of the fallen at the same time portray for us the glory of warriors fighting for honor itself, and also the pointlessness and the horror of what they're doing--after all, these guys are piling up bodies so that they can strip the dead of their armor and leave them lying there naked and dehumanized. And, most importantly in Homer, Achilles, the paragon of war, is very ambiguous. After Patroclus' death Achilles does some *very* questionable things, and leads even his own people to wonder whether he's still really human or whether war and grief have so possessed his mind that he's no longer rational. Of course this turns out not to be the case, when he entertains Priam at his tent, but it betrays a great fear the Greeks had, of losing control, particularly during something as dangerous as battle, as well as the horrific undertones that war had. 

Now, as for the Archaic Period things are somewhat different. Compared to the late Mycenaean Period and Dark Age the Archaic Period is pretty stable. You've got a middle-class rapidly rising, increasing economies everywhere, and expansion of the influence of cities. But all of this is accompanied by constant warfare. Throughout this period as rival states struggle with each other over very limited resources and territory, as well as over influence, war breaks out pretty much every season. But there's something to be understood here. By the time hoplite warfare had taken hold in Greece, warfare was, to the individual soldier, not particularly troublesome. You're a guy protected in heavy armor, the heaviest armor in the world actually, the *you* purchased *yourself*. And you're surrounded by guys exactly like you. This isn't heroic warfare where it's just you and the other guy and you have to prove to everyone that you're better than he is by dismembering him. No, you're operating as a part of a unit, and so long as you do your job and keep your shield up you're probably going to come out of this just fine. The chances of actually getting hurt if you're not in the front couple ranks is pretty slim. So we've got an urban middle class that can assert its own dominance by bearing the responsibilities of defense on its shoulders, with relative safety, along with a population boom and economic growth of an enormous scale. Warfare becomes a major political and economic catalyst, from which we get Plato's statement that during that period every now and then a city decided that it had to just march out, kill some of the men of a rival city, and assert their dominance on the field. Warfare also becomes highly ritualized, with certain rules like the sanctity of heralds (which was already a rule in Homer, but becomes even more important--so important that a couple centuries later when Alexander assaults Tyre much of his justification for the treatment of the city is that the Tyrians butchered the Macedonian heralds), the decision to limit the fighting to a single decisive engagement, allowing the defeated to retrieve their dead from the field, limits on missile troops and cavalry, etc. We also see a rise in mercenaries as the population increases and you have a bunch of people without work going overseas to fight for foreign powers--from this the Egyptians call the Greeks the ""Men of Bronze"" and we also get the poetry of the mercenary-poet Archilochus of Paros. 

Attitudes change following the Persian Wars. The Persians don't adhere to these rules, and they're foreigners attacking the Greek people, who for the first time ever start to consider themselves as a single entity. The Persians are willing to do things like mass crucifixions, mutilation of the dead, and burning of unoccupied cities. They are a barbarian menace, and Greek attitudes towards war change as it becomes important to fight the Persians by any means necessary, even if it means doing things like building a fleet. Fleet-building means that the rowers, the urban poor, become elevated in status, and in Athens this means that they are basically the major military arm of the state. But the Persian Wars are still glorious, as we can see from Herodotus, Aeschylus, and the attitudes that Aristophanes lampoons, precisely because the Greek people heroically fought off an insidious foreign power who didn't adhere to any of the rules of civilized men.

But the point at which things really get intense as regards Greek attitudes towards war is the Peloponnesian War. The Peloponnesian War  is an all-out brawl, and its aftermath is a century of constant fighting with no real resolution until Philip smashes Greek independence. The Peloponnesian War introduces horrors such as naval raids, mass slaughters, total war, light infantry massacres, etc. If you read through the pages of Thucydides you'll find that a point is made to contrast the lofty ideals that both sides claim they are fighting for with the brutal reality of the war--that it is absolute murder on the most pointless scale. In particular, Thucydides is especially interested in the way that the Spartans are hypocritical in their idea of ""justice"" (as seen when they commit mass murder of the entire population of Plataea after a phoney trial where the accused were asked a single question: ""Have you ever assisted the Peloponnesian League in any way?"" a question which the Plataeans, as staunch Athenian allies, could only reply ""No"") and the way that the Athenians, who profess to despise the tyranny of the Spartans and Persians, have become even worse than their enemies all for the sake of surviving. 

The terror of war haunts the Peloponnesian War and its aftermath (just take a look at Aristophanes and you'll see just how awful it was to the average person). This is a total war that lasted about 30 years and which sucked in every state in the Greek world. Following this the Greeks plunge into chaotic warfare as different states each try to take over the old Athenian Empire (and the Peloponnesian League which is heavily weakened and eventually collapses). We've also got an entire generation of men who were raised during the war and, when the war ends, have only known war *for their entire lives*. In fact, there are so many of these guys who only know how to fight and nothing else that the Ten Thousand that Cyrus hired to help him usurp the throne of Persia were only a tiny portion of the soldiers roaming around the Greek world. And let's take a look at some of these guys, starting with the Ten Thousand. Xenophon (who is himself a part of this generation) relates at several points that the Greeks did some questionable things (such as mutilation of the dead), but that it was alright because they were only doing that because the Persians were doing it to them. How unlike the disgust with which Herodotus views the Persian mutilations at Thermopylae. Winning and killing become more important than humanity or honor at this point, which we see when Iphicrates employs a force of only peltasts in the Corinthian War to wipe out a Spartan force marching up to meet him, and then hunts down the survivors mercilessly. All this is only broken when Philip defeats the Greeks, who have essentially destroyed themselves, and puts an end to war between the states (of course there are a lot of rebellions, but I'm not going to get into the Hellenistic Period, it's too complicated as it is).

As to some of your other questions, the idea of a diplomatic corps is a uniquely modern one, which comes out of the Peace of Westphalia and its aftermath. True, the Greeks had heralds to relay diplomatic information, and often important people would be sent on embassies of the state, but they weren't viewed the same way. Diplomatic attempts frequently fell through, although they also often succeeded. 

The difficulty with your questions lies in the fact that they are very widely spread out across a variety of different subjects, many of them only relating to warfare in the barest of ways. I've tried to answer some here, although I'm not sure of how good a job I've done.

There is a much-cited issue of ""Soviet Photo"" from 1937 ([issue 12, if you read Russian it's here](http://journal-club.ru/?q=node/10896)) which has a section at the end for 'articles from foreign journals'. They mention the one-shot three-color process as coming from an American journal. No color sections appear in the 1920s Soviet Photo magazines I saw, telling because American and English magazines from the same time period were regularly publishing color plates. 

Because I cannot read Russian, I realize that my evidence is lacking. But across dozens of Google-Translated web pages, not one has mentioned a ""Soviet pioneer of color photography."" The Russian wikipedia articles for color photography naturally mention Prokudin-Gorskii, but nobody else is mentioned as being a particularly Soviet inventor. [According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svema), the Svema factory in Ukraine produced color materials with equipment from a seized German factory. By the formation of the Soviet Union, the Autochrome was well-known in the photographic community, and journals across Europe had been talking about tricolor methods for decades. 

However, I was able to find information about a pioneering color *cinematographer*. Pavel Mershin, Nikolai Agokas, and Fyodor Provorov are jointly credited with inventing a method of color cinematography around 1931 (the translation makes the exact date unclear). It was the standard two- and three-strip process much like Kodak's invention, but it does appear to have been done independently. Provorov made the Soviet Union's first full-length color motion picture in 1936 and was awarded medals for his contribution to Soviet technology and art. Mershin worked on the 1939 film [Blooming Youth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVjYOQTIR-Y) and received a patent for the process that may still be used today.

ShakaUVM,"&gt;does JFK deserve credit for averting the crisis rather than creating it

I've done a lot of work on the Cuban Missile Crisis recently. Wrote a roleplaying game for it actually! (It's freely available here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49430809/13%20Days%20in%20October.pdf) It's for a high school classroom, but it works equally well for smaller groups of friends.

To answer your question, pretty much everyone in the EXCOMM was for some form of military strike on Cuba except for Dean Rusk and JFK. Even RFK, who later went on to write a rather self-serving autobiography of the event (*Thirteen Days*) rewrote history to make it seem like he was for the blockade when he wasn't originally.

Stern's [The Cuban Missile Crisis in American Memory](http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=22290) is really a must-read for clearing up the misconceptions surrounding the missile crisis. While Stern certainly has a pro-JFK bias from being one of the historians working in his library, I do think his reliance on JFK's secret recordings of the actual EXCOMM conversations gives him a more primary resource to draw from than less reliable sources like Thirteen Days, and conversations that took place years after the fact.

You could certainly argue that JFK did create the crisis, sort of - I mean, the Soviets were smuggling men and missiles into Cuba, and were lying about to the US, so they really did precipitate the crisis by fundamentally misunderstanding the US's response to having missiles so close by (if you read Khrushchev's son on the topic, he speaks eloquently on how Americans have never had the Enemy at the Gates, unlike the Russian people, who have had to deal with this for centuries), but theoretically JFK could have ignored the buildup in Cuba. He might have gotten impeached over it, but I suppose he could have tried to just ignore it. But it didn't fit into the US's cold war strategy of containing the Soviets on all fronts.

I think JFK certainly should be given credit for resolving the crisis without a nuclear exchange. He constantly sought to take the diplomatic approach in resolving the conflict (a stance people like Curtis LeMay felt was hopelessly naive and weak, akin to ""Chamberlain appeasing Hitler"")... which turned out to the correct choice in the conflict.

Cuba, unbeknownst to anyone, actually had operational tactical (short range) nuclear weapons on the island, and could probably have fired off some medium range missiles at the American homeland. In the case of a military attack on the island, they would have turned Guantanamo into a glass parking lot, killing thousands of Americans on the island. This would most likely have resulted in a nuclear response from America (as JFK said, any nuclear attack from Cuba would be treated as a nuclear attack from the USSR), which would probably have resulted in a general nuclear exchange.

Many in the Joint Chiefs felt such an exchange was inevitable, and wanted to get it out of the way before Russia could build up more nuclear weapons. The Soviets at this time had a massive deficit in nuclear weapons - only two dozen ICBMs, versus the hundreds the United States had. The JCS felt that allowing nuclear weapons on Cuba would give the USSR too much ammo for the ""inevitable"" upcoming war. 

So yeah, JFK took the right approach, I think.

&gt;appointing his brother with no legal experience Attorney General

RFK was more like an appointed vice president, that the president relied on much more than LBJ, who got sidelined a lot (and had a mutual hate thing going on with RFK).

&gt;the disastrous attempted invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs

Agreed. You don't commit halfway to invasions.

It's not as well known, but RFK made it one of his personal missions to get Cuba back, and worked with the CIA on Operation Mongoose to overthrow Castro after the Bay of Pigs.

In a real sense, the Bay of Pigs and Operation Mongoose were what caused the Soviets to put missiles there in the first place - they felt that the US wouldn't dare invade an island with nuclear weapons, and were trying to make it a *fait accompli* by revealing the weapons after they were already set up. Only the US's intelligence services ruined the surprise.

ShakaUVM,"&gt;does JFK deserve credit for averting the crisis rather than creating it

I've done a lot of work on the Cuban Missile Crisis recently. Wrote a roleplaying game for it actually! (It's freely available here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49430809/13%20Days%20in%20October.pdf) It's for a high school classroom, but it works equally well for smaller groups of friends.

To answer your question, pretty much everyone in the EXCOMM was for some form of military strike on Cuba except for Dean Rusk and JFK. Even RFK, who later went on to write a rather self-serving autobiography of the event (*Thirteen Days*) rewrote history to make it seem like he was for the blockade when he wasn't originally.

Stern's [The Cuban Missile Crisis in American Memory](http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=22290) is really a must-read for clearing up the misconceptions surrounding the missile crisis. While Stern certainly has a pro-JFK bias from being one of the historians working in his library, I do think his reliance on JFK's secret recordings of the actual EXCOMM conversations gives him a more primary resource to draw from than less reliable sources like Thirteen Days, and conversations that took place years after the fact.

You could certainly argue that JFK did create the crisis, sort of - I mean, the Soviets were smuggling men and missiles into Cuba, and were lying about to the US, so they really did precipitate the crisis by fundamentally misunderstanding the US's response to having missiles so close by (if you read Khrushchev's son on the topic, he speaks eloquently on how Americans have never had the Enemy at the Gates, unlike the Russian people, who have had to deal with this for centuries), but theoretically JFK could have ignored the buildup in Cuba. He might have gotten impeached over it, but I suppose he could have tried to just ignore it. But it didn't fit into the US's cold war strategy of containing the Soviets on all fronts.

I think JFK certainly should be given credit for resolving the crisis without a nuclear exchange. He constantly sought to take the diplomatic approach in resolving the conflict (a stance people like Curtis LeMay felt was hopelessly naive and weak, akin to ""Chamberlain appeasing Hitler"")... which turned out to the correct choice in the conflict.

Cuba, unbeknownst to anyone, actually had operational tactical (short range) nuclear weapons on the island, and could probably have fired off some medium range missiles at the American homeland. In the case of a military attack on the island, they would have turned Guantanamo into a glass parking lot, killing thousands of Americans on the island. This would most likely have resulted in a nuclear response from America (as JFK said, any nuclear attack from Cuba would be treated as a nuclear attack from the USSR), which would probably have resulted in a general nuclear exchange.

Many in the Joint Chiefs felt such an exchange was inevitable, and wanted to get it out of the way before Russia could build up more nuclear weapons. The Soviets at this time had a massive deficit in nuclear weapons - only two dozen ICBMs, versus the hundreds the United States had. The JCS felt that allowing nuclear weapons on Cuba would give the USSR too much ammo for the ""inevitable"" upcoming war. 

So yeah, JFK took the right approach, I think.

&gt;appointing his brother with no legal experience Attorney General

RFK was more like an appointed vice president, that the president relied on much more than LBJ, who got sidelined a lot (and had a mutual hate thing going on with RFK).

&gt;the disastrous attempted invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs

Agreed. You don't commit halfway to invasions.

It's not as well known, but RFK made it one of his personal missions to get Cuba back, and worked with the CIA on Operation Mongoose to overthrow Castro after the Bay of Pigs.

In a real sense, the Bay of Pigs and Operation Mongoose were what caused the Soviets to put missiles there in the first place - they felt that the US wouldn't dare invade an island with nuclear weapons, and were trying to make it a *fait accompli* by revealing the weapons after they were already set up. Only the US's intelligence services ruined the surprise.

vortexvoid,"Baldwin's resignation was primarily a result of his exhaustion. The revelation that France and Britain had tried to buy Italy off as a solution to the Abyssinia Crisis provoked severe criticism that the League of Nations was being betrayed. Baldwin's recently promoted Foreign Minister, Samuel Hoare, was forced to resign over the affair. G.M. Young, who Baldwin selected to write his biography, said 'the truth, I think, is that, as in 1927, but with nearly ten years more to carry, Baldwin was broken in mind.' Baldwin was suffering sleepless nights at this point, and chose to holiday in Wales and Norfolk instead of France to cut down on travelling; his doctors urged him to take three months' rest. After his resignation, he barely read for a year

He was heavily criticised by Churchill (angry that he had not been given Minister of Defence), and on the 12th of November 1936 told the Commons that he had not pursued rearmament more aggressively because there was no mandate. Baldwin cited a by-election in Fulham whilst ignoring the Conservative landslide at the 1935 general election, which suggested that he had considered party politics above the nation's security. 

More generally, Baldwin felt that his time had passed; in an address to the Empire Youth at Albert Hall he said 'I have had my hour. I pass soon into the shade'. Upon becoming Prime Minister for the final time, he wrote to his aunt that 'If my health lasts, I hope to do a couple of years but I don't want a longer time. I think by then I shall have given out all that I have to give, and I should like to retire while still in possession of such faculties as I have!'

Having always planned to resign within a couple of years, Baldwin found the physical and mental stresses of his final ministry too great to continue for any longer. The successful aversion of a constitutional crisis provided a good point to leave: he told a backbench MP that 'I had a success, my dear Nicolson, at the moment I most needed it. Now is the time to go.'

In what context did you get this assignment? What readings or other materials has your class been working with? 

This question is far too large for the professor to expect you to just go and find out ""the answer."" There is a massive literature on this subject, going back to at least Eric Williams in the 1940s. It's massive because this question gets to the heart of the narrative of Britain's--and Europe's, and even the world's--modernity, via the industrial revolution. For a long time, scholars assumed that Britain's industrial revolution was generated by internal factors: the development of markets for land, labor, and capital; inventions; domestic demand; whatever else. Williams and others came along and argued that in fact it was Britain's position in the Atlantic economy, an economy built on slave labor, that allowed them to accumulate the capital necessary to industrialize. To my knowledge that has been refuted by work showing that early industrialization was not especially capital-intensive, although the importance of slavery continues in other ways. Historians have argued that the slave plantation was a model for the factory-style organization of labor, or that the Atlantic plantation complex was a vital external market that allowed Britain to develop particular core-periphery relationships on an intercontinental scale.

Significant enough. Professor Craig Simpson estimates that 20% of the capital involved in driving industrial development was linked to the American South's slave system. The textile mills that were a cornerstone of many industrial towns in England were getting cotton in large measure, though not exclusively, from the Cotton Belt in the South, which was picked almost entirely by slaves or at best workers complicit in a slaveholding social order. 

On top of the cotton/textile industry, there was a tremendous push for sugar that, until 1838-39 (4-5 years after the Emancipation of 1834), was deeply invested in slavery and profited greatly from it. Even post emancipation, areas that produced sugar that were not necessarily part of the Empire proper but had very close ties (such as Brazil) were utilizing slavery. The British tastes involved a tremendous amount of sugar as tea became a more popular drink, and they demanded plenty of it. 

The Atlantic slave system is massively valuable, even after Britain ""emancipates"" its slaves in 1834, and the British economy, being based on global trade, profits greatly from it.

mormengil,"Well, there was no slavery in Britain in the 18th century (for all intents and purposes), so any significance of slavery on the British Economy must come from external trade from two possible sources:

1.	 The British Empire

a.	The Caribbean Sugar Colonies

b.	The North American colonies, where slaves were used to farm tobacco, rice and indigo (in the 18th century).

2.	Trade with non-imperial slave dependent economies

a.	The slave trade – transporting slaves to non-imperial colonies in British ships

b.	Trade with Spanish, French, Portuguese, America



You will need to do some research to figure out how significant these possible economic vectors were to the overall British Economy.

My own hypotheses would be:

The British Sugar Colonies in the Caribbean were probably the largest single slavery impact on the British Economy.

The overall impact of all the slavery economic vectors on the British Economy was probably only a small percent of the total British Economy.


By the way, it is possible that even if the impact of slavery was small relative to the total British economy, it still might have been important.  In your research, you will find there is a theory that the slavery system provided the surpluses of capital which funded the industrial revolution.

The ethical debate however grew each year mid 1700's until slavery was officialy abandoned in the 19th century.

Bakuraptor,"In brief, Britain is able to enjoy a dominant position in the slave trade (to the Caribbean, primarily) because of its dominant naval position in the eighteenth century, which enabled its merchants to achieve preferred status on many goods but particularly notably with slavery. However, its contribution to the British economy diminished over the course of the century; the growth of the emancipation movement followed a decline in the importance of Slavery towards British commerce (indeed, in the revolutionary wars of the 1790s, the attempts of the French to infiltrate British colonies with 'free coloureds' and incite rebellion almost made it a liability. You might want to try Brewer's 'Sinews of Power' for the link between the British Navy and Merchant Navy in the 18th century; for the second point about the revolutionary war, the chapter about the British empire in 'The French Revolution and British Popular Politics', by Philp, may prove helpful.

BeondTheGrave,"To get a better answer, I think you need to differentiate between **Revolutions** and **Rebellion**. A rebellion, or revolt, is when a group of people refuse to do something. The tax rebellion is the most common of these kinds of revolts, and has an obvious cause. After the offending tax is removed (or the rebellion put down) the cause for violence and resistance ends. 

A Revolution, on the other hand, is the complete overthrow of the government. Violence is a major component of revolutions as well.  Usually, revolutionaries attempt to create a new, *different* kind of government to replace it. The French Revolution is the progenitor of most modern revolutions, and we can see the general difference between revolution and revolt. The French kill their king and establish a new form of government, a republic. They then battle for several years about what kind of republic France will become, until the whole thing falls apart and Napoleon becomes Emperor. But the French revolution is one from the left (spectrum of politics). It ushers in equality, democracy, and all sorts of wonderful, classically liberal, policies. But, in the context of modern revolutions, you can also have revolutions from the right. This is best shown by the Nazi revolution of the 1930s, which destroys democracy in Germany. 

So now weve clarified terms a bit. So to answer your question more directly, people have rebelled for as long as there has been people. Its a natural thing to do, especially for young people. As for revolutions, thats a sticker answer, and depends on how you want to play with your definitions. The French Revolution created our modern conception of what a revolution looked like, and most of the major 20th century revolutions were in some ways influenced by the FR. But thats our *modern conception*. There are revolutions in early history that resemble the French (like the Roman Revolution), and modern revolutions that dont (like the Velvet Revolution). Thus, because it is so hard to define what exactly a revolution is, its hard to figure out what was actually a revolution and what wasnt. Some historians will snicker at the American Revolution, for example, and say it was only an overblown tax rebellion. 

And to really throw a wrench into your thinking, there are greater paradigm shifts which are called Revolutions. A great example would be the Industrial Revolution, which completely changed the world worked. Some of these paradigm shift revolutions can go back thousands of years, to the Agricultural revolution when people switched from Hunter-Gatherers to agricultural people.

zuzahin,"I wouldn't say it's a widely held belief as much as any photograph nowadays is 'altered' (levels adjusted, saturation, curves, contrast, brightness, all this junk), but it's definitely a theory that isn't denied or disputed in any major way, Lange most likely staged a lot of her photographs, but we will just never know. The problem with this sort of theory is that most photographs from that day and age were hand-picked out of a BUNCH of photographs. Recently in a class I had, we were watching a documentary called 'Er Du Mors Lille Dreng?' (Are you momma's little boy?), that centered around 2 mentally handicapped people who gave birth to a child, and that child's trouble with life, both legal and physically/mentally, Lars Høj, the producer, gave some good quotes aswell, one that I will share here:  

* *I believe it's a grown myth that it's possible for a T.V. Crew to become one with the surroundings, to become the so-called 'Fly on the wall'. We'll always atleast be an annoying bee in the room, that everyone notices every now and again.*

Basically what you can take from this, and what I took from it, is that nothing can really be perceived to be what happened during the time it was captured. What Lange captured was what she saw, and not what you might've seen in the situation. Some say she posed the mothers hand to indicate a hint of worry, pondering about the future, and their current troubles, and others say the reason the children's heads are turned away is because it removes any 'fake' emotion they might have (Also because they were supposedly laughing and playing around when Lange was capturing the photographs), but all these are just theories. [Here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LBRoOF0MNW0/SjkJ-mRX2UI/AAAAAAAAAOk/jdkm1V76CrE/s1600-h/dorothea_lange_migrant_mother_family.jpg) and [here](http://cphmag.com/-/2013/05/Dorothea-Lange-Destitute-pea-pickers-in-California.-Mother-of-seven-children.-Age-thirty-two.-Nipomo-CA-1936-02-lg.jpg) are 2 images of the same subjects taken consecutively, and only the first one would have sort of the same impact as the popular one we have today.

Lange herself had this to say in 1960, looking back on the photographs some 25-30 years earlier:

* *I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother, as if drawn by a magnet. I do not remember how I explained my presence or my camera to her, but I do remember she asked me no questions. I made five exposures, working closer and closer from the same direction. I did not ask her name or her history. She told me her age, that she was thirty-two. She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed. She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food. There she sat in that lean-to tent with her children huddled around her, and seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me. There was a sort of equality about it.*

I don't know if the government knew what she did, but she brought home the job that she was hired to do, her main job with the Resettlement Administration/Farm Security Administration was to show the American government that these people needed help, and staging photographs was one such way of going about that, Roy Stryker, the head of the Information Department of the F.S.A., said that he believed that *'showing the public the plight of the farmer would lead to support for government aid to the rural poor.'* This means that she might've staged them, Stryker might've known what she did, and she might've just simply photographed what was there. In my opinion, Lange is one of the 'cleaner' B/W photographers out there. Her images seemingly have no trace of being altered, and I think this is what owes to her success, aswell as her subject matters. In any case, the reason Stryker hired her was quite simple, he liked her previous works with the immigrants in California. Maybe he was aware she staged them, maybe he wasn't, but he had this to say in response to a reporters question about 'Composition':

* *The word ""composition"" was never talked about, never mentioned. It was a taboo word. We didn't talk about composition. I don't like the word. I think it's been loaded with all sorts of very spurious things. They try and get in the electrical and so on compositions. No. We had none of this. Photographers were intelligent people that worked for us. They were communicating. They were intelligent enough -- some of them had art training -- they were intelligent enough to sense what they were doing. They were trying to tell us, tell the public, make pictures that were genuine, that recognized peculiar situations whether it be a piece of geography or a human being, and recognized the pertinent things in this particular situation. They had taken the time to check certain facts or investigate, to understand why they were at that place, and what they were going to do. From that point on, ten pictures were taken. Of those ten pictures, if you looked at them -- we never evaluated them in terms of set values. We looked at them in terms of what did they have to say about this little group of people, this particular village, this particular dust area, or what.*

Odds are he knew that every photographer did things differently, he would obviously know the inner workings of how photography worked as Stryker was a photographer himself, so I'm sure he had a very good idea of the cogs and wheels behind the operation, but I'm not sure if he ever disliked it. 

As for staging, yeah, every photographer did it (Generalizing here), the most famous example of 'staging' in my mind is George N. Barnard who shot images such as [these](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Atlanta_roundhouse_ruin.jpg) with a double-exposed sky (2 photographs stitched together in the darkroom), which is as much of a lie as a staged image really is, in some respects, as that sky would never be present with the light-sensitive emulsions and slow exposure times, and limited cameras, of that era. So I don't know where you'd draw the line. Robert Capa is another example that springs to mind. His most famous photograph, the Falling Soldier, is also widely disputed and hailed as a fake, but I don't know man, it brought the message across, it shocked people, it awed people, it *touched* people, just like Lange's [Migrant Mother series](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Florence_Owens_Thompson_montage_by_Dorothea_Lange.jpg) did. However, in that last link, you see something very important that was omitted from the final take - The children don't seem to be so depressed as you see them in the most famous version of the photograph! Dorothea Lange later said (As a continuation of the quote in 1960):

* *... the pea crop at Nipomo had frozen and there was no work for anybody. But I did not approach the tents and shelters of other stranded pea-pickers. It was not necessary; I knew I had recorded the essence of my assignment.*

She was sent out to show how badly the people in that camp had it, and she did what she had been asked to do - and damned if she didn't succeed - supposedly after 2 of the photographs of the Migrant Mother was published in newspapers, the government rushed to ship out 10 tons of food to the camp, and some say it also influenced Steinbeck's 'Grapes of Wrath', but these last 2 aren't backed by a source, so I wouldn't really hold them accountable. :)",null,0,cdkglbg,1r7me3,askhistorians,top_week,6

A Jew trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto is rather different than a civilian living in Britain, but I'm going to tentatively suggest that there wasn't the same systematic attempt to collect this information in Britain.

I don't think people started collecting Vietnam veterans' recollections until the 1980's (and even then, not as massive systematic projects). Slave narratives weren't collected in America until the *1930's* when slavery ended c. 1865.

For example in Britain (with the threat of invasion) men above the age of 55 but below about 70 could serve in the Home Guard, or join up for special constabulary roles with the police. People had soldiers billeted with them, petrol strictly controlled, and things made of metal were suddenly in short supply.

Imagine having an air raid siren sound, and how difficult it would be for some elderly persons to physically evacuate. In Europe, elderly refugees fared poorly on the road. Imagine the sudden grief of young family members dying.

As other people have pointed out, older people did write dairies and letters about their experiences at war; many of these still exist. They are perhaps not as famous as their counterparts from the young - those that fought the war claimed the authority to speak about it afterwards, and those voices which fell outside that narrative tended to get lost.

From their dairies, it tends to be more selfish in the present; the pressing concerns of the now almost override the thinking about the future.

yodatsracist,"In the Warsaw Ghetto, Emmanuel Ringelblum (who, not coincidentally, had PhD in History from Warsaw University) started a secret project to document life in the Ghetto called ""Oyneg Shabbos"" (""Joy of the Sabbath""). The Oyneg Shabbos archive, containing diaries, letters, ticket stubs, ration cards, posters, etc., was hidden in three different caches, only two of which were found after the War. You can find out more on Yad vaShem's website and on wikipedia and in a new biography of Ringelblum. 

A Jew trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto is rather different than a civilian living in Britain, but I'm going to tentatively suggest that there wasn't the same systematic attempt to collect this information in Britain. Social History reached new heights only after World War II (see people like E. P. Thompson, etc.) and Oral History emerged even later. Now we have things like the [9/11 Oral History project](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/9-11.html) and the [Library of Congress Veterans Oral History Project](http://www.loc.gov/vets/) which started collecting Iraq and Afghanistan veterans' oral histories before those wars were even over but that's new. I don't think people started collecting Vietnam veterans' recollections until the 1980's (and even then, not as massive systematic projects). Slave narratives weren't collected in America until the *1930's* when slavery ended c. 1865. Until social history and then oral history came to prominence, to my knowledge, there wasn't a same value given to these narratives of events even in retrospect, nevermind as they were going on.

WedgeHead,"Southern Mesopotamia changed a lot over the thousands of years of history.  Technological and social changes can make a huge difference in the answers to the questions you are posing.  Since you mention Nippur, Lagash, and Marad, I am going to focus on the late Third Millennium BCE.

First, yes, the region is quite small compared to modern settlements, but remember that even 20 miles is nearly a full day's walk away, and these cities would have been virtually the only major structures on the map.  Even in neighborhoods in the exact same city, significant cultural differences can appear over time.  The ancient world was no different in this respect, and remember that we are viewing multitudes of centuries of growth and change when we examine them from so far away.

In the Early Dynastic Period (~2900–2300 BCE), the various city-states of southern Mesopotamia were diverse and dynamic centers.  They probably spoke languages that were different enough from one another to be considered different dialects, if not fully different languages.  They worshiped different patron deities, had different calendars, and they had a whole variety of different local religious traditions.  How many of these differences before they start to seem, well, different from one's own home?  Who can say?  But they were certainly different enough that it was a big deal when Sargon later conquered them and united them into a single administrative unit.  And the differences were enough to compel them to keep rebelling against the Akkadian kings throughout their brief period of domination.

Horses and dromedaries would not be introduced into Mesopotamia until later, in the 2nd and 1st millenniums BCE respectively.  In this early period, the primary mode of daily travel was by foot, possibly assisted by a hand cart, or by river boat for long distance travel.  Heavier loads could also be put on larger, four-wheeled carts that were pulled by asses.  

It is difficult to make precise estimates about travel times because there are so many variables in particular routes and time periods, but if we used the trade route itineraries from a slightly later period, like the route to Emar document mentioned by /u/asdjk482 previously, then you could take a very rough guess of an average travel speed of about 3 miles per hour.  Most land travel was at night, and most long distance travel was centered broadly around the summer season.

Finally, as to your additional question, the names for small villages in the third millennium BCE were largely unrecorded.  Residents of the various villages would be considered residents of the nearby city (temple-sanctuary, really) if they traveled abroad, so the only time we see names for the smaller areas are in early administrative documents.  Modern archaeologists use the modern (Arabic) names for most of these sites today.

BeondTheGrave,"&gt;I can't picture the South winning so many battles with just good Generals, territorial advantage -and morale.-[Not really true, especially in the lower ranks]

This is exactly the advantage the South need to win, *in the east*. But lets be clear, they didnt win. They infact lost, it just took four years. And that is largely due to the competency of Robert E Lee (and perhaps the incompetence of Union Generals). Robert E Lee is often called the American Napoleon, and for good reason. He adopted the precepts laid out by Napoleon to his specific situation, and repeatedly won battles against a numerically superior opponent. It was because Lee hit the Union Army so hard, at its weakest points, that he was able to repeatedly win victories. Not only that, but he was a master a repositioning his army to allow him to do so, a feat in itself. 

But, Lee lost. And thats because of the Unions massive advantages, which you mentioned. They had more men, more guns, more ships, more cannons, everything. And lets go back to Lee, who fights these spectacular, but bloody, battles. And while he wins, each time he has to spend some materiel which he will rarely replace. So in many ways, Lee's battlefield victories actually accelerate the destruction of the Confederacy. 

And lets also bring in the Western theaters, where the Union consistently *won*. By 1863 the Mississippi River was solidly in Union control, armies were invading across the river and down out of Ohio into Kentucky and Tennessee. And at sea, the Blockade of the South was strengthened, and made more complete. So while Lee is winning battles up North (due to his amazing tactical sense), the Confederacy is being strangled by the Union Anaconda Plan.  ",null,1,cdkff0h,1r7dwx,askhistorians,top_week,5
abt137,"Well, they won many battles in the East, the West was not the case, Union forces there achieved victories and progress almost since day 1.
Imagination focuses on Virginia and Lee's Army of Northern Virginia that did drive crazy the Union Army of the Potomac for 3 years. Now, the Union Command in the West was plagued by hesitant generals, political quarrels and lack of strategic vision, even then the Union was close to conquer Richmond should not Joe Johnston been wounded and Lee put in command, McClellan was then at the gates of Richmond.
The HUGE advantages you refer too should be explained and may be relative, for instance almost the whole Navy was Federal. If you refer to manpower and industrial capability that does not make it all in sheer numbers, you would be surprised to see that the Union army was actually the main supplier of the Confederate Army. Endless small arms, ammo, medical supplies and artillery would be collected by the Confederates as battle prizes and put into service quickly.
Sheer numbers are not everything, risk taking initiatives and leadership can alter the balance and I'd say this is the case in the East. Lee, Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson were daring and audacious against a conservative and often hesitant Union command. 
Small details also play their role, as an example Confederates would replenish the ranks with new recruits infusing them in the existing regiments achieving a mix of veterans and rookies. The Union by contrast would muster into service whole new regiments without any combat experience, this difference alone may tilt the balance of a battle.
one hand once Lee achieved victories he would have a powerful psychological advantage as many Union officers could not make their heads around a strategy to defeat him. There is an incident in which Grant has assumed command of Union armies and his generals were discussing what Lee's next movement would be, Grant enraged replied something along the lines ""Tell me what you are going to do not Lee"". Lee managed to read his opponents intentions very well and take risks against them. ",null,0,cdo6sti,1r7dwx,askhistorians,top_week,1

Das_Mime,"This is an extraordinarily broad question, as the specific factors influencing changes in various religions are different depending on what religion, locale, and time period you're talking about. 

I'll give you an example, which is taken pretty much directly from [a lecture series by Peter Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d47N2GHZJxs&amp;list=PLn_Ux4BxYOsb4UrsZVQcjbIBRP_YODmDd) about the development of two widely disparate monastic traditions in Egypt and Syria. During the 3rd and 4th centuries, monasticism began to be a significant religious practice in Christianity. People would forsake their worldly possessions and go to live in the desert or go wandering, often shunning most contact with other people in the former case. By giving up their treasure on earth, they would obtain ""treasure in heaven"". [Anthony the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great) is the best known of these, and one of the earliest. His biography, written by Athanasius of Alexandria, was very influential to the development of the Western monastic tradition. As for the regional distinctions, Brown points out that in Egypt, monastics generally lived in small groups which would be self-sufficient, producing all the food they needed and never having to rely on donations for survival. As such, it was a retreat involving considerable manual labor in established monastic communities. In Syria, on the other hand, monastics tended to be mendicant beggars, wandering from place to place and relying on charity. In both cases, the monks are seen as being holy, or angelic in a certain sense, because they have managed to separate themselves from the primary earthly concern. One cultural conundrum which must be overcome is how these monks, who have taken vows of poverty (in both cases) can accept gifts (which were in some cases rather substantial) without being tainted by profane nature of money. A gift engenders obligation, so the problem was how the ""holy poor"", the monks, could be the institutional recipients of gifts without becoming indebted to the giver.

Brown argues that in the Syrian region, the ""human condition"", as people conceived of it, was work. The Fall of Adam and Eve had been a ""fall from work-free abundance of Eden into the present world of toil"". Christ is often conceived of as a second Adam, and this idea was especially present in Syria. Brown points out that angels were not conceived of as being distant otherworldly beings, but rather more closely present. ""An angel is what an angel does, and one thing which an angel does *not* do is work."" So for monastics, to live as a mendicant, without toil, makes them angelic in a sense, and therefore to be capable of receiving money without being corrupted by it. They were ""engaged in the sacred labor of prayer on behalf of all humans"". The Syrian monks were similar in many ways to the elect of the Manichaeans, a highly ascetic, syncretic religion whose monastics subsisted entirely on the donations of the faithful.

In Egypt, the human condition was the constant threat of famine. Egypt was a society which relied entirely on yearly flooding of the Nile in order to make the land fertile for agriculture. If the floods were lacking, hunger was not far away. Many ancient writings, not least of all the story of Joseph and the dream of seven lean years, highlight the weight with which hunger weighed on the Egyptian consciousness. Egyptian monks, in contrast to their Syrian counterparts, labored extensively. Their monasteries were self-sufficient and often produced extra food, providing food to people nearby in times of famine. By their industriousness they were freed from the fear of famine. Because they needed nothing and could exist entirely on their own, they did not have an obligation to the givers, which is how it was possible for them to receive such gifts and yet not be touched by the stain of economic obligation. Their gifts were largely given onward to the poor. Anthony the Great, who was in many ways the progenitor of the later Christian monastic tradition, gave all his possessions to the poor, moved to the desert, staunchly refused to accept any alms, and usually refused to even see anyone. Work itself became sacred to the Egyptian monks, [""The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.""](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+3%3A10&amp;version=NIV)

These two competing modes of monastic holiness highlight the diversity present in early Christianity. The Syrian model, of course, dwindled in the Christian tradition over the course of Late Antiquity, transitioning into the early Middle Ages when organized, agricultural monasteries with industriously toiling monks was the norm. At the same time, Manichaeism, which was similar to the Syrian tradition in the element of the ascetic, alms-dependent monk, died out in the Mediterranean region over the same time period. The exact reasons why one model won out over the other are very difficult, at best, to pin down, but one explanation is that as the Church became more closely tied in to the Empire and grew in power and organization, it found that groups of monks &amp; nuns living in organized, hierarchical communities were easier to keep a handle on than were wandering preachers. One of the themes which recurs throughout the history of the Church is the struggle between the Papacy, bishops, archbishops, abbots, cardinals, and various secular rulers for autonomy or control. Many people today think of the Catholic Church as being an extremely centralized, top-down organization, and in many ways that's true for the 21st century Church. But in, say, the 6th century, when it might take months to get from Rome to some far-flung church or monastery in France or Asia Minor, such a level of control was not reasonable, and moreover many clergy would not have stood for it. Another reason is that after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, population declined (especially in the plague outbreak of 541), cities shrunk, and roads became less safe. As a result, there was less of a support base for mendicant ascetics and wandering was a more dangerous occupation, leading to the prevalence of largely self-sufficient monasteries as the primary mode of Christian asceticism.

Mendicant monastics did not disappear from history entirely, however; they had a resurgence in the High Middle Ages, specifically the 13th century. The Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, and others reinstituted the model of the itinerant preacher. I'm less familiar with the history of those orders, the High Middle Ages were a period of significant increases in population, wealth, and urbanization, especially in northern Italy where most of the mendicant orders originated.",null,5,cdkedbo,1r79ls,askhistorians,top_week,46

When you have a religion which was primarily followed because it was mandated and enforced by the political and social structure, when that political structure changes, the religion will often just atrophy away or merge with a new syncretic religion.

Das_Mime,"This is an extraordinarily broad question, as the specific factors influencing changes in various religions are different depending on what religion, locale, and time period you're talking about. 

I'll give you an example, which is taken pretty much directly from [a lecture series by Peter Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d47N2GHZJxs&amp;list=PLn_Ux4BxYOsb4UrsZVQcjbIBRP_YODmDd) about the development of two widely disparate monastic traditions in Egypt and Syria. During the 3rd and 4th centuries, monasticism began to be a significant religious practice in Christianity. People would forsake their worldly possessions and go to live in the desert or go wandering, often shunning most contact with other people in the former case. By giving up their treasure on earth, they would obtain ""treasure in heaven"". [Anthony the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great) is the best known of these, and one of the earliest. His biography, written by Athanasius of Alexandria, was very influential to the development of the Western monastic tradition. As for the regional distinctions, Brown points out that in Egypt, monastics generally lived in small groups which would be self-sufficient, producing all the food they needed and never having to rely on donations for survival. As such, it was a retreat involving considerable manual labor in established monastic communities. In Syria, on the other hand, monastics tended to be mendicant beggars, wandering from place to place and relying on charity. In both cases, the monks are seen as being holy, or angelic in a certain sense, because they have managed to separate themselves from the primary earthly concern. One cultural conundrum which must be overcome is how these monks, who have taken vows of poverty (in both cases) can accept gifts (which were in some cases rather substantial) without being tainted by profane nature of money. A gift engenders obligation, so the problem was how the ""holy poor"", the monks, could be the institutional recipients of gifts without becoming indebted to the giver.

Brown argues that in the Syrian region, the ""human condition"", as people conceived of it, was work. The Fall of Adam and Eve had been a ""fall from work-free abundance of Eden into the present world of toil"". Christ is often conceived of as a second Adam, and this idea was especially present in Syria. Brown points out that angels were not conceived of as being distant otherworldly beings, but rather more closely present. ""An angel is what an angel does, and one thing which an angel does *not* do is work."" So for monastics, to live as a mendicant, without toil, makes them angelic in a sense, and therefore to be capable of receiving money without being corrupted by it. They were ""engaged in the sacred labor of prayer on behalf of all humans"". The Syrian monks were similar in many ways to the elect of the Manichaeans, a highly ascetic, syncretic religion whose monastics subsisted entirely on the donations of the faithful.

In Egypt, the human condition was the constant threat of famine. Egypt was a society which relied entirely on yearly flooding of the Nile in order to make the land fertile for agriculture. If the floods were lacking, hunger was not far away. Many ancient writings, not least of all the story of Joseph and the dream of seven lean years, highlight the weight with which hunger weighed on the Egyptian consciousness. Egyptian monks, in contrast to their Syrian counterparts, labored extensively. Their monasteries were self-sufficient and often produced extra food, providing food to people nearby in times of famine. By their industriousness they were freed from the fear of famine. Because they needed nothing and could exist entirely on their own, they did not have an obligation to the givers, which is how it was possible for them to receive such gifts and yet not be touched by the stain of economic obligation. Their gifts were largely given onward to the poor. Anthony the Great, who was in many ways the progenitor of the later Christian monastic tradition, gave all his possessions to the poor, moved to the desert, staunchly refused to accept any alms, and usually refused to even see anyone. Work itself became sacred to the Egyptian monks, [""The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.""](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+3%3A10&amp;version=NIV)

These two competing modes of monastic holiness highlight the diversity present in early Christianity. The Syrian model, of course, dwindled in the Christian tradition over the course of Late Antiquity, transitioning into the early Middle Ages when organized, agricultural monasteries with industriously toiling monks was the norm. At the same time, Manichaeism, which was similar to the Syrian tradition in the element of the ascetic, alms-dependent monk, died out in the Mediterranean region over the same time period. The exact reasons why one model won out over the other are very difficult, at best, to pin down, but one explanation is that as the Church became more closely tied in to the Empire and grew in power and organization, it found that groups of monks &amp; nuns living in organized, hierarchical communities were easier to keep a handle on than were wandering preachers. One of the themes which recurs throughout the history of the Church is the struggle between the Papacy, bishops, archbishops, abbots, cardinals, and various secular rulers for autonomy or control. Many people today think of the Catholic Church as being an extremely centralized, top-down organization, and in many ways that's true for the 21st century Church. But in, say, the 6th century, when it might take months to get from Rome to some far-flung church or monastery in France or Asia Minor, such a level of control was not reasonable, and moreover many clergy would not have stood for it. Another reason is that after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, population declined (especially in the plague outbreak of 541), cities shrunk, and roads became less safe. As a result, there was less of a support base for mendicant ascetics and wandering was a more dangerous occupation, leading to the prevalence of largely self-sufficient monasteries as the primary mode of Christian asceticism.

Mendicant monastics did not disappear from history entirely, however; they had a resurgence in the High Middle Ages, specifically the 13th century. The Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, and others reinstituted the model of the itinerant preacher. I'm less familiar with the history of those orders, the High Middle Ages were a period of significant increases in population, wealth, and urbanization, especially in northern Italy where most of the mendicant orders originated.",null,5,cdkedbo,1r79ls,askhistorians,top_week,46

missginj,"Australian history isn't my field, so I can't speak to the specific case of New South Wales in Australia. I do know that the name ""The New Principality of South Wales"" was assigned to the southern coast of Hudson Bay (in present-day Canada) by Welshman Thomas James in the 1630s. The question of why Cook chose NSW seems to be more uncertain. I know we have a couple of Australia experts around here, so hopefully someone who can shed some more light on this will see this question.

In addition, I can point out as a matter of general interest (maybe?) that, in general, the mapping and naming of places in Australia, as in other colonies, was part of the act of claiming and ultimately taking possession of land that was inhabited by Indigenous people and was also being contested between rival expansionist powers in the Pacific. Mapping and naming were means of symbolically conceptualizing these areas as new edges of empire(s), even before any actual European settlement had taken place. By assigning place names with ties to Britain or even to their own personal lives, for example, colonizers like James Cook and Matthew Flinders imagined these areas as part of the British Empire. This process played into the geopolitical tensions between imperial states that defined European politics at this time, especially between England, France, and Spain, whose colonizers often mapped their *own* conceptualizations of these spaces through French and Spanish lenses and points of reference -- in direct contest with their British counterparts. Significantly, naming places in these ways also marked a significant element of colonizers' attempts to imagine/racialize these as white spaces.

intangible-tangerine,"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gvr98/how_did_the_practice_of_blindfolding_or_hooding/ 

This is answered here in regard to Common law.

In summary 

The cultural importance of death was such that it had to occur in a dignified way, even if it was an execution of a criminal. 

The hood was used to spare the audience from having to see the agonised face of the condemned and to save the condemned from being exposed at such a time. It was meant as a kindness.

brigantus,"Ukraine has actually oscillated between farming and pastoralism several times in its history. Between 5,000 and 3,000 BCE it was home to the one of the most populous farming societies in prehistoric Europe, the [Cucuteni-Tripolye culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucuteni-Trypillian_culture). Early pastoral economies in eastern Ukraine grew up in the shadow of that culture and maintained a mixed farming/herding, semi-sedentary lifestyle for several millennia. Steppe nomads held sway throughout most of the Bronze and Iron Ages, but by the early medieval period the nomadic Scythians/Sarmatians seem to have been edged out by sedentary peoples; first the Goths, then the Slavs. They formed the basis of Kievan Rus', a sophisticated urban state centred on Kiev. Turkic nomads dominated the area after the collapse of Kievan Rus' until the 17th–19th, when the Russian Empire gradually consolidated its power in the region and encouraged agricultural settlement. And there have been prosperous agricultural cities in Crimea continuously since at least the 5th century BCE.

It's easy to understand this if you look at Ukraine's geography. The fact that it essentially (if you ignore the Carpathians) consists of one gigantic plain might make it seem homogeneous, but it actually has quite a variable climate. The western part, in the Carpathian foothills up to the Bug, can be classed with temperate Europe. Crimea and the Black Sea coast has a Mediterranean climate. The bulk of the country is steppe, but this is only the breadbasket it is today because of modern agricultural technology. Ancient farmers had to contest with how arid the region is and that's why the major river valleys have always been such crucial areas for settlement. The steppe also isn't homogeneous internally; it's a layer cake. In the south there is a very arid band of desert-steppe, which grades into a slightly wetter true steppe further north, which in turn grades into forest-steppe and eventually the temperate forests of central Russia. The boundaries between these bands are blurry and have fluctuated in the long term.

We can draw a few general principles of Ukraine's history from its geography:

1. until very recently the core steppe region was only inhabitable by pastoral nomads;

2. but farmers—who have always flourished in temperate western Ukraine and the Mediterranean Black Sea coast—can make a living in the forest-steppe and in the valleys of the major rivers that cut through the country;

3. this makes the transitional zone between those two climatic zones—which is fuzzy and mobile to begin with—something of a battleground. 

Sometimes nomads get the upper hand, sometimes the farmers. Historically it wasn't until the 19th century that the region became fully sedentary, and that was only possible because of modern arable farming, irrigation, and a concerted effort by the Russian state against its nomadic population.

rosemary85,"Kagan is giving a loose translation of the Greek word *basileus*. For our purposes here, the word has two meanings:

1. in Homeric epic: pretty much any independent authority figure who has authority over people who live in his vicinity; in modern anthropological terms, [the closest English expression would be ""Big Man"".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_man_(anthropology\))

2. in later Greek (Classical Period onwards): ""king"".

This is why he goes on to lay stress on the fact that Nestor calls Agamemnon *basileutatos*, ""most Big Man-ish"" or as Kagan says ""most kingly"". (Nestor doesn't actually call him that until book 9, line 69, but never mind.) ""King"" in this context should be understood as a stand-in for Big Man.

I for one would be very happy if every translation of the *Iliad* from now until forever translated *basileus* as Big Man. It may sound odd, but anyone teaching the *Iliad* really ought to confront the idea of what *basileus* means at some point anyway, so it's not going to make things any simpler to pretend that it equates to ""king"". Basically, ""king"" is a needless simplification, and (as your experience shows) it only causes confusion.

This does come with certain corollaries, such as the fact that *basileus* is a quality, not a post, and as a result (a) it's not exclusive to a single individual, and (b) it's not always necessarily heritable from father to son; that should help explain why Achilleus is a *basileus* while his father Peleus is still alive. In fact it's rather doubtful whether Peleus should be considered a *basileus* at the time of the *Iliad*, since we're told that he is openly disrespected by those who were formerly his people.

Until the wars of unification, the Pope ruled a piece of land in central Italy called the Papal States that divided the peninsula in half. This was meant to increase the wealth, power, and influence the pope had, especially over the Italian city states, who's division was to his benefit. 

With the increase in Italian nationalism in the years and decades following the Napoleonic wars, coupled with the quickly diminishing influence the pope was able to wield with his spiritual powers (threat of excommunication), Italian forces grew bolder and seized papal territory, and later decided to make Rome the new capital of the Kingdom of Italy. This PISSED off the pope royally, and he got France to send a garrison to Rome to protect it. Basically putting a big stink in Italian plans for the next ten years until the Franco Prussian war happened in 1870 and Napoleon III had to recall the garrison. 

With no more foriegn protection, and only a token force of swiss guard, the city was not able to be defended by the Pope, and the Italians swiftly moved in. 

The Pope was righteously pissed off at them and refused to consent to almost any of their demands and then cosigned himself and his people to Vatican Hill where they all sat in a huff and accused the Kingdom of Italy of not being an actual state and being governed by heathens.

sozomenspengler,"The rationale was an ideological one that can be best described by dissecting the Nazis' name for their ideology and political program, ""national socialism."" It was ""national"" in that it claimed to serve the needs/redress the grievances of the German people, or *volk*. It was ""socialist"" in that these needs/grievances were tied to groups seen as economically exploiting the *volk*--simplistically, capitalists, but not capitalists in the Marxist sense: instead of conceiving of capitalists as merely a class defined by ownership of the means of production, the Nazis equated capitalism (and, by extension, Germany's Western foes in WWI--seen as the den of the capitalist class--to which it still owed war reparation payments) with Judaism.

Basically, Nazism was an ideology of racial purification that grew out of a very long, very ugly European tradition of anti-Semitism. Antipathy in Germany (but by no means not present elsewhere) toward Jews was coupled with resentment over Germany's defeat in WWI, worry over some major economic problems (particularly those affecting the working class), and, weirdest of all, fears of Marxism (Jews were well-represented among Marxist intellectuals) to create an image of an international Jewish conspiracy pressing on Germany from all sides and dedicated to corrupting and humiliating the *volk*. Basically, the logic the Nazis advanced construed the Jews as being an enemy of German national interests in every way; that, of course, made it such that the destruction of the European Jewry became an irresistible objective.

adimwit,"It is very true, however, the portion that was directly influenced by Italian Fascism was actually ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935.

Specifically, the National Industrial Recovery Act established a Corporatist government. Roosevelt placed Hugh S. Johnson as the administrator of the National Recovery Administration and it was Johnson who was a great admirer of Mussolini. It was also Roosevelt who chose to keep Johnson away from the Public Works Administration for fear that he might become an American Duce/Fuhrer.

The idea was to give representation to both Labor groups and Business groups and a mediator so they can come to agreements on fair business practices (like better pay, standards, work hours, etc.) Business and Labor would come together to form ""Code Authorities"" who would create ""codes"" (essentially laws) that would govern these various groups (very similar to Mussolini's Corporate State).

One of the provisions of the act allowed Roosevelt to delegate his powers as President to the Code Authorities. Basically, the Codes were found to be laws and the President does not have the power to delegate powers that belong to the Legislators. So the Court ruled that the Code Authorities did not have the power to make Codes (laws), making them obsolete.

I'm not entirely sure how much of this was Roosevelt's idea. It is pretty clear that Johnson was well read in Fascism and was constantly making speeches on the importance of national unity and cooperation between Labor and Management. Also, Title I Section I of the NIRA echoes much of Mussolini's Corporatist ideas.

After the NRA disbanded, the National Labor Relations Board was formed, which is similar to Mussolini's Labor Courts, but I have not really read anything that suggests they were directly inspired by Mussolini's programs. But it's possible.",null,0,cdn8nla,1r6d5j,askhistorians,top_week,2

The author is absolutely blinded by confirmation bias - any discrepancy or contradiction to be found in rural, mid-19th century records or newspapers (which she jumps to point out can't be trusted when reporting James' death, but are somehow reliable when they fit her narrative) is to her damning proof of her claim, as are statements by relatives.  These include what strike me as ludicrous jumps of logic: her great-grandfather, in 1880s Texas, was suspicious of strangers and heavily armed; he perhaps didn't trust banks and so kept his money on his property; and he had a lot of money, which her aunt totally saw.  To Duke all this is iron-clad evidence her great-grandfather was Jesse James.  I don't buy it.  It's possible her great-grandfather even looked similar to James, but that hardly means he *was* him.

Muskwatch,"References to the seasons being flipped extend back at least to Herodotus, who was referencing Phoenician voyages from a few hundred years before that circumnavigated Africa, however as to who first ""discovered"" the reason why the earth has seasons, it definitely lies in prehistory.  It also depends on the type of ""season"" that you are talking about.

For example, say you're in the northern hemisphere.  The sun is warm.  In summer you see lots of the sun, and the weather is warm.  In the winter you see a lot less of it, and it's cold. Your creation story explains how the sun goes around the earth on an very wide bridge, and that during the summer it tends to your side of the bridge, touching the edge around solstice, but in winter it drifts towards the other side of the bridge, meaning it is much lower in the sky.  You attribute the seasons to the amount of sunlight you get and you are 100% correct. Likewise, if you ever asked yourself the question as to what life would be on the far side of the bridge, the answer is likewise obvious, and also completely correct.  This doesn't mean that everyone figured this out, but doubtless many did, and did it many times.

Now let's say your somewhere around the equator. You have two rainy seasons separated by a few months, a long one and a short one.  While you can link them time-wise to the progression of the sun through the zodiac, the obvious cause and effect reasoning that makes the connection so obvious to northern peoples is absent, especially without much wider geographical knowledge of prevailing winds and the origin of your weather patterns from distance regions.

Now let's say you're in Egypt, and you have two seasons, flood season, and the rest of the year.  Theories range from almost correct (melting snow) to the absurd (the river that goes around the earth feeds the source of the Nile).  Since the seasons consisted of variations in water flow, and the creation of that flow lay several thousand miles away, no answer could immediately  be drawn upon.

Now let's go back to the first group.  I lay out how they could have hypothetically described the seasons.  The story I referenced comes from the Nuxalk people of British Columbia and seems well put to describe the seasons.  Except, that's not how they described their seasons.  In Nuxalk, the year was divided up into months which were described by the types of activities conducted during them - the oolichan fishing month, months for various types of salmon, months for different storytelling and dances, but no reference to seasons as we know them, even though they were undoubtedly an important aspect of life.  For people who lived off of fish and seafood primarily, the seasons - winter, summer, etc., which they could describe so easily, weren't as significant to fisherman as they might be to farmers. In other words, in order to discover the reason for seasons, you not only have to have an mode of explanation, you also have to care what a ""season"" is.

If you go from yet another perspective, and respond that a ""season"" is the period of time between two solstices, which at least in Canada is officially correct (first day of summer is the summer solstice, and so on), it doesn't take much to figure out ""why"" these seasons.  ""Because the sun is highest, it is now summer"" then ""because the sun is halfway lower, it is now fall"".  When your definition of ""seasons"" gets divorced from real-world meaning, the answer to ""why seasons?"" can be as simple as ""because seasons"", but that's the world we live in.",null,2,cdk4byd,1r63h8,askhistorians,top_week,5

Spinoza42,"This is a very controversial question, your answers will depend almost entirely on who you ask.

Some parts of the Old Testament, in particular the first five books are taken to be quite old. Traditionally they're considered to be written by or dictated to Moses. Modern scholarship often sees them as a compiling of a few older texts, possibly around the year 1000 bc.

Other parts of the Old Testament are quite a bit newer, according to both traditional and modern interpretations.

The gospels and the letters of Paul probably date from somewhere between 70 and 130 AD. Since they're supposed to be eye-witness accounts of Jesus' life and Paul's travels, those 60 years difference would matter quite a lot.

However, with the Old Testament being written, and the Gospels and the Letters, you don't yet have a Bible as such.

Reedstilt,"The answer to this question is definitely going to vary depending on where, when, and who we're actually talking about. I'll use the Powhatans' as an example.

The Powhatans had some knowledge of Europe before the English arrived in Tsenacommacah. In 1561, a boy from Tsenacommacah was captured by the Spanish and taken to Mexico and Spain to be educated by Spanish priests, during which time he certainly would have learned quite a bit about the Old World. In 1570, the Spanish returned with their captive, now known as Don Luis, and attempted to establish a mission in Tsenacommacah with Luis serving as their translator. Luis had other ideas and promptly abandoned the mission, reunited with his people, and eventually led warriors to destroy the mission. While the Spanish lost their foothold in Tsenacommacah, they continued to raid the coast from their colonies further south. The conflict with the Spanish was one of the reasons the Powhatans were willing to make an alliance with the English once they show up in the area.

We don't know what became of Don Luis after this or how much information about Europe he passed on. There's some speculation that he may actually have been Chief Powhatan himself or one of his brothers, as Spanish [source](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/jamestown-browse?id=J1038) for this event mentions that he was the nephew of the then-current paramount chief. In Powhatan society, power isn't inherited from father to son, but matrilineally onto the children of the leader's sister. But there are too many uncertainties involved to be certain.

For a time after the English show up, its seems the Powhatans believe they came from a horrible little island. In 1616, as part of Pocahontas' entourage to England, Uttamatomakkin, a kwiokos (priest), was sent by his father-in-law Chief Powhatan to survey England and learn what he could about that country. His findings differed considerable from the Powhatans' initial assumptions about England, which (combined with the ascent of Powhatan's brother Opechancanough) soured relations after his return. Having thought the English were destitute and desperate (not to mention hopelessly incompetent), the Powhatans had been fairly charitable in their early relations. Once Uttamatomakkin returned from England, however, it now seemed as though they had been taken advantage of, because England was larger, wealthier, and more populous than they had first surmised. 

&gt; Would they have been aware of there being more to Europe than Britain, France, and Spain?

//For generations, blacks in the South might pour the first sip of their liquor onto the ground, Mr. Olayinka (A Yoruba priest in Brooklyn, NY) said. They didn't know why they were doing it. They were merely acting out a cultural ritual passed down over the years with little explanation.// - 

It was black colleges and the black power movement which reconnected it with its African roots and created or restored formal rituals around it and actively promoted it.

null,"The link exists, however the link is almost entirely manufactured. Like with many aspects of older or more forgotten cultures, the practice of libations was appropriated by rappers to be used as a form of badge of honor. It was a ""classy"" and ""hard"" way to say goodbye to your friends. Whatever link does exist between the two practices, it is entirely manufactured by hip-hop (so in the last 50 years or so). Interestingly the most agreed upon birthplace of hip-hop, Jamaica, doesn't have this tradition among their ""gangsta rap"" culture. Instead they have a ""light one up for your homies"" tradition that is analogous, obviously. This difference is completely unsurprising though, as Jamaican culture in general is much more centered around marijuana than American. It is almost certainly an invention or addition to the culture by late 70s or early 80s North American ""gangsta rap"" artists, and it first started appearing in songs in the early 90s. For it to appear in songs, it has to be a well established culture meme. Rappers generally play off of cultural memes to give their lyrics more weight, and I think more than anything the concept of libations holds a strong culture significance in some of the more violent African American communities, thus associating the rappers with those more violent communities. In ""gangsta rap"" being associated with more violence is always a good thing, so it makes sense why the rappers would want to participate in this cultural meme. 

Cuba has a tradition of pouring out a few drops of rum ""para los santos"" (for the saints) that may in some way be related to the concept spreading into hip-hop and then later into American ""gangsta rap"" culture.

Aethelric,"Since the surname question has already been answered fairly well, I'll address the second parts of your question (which are still applicable, regardless of the surnames).Typically speaking, the ideal for most members of the Third Estate, from peasants to wholesale merchant, would be to pass their trade, their social arrangements, and/or land down to their their sons.

Unless something dramatic happened—like, a war destroying a village, early death of the father, no male heirs, too many male heirs—odds were quite good that the firstborn child could expect to have the same trade, or work the same plot of land, as your father, his father, and his father. If you were a second or later son of an artisan, your eventual profession might be a bit dicier; if your father did well, you could expect to still learn the trade, though you might not inherit control over the family business. Your best hope would be to marry the daughter of another master without any heirs (or, even better, a recent widow of a master).

The idea of ""caste"" is a little misleading, since that a legal or social system enforced what professions were appropriate for a person, based on their birth. This isn't how medieval and early modern European society functioned, ignoring the nobility. It was generally possible to practice another trade; however, the problem was finding someone to take you on, when the pace of economic growth (if there was any in the area or time period) was slow enough that most lower class families were lucky to provide all of their children with a decent life.

Serfs and the nobility are exceptions, since movement out of and into these groups, respectively, was very difficult. This is still different than a caste system, however, in which the castes themselves contain established ritual significance.",null,0,cdk02jl,1r5rwz,askhistorians,top_week,3
Spinoza42,"Generally speaking the latter is the case. Common people would not have hereditary surnames, they'd have a patronimic, which refered to their own father, and might in addition to that have a nickname which refered to their place of origin, some characteristic, or their profession. Legal documents like contracts or court cases would list as many names as one had available of a person, to ensure there would be no ambiguity as to who one was talking about.

In continental europe surnames only became fixed during Napoleon's reign. Before that names weren't fixed cause there was no registry of people anyway. And after that the names in no way decided someone's profession.

Still, many sons of course did take the same profession as their fathers, and in some cases daughters as their mothers. But surnames had little or nothing to do with it.",null,1,cdjwtpy,1r5rwz,askhistorians,top_week,3

That is, there were no people who's full time job was soldiers or guards in these castles or manors except the Knight.  The Knight (and maybe some members of his family like sons or brothers) would be the only people living in the castle who were primarily trained and equipped for war.

The male servants of the Knight who were of military age (the huntsman, groom, butler, falconer, etc.) would serve as ""men at arms"" in time of need.  They would have arms and armor stored in the castle.  They might have some training in the use of weapons and battle tactics.  They would often be the lieutenants in charge of companies of villagers (also armed from castle supplies) in times of danger.

It was only much greater castles, like royal castles, or those belonging to great nobles, which would have any full time ""guards"" or soldiers as a garrison.

That contrasts with the Warsaw Pact states, which were independent.

Regarding why the Red Army didn't get sent in during the 1989 revolutions stems from Mikhail Gorbachev and his policies of glasnost and perestroika.

Once it became apparent the Russians weren't going to do anything, the protests grew even larger, and the various Warsaw Pact countries, who couldn't maintain their power without Soviet backing, were forced to accept reform, which effectively forced them out right away.

Also, historians who engage in creating avenues for public involvement in history are also taking part in public history. Think a historian that works on historical documentaries, the creation of museum exhibits, audio-walking tours, or any other type of public historical outreach. 

Most often, though, historians who engage in these processes most often move between one and the other ""definitions."" In fact, I'd say that a good historian tries to do a little bit of both. A professor at my university and a renowned public historian - [Ronald Rudin](http://history.concordia.ca/faculty-and-staff/bios/RudinR.php) - has both written extensively on historical perceptions of history, ""public history events"" from the 19th and 20th centuries, and engaged in historical public outreach.

LIPCSB,"Culture.  German romantics of the nineteenth century extolled the virtues of the peasantry, the ""blood"" of the nation that lived on the ""soil,"" hence the phrase ""blut und boden,"" ""blood and soil.""  This was part of a greater nationalistic trend to use the culture of the peasantry (often the peasantry of an exceedingly small area, at that) to define the Nation's culture.  The conclusion of this thought was that the peasants were the Real Germans, the most morally pure and physically healthy (compare the American idea of the small-town being wholesome while the big city is full of shady immigrants and colored people--hey, you know who else lives in cities?  JEWS!).  

The logical conclusion of this line of thought is that Germany would be strongest if her people were returned to the fields.  Which necessitates getting more fields--hence, Lebensraum.

While these may seem like neutral/negative outcomes for the USSR, who took Berlin first, there were a few concessions the Americans and British made to Stalin that were hugely in his favor.

The British and Americans agreed to leave Eastern Europe under the Soviet sphere of influence, so long as Poland and others were allowed free, democratic elections.  They were given elections all right, but the freedom of them was obviously reneged upon when communist parties overwhelmingly won every race.  The Brits/US also permitted for the return of all Soviet citizens to the USSR at the conclusion of the war.  This included traitors, Jews, trotskyites, and others that Stalin was happy to have back in his clutches.  Stalin was far more concerned with consolidating power in Eastern Europe and further purging undesired elements from his own party/state.

Non-Chinese sources place a more reliable series of silk scraps from Liangzhu culture sites in Zhejiang, dating back to 2700 BCE.

As to *how* exactly the idea came about to pull threads off of a cocoon, I don't think anybody knows for sure. Confucius wrote that a cocoon fell into the tea cup of the Empress Leizu, and that upon pulling it out, she got strands of silk and decided to weave it. This mythologized account on the origins of sericulture (raising silkworms) elevated her into the status of a God. (*The History of Silk from The Silk Association of Great Britain*)

Silk production, for a long time, was a closely-guarded secret and the origins of the procedure mystified many Western writers, who erroneously believed it came from the leaves of trees.

Commustar,"The first report Western Europeans had of the existence Timbuktu was  following Mansa Musa's hajj to Mecca in 1324.

In that image, Timbuktu appears to the left of the throne, and is labelled as ""Tonbudy"" on the atlas.

However, European interest in Timbuktu, specifically, is derived from the account of the Moorish christian-convert Leo Africanus (born al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi) in his descriptions of the geography of North Africa and West Africa that was included in the *Description of Africa* published in Venice in 1550.

In his [description of Timbuktu](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/leo_afri.asp), Africanus  paints a picture of a city of wealthy merchants, gold ingots and brisk trade. For the next several hundred years, Africanus' report was the primary basis for European knowledge of the interior or West Africa. 

It was during this period between 1526 and 1830 that Timbuktu's reputation for remoteness and mystery was established. However, the city also had a reputation for opulent wealth, which fired a European imaginations of a city of gold. For instance, lets take a gander at Tennyson's poem [Timbuctoo](https://archive.org/stream/suppressedpoemso00tennrich#page/viii/mode/2up). In it, Tennyson is making comparisons between Timbuktu and El Dorado and Atlantis, and is openly wondering whether Timbuktu is an actual place or is as mythical as the other two. By a quirk of fate, Tennyson's poem was first delivered in 1829, and news of Rene Caille's successful expedition to the city would not reach Europe until 1830. 

Of course, the next logical question is, upon discovering that Timbuktu was no longer a West African version of El Dorado, why did the city continue to stick in the popular conscious?

 I can only point to the fact that Timbuktu still fit the description of a remote place (it still does, to an extent), and benefited from the notoriety of the early 19th century race to discover it. Thus, literary figures seized upon it as real, notable location famed for its remoteness,  rather than a more generic idea like ""the middle of nowhere"".

The Greeks had a classification system of sorts. Nothing like the modern Dewey, UDC, or Library of Congress systems, but quite recognisable regardless.   
  
We know that around 296 BCE a Greek called Callimachus who lived in Alexandria created a bibliographical index of the contents of the Library. His index was called [""Pinakes""](http://www.greece.org/hec01/www/arts-culture/alexandria/library/library11.htm) and covered 120 books. In them he divided all the books in the library into 11 subjects, 6 for poetry (epic, elegy, iambics, melodrama tragedy, comedy), and 5 in prose (history, rhetoric, philosophy, medicine, law)”. So it is logical to assume that the library itself already used this subject classification system. The name of the index, Pinakes, refers to the index tablets hanging above the pots that stored scrolls, so that also indicates that he was working with an already established system. 
  
""Under each division, individual authors were arranged in alphabetical order; and each name was followed by a short bibliographical notice and a critical account of the author's writings"" (R. Pfeiffer, The Pinakes Fragments)

Several tablets have been discovered from the Hittite capital, Hattusa, from ca. 1400-1300, that look a bit more thorough at least: they have very detailed lists, with information about the number of tablets a text occupies, how many are missing, the contents of the work, and occasionally, the name of the author.

One tactic that was widely practised throughout antiquity, in practically all libraries, was to put a colophon at the end of a volume at the start or in the middle of a series; this is a note at the end that points the reader to the next one in the same work. For example, the surviving texts of *Gilgamesh* have colophons at the end of each tablet directing the reader as to which tablet comes next. The same was done in Greek and Roman collections. Often a colophon could take the form of the first couple of lines of the next volume, so the browser would immediately know that s/he had got the right one. Some catalogues did this too: there's one catalogue of hymns in Ashurbanipal's library that gives the first line of each hymn.

One colophon from Ashurbanipal's library is especially elaborate and telling:

&gt; Palace of Ashurbanipal, King of the World, King of Assyria, who trusts in Ashur and Ninlil, whom Nabu and Tashmetu gave wide-open ears and who was given profound insight. ...The wisdom of Nabu, the signs of writing, as many as have been devised, I wrote on tablets, **I arranged [the tablets] in series, I collated [them],** and for my royal contemplation and recital I placed them in my palace.

As to how you physically find the volume you want: we have decent information on this from Greco-Roman libraries. [Here's a famous 4th century CE Roman relief showing someone taking a scroll from its shelf.](http://purplemotes.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ancient-library.jpg) Notice:

1. The scrolls aren't stacked too high: they're not that light (those are wrapped into solid cylinders, and surviving papyri show that they were indeed rolled tight) and you need to be able to get to the ones on the bottom.

2. You have multiple compartments to aid in organisation. This would be especially helpful in the case of a large work, like say Pliny's *Natural history*, which would fill a lot of scrolls.

3. Each scroll has a tag attached to it. The Romans called these *tituli* ""labels"" -- and hence the modern word ""title"". These seem to have been made from vellum, not papyrus, according to a reference in Cicero. It seems that this derives from a similar practice in older libraries that contained tablets, rather than scrolls: in Ashurbanipal's library, each *series* of tablets had a tag hanging over it (it isn't as easy to attach a tag to a tablet).

(Incidentally this relief dates to the time when the scroll was starting to be replaced by the codex, i.e. the modern-style volume with multiple leaves bound together.)

The Greeks had a classification system of sorts. Nothing like the modern Dewey, UDC, or Library of Congress systems, but quite recognisable regardless.   
  
We know that around 296 BCE a Greek called Callimachus who lived in Alexandria created a bibliographical index of the contents of the Library. His index was called [""Pinakes""](http://www.greece.org/hec01/www/arts-culture/alexandria/library/library11.htm) and covered 120 books. In them he divided all the books in the library into 11 subjects, 6 for poetry (epic, elegy, iambics, melodrama tragedy, comedy), and 5 in prose (history, rhetoric, philosophy, medicine, law)”. So it is logical to assume that the library itself already used this subject classification system. The name of the index, Pinakes, refers to the index tablets hanging above the pots that stored scrolls, so that also indicates that he was working with an already established system. 
  
""Under each division, individual authors were arranged in alphabetical order; and each name was followed by a short bibliographical notice and a critical account of the author's writings"" (R. Pfeiffer, The Pinakes Fragments)

So you see, the rise of the D.C. Circuit really has two simultaneous things going on for it: the rise of the administrative State and the power the D.C.

popisfizzy,"After doing some *very, very* brief looking into this, it seems like completely bullshit. I'm referring to [this source](http://www.consciousplat.com/alkebulan) for it, which is what pops up on Google first. Let's break this down a little bit.

First, note that there is nothing coming up in Google except people claiming that it is an indigeonous word for Africa, and nothing providing cited sources *why* that's the case. This is a poor start.

Let's start off with this
&gt; The Original name for Africa is  :Alkebulan: Arabic for ""The Land Of The Blacks""

I don't know Arabic, but I know enough that this would have to break down as 'al-Kebulan', with the *al-* prefix being a definite article. So, we have a supposed word *kebulan. I can't find this word, or possible derivations of it. I would guess it would have the root of either k-b-l or b-l-n. My guess is towards the former, as (IIRC) Arabic uses nasals in derivational morphology more often than other consonants.

So basically, so far it seems like there's no evidence that 'Alkebulan' is an Arabic word.

Furthermore, why would this be indigenous? Because of the native Muslims of Northern Africa? The spread of Arabic is tied to the spread of Islam, and Islam post-dates the Roman Empire (well, the western Roman Empire) by several centuries. This website itself claims that Africa is a colonial term of the Romans, yet it seems to predate the supposed indigenous name.

And as for that claim of Roman colonialism:
&gt; Africa, the current name adopted by almost everyone today , was given to this continent by a European invader by the name of Louis Africanus.

Okay so, let's start with 'Louis Africanus'. ""Loius"" is a French name of Germanic origin, with the French as a culture at the *earliest* dating to several centuries after the fall of Rome. No Roman would have been named Loius. Furthermore, referring to him as a 'European invader' implies some cultural solidarity between the Romans and other European people, but at the time of the Romans there was no European identity, no common European culture (not to say there still is today, but there is certainly a distinct cultural zone in Europe, which was not present c. 1-300 AD).

On top of *that*, a quick Google search gives me no indication that such a person existed. This is unsurprising, given that it is as anachronistic as someone from medieval England being called ""Sunflower Abbey"".

&gt; Like all methods of manipulation the Romans sought to completely disconnect the indigenous Africans from their culture, deities, and knowledge.

This was not the modus operandi of the Romans. Refer to their treatment of just about *everyone* in the Roman provinces. The standout is Judae. The Jews kept their religious beliefs, customs, culture, and identity, and what really screwed them was only because they fought back against Roman incursion into their culture.

This is really just some neo-, pan-African-nationalist bullshit someone came up with to turn Europeans into evil invaders. Consider that Africa has a *two hundred and fifty thousand year history* of human life. While most of that is unrecorded, humans were almost-certainly using language by 50kya. Even today, Africa is a linguistically-diverse continent, with at least two thousand languages spread over six language families. To claim that there is a single toponym for such a vast area is absurd.",null,15,cdjmc08,1r4u4h,askhistorians,top_week,116
OnkelMickwald,"Africa *was* what the Roman called the region which roughly lies where Tunisia is today, and that definition later expanded out to designate the whole landmass south of the Mediterranean. Similarily, Asia was originally was what the Greeks called the region east of the Aegean sea. However it's important to note that we don't quite know the origin of these names. They could very well have their origin in indigenous names of peoples/tribes/areas/places in Africa or Asia respectively.

I also don't know what really ""indigenous"" would mean in this context. Africa is a vast continent with many languages, and I doubt many (if any at all) would know about the concept of ""the continent Africa"" before modern times.

Finally. What language would ""Alkebulan"" be in? My guess is that Alkebulan would be one of many names for a, to the ""inventing"" people, known landmass *in* what is nowadays defined as Africa.",null,10,cdjlwn6,1r4u4h,askhistorians,top_week,38

wesak87,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabylie

Kabylie or Kabylia (Berber: Tamurt n Leqbayel), is a region in the north of Algeria. The Arabic is ""al-Qaba'il"", which means ""the tribes"", which points to NOT being one of the earliest names for Africa.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa#Etymology

Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the Carthaginians, who dwelt in North Africa in modern-day Tunisia. This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; however, see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Phoenician afar, ""dust"", but a 1981 hypothesis[7] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) ""cave"", in reference to cave dwellers.[8] The same word[8] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[9]

Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of Africa Province, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[10] The Latin suffix ""-ica"" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.

According to the ancient Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while ""Asia"" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name ""Africa"":

    The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
    Isidore of Seville in Etymologiae XIV.5.2. suggests the Latin aprica ""sunny"".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afri

Afri (singular Afer) was a Latin name for the Carthaginians.[citation needed] It was received by the Romans from the Carthaginians, as a native term for their country.[citation needed] Latin-speakers at first used afer as an adjective, meaning ""of Carthage"", ""of Africa"". As a substantive, it denoted a native of Africa, i. e., a Carthaginian.

The ultimate etymology of the Punic term for the country remains uncertain. It may derive from a Punic term for an indigenous population of the area surrounding Carthage.[citation needed] (See Terence for discussion.) The name may be connected with Phoenician `afar, dust[1] (also found in other Semitic languages), or with Berber ifri, cave (see Tataouine). The classical historian Flavius Josephus asserted that descendants of Abraham's grandson Epher invaded the region and gave it their own name.

During the period of the Roman Empire, Afer came to be a cognomen for people from the Africa Province.

This ethnonym provided the source of the term Africa. The Romans referred to the region as Africa terra (land of the Afri), based on the stem Afr- with the adjective suffix -ic- (giving Africus, Africa, Africum in the nominative singular of the three Latin genders). Following the defeat of Carthage in the Third Punic War, Rome set up the province of Africa.

The Germanic tribe of the Vandals conquered the Roman Diocese of Africa in the 5th century; the empire re-conquered it as the Praetorian prefecture of Africa in AD 534. The Latin name Africa came into Arabic after the Islamic conquest as Ifriqiya.[2]

The name survives today as Ifira and Ifri-n-Dellal in Greater Kabylie (Algeria). A Berber tribe was called Banu Ifran in the Middle Ages, and Ifurace was the name of a Tripolitan people in the 6th century.

Troglodytism was frequent in northern Africa and still occurs today in southern Tunisia. Herodotus wrote that the Garamantes, a North African people, used to live in caves. The Greeks also called an African people who lived in caves Troglodytae.",null,0,cdkfveh,1r4u4h,askhistorians,top_week,2
popisfizzy,"After doing some *very, very* brief looking into this, it seems like completely bullshit. I'm referring to [this source](http://www.consciousplat.com/alkebulan) for it, which is what pops up on Google first. Let's break this down a little bit.

First, note that there is nothing coming up in Google except people claiming that it is an indigeonous word for Africa, and nothing providing cited sources *why* that's the case. This is a poor start.

Let's start off with this
&gt; The Original name for Africa is  :Alkebulan: Arabic for ""The Land Of The Blacks""

I don't know Arabic, but I know enough that this would have to break down as 'al-Kebulan', with the *al-* prefix being a definite article. So, we have a supposed word *kebulan. I can't find this word, or possible derivations of it. I would guess it would have the root of either k-b-l or b-l-n. My guess is towards the former, as (IIRC) Arabic uses nasals in derivational morphology more often than other consonants.

So basically, so far it seems like there's no evidence that 'Alkebulan' is an Arabic word.

Furthermore, why would this be indigenous? Because of the native Muslims of Northern Africa? The spread of Arabic is tied to the spread of Islam, and Islam post-dates the Roman Empire (well, the western Roman Empire) by several centuries. This website itself claims that Africa is a colonial term of the Romans, yet it seems to predate the supposed indigenous name.

And as for that claim of Roman colonialism:
&gt; Africa, the current name adopted by almost everyone today , was given to this continent by a European invader by the name of Louis Africanus.

Okay so, let's start with 'Louis Africanus'. ""Loius"" is a French name of Germanic origin, with the French as a culture at the *earliest* dating to several centuries after the fall of Rome. No Roman would have been named Loius. Furthermore, referring to him as a 'European invader' implies some cultural solidarity between the Romans and other European people, but at the time of the Romans there was no European identity, no common European culture (not to say there still is today, but there is certainly a distinct cultural zone in Europe, which was not present c. 1-300 AD).

On top of *that*, a quick Google search gives me no indication that such a person existed. This is unsurprising, given that it is as anachronistic as someone from medieval England being called ""Sunflower Abbey"".

&gt; Like all methods of manipulation the Romans sought to completely disconnect the indigenous Africans from their culture, deities, and knowledge.

This was not the modus operandi of the Romans. Refer to their treatment of just about *everyone* in the Roman provinces. The standout is Judae. The Jews kept their religious beliefs, customs, culture, and identity, and what really screwed them was only because they fought back against Roman incursion into their culture.

This is really just some neo-, pan-African-nationalist bullshit someone came up with to turn Europeans into evil invaders. Consider that Africa has a *two hundred and fifty thousand year history* of human life. While most of that is unrecorded, humans were almost-certainly using language by 50kya. Even today, Africa is a linguistically-diverse continent, with at least two thousand languages spread over six language families. To claim that there is a single toponym for such a vast area is absurd.",null,15,cdjmc08,1r4u4h,askhistorians,top_week,116
OnkelMickwald,"Africa *was* what the Roman called the region which roughly lies where Tunisia is today, and that definition later expanded out to designate the whole landmass south of the Mediterranean. Similarily, Asia was originally was what the Greeks called the region east of the Aegean sea. However it's important to note that we don't quite know the origin of these names. They could very well have their origin in indigenous names of peoples/tribes/areas/places in Africa or Asia respectively.

I also don't know what really ""indigenous"" would mean in this context. Africa is a vast continent with many languages, and I doubt many (if any at all) would know about the concept of ""the continent Africa"" before modern times.

Finally. What language would ""Alkebulan"" be in? My guess is that Alkebulan would be one of many names for a, to the ""inventing"" people, known landmass *in* what is nowadays defined as Africa.",null,10,cdjlwn6,1r4u4h,askhistorians,top_week,38

wesak87,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabylie

Kabylie or Kabylia (Berber: Tamurt n Leqbayel), is a region in the north of Algeria. The Arabic is ""al-Qaba'il"", which means ""the tribes"", which points to NOT being one of the earliest names for Africa.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa#Etymology

Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the Carthaginians, who dwelt in North Africa in modern-day Tunisia. This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; however, see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Phoenician afar, ""dust"", but a 1981 hypothesis[7] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) ""cave"", in reference to cave dwellers.[8] The same word[8] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[9]

Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of Africa Province, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[10] The Latin suffix ""-ica"" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.

According to the ancient Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while ""Asia"" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name ""Africa"":

    The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
    Isidore of Seville in Etymologiae XIV.5.2. suggests the Latin aprica ""sunny"".
    Leo Africanus (1488–1554) proposed the Greek aphrike (Αφρική), ""without cold"". Africanus suggested that the Greek phrike (φρίκη, ""cold and horror""), combined with the privative prefix ""a-"", indicated a land free of cold and horror.[11]
    Another theory is that the word aphrikè comes from aphròs, 'foam' and Aphrikè, 'land of foam', meaning the land of the big waves (like Attica, from the word aktè, Aktikè meaning land of the coasts).[citation needed]

First, it was certainly not limited to the middle ages. Luis XV in France did have mistresses in the XVIIth century, Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy in the XIXth, the royal heir Charles of UK in the XXth ... Those are just examples that I did happen to remember immediately.

Then you have the fact that the expectation of (male) faithfulness has never been universal, and very often not even predominant in a lot of places in the course of history. Rich and powerful man did kept lovers because they could, and society was seldom concerned.

For royalties and nobles there is an added dimension: marriages were almost always a political and diplomatic affair, not a romantic one.

A prince or a king married (or maybe, was married while still a child) because of the strategic gains that a match could bring to his kingdom, such as a territorial gain or the promise of assistance in a future wars by the family of the bride.

To have a lawful heir with the queen was very important, but, apart of that duty, the man was not expected to be in love with a wife that he probably had never met before their wedding (and maybe only years after the official wedding !).

There are some examples of a royal marriage driven by passion, such as the one of Edward IV of England with Elizabeth Woodville, but they are very rare. Even in the case of Edward IV he did start having mistresses after a few years.",null,0,cdjpsde,1r4s5v,askhistorians,top_week,6

Trigorin,"I think it would be useful to briefly chart the development of Dar-al-Islam, or the Islamic states, as you say. 

Two things to keep in mind: 

1) The Roman Empire and Sassanid Empire possessed highly developed political structures with centuries if not millennia of political theory, philosophy, and culture upholding them. These did not disappear. And in most cases, the original Bedouin or Hejazi Arab Muslims were not the majority of the population in the early Islamic period. They certainly spread and migrated and many tribes came to settle in Mesopotamia or Syria or Iran or Egypt but assimilation always goes both ways.

2) The Early Muslims were not as organized as we may think. There have been some arguments that the yearly tribal raid (Ghuz) became impossible when most tribes converted to Islam, because they were all in the same 'tribe' or family of Islam and one could not raid one's tribe members. So they raided the only people they could, the ones to the north. 

The early caliphate (first 4 caliphs) was essentially a big tribal organization. Arab leadership was based on senior tribal leader democracy, so the chiefs (or luminaries) chose among themselves by voting. Governors and other administrators were appointed. The government was highly centralized. The caliph would send someone he trusted to govern and after a period of certain years, might appoint someone else, etc. 

When the Abu Umayya clan took over the caliphate following the civil war with Ali, the government became centralized along Roman lines. The capital was in Damascus and the chief bureaucrats and administrators were mainly Romans who had converted to Islam. This was a government based on the Umayya and organized along Byzantine/Roman lines. So the tax collection, etc, were all given to certain governors who were responsible for getting so much back to the central treasury. Things worked out fine enough until they didn't. 

The Abu Abbas took over in 9th century. Their model was based on persian administration. Here things get interesting. From the 9th century onwards, the Persian practice of appointing sub-kings , if you will, takes root. The caliph gives out land to certain dynasties and they rule it on his behalf. This leads rise to a sort of feudalism but I am hesitant to call it that. This is also the great rise of Islamic science and humanities as all of these little provincial courts try to distinguish themselves by sponsoring the next big thinker. 

European Feudalism is a unique phenomenon. I  would not say that the Islamic states were similar to Feudalism, but that certain ways of ruling seem to be more or less efficient given certain circumstances, and both shared some similarities, especially in the 10th and 11th century. The centrifugal forces in Islamic governance arose from a need to accommodate local reality with state ideals and it did so by using a commonplace tactic that had been developed in Persia thousands of years ago and had probably also been developed in many places, namely, having someone rule on your behalf. European Feudalism is a whole different thing though on a superficial basis, it did incorporate this. ",null,1,cdk72nn,1r4qd7,askhistorians,top_week,6

LordKettering,"Not really.

Native American nations had a long history of diplomacy and warfare, extending centuries before European contact. The idea that separate nations with separate leaders would engage in combat or politics to gain land or crush an enemy was an idea that Native Americans were familiar with, and could easily be applied to the colonists.

Many Native American nations were adept at diplomacy, and could easily outclass Europeans when it came to political manipulation. By the eighteenth century, many nations were dependent on European trade goods, but were losing land to the colonists. This required them to strike a balance between deference and resistance. It's an incredibly difficult line to walk, but historians are largely in agreement that several nations were successful in playing the French and English off against each other in order to gain material or diplomatic advantage. Such diplomatic feats couldn't have been accomplished had they been confused about imperial conflicts.

For more information on how Native Americans were able to survive between two belligerent imperial powers, and why this advantage eventually fell apart, read Alan Taylor's *Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderlands of the American Revolution.* Another great one, that I recommend here often, is Joseph Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin's *Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution*.",null,11,cdjkvdz,1r4kzq,askhistorians,top_week,64

Following King George's War (1744–1748), what is now northern New England was disputed territory. In 1752, the Governor of Massachusetts sent Phineas Stevens to negotiate with [the Wabanaki Confederacy](http://www.brownhistory.org/images/Maps/Native%20American%20Maps/Wabanaki%20Country%20pre-18th%20Century%20Map.jpg) at a meeting hosted by the governor of Montreal. At this meeting, the Wabanaki representative, Atiwaneto, refused to sell any more land to the British.

&gt; Brother, you are therefore masters of the peace that we are to have with you. On condition that you will not encroach on  those lands we will be at peace, as the King of France is with the King of Great Britain.

&gt; By a Belt.

&gt; I repeat to you, Brothers, by this belt, that it depends on yourselves to be at peace with the Abenakis^1. Our Father^2 who is here present has nothing to do with what we say to you; we speak to you of our own accord, and in the name of all our allies^1. We regard our Father, in this instance, only as a witness to our words.

During the French and Indian War, Pennsylvanian ambassador Christian Frederick Post went to negotiate peace with the Lenape living in the Ohio Country. After meeting with Shingas (whom the Pennsylvanians erroneous deemed king of the Lenape) and other Lenape leaders, Post received this reply:

&gt; The land is ours, and not theirs; therefore, we say, if you will have peace with us, we will send the French home. It is you that have started this war, and it is necessary that you hold fast, and be not discouraged, in the work of peace. We love you more than you love us; for when we taken any prisoners from you, we treat them as our own children. [...] By this you may see that our hearts our better than yours. It is plain that you white people are the cause of this war; why do not you and the French fight in the old country, and on the sea? Why do you come to fight in our land? This makes every body believe, you want to take the land from us by force, and settle it....

&gt; Look now, my brother, the white people think we have no brains in our heads; but that they are great and big, and that makes them make war with us: we are but a little handful to what you are; but remember when you look for a wild turkey, you cannot always find it, it is so little it hides itself under the bushes; and when you hunt for a rattlesnake, you cannot find it, and perhaps it will bite you before you see it. However, since you are so great and big, and we so little, do you use your greatness and strength in completing this work of peace. This is the first time that we saw or heard of you, since this war begun, and we have great reason to think about it, since such a great body of you comes into our lands. It is told us, that you and the French contrive the war, to waste the Indians between you: and that you and the French intend to divide the land between yo: this was told us by the chief of the Indian traders; and they said further, brothers, this is the last time we shall come among you; for the French and the English intend to kill all the Indians and then divide the land among themselves...

[...] Englishman, our father, the King of France, employed our young men to make war upon your nation. In this warfare many of them have been killed, and it is our custom to retaliate until such time as the spirits of the slain are satisfied. But the spirits of the slain are to be satisfied in either of two ways; the first is by the spilling of the blood of the nation by which they fell; the other is by *covering the bodies of the dead*, and thus allaying the resentment of their relations. This is done by making presents.

&gt; Englishman, your king has never sent us any presents, nor entered into any treaty with us, wherefore he and we are still at war, and until he does these things we must consider that we have no other father, nor friend among the white men than the King of France.

Despite Minavavana's declaration that a state of war persists between the Ojibwe and the British, he assured Henry that, since he came in peace under the misapprehension that the war was over, he would be permitted to conduct his busy among them as he had planned.

LordKettering,"Not really.

Native American nations had a long history of diplomacy and warfare, extending centuries before European contact. The idea that separate nations with separate leaders would engage in combat or politics to gain land or crush an enemy was an idea that Native Americans were familiar with, and could easily be applied to the colonists.

Many Native American nations were adept at diplomacy, and could easily outclass Europeans when it came to political manipulation. By the eighteenth century, many nations were dependent on European trade goods, but were losing land to the colonists. This required them to strike a balance between deference and resistance. It's an incredibly difficult line to walk, but historians are largely in agreement that several nations were successful in playing the French and English off against each other in order to gain material or diplomatic advantage. Such diplomatic feats couldn't have been accomplished had they been confused about imperial conflicts.

For more information on how Native Americans were able to survive between two belligerent imperial powers, and why this advantage eventually fell apart, read Alan Taylor's *Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderlands of the American Revolution.* Another great one, that I recommend here often, is Joseph Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin's *Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution*.",null,11,cdjkvdz,1r4kzq,askhistorians,top_week,64
Reedstilt,"/u/LordKettering already covered the basics, so I'll tackle some specific examples of how a few Native American leaders and diplomats viewed the political landscape of colonial North America.

Following King George's War (1744–1748), what is now northern New England was disputed territory. In 1752, the Governor of Massachusetts sent Phineas Stevens to negotiate with [the Wabanaki Confederacy](http://www.brownhistory.org/images/Maps/Native%20American%20Maps/Wabanaki%20Country%20pre-18th%20Century%20Map.jpg) at a meeting hosted by the governor of Montreal. At this meeting, the Wabanaki representative, Atiwaneto, refused to sell any more land to the British.

&gt; Brother, you are therefore masters of the peace that we are to have with you. On condition that you will not encroach on  those lands we will be at peace, as the King of France is with the King of Great Britain.

&gt; By a Belt.

&gt; I repeat to you, Brothers, by this belt, that it depends on yourselves to be at peace with the Abenakis^1. Our Father^2 who is here present has nothing to do with what we say to you; we speak to you of our own accord, and in the name of all our allies^1. We regard our Father, in this instance, only as a witness to our words.

[...]

&gt; We are entirely free. We are allies of the King of France, from whom we received the Faith and all sorts of assistance in our necessities. We love that monarch, and we are strongly attached to his interests.

1. The Abenaki are one of the members of the Wabanaki Confederacy, and specifically the ones from whom the British wished to purchase land. Atiwenato was Abenaki. When he refers to 'our allies' later, he means the Wabanaki Confederacy as a whole.

2. ""Our Father"" refers to the governor or Montreal.

During the French and Indian War, Pennsylvanian ambassador Christian Frederick Post went to negotiate peace with the Lenape living in the Ohio Country. After meeting with Shingas (whom the Pennsylvanians erroneous deemed king of the Lenape) and other Lenape leaders, Post received this reply:

&gt; The land is ours, and not theirs; therefore, we say, if you will have peace with us, we will send the French home. It is you that have started this war, and it is necessary that you hold fast, and be not discouraged, in the work of peace. We love you more than you love us; for when we taken any prisoners from you, we treat them as our own children. [...] By this you may see that our hearts our better than yours. It is plain that you white people are the cause of this war; why do not you and the French fight in the old country, and on the sea? Why do you come to fight in our land? This makes every body believe, you want to take the land from us by force, and settle it....

&gt; Look now, my brother, the white people think we have no brains in our heads; but that they are great and big, and that makes them make war with us: we are but a little handful to what you are; but remember when you look for a wild turkey, you cannot always find it, it is so little it hides itself under the bushes; and when you hunt for a rattlesnake, you cannot find it, and perhaps it will bite you before you see it. However, since you are so great and big, and we so little, do you use your greatness and strength in completing this work of peace. This is the first time that we saw or heard of you, since this war begun, and we have great reason to think about it, since such a great body of you comes into our lands. It is told us, that you and the French contrive the war, to waste the Indians between you: and that you and the French intend to divide the land between yo: this was told us by the chief of the Indian traders; and they said further, brothers, this is the last time we shall come among you; for the French and the English intend to kill all the Indians and then divide the land among themselves... Brother, I suppose you known something about it; or has the Governor stopped your mouth, that you cannot tell us?

tenent808,"This is question ties nicely in with my thesis research, so I’ll try my best to give a brief rundown. 

As the other post noted, it very much depends on the time you are talking about. Below I will try to give an extremely broad overview of partisanship amongst military officers. For a frame of reference I will discuss particularly the US Army officer corps

The early American military establishment was distinctly Federalist in character, founded as it was by Alexander Hamilton, who served as the first Army Chief of Staff and thus controlled officer commissions, an important source of patronage in the early days of the Republic. The Republicans, led by Jefferson, were decidedly distrustful of a standing military, considering it an inherent threat to republican government. They looked to the English Commonwealth under Cromwell and the Roman Republic, and saw in Hamilton a potential Caesar. For his part, Hamilton himself greatly admired Caesar, and believed in a strong military as a key defender of the new nation, and as a potential vehicle to drive his own legacy.
After Hamilton’s death in a duel in 1804 and the disintegration of the Federalist Party as an active force in electoral politics, the U.S. Army and Navy, along with the Supreme Court, continued to be heavily influenced by Federalist ideology and staffed with Federalist officers. For an excellent study of the early Army partisanship, see Richard Kohn’s [Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment](http://www.amazon.com/Eagle-Sword-Federalists-Establishment-1783-1802/dp/0029175518). 

Thomas Jefferson, as President, worried about the Federalist tendencies of his officers and attempted to counter their influence with his establishment of West Point in 1803. Jefferson also reduced the size of the Army and Navy, and emphasized a disengagement from international affairs in the hopes of avoiding military confrontations. 
The War of 1812 and the vast expansion of the military during that time provided the Republican Madison administration with ample opportunities to commission Republican officers, which it did to great effect. Andrew Jackson, mentioned above, being a key example of a decidedly non-federalist officer rising to political power based on his military record. Jackson, it should be noted however, was a General in the Tennessee militia, not the standing regular army. For all his successes as a political figure, Jackson’s influence on the partisanship of the regular army officer corps was limited, imbued as he was with Republican ideals of “citizen-soldiery” embodied in the state militias and contrary to the Federalist notion of a professionalized standing military establishment. 

As the Federalist Party collapsed and was ultimately replaced by the Whigs, many Army officers followed to that camp. By this time, the small U.S. Army was pushing westward, and its officer corps began to develop a distinct identity forged on the frontier. With no real continental threat of invasion, the main duty of the Army became frontier duty fighting Indians. Because of this separation, the Army developed a culture almost akin to a priesthood or monastic order. Army officers, in peacetime almost all West Pointers, saw themselves as a separate, apolitical caste of professionals. Most refused to vote. Raised with small “r” republican ideals, they generally believed strongly in their constitutional oaths and were duly submissive to civilian authority, however disdainful they might be of politicians in general. 

This standard of professional autonomy and separation continued until the 1940s. The Army, which matured largely on the frontier, was proud of its heritage as an apolitical defender of the Republic. George C. Marshall was in many ways the embodiment of this ideal, refusing to vote and maintaining cordial yet professional and ultimately deferential relationships with his superiors. 

Of course, during times of war and mass mobilization this dynamic was tested. The World Wars and the Civil War saw the Army balloon by hundreds of percent in the span of months. Wartime Presidents such as Lincoln and FDR, and to a lesser extent Wilson, recognized the political nature of their conflicts and thus were adamant in treating the army as a part of a wartime coalition. Lincoln famously appointed political officers representing the different constituencies of the Union. Hence the prominence of war Democrats, Catholics, Germans, Irish, etc., in high military positions. These “political generals” many of whom were military neophytes, were of course highly resented by the West Point caste of officers. They were varyingly successful, but to Lincoln their importance was less in their military acumen then their political value in maintaining his wartime coalition. See T. Harry Williams’ [Lincoln and His Generals](http://www.amazon.com/Lincoln-Generals-Vintage-Civil-Library/dp/0307741966) for more. 

However, after WWII, the onset of the Cold War led to a decision not to draw down the military as was the past American tradition at the conclusion of large wars, and the subsequent creation of a much larger military establishment than had ever existed. After the Cold War ended, this military establishment remained, becoming increasingly political following the abolishment of the draft and the abject failure in Vietnam. Seeing a distinct need to justify its continued largesse, the military from 1975-1990 took on a series of reforms aimed at modernizing and further professionalizing itself. The end of the draft led to increasing self-selection among those who would serve, leading to an increasing partisanship among military officers. The career of Colin Powell, Reagan’s National Security Advisor and later Chairman of the JCS, demonstrates the increasing political partisanship, as well as political acumen and savvy of these late Cold War army officers. Their agenda was to avoid another Vietnam-like entanglement that sapped the army of resources, respect and readiness for a major WWIII-type conflict. To this end they advocated such reforms as the Weinberger and Powell Doctrines. For more on the post-Vietnam politicization of the US military, see Andrew Bacevich’s [The New American Militarism](http://www.amazon.com/New-American-Militarism-Americans-Seduced/dp/0199931763/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385140178&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bacevich+new+american+militarism). 

Following Desert Storm, a perceived success of those Doctrines (perceived because looking back twenty years later after a second and much more costly war in Iraq the first war there can hardly be called a decisive victory, as it was at the time), led the military further towards the Republican Party, which began to view the military as a constituent element of their political coalition as well. 

This brings us to our self-imposed 20 year limit, so I’ll end the discussion there. Sorry if this was too long, but this is just a bored-at-work synthesis of a much longer paper I’m writing.

The short answer is that they did have access to abortifacients and some did use them, though it seems to be more common among slaves in the Caribbean than in the US South.  There was a much greater importance placed on keeping and raising children in the South, since slave prices were higher than in the Caribbean.  In the Caribbean it was cheaper to buy a new slave than raise one from birth, so there was less focus on keeping them on the part of the owners and the conditions were so terrible that many mothers did not want their children to grow up in that environment.  The US South had a much greater focus on family, both among the slaves and slave owners.  The slave owners wanted the slave to have kids so that they could have more slaves, while the more equal gender balance among the slaves, as opposed to Caribbean slaves, meant that it was much easier to create a family.

BigBadSaint,"Tense. 

I'm working off what I remember of Dalleck's biography. 

It's all about personality, not policy or ideology. They had reasonably similar liberal goals, but got there from very different points.

JFK was a golden boy: war hero, handsome, Harvard educated, a Boston Brahmin, Catholic (at the exact moment when Catholicism stopped being weird, with so many serving in WW2). He basically had everything going for him, and had sailed into front spot by the 1960 election.

LBJ was the polar opposite. Coming from relative poverty (although he overplayed this), he became a successful (albeit corrupt) businessman, an associate of FDR's New Deal, and ultimately a congressman who ran the House with an iron fist.  Basically someone who worked their way up the hard way.

It obviously stung for LBJ to be overlooked in favour of JFK for the presidential nomination, but when Kennedy offered him the VP spot (to secure the Dixiecrats, LBJ arrogantly believed he would run the show. Once in office, he was marginalised - many photos of the cabinet show him sulking around in the background, and JFK would moan about him to others in the Cabinet.

JFK basically found things to keep him busy - put him in charge of a few programs, sent him on a foreign tour in '62. The essence of the relationship was one of mutual contempt. LBJ disliked that his influence was waning, while JFK was very aware that LBJ had the experience he lacked. JFK was an incredibly insecure guy (which is why he broadcast his womanising), and politically had to give both the US hawks and the USSR the impression that he was firmly in command, so he wasn't going to let LBJ too close to the big issues.

IIR,LBJ was barely consulted over the Missile Crisis, or the Bay of Pigs, while JFK's 'team', like Bobby Kennedy, Sargent Shriver etc were helping make the big decisions.


There is only one photo you need to see to encapsulate how LBJ felt about the assassination:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Lyndon_B._Johnson

That's on Air Force One, hours after the shooting on the way to DC, and the woman next to him is Mrs. Kennedy. LBJ specifically and forcefully demanded that she be present, on the plane and in the photograph.

For the sake of his own legitimacy and stature, he strong-armed the grieving widow into leaving her dead husband to pose for a picture.

I don't doubt that he saw the opportunity created the death. If you read LBJ's inaugural address, he basically appropriates Kennedy's legacy, and invokes his martyrdom to drive through the Great Society reforms of the mid 60s. 

LBJ's a fascinatingly complex character - ruthless, ambitious and narcissistic, but with a streak of greatness that few presidents have (or realise).

Beau was basically a major/minor celebrity of the day who was mostly known for his keen fashion sense to the point where he would personally help the then Crown Prince ([yes, this Crown Prince](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7c/52/ba/7c52bad3196c052ffd3fbc1ab188f870.jpg)) dress his best. For a time. Then Brummell made the epic error of directly insulting the Crown Prince  by calling him [fat](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZJrLtHkmnfU/UoUINl4j9nI/AAAAAAAAIYQ/uM4STx1VF1c/s1600/George_IV__our_most_hopeless_prince_.jpg) in his presence, ultimately shunned by anyone who was anyone, and died a quiet, poverty-stricken death in an asylum.


At the time, dandies were guys who were obsessed with clothing, fashion, and being seen (fyi, ""Dandy"" is where we get the term ""dude""). Brummell was the most famous of this aesthetic, and pushed for a more sophisticated style with certain colors, certain cuts, a fairly modernized suit style that modern suits evolved from ([This](http://joyhog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/gq-timerblaker-cover.jpg) coming from [this](http://www.illustrationartgallery.com/acatalog/RainerBeau.jpg) as opposed to [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s9hczoEDJ4A/T3jb7-q0ifI/AAAAAAAAGs0/ViuE_9V0scI/s640/_Mens+French+Fashions+Late+18th+Century.jpg)])

You can see the changes in color, cuts, and a shift from knee britches to full length pants or trousers (something Brummell pushed a lot). 


Long story short, Brummell LOVED cravats and neck ties. He was notorious for tying his each day, sometimes for hours with a new one each time until he got it just right. The cravat-neck tie style was really pushed by him, picked up by the Crown Prince and court, and the rest is fashion history.

MrMarbles2000,"Stalingrad was an important industrial center in the southern part of the Soviet Union. Also, it is located on a bend on the Volga river, which makes the it westernmost point on the Volga south of Moscow. Volga was an important transportation artery leading from the Caspian oil fields to the rest of the country. Capturing Stalingrad meant that the Germans could cut off the river traffic. Lastly, the entire Caucus area (roughly the part of the USSR between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea) could essentially be isolated from the rest of the Soviet Union by capturing Stalingrad. Hilter called the city ""a Key to the Caucuses"", area which was rich in oil. 

What made it hard to take? Well being on the banks of a large river made it more difficult to surround it - the Germans would have had to land and capture area on the opposite bank. The Germans tried to force their way into the city directly, leading to street by street, block by block style of fighting which quickly turned into a war of attrition rather than maneuver. Another reason is that the Soviets committed quite heavily to defending it. Stalin is famous for issuing his order ""not a step back"" to his troops, meaning that Stalingrad was to be defended at all costs. 

Stalingrad by Anthony Beavor is a good book about this. ",null,5,cdjeh55,1r44eo,askhistorians,top_week,22
null,"Most of the answer has been given, but I would like to point out the importance of Stalingrad as a symbol; which relates to Hitler's preoccupation with them. For example, he organized the signing of the French armistice in the same place and even in the very same railway cart where the Germans had signed their armistice in 1918. After which Hitler blew it up.

Similar to Stalingrad (and the earlier siege of Leningrad); conquering Moscow, Leningrad/formerly St. Petersburg and Stalingrad would represent total ideological victory of Nazism over Soviet Communism. ",null,1,cdjkkh2,1r44eo,askhistorians,top_week,9
RationalAnimal,"This is an interesting question, and it admits of several lines of reply.   I'll offer the following.  

One item not emphasized nearly enough in histories of this war is the catastrophic failure of the Soviet Union to prepare properly to defend itself in the first place.   Indeed, it is possible to say the following with no exaggeration.   To the USSR of the mid- to late-1930's, Hitler's Germany was one of the most obvious and dangerous security threats in the history of the world.  Yet, the Soviet leadership seemed capable of nothing more than stumbling through this period, almost willingly blind to their strategic danger. 

Remember, the German government was led by a man whose supreme, openly declared political ambition was the annihilation of the Soviet Union.  By the late 1930's, there should have been little doubt as to the broad capabilities of the German military.  By the fall of 1940, after the stunning defeat of France and Britain in the west, the mortal danger the wermacht posed to the Soviet Union should have been impossible to ignore.    

Yet, during years when the Soviet Union could have been organizing a capable armed force as a credible deterrent,  Stalin squandered precious time and human lives terrorizing the Soviet military.  Further, the authoritarian nature of the Soviet government precluded the the Soviet leadership from having accurate information about the true capabilities of the red army all throughout this time.  

The result was the Soviet Union was appallingly unprepared for the German invasion of 1941, and the Soviet leadership was perhaps the only organized political body in the world who did realize this fact.   Were it not for the distraction of the history of the war itself,  Stalin's failure would be  widely acknowledged for what it was:  one of history's great mistakes.  

All that said, it is nevertheless true the German invasion was, for the Germans, a breathtaking gamble.  Even by their own lights they did not have all that much room for error.  As it happened, the Germans badly underestimated reserves of Soviet manpower, but even by their reckoning they were attacking a much larger defensive force.  Normally, of course, it is thought necessary for attackers to outnumber defenders for a successful offensive campaign.  Further, the German strategic objectives required movement across vast distances in a relatively short period of time.   Finally, the Germans committed the large majority of their total national military capability to the Russian campaign.  So, defeat would threaten vulnerability to counter invasion and, perhaps, even to the destruction of Germany itself.  

Still, in the first months of the war, events demonstrated that means were better matched to ends on the German side of war planning.   The Germans defeated huge Soviet armies in the first weeks of the war, and then again they achieved a tremendous victory in the battles surrounding Kiev.  Military historians much debate the effect of German diversions in the autumn of 1941 in the Ukraine, but even as things happened the Germans came within a hair's breadth of capturing Moscow by December of 1941.  Had they done so, there is a good likelihood that even Stalin would have had difficulty retaining sufficient control over what would have been left of the Soviet state to fight an organized war.  

""Resourcefulness"" probably suggests too much in the way of deliberate planning to describe the Russian response to the German invasion.  Even if ""desperation"" is a more apt name for the Soviet war effort in 1941, the Soviets did barely keep the Germans out of Moscow.   The state of Soviet planning had improved markedly by the time of the climactic battle of Stalingrad in 1942-3, and by then German strength had largely spent itself in the long drive toward the southern Soviet Union.   From then on, the war was a gruesome Soviet counter offensive, and the Germans had no more prospect of achieving victory in the east.  

So, a short answer is that the Soviet Union eventually prevailed in a desperate fight despite its failures in pre-war and early war planning.  The Germans were much better prepared to fight the war they chose, but they had little room for error.  The Soviet forces were more numerous and the political system of the USSR was less susceptible to collapse than the Germans had estimated.   The fight itself was a close-run thing, but we all know how it ended.

Several cultures would use opiods such as the Middle East and China (usually morphine and later laudanum) as a kind of soporific, where it wouldn't completely knock them out, but leave them in a bit of a haze during medical care.  (spoiler alert- discussion of disturbing imagery).

Alcohol was also used for centuries as if not an anesthetic, but more as a fortifier. One of the most famous pre-anesthetic cases in the late 1700s involved a middle aged woman who had to undergo a double mastectomy with several men holding her down, a shot of alcohol, and a cheesecloth to cover her face so she couldn't watch it (that also failed, she saw the whole thing). She actually survived for several decades after, somehow recounted the whole ordeal in her diary, but was very shaken for years after the procedure. 

People during surgery basically had to just get through it by personal strength, bit of alcohol, and a strong  and very fast surgeon. One of the big drawbacks during awake surgery was that the patients were often thrashing and screaming, so surgery had to be as fast as possible. Darwin had early in his life wanted to be a doctor, but his first time watching a surgery take place left him horrified to the point where he changed studies (much to our entire benefit), and would later claim that that much blood had  been terribly traumatizing.

400-Rabbits,"With regards to the Americas, it generally was because those European settler regimes were quite brutal. There's a few factors that play into this, including minority rule, tacit approval of non-state actions, a focus on wealth extraction, and de-humanization of indigenous groups.

Taking these in reverse order, there was an underlying question of whether Native Americans were even human, or at least fully human. If you look at the work of armchair naturalists like [de Pauw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_de_Pauw) or [Buffon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon) they both put forth ideas of Native Americans as ""degenerate"" or otherwise sub-human, ideas that were widely read and accepted at the time. With those concepts in the mainstream, it was easier to justify the use of lethal slave labor on plantations and in mines, or to say that ""Indian's and wolves are both beasts of prey, tho' they differ in shape,"" as George Washington put it. The native populations were not so much subjects to ruled as they were tools to generate wealth, or obstacles to ""civilizing"" the land. Often this was done not so much as a matter of central state policy, where there might have been some mediation of the actions, but by self-interested groups like Spanish Conquistadors or English Puritans who were in the Americans to get rich or build a utopia, not establish a sustainable extension of state power. Since these groups were so often in the minority, you can see a strain of a sort of siege mentality of the ruling groups, wherein brutality was necessary lest the dominant few be crushed by riotous masses.

There are certainly historical models for absolutely brutal and oppressive regimes that were not ""White,"" but what happened in the Americas set the template for colonial expansion over the following centuries. While the Mongols and Assyrians, for example, may have committed atrocities in their campaigns for dominance, they did so centuries and millenia before the present. European regimes are far closer to the present and, in regards to colonialism, were able to use advances technology in project power on a far wider than previous imperialists and exploiting conquered peoples through new regimens of production which were far more invasive and intensive than past tributary systems. This was further backed up by ""scientific"" proof of the natural superiority of Europeans over others -- even as the philosophy of the time was inching towards universal rights -- which justified both the conquest and the brutality in terms beyond simple ethnocentrism.",null,1,cdjtilj,1r3ycc,askhistorians,top_week,3

* The Boer war is notoriously the last in which the British Army suffered more casualties from disease than from combat. Also where concentration camps were invented, although this perhaps didn't bother the average infantryman too much. 

* The Great War is perhaps not quite as bad as its reputation, but still, it was genuinely awful. Mud, rats, charging into machine guns, living in the trenches for months on end waiting for the shell that would finish you - perhaps it has been exaggerated, but still, it's all *true*. Also of note for the near impossibility of getting medical help if you were wounded between the trench lines. NB: No antibiotics, lots of muddy battlefields. Widespread use of chemical weapons by both sides.

* WWII, well, what can one say? You asked about infantrymen, so I'll leave the Holocaust out of it. But at least on the Eastern Front, things were pretty grim all around. Being taken prisoner - and let's note, neither side was that keen on prisoners - meant death by slow starvation. For the Russians, even those who survived captivity could expect some years in the Gulag. Something on the order of 80% of the Russian men born in 1923 died. 

* Korean War: I can't think of any area in which this one was plausibly the worst. 

* Vietnam: No support from home, or at least, none that was very obvious in the media. Perhaps the first unpopular war in which the soldiers could really *feel* that the home front didn't have their back. 

* Iran-Iraq war: Unarmed teenagers charging into minefields. 'Nuff said.

&gt;Are we to automatically take all these phrases like “Allegro’s theory” as referring to the theory formed by the following 3 components?  1) The Bible contains encoded allusions to Amanita, based on linguistic proof, proof that early proto-Christians used mushrooms.  2) Starting around Constantine in 313 CE, Christians became literalists; they knew nothing of entheogens and this is how the Historical Jesus illusion began.  3) The tree in the Plaincourault fresco of 1291 intends to represent Amanita, proving that Christianity is about Amanita use.

&gt;. . .

&gt;Each scholar needs to begin identifying which components of ‘Allegro’s theory’ they have in mind.  This would help tremendously; it’s the key to reclaiming “Allegro’s theory”, whatever that vague, magically charged phrase “Allegro’s theory” is supposed to mean – we must not be kept guessing and having to indirectly deduce this.

Fair enough, but I don't think any of the *individual* assertions can be sustained either.

Admittedly I'm less intimately familiar with some of Allegro's specific assertions about linguistic ""evidence."" I know he proposed a new etymology for *manna* - which I know nothing about, though I'd certainly interested (in the *actual etymology*; less so in whatever dubious etymology Allegro is sure to give) - and then views the early Christian use of the word *soma* (""body"") in the Eucharist as some sort of codeword. 

I'm kinda tied up in something else at the moment, but if you could find out more about his specific proposals more on the linguistic side of things, I'd be willing to respond to them individually.",null,1,cdjd5ur,1r3w65,askhistorians,top_week,5
backgrinder,"The history of mining is a history of metals being sourced from more difficult to find, expensive to extract, and less rich deposits. The first known prehistoric mines were flint and salt mines, and were started as people chipped deeper and deeper from an exposed face into the earth. 

 The first metals were likely sourced on open ground, remnants of meteor strikes or geologic action or deposits from glaciers, or from collapsed cliff faces that exposed rich ore. Since mines were found by happenstance locating them wasn't specialized, operating them was done by whoever had the resources to run a mine (mines have always been labor intensive and expensive) and might to hold the valuable ground. 

 The earliest metal mines were copper mines. There are ancient (3-5000 years BC or BCE, whichever you prefer) copper mines in present day Serbia, Jordan, North America, Israel, and Egypt. We are aware of them because smelting was done on site, which created plenty of detritus for archaeologists to find. The idea of transporting ore to be finished off location is a post railroad invention, before that moving bulk cargo like ore was just to expensive. 

 Prospecting for ore until very recently was done on foot. Prospectors would trace streambeds or cliff faces looking for signs of ore. If they found good sign they would trace it back to the most likely source and start digging, looking for a rich vein to exploit. Modern techniques are more sophisticated, but still use the same basics: knowing how to discern a likely location from geological information and history of other prospectors, and inspecting it up close. Basically, as far as certain cultures having specialized prospecting knowledge until recently there was no such thing. Then, as now, finding that you were occupying land with rich ore under it was basically like winning a lottery you hadn't even bought a ticket for.

onthefailboat,"There weren't all that many incentives to abolish slavery.  The planters, obviously were against it, by and large, since they relied on that labor for their welfare.  After British abolition, the British pushed for other nations to abolish slavery as well, which may be what you're thinking of.  This added a certain amount of social pressure, and Britain may have offered certain economic benefits to islands that abolished slavery.  Most nations did repay slave owners for the worth of their emancipated slaves, which would have made abolition more palatable.  If I recall correctly, the only nation that did not repay owners for the value of their slaves was the US.  

There is a very famous argument by Eric Williams' *Capitalism and Slavery* which basically says that the plantation complex fueled the rise of the industrial revolution and capitalism, which in turn led to the plantation complex's demise as slave labor became less profitable than industrialized was labor.  This thesis has come under a lot of scrutiny since its creation in the '40s.  More modern research suggests that there was no inevitable reason for slavery to disappear, and that it could well have flourished in a modern setting.  There's also a theory that slavery became less necessary as nations increased their imperial power in other continents, like Asia.  The workers there were not nominally slaves, but in practicality worked for almost nothing.  Rebecca Schloss' *Sweet Liberty* goes into emancipation in French-held Martinique and claims that the rise of beet sugar in Europe, combined with a public perception of slave owners as unvirtuous, made slavery less desirable which led to emancipation in its own right.  It's still an open debate, and there's probably no completely right answer since these factors all played into each other.",null,0,cdjc5k1,1r3vo5,askhistorians,top_week,3

If slavery would be unprofitable, slaveowners would probably just set their slaves free and move on, but this did not happen: governments abolished slavery. Therefore social or moral motives are more likely. Also, keep in mind that slavery is not the same as the slave trade: most countries outlawed the cross-ocean shipping of slaves in the early nineteenth century but allowed slavery to exist for years after that.",null,1,cdjlnqz,1r3vo5,askhistorians,top_week,1

Comprehensive  legislation  was  passed  between  1901  and  1917  to  tightly  regulate  the  rates  the  railroad  companies  could  charge.  The  Panama  Canal  Act  of  1917  forced  the  railroad  companies  to  divest  their  ownership  in  steamship  companies.  The  Southern  Pacific  used  to  own  fast  passenger  ships  that  could  go  from  New  Orleans  to  New  York  City  in  four  days,  four  hours,  or  as  the  brochure  said  ""One  Hundred  Golden  Hours  at  Sea""    The  Southern  Pacific  sold  34  ships  to  the  Atlantic  Steamship  Lines  in  1917.  It  also  explains  why  there  is  one  wharf  on  the  lower  east  side  of  Manhatten,   near  the  Fulton  Fish  market,  that  is  labeled  Southern  Pacific  Railroad,  when  that  railroad  did  not  go  east  of  New  Orleans.  The  Southern  Pacific  divested  a  fleet  nearly  as  large,  to  the  Pacific  Fast  Mail  Company.  The  Southern  Pacific  owned  54  ocean  going  steamships  and  it  was  the  largest  railroad  owned  fleet.  However,  many  railroads  owned  steamships.      
 The  Panama  Canal  Act  hurt  smaller  railroads,  like  the  New  York  Ontario  &amp;  Western  or  the  Rutland  railroad.  These  two  short  lines  had  ports  on  Lake  Ontario  and  used  Lake  Boats  to  serve  Chicago.     
       Railroad  unions  were  pretty  powerful  in  1917  and  in  1918  when  the  USRA  seized  control  of  the  US  railroad  system,  the  unions  negotiated  big  wage  increases,  mandated  safety  improvments  and  tried  to  reform  the  rather  chaotic  hours  of  work  and  haphazard  work  shift  scheduling  in  the  railroad  industry.  The  unions  achieved  most  of  their  goals,  but  I  don't  think  blocking  the  Panama  Canal  was  one  of  their  goals.  Of  course,  by  1917  and  1918  it  was  to  late  to  stop  a  canal  that  opened  in  1914.

The Republic of Texas maintained diplomatic relations with both major European powers of the day, England and France. They also (briefly and on a limited scale) traded with the Danes and Dutch and Belgians. 

Texas and France maintained embassies in their respective capitals of Austin and Paris; the French legation still stands in Austin and is a cool reminder to drive by and recall this place's interesting history. England maintained a consulate in Houston while Texas reciprocated in London. France was considering opening consulates general in Houston and Washington-on-the-Brazos as well. 

In conjuction with the Texan Navy, France's Navy helped to ensure Texan maritime sovereignty by facing off with the Mexican Navy in the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico, for its part, never considered Texas to be anything more than a state in rebellion, despite the existence of a treaty between the parties. 

Belgium also recognized Texas, and there was a Texan consulate in Antwerp. Russia recognized Texan independence but it is not known if (and is probably therefore unlikely) any diplomats ever travelled between the nations. Finally, the Netherlands also extended full recognition to Texas, with each nation having embassies in the other's capital. A small number of Dutch settlers arrived in Texas, though not in major numbers. 

Oh and also, obviously the United States! The United States also formally recognized Texas' independence and each nation maintained an embassy in the other capital.

An ""Islamic"" architect or engineer would be taught architecture and engineering,probably using original versions of Greek or Latin texts, or the Arabic translation if he did not speak Greek (it was typically in Greek). He would learn architecture and he would know that it was a Roman (Rum) thinker or writer but it would not be Roman architecture, it would be architecture developed or discovered by Romans.

khosikulu,"Depending on when you're talking about, there are a number of answers here.  First of all, the idea of taking on extracontinental territories was not a particularly popular one--Alaska notwithstanding--and even remained controversial during the Pacific expansion era (and Spanish American War).  The ""ground rules"" for colonial expansion in Africa were set at the Berlin *Kongokonferenz* of 1884-85, and the US had a representative there--but that representative, as [per an article in the New York *Times* at the end of January 1885](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F00A16FC3A5C15738DDDA90B94D9405B8584F0D3) (PDF), knew that the US had no interest in struggles for possession but only in the interests of its commerce.  

At the same time, the report in the *Times* also noted that the US in a way had one colony: Liberia.  It was in pretense an independent state after 1847 (and before that was a semi-private colony under the American Colonization Society); but in reality the implied shield of the United States served to limit the action another European power might take against it beyond cleaving off a little chunk of territory here or there.  But at the Berlin conference (based on the report), the US representative was clear that the Liberian precedent was the one the US supported all powers following--cession or purchase, with treaties (although in Liberia as elsewhere those agreements often weren't what either party thought they were).

In any case the US did send commerical agents and consuls to African colonies to safeguard American trade and commercial interests; they had one in the Congo Free State, for example, for a number of years.",null,2,cdjdguq,1r3sc4,askhistorians,top_week,8

It proved to be a problem even in 1898. Even if the political climate wouldn't have forbidden the colonization of Africa, the U.S. lacked the military strength throughout the 19th century to project power across the Atlantic. There might have been a short time span at the beginning of the 20th century when the U.S. navy would have been able to defend an American colony in Africa, But Africa was pretty much carved up by the European powers at that point.

DonaldFDraper,"I cannot speak much on the Seven Years War but I would argue that it would be due to the commitment to the North American colonies that there was no intended action to invade France or Britain.

As for the Napoleonic Wars, an odd secret about the Napoleonic Wars is that Britain repeatedly tried to invade France. Twice there have been major invasions, once Marshal Brune invaded Holland to stop a British invasion of the Netherlands &amp; Belgium in 1810, and Marshal Bernadotte stopped a British invasion in the Netherlands meant for Paris. Both times, the armies were stopped by a combination of disease and poor management.

On the other side, Napoleon was obsessed with the invasion of Britain. When he was a triumphant general in 1797, he pushed for an invasion of Britain but was allowed to invade Egypt instead. The famed Grande Armee was stationed near Brest was meant to invade Britain was placed there in 1804 for a pending invasion for Britain. They trained on amphibious landings for the purpose of invading the coast of Britain. This of course never happened because Austria had declared war on France and Napoleon turned his army toward glory.

There was a French marshal that was participating with an intended and failed invasion of Ireland but I cannot remember whom it was at the moment.

The odd thing is that it's never really mentioned. Britain use the Iberian peninsula due to Spanish and Portuguese resistance to France, it would be smarter for them to work with their allies against France rather than invade France directly. As the war went against the French in Spain, the Anglo-Iberian coalition attacked Southern France while the Pussians, Russians, and Austrians invaded France from the East and drove forward to Paris.

df-41,"Hi, Chinese person here,

Traditionally, China's mortal threats came from the northern land border (hence Great Wall of China) as most of China's foreign conquest attempts (Mongols, Manchus, Japanese) came from the North.

It was only during the Ming repulsion of Yuan in the 13th century, and Kuomintang (KMT/ROC) base in Guangzhou was there ever an south-to-north political transition. All political changes happened in the north, so northern-land border security was of paramount importance, hence Mao's private desire to keep Outer Mongolia within China, if for no other reason as a Chinese-aligned buffer state against USSR.

You can see Chinese anxieties of Russia (dating back to Czarist annexation of Trans-Baikal-Amur in Treaty of Aigun 1858) erupt during the Sino-Soviet split of 1969, and China mobilized nearly 10 million troops on her northern land border with USSR because she considered Russia as a mortal threat. This precipitated the quasi-alliance with U.S. via Western-Pacific oceanic trade, also with Western Europe via the South China Sea, and oil-imports from the Middle East via Straits of Malacca.


Post-USSR collapse (threat gone, yay!), and China-Russia signed a Border Treaty which resolved any disputes with Russia on border demarcations. Also, the China-Russia good-neighborliness treaty has a condition of withdrawal of mass troop formations from the Sino-Russian border, which means China has more resources to devote to other areas instead of northern land border.

NORTHERN LAND BORDER SECURED :-)

What about China's other land borders? China resolved 17 out of 23 land border disputes with her neighbors since 1949, and only has unresolved disputes with India and Japan. Himalayas are extremely formidable natural barrier to major troop movements, so no mortal threat can occur from Indian invasion of China, but unresolved claims is added military pressure to India to not harbor any designs on Tibet by supporting the exiled government and perhaps relieve pressure on Pakistan by establishing a two front war with India.

Since the 18th century, China's new emerging threat came from the arrival of European traders and imperialists, first the Dutch and Portuguese, then the French and British ships which resulted in the 1848 Opium Wars and subsequent opening of treaty ports, so China realized a new threat came from the Western Pacific...

What's next? First island chain consisting of Taiwan, Phillipines, Japan islands is where China is diverting her resources now. Previously it was a 60-20-20 split between Army, Navy, Airforce respectively, but since China's primary mortral threat (Russia and northern land border security) is now secured, she is shifting to a 50-25-25 split, with more resources going to the Navy and Airforce.

China plans to create a fleet of SSNB (first Tang-class SSBN unveiled one week ago), three (3) to five (5) aircraft carriers by 2020 (second carrier already under construction, will finish by 2015), Beidou global GPS coverage by 2020, and two (2) 5th generation stealth fighter programs deployed by 2020.

All this means that China's land borders are secured, China is focusing on force-projection to ensure survivability of her nuclear SSBN for a second-strike capability, in addition, naval force projection to secure sealanes of communications through the South China Sea to prevent U.S. naval blocade on Chinese oil imports from Middle East, or Chinese merchant shipment to the rest of the world.

&gt;In other words...did geography and topography form China’s political efforts in the 20th as it develops into a 2nd and potentially a 1st world power?

Yes, China was willing to risk nuclear annihilation against U.S. in Korean War 1950 because it wanted to prevent ROC/KMT troops reconquering the mainland through the Northern Korea... you can still see Chinese support for N. Koreas a defacto extension of the passive Great Wall concept, with N. Korea's buffer state and million men as delaying action until PLA troops arrive to safeguard her hinterland (Manchuria/Beijing area)...

No threat can come from the Himalayas-Pamir-Altai-Tian Shan mountain ranges from China's Western regions... That's why even China permitted U.S. presence in Afghanistan (bordering China), but not North Korea (bordering China), because the Western regions are near impassable. :D

Ugh, **21st century now mainly oceanic focus because of oil imports and significant wealth coming from oceanic trade, and protecting sealanes of communications..**. can't rely on the goodwill of the ~~imperialistic~~ U.S. navy forever...

ALSO!! China is investing massively in energy resources in Central Asian states, former Soviet-republics, because it wants to diversify it's energy supplies, and an overland pipeline route is a natural extension of the ancient silk road trade.

TheArrowsOfAgincourt,"I would put forward the following - 

- Possessions were few and far between in the middle ages; a sword was one of the most valuable things a person could have. As a result, knights wanted to show off their pride for their weapons by naming them.

- The tradition of naming weapons probably arose in the early middle ages, such as in the anglo-saxon and viking cultures. For example, the Viking King Magnus Barelegs had a sword called ""Legbiter"".

- Not only swords were named, but other weapons also, and sometimes armour and shields as well. In such warrior cultures weapons and armor were very prized possessions, and men would form a strong psychological bond with such items. Much like an American Frontiersman who named his rifle, these names represented the life and death relationship warriors had with their arms and armour. 

- Later in the middle ages, in the more continental traditions of knighthood in the high and late middle ages, this tradition was not formally practiced, although it is likely that some individual would have given their weapons informal nicknames.

Other examples of named swords I can think of -

- Edward the Confessor had the ""Sword of Mercy"" or ""Curtana"", which forms a part of the French epic you name above and according to legend, once belonged to Ogier the Dane.

- El Cid had a sword named ""Tizona"" which is on display in the Museo de Burgos, in Burgos, Spain.

While the Chinese government is certainly not as oppressive in terms of freedom of speech as many Western views would have you believe, Tiananmen is easily the most controversial topic and *is* very hard to find anything about in China even to this day (and by extension, the actions of the government in 1989 can't be judged either by the majority of the people). 

People at the time would have picked up on the first bits of it because some newspapers (notably People's Daily) and tv shows initially showed much of the protests, but after a few days they were silenced by the government, along with some large staff purges, but the media coverage of the final crackdown on 4 June would've been practically non-existent or extremely biased towards 'righteous' government action. Based on all this, I don't think an 'approval rate' of what *actually* happened is possible to know.

AgentCC,"One thing that is important to understand about the Tiananmen Square Protests was that it was largely an urban vs rural thing.  History may refer to the event as Tiananmen, but in reality, it was every urban center of significance across China that rose up in protest.  People in the cities tended to be a lot more educated and aware of their own government's corruption, other forms of government, and especially what was then going on in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (glasnost &amp; perestroika).  

China's rural population, however, had a very difficult time figuring out why urban Chinese were so dissatisfied with their government, especially considering how they had been the ones to benefit the most from the Reforms of 1979.  To them, it appeared that perhaps ungrateful city folk really had been manipulated by foreign instigators to self-sabotage the economic gains China had been making for the past ten years; and when it came down to cracking down on the protesters, it was the peasant-based army of the PLA who did the job.  

China was majority-rural in 1989.  Only [about a quarter of Chinese were urban](http://www.chinability.com/Population.htm).  The country only became majority urban (51%) about two years ago, so I suppose that **the rural majority of China (73.79%) probably would have given at least passive approval of the CCP's actions in Tiananmen,** if for no other reason than because of ignorance.  However, now that China is majority urban, perhaps the next Tiananmen will be a success.

redditho24602,"The ""sad clown"" thing can be traced back to the beginning of clowns, really. Back in the 16th century Italy invented the improv troop, basically, except they called it commedia dell'arte. At first these were little informal skits put on by actors during festivals and holidays, later organized troops evolved that would travel around Europe putting on little shows. These were pretty popular, and local troops would perform versions of them for years and years in many different countries, even up to the 19th century. 

Commedia shows consisted of short little scenes of everyday life, and they evolved stock characters --- the drunkard, the rich old man, the young lovers, the blowhard soldier --- to help quickly clue people in to what was going on in the scene. Each character had their own distinctive costume. The comic relief characters in commedia were some of the first clowns, and one of the most famous ones is Pierrot, who costume usually had his face painted white with a few black touches and a white outfit with a white ruff around his neck. Sweet, naive, dumb Pierrot is in love with and/or married to the beautiful Columbine, but she's into the dashing and clever Harlequin.

jaguardestroyer,"I'll answer to the oldest of my knowledge:

In the wall paintings that we have from the Bronze Age peoples of the Aegean–Minoan, Cycladic, and Mycenaean peoples–there seem to be distinctions in class or age (or both) based on hairstyles. The Late Minoan (LM IA in conventional chronology) settlement on Santorini known as Akrotiri, which was destroyed in the 17th century BCE in a volcanic eruption, gives us great evidence for this. Several of the buildings have frescoes that are relatively well-preserved (images: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(Santorini)) and show people who seem to be of different genders and ages.

Ellen N Davis in ""Youth and Age in the Thera Frescoes"" (American Journal of Archaeology 1986, available via JSTOR) argues that the differences in hairstyle can be attributed to indications of age; so children have heads that are shaved in particular ways with particular topknots, and older adolescents exhibit different hairstyles that are gender-distinguished. Davis delineates 4 separate stages of maturity according to her analysis of the frescoes from Akrotiri. These hairstyles might have been associated with rituals for initiations into new life-stages; IE, an infant makes it to their fifth year, and gets these topknots; then the hair is allowed to grow naturally until the next stage, IE puberty, and then it is fashioned a different way, and at the next life stage the bangs are cut. This is somewhat speculative, but it fits with comparative scholarship on life stage rituals.

Now, the Late Minoan period is approaching the end of the Aegean Bronze Age, which comes to a halt around 4 centuries later for reasons not entirely clear; the earliest traces of the Bronze Age begin about 15 centuries earlier than these frescoes on Akrotiri. Minoan civilization was not, it seems, thoroughly continuous for all this time, but there was a reasonable degree of continuity, for instance in language: linear A, versus linear B on the Greek mainland (the same language as ancient Greek but written in different characters: see Thomas Palaima's book ""The Scribes of Pylos"", 1988). So I can't say for certain when this convention of hairstyles associated with life-stages originates, but safe to say it's well before the 17th century BCE. Which is after all 3500 years ago.

Later on (a lot later on) in ancient Greece and Rome, we see associations of particular hairstyles with particular stages of life: Greek and Roman portrait busts are great for this, even if they're typically not useful as literal representations of their subject. So young women wore their hair down, and married women wore theirs up (generally speaking), young men might wear long hair but cut it short when they got serious about the military (or keep wearing it long, and risk ridicule for perceived vanity). Fashions went in and out during these periods. Alexander the Great had big flowy lacrosse hair, and after him many powerful men, especially those who had major military conquests in the eastern Mediterrnean, would depict themselves with flowy lacrosse hair. For instance, check out Pompey the Great's hair, or this coin with the Roman statesman L. Quinctius Flamininus' flowy hair: http://imgur.com/gPc309d",null,0,cdj8l0h,1r3ahe,askhistorians,top_week,2
andylowell,"The following is the most relevant passage from the Book of Mormon concerning polygamy (Jacob 2:23-30; a prophet named Jacob preaching in the temple to his people, the ""Nephites""):

 23 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.
 24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.
 25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.
 26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.
 27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;
 28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.
 29 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.
 30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.

I don't think it's quite accurate, therefore, to say in a huge blanket statement that, ""the Book of Mormon condone[s] polygamy."" Rather, the Book of Mormon explains that God reserves the right to allow his people to practice polygamy, but ONLY if He expressly commands his people to do so. The stated purpose is to ""raise up seed unto [God]."" The Book of Mormon spends seven verses excoriating those who practiced polygamy without divine authorization, arguably implying that they acted out of their own selfish lust. 

Also, from your question ""do we know why Mormonism allows for polygamy?,"" I just want to make it clear that the Church does NOT currently allow for polygamy. President Hinckley, President of the Church in 1998 reiterated that, “if any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.”

I'm also not sure that it's accurate to say that Joseph Smith ""encouraged plural marriage."" Definitely he encouraged some individuals to practice plural marriage, but in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a whole, [this article] (http://blog.beliefnet.com/flunkingsainthood/2011/07/polygamy-by-numbers-how-many-mormons-were-really-involved.html), for instance, suggests that on average, no more than 30% of Church membership was involved in polygamous relationships. It was not a requirement for all members.

As for a ""general historical consensus,"" it's hard to say. Opinions about Joseph Smith tend to be very, very polarized. Detractors have claimed that Joseph's motives were lustful, that he had a ""voracious sexual appetite."" Some of those sources are [here] (http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Polygamy/Lustful_motives/CriticalSources). There is some evidence that Joseph Smith and other early Church leaders were very, very reluctant to institute the practice, but they felt like they had been commanded by God, and so they obeyed. Check out some materials [here] (http://mormonhistoricsites.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Encouraging-Joseph-Smith-to-Practice-Plural-Marriage-The-Accounts-of-the-Angel-with-a-Drawn-Sword.pdf) and [here] (http://en.fairmormon.org/Plural_marriage_spiritual_manifestations).

For what it's worth, I believe that Joseph was motivated by perceived moral obligation to God rather than sexual appetite. That, however, is an opinion borne of my own convictions, experience, and interpretation of what facts exist. I can't really tell you which evidences or arguments you'll find more compelling. Best of luck to you, therefore, in your own studies!

Unfortunately, I don't have a great answer for you. Michoacan is still very much, as /u/400-Rabbits so aptly put it, ""the archaeological equivalent of 'Here There Be Dragons.'"" There's been some minor work on the Formative Period cultures. Since I know you've got a rough background in the El Opeño/shaft tomb tradition in western Michoacan/Jalisco/Nayarit I won't discuss that one. (You probably know more than I do about it, given your background). The northern end of Michoacan near the Río Lerma/Lake Cuitzeo was home to a culture known today as Chupícuaro. They appear to have been a largely agrarian culture known for elaborately painted ceramics such as [this figurine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chupicuaro_statuette_Louvre_70-1998-3-1.jpg). Artifacts in Chupicuaro style show up in Central Mexico as well, so they were clearly trading with each other at this time. Not much research on them has been done, but they seem to have built towns/villages along lakes and river shores primarily. They started building monumental architecture and showing emerging class distinctions by the Terminal Formative/Early Classic period, but there's little evidence of warfare. The Formative Period was also home to a couple of important cultures known as the Chumbícuaro and and the Mescala located in the southwest and southern portions of the state respectively. These cultures are even less researched - primarily due to lack of interest in the scholarly community and modern drug cartel activity in the area. ([This map](http://imgur.com/GdQx26n) from Pollard 1993 shows the locations of various formative period cultures, the Mescala culture is labeled ""Balsas."")

Larger-scale ceremonial centers begin to show up in Central Michoacan during the Classic Period. El Otero near Lake Chapala, Tres Cerritos near Lake Cuitzeo, and Tingambato on the western edge of the Central Mexican Plateau all have monumental architecture including pyramd-temples, sunken plazas, elaborate tombs, and occasionally ballcourts. However, a lot of this work is controversial - especially Tingambato. The archaeologists who restored the site reconstructed it in a Talud-Tablero form which suggests direct influence from Teotihuacan. This is not universally accepted to be the case, as only a few Teotihuacano artifacts have shown up at these sites. It's still possibly true that Teo had a strong influence in Classic Period Michoacan, but further research needs to be done to confirm it. As I'm sure you're aware, this is also the period when complex societies appear in Jalisco as well, and the nature of contact between the two regions is not well established.

The Epiclassic/Early Postclassic appears to be the period when large scale urbanism gets started. Good research has been done on this in the Cuitzeo and Zacapu basins (in the northern end of the state), and research in the Pátzcuaro Basin covering this time period is still ongoing but paints a similar picture. The number and size of settlements in these areas increases, and many appear to nucleate in defensible positions which suggests competition/warfare. This is also the period when metallurgy is first introduced to the region. But once again, this period has very little concrete published research, especially in the Pátzcuaro Basin. Ask again in 10 years and I'll have a better answer :)

EDIT: I should state that my main source for the above is *Tariacuri's Legacy* by Helen Pollard (1993). It's a book I have mixed feelings about.

mormengil,"Legitimate Privateers, in possession of a legitimate ""Letter of Marque"" from their government, and operating within the terms of that ""Letter of Marque"", (usually terms only allowed the privateer to make war on a country with whom the issuing country was formally ""at war"") would be treated the same as a captured naval vessel and naval crew.

Privateers (operating legitimately) were private warships.

So, the ship and its cargo would be seized and sold and the proceeds split among the captors, just like any other prize money.  The crew would be treated the same as any other prisoners of war.  (Unlike pirates, who would be tried and possibly hung if convicted.)

If there was any doubt about the legitimacy of the ""Letter of Marque."" or whether the Privateer was operating outside the terms of the ""Letter of Marque"", a court would decide whether the enterprise was legitimate privateering or had crossed the line into piracy.

Most of the  European powers signed ""The Declaration of Paris in 1856"" which abolished Privateering.  The United States did  not sign.  Neither did Prussia, and they were the last nation to utilize Privateering in the Franco Prussian War of 1870.

HomeAliveIn45,"Actually the Supreme Court has repeatedly found that Constitutional rights can in some instances be extended to non-citizen residents of the US, even going so far as to offer 14th Amendment rights to the children of undocumented immigrants in [Plyler v. Doe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe). In that case, it was found that undocumented children have a right to public education because of the wording of the equal protection clause, which reads ""No state shall... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" It does not say ""deny to any citizen"", but specifically says ""person"". Once the court found that undocumented immigrant children are, in fact, people, it then concluded in a 5-4 decision that the equal protection clause must apply to them.

The founders' concept of 'universal rights' isn't exactly that useful here, as they obviously didn't include people such as slaves and women when it came to constitutional liberties. It is therefore incorrect to assume that there's been some sort of degenerative transition in the application of universal rights- does 'universal rights' mean that foreign nationals have a right to vote in US elections for example?

Also the 14th was of course a reconstruction amendment (1868 I believe), but the 4th and 5th amendments are similarly worded and therefore also apply to non-citizen residents.

snickeringshadow,"Andean people saw metal in a fundamentally different way from Europeans. Metal was a material of symbolic, religious importance. Using it for utilitarian purposes was wasteful. Those few tools that were made from metal were implements like tweezers and needles where ductility was more important than hardness. If a tool/weapon was designed to be a blunt implement like a hammer or mace, it was made from heavy rock like basalt. If a tool/weapon was designed to be a cutting implement it was made from obsidian or chert.

Bronze and copper actually have low marginal benefits compared to these materials. By that I mean, early bronze implements aren't *that* much better than stone.

And it is on JSTOR, so you can read it online for free if you don't have journal database access. Basically, she takes a different take from the idea that metal is simply technologically and economically superior (a very Western argument that fails to understand what Andean culture was all about) and argues instead that there was major cultural reasons why metal was never considered fit for everyday use. To be sure, there were metal weapons and other tools (I've seen bronze and copper mace heads, and I've seen atlatls tipped with copper-gold dart tips), but these were always elite, symbolic objects. 

And I'm not even sure that it is a rarity issue; the Inca and other Andean peoples had massive state-centered economies, master artisans and metallurgists, and lots that they could have traded in exchange for metals that are abundant in the mountains, but they didn't. They used stone tools for most cutting tasks right until the Spanish came. And when I was trying to figure out why that was (coming from the very Western idea that metal was superior so duh, why not use it?), I read Lechtman's article and it really gave me a new perspective. I can't really explain it, though (and it's been a few years since I last read it), so you should just take a look at it.

Qhapaqocha,"My cohorts /u/snickeringshadow and /u/Pachacamac have already given some very good reasons as to why using metal for weaponry was only marginally better, and that it already had symbolic connotations. To synthesize these arguments I would simply say that elites throughout the Andes controlled metallurgy tightly, partly because it required a decent expense to create, and partly because they could do so because Joe Q. Farmer could get by just as easily with lithics for their cutting, chopping and plowing.

The other thing to consider is that before the Spanish showed up, winning many battles in South America was a numbers game. The team with more players generally won - and with well-maintained road systems and infrastructure the Inca could move thousands of troops quickly and comfortably wherever they were needed. Arming Inca warriors with stone implements was just as effective as arming them with metal weapons, and more cost-effective. Plus, the leaders get shiny weapons to denote prestige or command.

Another interesting note here: technically, the Inca *did* make metal weapons for their troops...post-Contact. Iron arrowheads were constructed that could pierce Spanish steel plate armor - though employed in limited quantities it was effective when used. Also, there was a concerted refocusing of using *bolas*, or balls tied to rope, thrown to trip up Spanish cavalry, as well as the use of pikes to mitigate charges by conquistadors.

The problem with the V-2 rocket project was that it was *expensive* on multiple levels. For all it's work, there was reasonably little result- they averaged two civilian casualties per launch. Now, some want to argue that this is screwed because of many bad launches that either went off course, or exploded prematurely, but that doesn't change the reality. It was a strategic weapon against an enemy who's main production was far outside the effective range of these weapons. And to reiterate, yes, it was *expensive.* The net cost of the project was around 3 billion USD (for the entire V weapon project). The Manhatten project ran 1.9 billion. Both of these figures are in war-time currency. 



When you research the history of German production in this period you find three common narratives- Germany didn't hit wartime production till it was too late, they had awful organization and they had a poor understanding of practicality.


The V rocket project was an intersection of all three of these things. For it's scale, it was impractical (for ""practical"" rocket weapons, consult Katyusha rocket batteries or even the Calliope modification for M4 Shermans, or British Land Mattress launchers), it was expensive, production started too late, and for all that was spent, it probably had the worst cost in : results out of any major weapon project of the war, short of projects that simply got canceled.

Drsamuel,"&gt; Was Germany the only country who had V-2s'?

Germany was the only country to make and use V2s during the war.  The US, Canada, Britain, and the USSR captured V2s at the end of the war.  

&gt; Why weren't they used in the war, even at the end?

Germany used them during the war.  From what I've read they were not very effective.  They had the advantage of carrying a large bomb, traveled too fast to intercept, and fell faster than the speed of sound so the victims had no warning.  They had the disadvantage of being horribly expensive, used relatively rare resources, and were inaccurate.  The V2s were long range, but were only useful for targeting cities.   

All this combined to make V2s useful only as a weapon of terror and propaganda, but with no larger effect on the allied war effort.

&gt; Who took control of their plans / production after the war?

As above the US, Canada, Britain, and the USSR captured V2s, V2 parts, and scientists. Most of the high level scientists wanted to be captured by the US.  The V2 manufacturing factory (a huge cave to protect it from bombing)  ended up in the soviet zone of control. The US and the USSR used V2 technology to create their own rockets after the war, the Redstone and R-1 respectively.  ",null,1,cdj0rqe,1r2n9y,askhistorians,top_week,3

XenophonTheAthenian,"A better question might be what *weren't* the Persians doing! The Peloponnesian War lasted about 30 years, but the conflict between Sparta and Athens was actually *twice as long*, beginning with the so-called First Peloponnesian War in 460. It's for this reason, as well as the fact that the so-called Peloponnesian War is actually a series of separate conflicts involving Sparta and her allies and Athens in her allies that many scholars prefer to call them the Peloponnesian Wars in the plural, or at least break them up into stages (during many of these stages Sparta and Athens were never officially at war with one another). So it's kind of complicated, but we can essentially break up Persia's actions into domestic and foreign affairs.

Domestically, the 5th Century was kind of problematic for the Achaemenids. Their losses against the Greeks at the beginning of the century (and later, since armed conflict with Persia continued, particularly among the states of Asia Minor, until about 450) were disastrous, and even though the Empire had the ability to make up such losses it couldn't do it easily, particularly when there were domestic issues to deal with. And along with the serious loss of face that the Great King suffered among his satraps, Xerxes' successor, Artaxerxes I, caused a lot of cultural and economic trouble. Artaxerxes instituted a series of policies that completely revamped the way that the Persian state functioned politically, economically, and culturally. Importantly, he moved the functional seat of the state from Persepolis (which remained a ceremonial center) to Babylon, dropped the use of Elamite in court, and instituted a wide-reaching policy of Zoroastrianism, which essentially became the religion of the court and of the nobility. His cultural reforms were not the only things that caused trouble, although they did a great deal to alienate him from much of the nobility and the border-satrapies (although the Hebrews seem to have liked him). It was during Artaxerxes' reign, possibly due to the diminished military influence of the Great King, that a series of satrapies entered into revolt against the Persian rulers. In particular, the most important of these was the revolt of the Egyptians in 460 (more on that later), but more problems were to occur following Artaxerxes' death. At this point a deeply divided nobility decided to rally behind Darius II, who assassinated Sogdianus, himself the murderer of his half-brother Xerxes II, the eldest son of Artaxerxes. With the support of the Persian nobility Darius II was able to seize the throne and take command, in 423. 

In terms of foreign affairs the Achaemenids had it no easier. Their inability to be a major military presence, as well as the fact that the Great King's ability to police the satrapies was greatly reduced, resulted in several problems. For starters, the satrapies, which had always had some independence, became more and more autonomous, something that Darius I and Xerxes I would never have allowed. A bigger problem, though, was the issue of the Ionians, who were instilling revolt among the peoples of Asia Minor, and the Delian League, which was becoming rapidly more and more of a thorn in the Great King's side. Following the Persian defeats at Salamis and Plataea, the Greek fleet, under the leadership of Athens, set out to liberate the islands and conquered regions. After a couple years the job was entirely left to Athens and her League, who were the only ones rich enough and with enough of a naval presence to be entrusted to the task (and damn if Athens was about to let anyone stop her!). As Athens' empire grew, the Persians became more fearful, particularly since the Athenians had not yet made peace and were perfectly capable of mauling a diminished Persian military force that already had far too many domestic troubles to deal with. To protect herself without committing too many resources, Persia essentially tried to cause as much trouble as possible for Greek politics by offering funding to one state or the other. This funding primarily went to Sparta's allies, although the Persians were pretty good at trying to make it seem like they might give it to the Athenians in exchange for favorable relations (which caused some trouble for the Athenian state, helping to stir up tensions between the old aristocracy and the rest of the demos). War continued between Persia and ""Greece"" (i.e. Athens), and the outbreak of the First Peloponnesian War offered the Persians the perfect chance to undermine Athenian interests. The Persians here had no issues with directly funding Sparta, since the Athenians had yet to make peace with Persia. As a result, the Peloponnesians, who honestly were in no state to begin a war this early (whereas the Athenians were in a much better state, although not totally ready either), were able to continue fighting through the early stages of the war. However, the Athenians were still able to defeat the Peloponnesians, except that they decided it was a good time to attack Sparta's ally, Persia, and supported the Egyptian Revolt (in reality it was a Libyan revolt, but whatever). This became problematic when Athens' prized troops--her marine force--and the majority of her fleet became bottled up in Egypt for the next six years or so, which allowed the Peloponnesians to rebuild their strength (partly with the help of Persian gold). As a result the First Peloponnesian War ended in stalemate, although the Persians ended up squashing the Egyptian Revolt once the Athenians were forced to withdraw. 

But then the Peloponnesian War proper. During the first part of the war (the Archidamian War) Persia maintained pretty strict neutrality, although feeding Sparta money to fund the fleets of her allies (and the pathetic excuse for a naval force they were already fielding). But the Archidamian War ended, if not in Athenian victory, in a pretty good state of affairs for Athens, who proceeded to blow it all on the Sicilian Expedition (let's not get into the reasons behind all that). At this point, combined with Alcibiades' defection, the Persians felt that they could start to more openly support the Spartans, with whom they made a secret pact. In exchange for vast funding to build up their fleet, the Spartans agreed to hand over the Ionian cities to the Persians in the event of victory--a *complete* stab in the back, since the Spartans were telling anyone they were fighting under the banner of liberation for the Ionians against Athenian imperialism (hence the fact that the terms of the pact were kept secret), and one that contributed to the *massive* backlash against the Spartans (who also were really tyrannical administrators, exacting several times more tribute than the Athenians had demanded) after the war. But the Spartan victory was pretty much entirely due to Persian gold, which allowed them not only to continue fighting, but even to venture into Athenian territory--the sea. Did it pay for the Persians in the end? Sort of. They got Athens off their backs, at least temporarily, which was pretty high up on the list of priorities, but the Spartans were totally ungrateful. Following the return of Xenophon's Ten Thousand the Spartan king Agesileus decided that he could get massive brownie points for Sparta (which was currently being viewed as the asshole of the world) if he recruited the remaining Ten Thousand and marched with his army into Asia Minor to liberate the Ionians (whom the Spartans had abandoned in the first place). The attempt resulted in failure, due to complications in Greece and general Spartan ineptitude, but the Persians still weren't too happy.",null,2,cdj2l38,1r2hm3,askhistorians,top_week,16
SnakeGD09,"So, Tissaphernes, a Persian satrap, was the Persian commander in Asia Minor. I'm not sure if there is any text found in Persian, but Thucydides talks at length about him. Darius II ordered tribute be collected from the Greek cities in Asia Minor.

In carrying out Darius II's order, Tissaphernes chose not to directly interfere in the Greek conflict. No Persian land forces or naval forces fought in the war. The idea was to let Athens and Sparta wear one another down militarily before taking any action. The Persians agreed to fund the Lacedaemonian navy...sort of.

Tissaphernes and Alcibiades played off one another during the war. Alcibiades convinced Tissaphernes to adopt the strategy he did. Although allied with the Lacedaemonians he advised Tissaphernes to find excuses in order to improperly fund their navy, giving them no advantage over Athens by sea.

For his part, Tissaphernes was able to use Alcibiades as his connection and mouthpiece in Athens.

At the same time Alcibiades convinced the Athenians that he had Tissapherne's confidence (ie had his ear as a trusted advisor) in order to convince them to accept his return. As part of this Alcibiades lied to the Athenians, telling them that Darius II would not be able to trust Athens as an ally as long as it was ruled democratically - Alcibiades did not trust the democracy accepting his return. This lead to the whole council of 400 debacle.

At one point Tissaphernes promises to bring up the Persian navy to assist the Lacedaemonians, and is observed both by Alcibiades acting for Athens and by Lacedaemonian envoys. It's likely that Alcibiades knows that Tissaphernes does not actually intend to bring this naval force, and later claims that his influence averted the sending of the Persian fleet to the assistance of Lacedaemon. For their part is it at this point that the Spartan observers realize they are being played.

Tissaphernes then realizes that he is losing control, as he has been found out, and ventures to Lacedaemon to offer an apology.

I got the impression that ""The King"" as Darius II is referred to as, is not terribly interested given his complete absence and delegation of the matter to Tissaphernes. The Persians were certainly afraid of losing control of the Greek cities in their domain in Asia Minor, but they didn't take military action.",null,1,cdj4hp0,1r2hm3,askhistorians,top_week,3

Tiako,"This is a *huge* and rather difficult topic, filled with an enormous amount of controversy. The battle lines are also almost constantly being redrawn--in the 1980s, for example, I would say the argument was largely over questions of cultural resistance, while now it tends to be more focused on inequality.

The issue is ultimately what we mean by ""Romanization"". For a very long time, scholars were led by a particular passage from Tacitus (*Agricola* 21) into thinking of Romanization as being a deliberate policy of cultural change, a strategy for either civilizations or conquest, depending on how you looked at it. For various reasons (chiefly lack of evidence), this view is no longer really supported, and it was often replaced by the opposite view, that the Roman material we see all across the empire (baths in Britain, *terra sigilata* in Spain, etc) was actually just a thin veneer over a generally unchanging society, and to think these represented an actual change in the identity of the people is to ignore the ways that the meanings and use of objects change in different situations. A statue of, say, Jupiter would have a very different meaning in North Africa than in Rome, and this emphasizes resistance or continuity, again depending on how you want to characterize it. This is still contested, but generally goes a a bit too far and often has a certain aspect of nationalism and romanticization.

Probably still the best perspective is that which was advocated in Greg Woolf's *Becoming Roman: The Origin of Provincial Civilization in Gaul*, in which he essentially rejects both interpretations in favor of an understanding of ""Rome"" as a concept, identity and culture as being extremely complex and multifaceted. Thus, the very process of change can be defined as ""becoming Roman"" even if it produces highly divergent cultural outcomes than what is actually in the city of Rome because even within the city the cultural experiences and identities were enormous varied. Rather than transforming their culture to be more like Latium, they become part of the process which defines what it means to be ""Roman"".

So I suppose the simplest answer is that things changed in Gaul a great deal and everywhere--there are no ""hidden valleys"" of Gauls carrying on with their winged helmets and magic cauldrons. But that doesn't mean they lost their distinctiveness or identity.",null,0,cdiwb2v,1r2dzg,askhistorians,top_week,21
ProfessorRekal,"Honestly, I don't know much about the experience of physically or mentally challenged individuals enduring slavery, so frankly I'm as curious as you are. 

One related theme I can comment on is the treatment of elderly slaves, who might have suffered from similar ailments. The stereotypical image of elderly slaves presented in the antebellum South and later in various forms of popular media is that of paternalistic slave masters taking gentle care of slaves too old or infirm to continue working, ensuring their safety, security, and comfort as they slipped into their dotage. 

Undoubtedly such behavior occurred in some slave households. But it wasn't typical. More frequent was exploitation in another cruel form. Slave owners sometimes sold elderly slaves for cheap prices before the point of complete physical exhaustion. Providing food, clothing, care, and medicine for a slave cost money, which cut into often already very tight profit margins for many slave plantations. Better to sell then while some tiny profit can be still drawn from their bodies. Such slave sales broke up slave families and sundered decades of relationships. 

Most common was emancipation of elderly slaves. At first glance this would seem like a boon, not a burden. That would certainly be the case if the slave was freed in their youth or middle-age, when wealth, careers, and families might provide the basis for support in their final years. But emancipation at age 75 or 80 meant supporting yourself at the moment when you have no resources to do so. Elderly slaves often couldn't work because of bad health incurred by decades of literally back-breaking labor. There's no pensions for emancipated slaves, no subsidized housing, no social support net of any kind. The best an emancipated slave could expect were ""freedom dues"" given by their masters, which often consisted of cash, land, or the materials needed to farm independently. But awarding such freedom dues was the exception, not the rule in much of the South. Elderly freemen struggled to feed, clothe, and house themselves and often required charity and luck to survive for any extended period. 

The widespread practice of essentially abandoning elderly slaves  became a condemned practice across the South (and beyond). State legislatures tightened emancipation laws in the last decades before the Civil War to deal with this problem, which in turn restricted overall access to emancipation for both young and old. Some states, [like Missouri](http://books.google.com/books?id=EW1ox4CWx9YC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=elderly+slaves+cost+emancipation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GPSMUsOeHMzrkAfO8IHgCw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=elderly%20slaves%20cost%20emancipation&amp;f=false), forced slave masters to post substantial bonds aside for every elderly slave they freed to discourage the practice.

""Psychological and neurological conditions also affected the soundness of African American slaves. Although some antebellum observers -- using the misinterpreted results of the 1840 census as evidence --  argued that 'hard working' slaves were less susceptible to the disappointments of a more 'refined' life and thus less likely to be afflicted with nervous disorders than their white masters, there are many cases of bondspeople identified with a variety of psychological and neurological disorders. In 1953 historian William Dosite Postell examined antebellum probate records from different counties and parishes in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana, and determined that of the 31,170 slaves mentioned in these records, 391 were identified as suffering from some type of mental affliction; the records use such terms to describe them as simpletons, imbeciles, crazy, deranged, insane, 'subject to spasms' or fits, and afflicted with paralysis, palsy, and spinal injury. However, Postell acknowledges that slaveholders and overseers inconsistently applied these labels, and because of these irregularities, the prevalence of nervous disorders among African American slaves was probably much higher than his statistical analysis indicates. **Moreover, Todd Savitt has pointed out that a majority of individuals with mental disorders, white and black, were not institutionalized in the mid-nineteenth century, and these slaves were just incorporated into plantation life; indeed, 'the lines separating mental soundness from temporary and total insanity were necessarily hazy.'** However, any personality, emotional, or neurological disorder was viewed as important for disclosure in slave sales [...] The loss of labor, and difficulty in controlling slaves with nervous ailments, made mental and neurological disorders a significant cause of unsoundness in African American slaves.""

bettinafairchild,"Well, here's an anecdote about a mentally disturbed slave. The recently released film 12 Years a Slave tells the true story of a free man, Solomon Northup of New York, who is kidnapped into slavery. When he is first imprisoned in Washington DC, he is with a woman named Eliza, who is in her mid-20s and has 2 children aged about 7 and 10. While they were slaves, she lived with her master in a separate house as his lover, and was well-treated, as were her children. Then they were all abruptly sold to a particularly nasty slaver and were transported to Louisiana. Then they were split up, with the mother very powerfully and tearfully resisting separation from her 2 children. Once they were split up, the film shows her in a near constant state of tears, missing her kids. The book goes into more detail: she was very depressed, and was listless and sad most of the time. She talked about her children all the time, and often talked TO them, as if they were there with her. While she was hired to work as a ladies maid, due to her behavior, she was sent to work in the fields. She was no good there either due to her obvious mental issues. Now keep in mind that the master she had there was described by the book's author, Solomon Northup, as the best, most ""Christian"", good man he had ever met in his whole life. The man had even tried to buy the woman's daughter to keep them together, but the slaver wouldn't sell the daughter because she was a beautiful girl (remember, age 7) so in a few years he was sure he could sell her to men for $5000.   So what did this paragon of wonderful slave ownership do when his slave was depressed because her children were taken away from her and she'd never see them again? He sold her for almost nothing to a cruel master who whipped her a lot to get her to do anything. But she didn't really respond to whipping, either. Eventually she just lay down in the slave quarters and didn't get up. The other slaves tried to feed her and take care of her, but she was not very responsive, and after awhile in this semi-catatonic state, she died, only around 2 years after her children were taken from her, still in her 20s. So that's what you get from a master that a slave described as being one of the best.

Here's another example: Dr. J. Marion Sims, father of American gynecology, put the word out that he wanted to buy slaves suffering from ""female troubles"". So he bought such women, and did surgical experiments on them, on slave babies, and on non-enslaved women too, since by law a husband could ask a doctor to perform surgery on his wife, and she had no legal say in the matter. He performed over 30 surgeries on one enslaved woman. No anesthesia.

The man had even tried to buy the woman's daughter to keep them together, but the slaver wouldn't sell the daughter because she was a beautiful girl (remember, age 7) so in a few years he was sure he could sell her to men for $5000.   So what did this paragon of wonderful slave ownership do when his slave was depressed because her children were taken away from her and she'd never see them again? He sold her for almost nothing to a cruel master who whipped her a lot to get her to do anything. But she didn't really respond to whipping, either. Eventually she just lay down in the slave quarters and didn't get up. The other slaves tried to feed her and take care of her, but she was not very responsive, and after awhile in this semi-catatonic state, she died, only around 2 years after her children were taken from her, still in her 20s. So that's what you get from a master that a slave described as being one of the best.

Here's another example: Dr. J. Marion Sims, father of American gynecology, put the word out that he wanted to buy slaves suffering from ""female troubles"". So he bought such women, and did surgical experiments on them, on slave babies, and on non-enslaved women too, since by law a husband could ask a doctor to perform surgery on his wife, and she had no legal say in the matter. He performed over 30 surgeries on one enslaved woman. No anesthesia.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Marion_Sims

Then there's drapetomania, which a doctor declared to be a mental disorder among slaves that caused them to want to run away. He was laughed at my most other doctors for this, but it shows the mindset that anyone even entertained this idea as being in the least legitimate. ",null,3,cdjiyu8,1r2dcf,askhistorians,top_week,11

thrasumachos,"Excluding mythological figures, off the top of my head, the earliest fictional characters I can think of come from Greek comedy. Unfortunately, a lot of these don't survive. So, the earliest extant text with a non-mythological fictional character that I could think of would be Aristophanes' [The Acharnians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acharnians) (425 B.C.), as comedy prior to Aristophanes comes to us in fragments alone.

There's also the Batrachomyomachia--a comedic account of a battle of mice and frogs that was traditionally attributed to Homer in Roman times. It's a parody of the Iliad that has anthropomorphic animal characters. The dating of the Batrachomyomachia is incredibly controversial, but it was likely written during the 1st century B.C.

The earliest non-mythological prose fiction I can think of would be either Chariton's *Callirhoe*--a historical novel written in the 1st century A.D., but set in the time period following the Peloponnesian War--or Apuleius' *Golden Ass*, a novel written in the first person that follows around a man who is turned into a donkey. Petronius' *Satyricon* postdates these only slightly, as well.

LieBaron,"I can't claim to be an expert, but a good bid would be bird and fish from, well, '[debate between bird and fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_between_Bird_and_Fish)'. 

But really, the question is incredibly hard to answer. For instance, if we discount mythological accounts that seems relatively simple, yet a lot of mythological accounts have a mix of historical/mythical and allegorical elements, and occasionally even veer into the genre of the joke. 

As an example, some people today are literalists when it comes to the Book of Revelations. Yet (to the best of my knowledge), this was never the intention of the author, nor how people at the time read it, but rather as allegory or metaphor. And as far as I know, there are a lot of religious doctrines that take varying approaches to their holy texts in between the spectrum of 'wholly literal' and 'wholly metaphorical' - many of which try to avoid or transcend such distinctions at all.

More importantly, our conceptions of what is or isn't 'fiction' might differ quite a bit from the ideas of ancient peoples, who could easily have very different ideas of what constituted fiction and fact. Hell, even today there are plenty of genres and authors that deliberately challenge our notions on these things, and a lot of stories are successful exactly because they blend fact and fiction, from 4chan copypasta to urban legends about Albert Einstein or ivory-tower intellectuals being dumbfounded by upright Christian marines.

LiesAboutKnowingYou,"Full Disclosure: I am neither Jewish nor a historian, my knowledge on this topic is purely from personal interest and classes related to my degree in Middle Eastern Studies.

I would strongly suggest picking up material on the creation of the modern state of Israel. [Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, by Charles Smith](http://www.amazon.com/Palestine-Arab-Israeli-Conflict-History-Documents/dp/0312535015) might be a good place to start. There seems to be a common notion that there was Palestine then the West tromped in and just said ""Everyone out, this is the Jews land, now."" This is nowhere close to the truth. The Jews were not just handed the state of Israel. The modern Jewish push for statehood can be traced back to the end of the 19th century when [Theodor Herzl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl) pushed for international Jewry to leave Europe and found a national home for the Jews. He specifically mentions Argentina and Israel in his paper [*Der Judenstaat*](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/herzl2.html). Europe, particularly Eastern Europe with its [pogroms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire) and even in Western Europe with the [Hep Hep Riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep-Hep_riots) in Germany and the [Dreyfus Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair) in France, was not a jovial happy place for many Jews living there, long before the Nazi party came to power. With this in mind many Jewish leaders (quite often secular leaders) began to push strongly for this idea of a mass exodus towards a yet undecided land. The long and short of it is that Ottoman controlled Palestine won out over plans to resettle in Argentina, [Uganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Scheme), and at one point Nazi Germany suggested deporting its Jewish population to [Madagascar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_Plan), as well as I'm sure some other places.

You could fill hundreds of pages with how they moved forward to meet this goal but the crux of it is that mass immigration, legal and illegal, into Ottoman controlled Palestine was supported, funded, and lobbied for by a variety of Jewish organizations ([Lovers of Zion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_of_Zion, [World Zionist Organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization), etc etc). Once there the idea was to buy as much land from the Ottomans and local Palestinians as was possible in long term preparation for a Jewish state. As it became apparent what they were doing, Palestinian anger fueled Ottoman authorities to put immigration limits in place.

Skipping forward a few years (check out [Sykes-Picot Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) and more importantly the [Balfour Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) ) the Ottomans lose WWI lose their Middle Eastern holdings and in moves Britain to Palestine. Britain has made certain promises about the future creation of a Jewish state, promises that is not really intending to follow through on and promises similar to the ones it made to Palestinians and other Arab groups regarding making their own independent states if they assist them in fighting the Ottomans.

Zionist groups have taken this encouragement from Britain to gather support for their cause and dramatically spike Jewish immigration. Skipping forward a bit, by the time World War II rolls around, Britain is scared that if they allow Jewish statehood the Palestinians and Arabs will revolt and the Axis powers will gain Palestine with its access to Iraqi and Iranian oil, and be perfectly poised to shut the Suez canal. Thusly Britain postpones any plans for Jewish statehood and actually makes promises to the Palestinians that following the war they might get to have their own independent Palestine.

Jewish residents use the war as a chance to stockpile weapons, gain experience fighting the war, and bide their time a bid for independence. Following the war, if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of the creation of Israel, you know what happens next, but all that is to say, Israel was not *given* their current lands. They spent well over 50 years preparing for their bid for independence and it was not out of any well intentions of Western powers.

lucky_wood,"As other posters have said, the move for Jewish settlement in Palestine started well before WWII, and there was already a significant Jewish population in Palestine and a very well-developed Zionist movement lobbying for them to be given statehood there. But the other side of this that's worth considering is the situation in Europe after WWII. European Antisemitism didn't come to an end in 1945, and even after the end of the Holocaust and the Allied victory, there was significant violence against Jewish communities in Poland - Wikipedia gives a figure of 1000-2000 Jews killed in Poland between 1945 and 1947. And it wasn't just Poland, although the violence was probably worst there - in 1945-48 there were a number of antisemitic riots in the UK, while in Belgium and France Holocaust survivors returned to find their homes occupied, sometimes by their former neighbours, and largely there wasn't anything they could do about it. It's easy to see why a lot of those people wouldn't be particularly disposed to stay in Europe.

The other thing to remember is that the Jews weren't the only ethnic group to be displaced after the war. Prior to WWII, most central European countries were an ethnic mish-mash, with German, Polish, Romanian, Jewish, Hungarian, Roma and other populations spread out well beyond the borders of what we now recognise as 'their' states. There were German-speaking populations spread out across Eastern Europe long before Hitler came to power, and one of the motives for Nazi expansionism was the goal of uniting these German peoples within the German nation. After the war, the victorious powers saw this confused mess of peoples as a recipe for disaster - so they simply moved everyone. The forced movement of Europe's German populations was probably the biggest part of this, with ~12m Germans being forcibly expelled from countries they had lived in for hundreds of years. Similar events moved Poles into Poland, Hungarians into Hungary, etcetera, although the expulsion of the Germans was probably the most dramatic. 

So that's the context you have to consider when you thinking about carving out a little enclave of German land as a permanent home for the Jewish people. Germany's borders were already much reduced, and they were going to have to accomodate an extra 12m people. And very few Jews would have any great desire to stay in a Europe which was still far from welcoming. Given that, it's hard to see how a Jewish state in Europe would have ended up any better than the ultimate Jewish state in Palestine did.

LiesAboutKnowingYou,"Full Disclosure: I am neither Jewish nor a historian, my knowledge on this topic is purely from personal interest and classes related to my degree in Middle Eastern Studies.

I would strongly suggest picking up material on the creation of the modern state of Israel. [Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, by Charles Smith](http://www.amazon.com/Palestine-Arab-Israeli-Conflict-History-Documents/dp/0312535015) might be a good place to start. There seems to be a common notion that there was Palestine then the West tromped in and just said ""Everyone out, this is the Jews land, now."" This is nowhere close to the truth. The Jews were not just handed the state of Israel. The modern Jewish push for statehood can be traced back to the end of the 19th century when [Theodor Herzl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl) pushed for international Jewry to leave Europe and found a national home for the Jews. He specifically mentions Argentina and Israel in his paper [*Der Judenstaat*](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/herzl2.html). Europe, particularly Eastern Europe with its [pogroms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire) and even in Western Europe with the [Hep Hep Riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep-Hep_riots) in Germany and the [Dreyfus Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair) in France, was not a jovial happy place for many Jews living there, long before the Nazi party came to power. With this in mind many Jewish leaders (quite often secular leaders) began to push strongly for this idea of a mass exodus towards a yet undecided land. The long and short of it is that Ottoman controlled Palestine won out over plans to resettle in Argentina, [Uganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Scheme), and at one point Nazi Germany suggested deporting its Jewish population to [Madagascar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_Plan), as well as I'm sure some other places.

You could fill hundreds of pages with how they moved forward to meet this goal but the crux of it is that mass immigration, legal and illegal, into Ottoman controlled Palestine was supported, funded, and lobbied for by a variety of Jewish organizations ([Lovers of Zion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_of_Zion, [World Zionist Organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization), etc etc). Once there the idea was to buy as much land from the Ottomans and local Palestinians as was possible in long term preparation for a Jewish state. As it became apparent what they were doing, Palestinian anger fueled Ottoman authorities to put immigration limits in place.

Skipping forward a few years (check out [Sykes-Picot Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) and more importantly the [Balfour Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) ) the Ottomans lose WWI lose their Middle Eastern holdings and in moves Britain to Palestine. Britain has made certain promises about the future creation of a Jewish state, promises that is not really intending to follow through on and promises similar to the ones it made to Palestinians and other Arab groups regarding making their own independent states if they assist them in fighting the Ottomans.

Zionist groups have taken this encouragement from Britain to gather support for their cause and dramatically spike Jewish immigration. Skipping forward a bit, by the time World War II rolls around, Britain is scared that if they allow Jewish statehood the Palestinians and Arabs will revolt and the Axis powers will gain Palestine with its access to Iraqi and Iranian oil, and be perfectly poised to shut the Suez canal. Thusly Britain postpones any plans for Jewish statehood and actually makes promises to the Palestinians that following the war they might get to have their own independent Palestine.

Jewish residents use the war as a chance to stockpile weapons, gain experience fighting the war, and bide their time a bid for independence. Following the war, if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of the creation of Israel, you know what happens next, but all that is to say, Israel was not *given* their current lands. They spent well over 50 years preparing for their bid for independence and it was not out of any well intentions of Western powers.

TheOneFreeEngineer,"It is important to note that Israel was not simply given land. First the Ottomans allowed some immigration to Israel region, then the British allowed more immigration. Then the Jewish peoples of the region (along with the Arab peoples [though there was some overlap, Arab Jews mostly sided with Jewish nationalism rather than Arab nationalism]) pushed for their own country. Then the people who would be the Israelis fought tooth and nail for every inch of that land they could, first against just the local Arabs (who didn't want a Jewish state, and were upset about the large immigration, but not to say they wanted a Muslim state either, they wanted an Arab state.) then that expanded into other new Arab states fighting to claim newly ""de-mandated"" land.

Of course there could be a lot of price fluctuation based on a slave's gender, age, skills, location of the sale, etc. Generally speaking, a ""good"" male field hand could easily get up to $1200 while a female might run $800, give or take.

Now, this one is a little bit of a dead horse, so I'm going to address a side of it that isn't discussed as often: the reaction to the news that the president had been assassinated.

Remember, in 1963, it was not the case that news would show up instantly on your smartphone, so there were a lot of cases of people finding out through announcements in groups. [One instance of this is the crowd who had gathered to hear a performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra that night.](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/11/14/throwback-thursday-boston-symphony-orchestras-moving-tribute-jfk-just-death/) The news broke right before the concert, and most of the audience was unaware of what had happened. The conductor, Erich Leinsdorf, walked on stage, made an announcement that the president had been assassinated, and then proceeded to lead the orchestra in the funeral march from Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, which they had had practically no time to rehearse, as it was not what they had planned to play for the concert.

jaguardestroyer,"Currency was invented in the ancient Mediterranean by the Lydians, a people in central Turkey whose wealth was legendary (see everything about Croesus in Herodotus' Histories book 1). This was in the late 8th-early 7th century BCE. While Herodotus' testimony is always subject to question as to its accuracy, material evidence basically backs him up: see this brief link from the [British Museum](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/money/the_origins_of_coinage.aspx).

The use of currency spread through the Mediterranean, although not without some resistance; we are told that the Spartans resisted the use of currency because they viewed it as a corrupting influence. Nonetheless as you can imagine coins are pretty useful, especially when you can place a value on them beyond their worth as metal, and they caught on. One of the appendixes in the Landmark edition of Thucydides gives a good background on currency in Classical Greece.

Later on, in the late third century CE, the Roman empire was probably experiencing something we call the Third Century Crisis, part of which was severe inflation and terribly devalued currency, and the emperor Diocletian responded by issuing something known as the Prices Edict (which you can read in full, in English) in which he regulated the price of products as disparate as haircuts, mid-range wine, and fine imported silks. We don't know much about how the Edict was received, or whether it was actually followed, but it was a bold move.

From the items included in the Edict and the maximum prices they are allotted, it seems like possession of currency was at this time still widespread–if anything, moreso than previously, because coins were worth so little by this point. For more on the economic issues Rome was facing and the context of Diocletian's Edict, check out ""Aurelian and the Third Century"" by Alaric Watson.

Still, early on in Rome's history, coins seem to have been absolutely the standard for people to gather wealth, especially people who weren't wealthy enough to count their money in acres of land. Slaves had a private purse and so did married women. When a ""regular"" Roman went out to buy groceries, s/he paid in coins.",null,0,cdit5lu,1r1zxh,askhistorians,top_week,3

cecikierk,"According to David Wallechinsky &amp; Irving Wallace's *People's Almanac*:

&gt;The final shot was not a bullet--it was a torpedo, fired from the U.S. submarine Torsk at 2117 hours Greenwich Civil Time on Aug. 14, 1945, during a battle against several Japanese ships. The torpedo sank a Japanese coastal defense frigate. At least one American ship fired its guns in anger after the official end of the war--2300 hours on Aug. 14, 1945. Again in Japanese waters, at 0418 hours on Aug. 15, the U.S.S. Heerman, although fully aware of the surrender, became suspicious of an approaching aircraft and called ""general quarters."" As the Japanese plane closed in, it appeared to be preparing for a suicide dive, so the Heerman opened fire and ""splashed"" it.",null,1,cdip3o2,1r1qu7,askhistorians,top_week,12
backmarkerS_E,"Fighting continued right up to the announcement of the surrender on 15th August 1945, though the United States had frozen its combat actions on 14th August 1945.  As a result, it is near impossible to tell who fired the last shot before the surrender, though my educated guess would be a Chinese, Japanese or Soviet soldier.

Fighting, however, continued beyond the surrender.  The Imperial Japanese Army did not communicate the cease-fire order to the Kwantung Army in Manchuria until the 20th August 1945, meaning that fighting between Soviet-Mongolian and the Kwantung Army continued until that date.  Japanese soldiers in China had not completed their surrender until 9th September 1945, and there were isolated incidents of fighting up until that point.

Japanese garrisons on the Kuril Islands did not surrender until 23rd August 1945.  The Battle of Shumshu was the final battle in the campaign, and saw 1,534 soldiers killed.

Because Japanese soldiers were conducting jungle warfare on isolated islands in the Pacific, a number of soldiers kept fighting after the surrender, either as they did not find out about the surrender, or they suspected reports of the surrender might have been enemy propaganda.

The last confirmed holdout was Teruo Nakamura, who was found on Morotai in Indonesia in December 1974, but it seems that he didn't fire his rifle for much of his time on the island as he feared that he would attract attention by doing so, so I don't think he would have fired the last shots.

Before him, Hiroo Onoda was found on the Lubang Island in the Philippines.  Despite having seen a leaflet in October 1945 that declared the war was over, he and his fellow soldiers thought it was probably enemy propaganda, so continued fighting.  Onoda is a good bet for having fired the last shots, as he and his fellow soldiers (who all died before his discovery) believed they were conducting a guerilla war, and killed 30 Filipinos, and was involved in a shoot-out with the police as recently as 19th October 1972.  When discovered he only agreed to surrender if he was given a command to do so by his commanding officer.  The Japanese government tracked down his commanding officer, who was by then a book-seller, who flew to Lubang and ordered Onoda to surrender.

misopog_on,"Don’t know about private families, but I can answer your question from a cultural viewpoint as a student of history of medieval philosophy. The short answer is: it actually didn’t change from the late antiquity to the middle ages, and didn’t also change for a long time afterwards. 
The long answer is: women were never completely subordinated, but they didn’t have often a prominent role too; Augustine is well known for bringing his own mother Monica in his “laic monastery” of Cassisiacum, but it was more an exception than a rule.  Moreover, with the establishment of the convent system (around the V and VI century) the abbesses of the most important abbeys and convents had a lot of power and wrote frequently to kings, popes, bishops and other political figures, either for advise or reproach them, both requested and unrequested. We can remember Amalasunta, Ildegarde from Bingen, Eloise (of Abelard’s fame) and many others. There were some lay powerful women, too: Matilde of Canossa left the Emperor out of her door for three days and three nights, barefoot and almost naked, during the investiture controversy! 
Also, the mystic was for centuries dominated by the women, as the writings of Jean Gerson suggest: Chiara from Assisi, Angela from Foligno, Caterina from Siena were all well-read women just a “take-the-sword-during-a-bloody-civil-war” away from becoming the Italian Joan of Arc (I’m over simplifying but that conveniently conveys the idea).
Another famous medieval woman is Beatrice, the one loved by Dante: the poet put her as his guide through the Paradise, and she doesn’t lose a chance to reprimand or scold him.
Now, it’s safe to say that cultured women were, during the middle ages, a small percentage of the cultured people in general (which by itself wasn’t such a big number, thought it is bigger than people usually thinks). But they were there, and actually in the Renaissance that percentage dropped enough significantly to be noted. Women remained in position of political power, when they could obtain it (Lucrezia Borgia is the most famous); but on the other hand it had happened also during the Roman age (Zenobia gave some real troubles to the late Empire, Boudicca to the early, Cleopatra to the Republic…)
All of this is without considering the “marian revolution” of the XI-XII centuries, when they started worshipping Mary and which really contributed to a great renovation of the woman figure. 
I’m sorry if I didn’t provide any source, but I’m not currently at my own home, but if you’re interested I could look later for something. 
I also hope to get confirmed or disproved, because I really like this argument but it’s not my central subject!
p.s. I wrote Italian names in their original form, I don’t know if in English they’re spelled differently and I’m too lazy to look them up…

snickeringshadow,"Yes! Mesoamerican armies employed spearmen in tight formation, although it was not quite as common as it was in the old world. It's a little difficult to see (this was the only picture I could find) but the [murals at Chichen Itza](http://eleconomista.com.mx/files/imagecache/nota_completa/mayas-.jpg) show two rows of spearmen, each spaced about 0.5m apart and carrying a round wooden shield. Spears and rectangular shields were also the melee weapon of choice in Central Mexico during the Classic Period. Soldiers would skirmish first using an atlatl (javelin-thrower - [shown here](http://tolnai-history7.wikispaces.com/file/view/Aztec_awesome.jpg/208103264/590x399/Aztec_awesome.jpg)). After launching a few darts, the infantry, armed with spears and probably fighting in tight rows, would close. 

The weapon/tactic became less popular during the Postclassic and the Melee weapon of choice became the Macuahuitl - a kind of wooden sword with an obsidian edge. Since a Macuahitl is a swinging/slashing weapon, it had to be used in looser formation in order to avoid cutting your comrade.

Dumannios_Raven,"As an historical archaeologist (under the umbrella of anthropology) here in the United States, full of some of the most privileged people in the world, as well as some of the most underprivileged, the single most important thing I've learned is this:  History is not a singular word.  There are many truths, and many histories, that can come from the same series of events.

If someone ever asks me how the past ""really was"", I cannot answer.  It ""really was"" different for each and every person who experienced it.  You may have heard the old adage ""the winner writes the history""?  That's true after a fashion...the winner often writes the ""official"" history, the ""official"" account of ""how it really was""...but the others histories are there to be found still.

This is why I love archaeology. I can explore in the soil and recover a musketball that was dropped by a soldier of the Continental Army during the winter encampment at Valley Forge.  I am the first person to touch this object in over 260 years.  That nameless, faceless soldier may as well have reached out through time and space and dropped it in my hand, it is that powerful to hold such an object.

Yes, we know the history of the American Revolution, and of the winter at Valley Forge - suffering, starving, bloody footprints in the snow...

...but the objects can tell us something else.  They can also tell us about the manufacture and production that was occurring daily at the site.  The Army wasn't just sitting there drilling occasionally, and waiting to die the rest of the time.  They were producing weapons, tools, clothing and horse furniture.  They were passing time in recreation (I have found numerous musketballs which were hammered flat or into the shape of throwing dice for games), they were human and they were having experiences.  It was so much more than what book tell us it ""really was"".

And then again, there were certainly men at that time and place who were sick, who were depressed, who were, in fact, drilling and waiting to die.  Which one is correct?  Both.  History is not two-dimensional. It is multi-dimensional; each life, each story, each experience contributes to the whole, and the ""whole"" is simultaneously unknowable, and easy to know, depending on what resources you can get your hands on.

Objects, books, journals, these all have a lifecycle. The interactions that people had with them in the past are different from those that we have with those same things now.  But one thing that is constant is the assignation of meaning.  Each person assigns meaning to each thing, encounter, relationship, landscape s/he comes into contact with.  When we start to examine history as a way to explore and understand those meanings, that is when we can formulate full picture after full picture after full picture of what the past was like, and never run out of authentic, interesting, human stories to tell.

If the reality of what you're experiencing through others self-identifying in a certain way to reclaim patriotism, then that is what is occurring for those people. Understanding how/why/when those ideas became popular opinions, or common experiences could help you shape your own view of the same ideas.  You choose to write history they way they are, along with them, or to write a different one, perhaps on your own, or perhaps with others, which is no less valid, because you are experiencing it.


TL:DR - There are many histories; each person/place/culture contributes to the world, and though the victor may write the ""official"" history of some event or occurrence, there are as many histories of it as there are people who experienced it.",null,5,cdixg1s,1r1of8,askhistorians,top_week,55
santi_ozil,"Good question. It's been quite rewarding for me. I've emphasized the modern history parts, especially Europe in the 20th century. After reading my way through history, from Big Bang to modern times, I've learned much about humans. In my view history is a better tool to look at society than sociology, because historians can always compare modern times to past times.

Somehow I've looked at the 20th and 21st century as a society developing at warp speed. It's way too fast for us to handle. This post-modern stage has defected us as humans and it's making our world too fast, too complicated and too spoiled. In historic view I see modern times as a bubble waiting to burst, making us become a simpler society again.

The low ground clearance, high center of weight, number of axles and length of the body were all products of the passenger and commercial cars they were built on. The Rolls Royce Armored Car was built on the chassis of the [Rolls Royce Silver Ghost](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Rolls-Royce_Silver_Ghost_at_Centenary.jpg), appropriated by the British government early in the war. The Silver Ghost was a high-end luxury auto, built in the UK. British cars had relatively low ride heights compared to their American counterparts (compare the picture of the Silver Ghost with [the Oldsmobile Limited](http://oldcarandtruckpictures.com/Oldsmobile/1911OldsmobileLimitedTouringCar-BobBelf-a.jpg), with its 42"" wheels), because the UK had a much more developed road network than the US. While that made them comparatively sleek and gave them good handling, it also meant low ground clearance, which would be a problem for off-road travel. The long wheelbase of the Rolls Royce was typical of luxury automobiles. A long wheelbase allowed passengers lots of legroom, a variety of body styles ([landaulet](http://www.coachbuild.com/gallery/d/51939-2/Barker_Rolls-Royce_Silver_Ghost_Limousine_Landaulet_1797_1911_01.jpg), [limousine](http://www.extravaganzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/1912-Rolls-Royce-40-50hp-Silver-Ghost-Double-Pullman-Limousine-9.jpg), [touring](http://autophotosite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1907_Rolls-Royce-40-50-Silver-Ghost-Touring-Car_1907-01.jpg), [roadster](http://www.best-selling-cars.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1911-Rolls-Royce-4050-HP-Silver-Ghost-Roadster.jpg), etc.), and a large engine: compact V-8 and V6 engines hadn't quite caught on (Cadillac introduced the first V8 in the U.S. in 1916, and it was riddled with problems) and designers were afraid to use too high compression ratios, so luxury automobiles had huge displacement engines (the [Pierce Arrow 66QQ](http://www.supercars.net/carpics/5164/1910_PierceArrow_Model66QQ1.jpg) had an 825 cubic in. straight 6) in space-inefficient straight-6 or straight-8 layouts. The Silver Ghost had a [453 cubic inch straight 6](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/RR40_50SG.jpg) that required a long hood and extra body length. The center of gravity on armored cars was high because they were built on-frame, like every car of the period. With [some notable exceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Underslung), nearly every car of the period featured a steel frame mounted above solid axles, with the coachwork (aka the passenger compartment) mounted on top of the frame. Most cars of the period, like [this Mack moving van](http://i.imgur.com/m9f04lk.jpg), were pretty top-heavy; the tall wheels also prevented the body from extending too far out from the frame rails. It looks like armored car manufacturers just copied the prevailing automobile trends and just put their coachwork (in this case, an armored box) on top of the frame. Lastly, the number of axles was also a product of the cars they were built on. Very few multi-axle automobiles existed, let alone were produced in any quantity. Even trucks that would have benefited from the extra axle, like the Mack moving van above, neglected to use them because of the difficulty of providing power to two axles from one driveshaft.   
The reason for the large number of turrets is not something I can give a definitive answer for, but it does seem like there is an obvious answer. Armored cars based on truck chassis like the Garfield-Putilov would have been slow and poorly suited for off-road travel, but could carry much more weight than their car-based brethren (like the Rolls Royce or the Austin). From a practical standpoint, it seems like their best use would be as mobile pillboxes (like the German [A7V](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/A7v-wotan-diorama.jpg)), so they were equipped with as many machine guns as they could mount, in barbettes around the body. A [1912 report](http://nucat.library.northwestern.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=41&amp;ti=26,41&amp;Search_Arg=armored%20car&amp;SL=None&amp;Search_Code=GKEY&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=nSj1R6HteA-dRBImDe7kiBhTGXb&amp;SEQ=20131120161637&amp;SID=1) on armored cars presented to the Congressional Committee on Military Affairs advocated the mobile pillbox idea, noting that a car armed with multiple machine guns would be able to halt enemy offensives, and that even when ""surrounded by an enemy . . . their armor would be impervious on all sides.""   
Faster, single-turreted cars like the Rolls-Royce, on the other hand, seem much more suited for quick hit-and-run operations; their high gearing ratio meant they wouldn't have been able to carry as much armor plating or armaments, but could escape before the enemy had time to react. 

Ok, those were the limitations that you came up with; I've got some of my own.  

1. Wheels unsuited for offroad travel. Auto wheels of the era were tall and skinny (see the Oldsmobile Limited above for an extreme example), in order to fit into preexisting carriage ruts and to cut through shallow mud, snow, and puddles. However, the narrow tire meant a very small contact patch (the part of the tire that is in contact with the road at a given point) and therefore little traction. Wheels were often made in the ""[artillery spoke](http://www.model-t-restore.com/images/wheel_3_lrg.jpg)"" style, with wooden spokes. These wheels were liable to snap if too much lateral pressure was exerted, something that would be frequently encountered in offroad travel (the [Thomas Flyer](http://www.thegreatautorace.com/ThomasFlyer.jpg), winner of the New York to Paris transcontinental race in 1908, broke its wheels 18 times over the course of the race). In addition, most heavy trucks like the Garford that the Garford-Putilov was built on, used solid rubber tires which lacked any tread whatsoever. Pneumatic tires, it was thought, would be unable to support the weight that large trucks would be carrying. Solid rubber tires were perfectly suited for driving at slow speeds in cities, but certainly less so for cross-country travel on bad roads. However, the pneumatic tires of the period were not much better. They were of the ""bias-ply"" style, with an outer treaded casing around a separate inner tube that held the compressed air. They also lacked the belt of steel fabric that helps modern tires keep their shape, so that wider balloon tires more suitable for offroad travel were unfeasible. 
 
2. Low speeds. If the idea behind an armored car is highly mobile firepower, some of these cars certainly would have fallen short. While the Rolls Royce armored car would have been able to zip along quite nicely, armored cars based on trucks like the Garford-Putilov would have probably maxed out at ~20 MPH. Because of the low power output of engines at the time (even the Rolls Royce's large inline 6 only made 80 HP), heavy duty trucks used [worm-drive](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Worm_Gear.gif) rear axles (like [this one on the Mack](http://i.imgur.com/ZbXdXAv.jpg) or [this one on a Ford TT truck](http://i.imgur.com/XRvK7pZ.png)) in order to maximize torque.    

3. 4 Wheel Drive. The lack of four wheel drive is the most puzzling, to me; but I think there's a reasonable explaination. Four wheel drive certainly existed, and 4WD trucks like the [Nash Quad](http://www.allpar.com/images/nash-engines/nash-quad.jpg) were used fairly extensively throughout WWI. A 4WD armored car would have notable advantages over its 2 wheel drive contemporaries, at least in terms of off-road performance. On the other hand, the four wheel drive apparatus meant that the frame sat considerably higher: building an armored box on top would have made it very top-heavy. However, I suspect that the major reason that 4WD armored cars didn't see extensive use was that armored car doctrine at the time probably didn't emphasize offroad mobility. The congressional report I mentioned earlier suggested that ""truck gearing"" (aka a worm drive) and a powerful winch would be enough to handle the offroad situations that an armored car might face, and it seems like they were to be used mainly on preexisting roads.

TheArrowsOfAgincourt,"- The presence of the crusades in Muslim history and society,  is pretty low-key. Islam may have dominated European thinking at the time, but for the Muslims, the Europeans were just another minor pest of an enemy, even allowing for the occupation of Jerusalem. The importance placed on the Crusades in Europe is a direct reflection of the fear of Islam at the time, and its overwhelming presence as a superior civilization and power. 

- This can be indicated in the relative lack of work done on the crusades in Muslim historiography compared to European. The Crusades have actually been covered in Islamic sources far more in the modern era than in the medieval period.

- Of course, the fall of Jerusalem was a significant event for Muslims at the time, being one of their holiest cities after Mecca and Medina. The zeal with which the likes of Salah al-Din, Nur al-Din Zengi and Baybars Bundukdari attacked the Crusaders throughout the 12th and 13th centuries would have been inspired by a sense of overwhelming injustice that ""al-faranjah"" or the ""Franks"" as the Muslims referred to Crusaders at the time, had invaded lands that never belonged to them. 

-However, there was never any threat to the Gulf or Mesopotamia from the Crusaders, which would have resulted in a wider more concerted Islamic push to drive the Crusaders from the Holy Land.

kevink123,"Following a brief interruption after the onset of the conquest in 1644, the Manchu emperors prudently reinstated the examination system early on in the Qing Dynasty. For the conquering Manchus, promoting the examination system and choosing officials from it was a prudent method by which to legitimize their reign. At its core, the system was more or less unchanged from the procedure and content standardized under the Ming. 

Most of the changes in the imperial examinations during the Qing were adopted in order to accommodate the now diverse ruling class that included the new conquest elite of Manchus, Mongols, and Chinese Bannermen (*hanjun*, or ethnic Hans that had early on joined the Manchus and were integrated into the ruling elite socially and culutrally) as well as native Han Chinese. Because the examinations still demanded mastery of the classics, the Bannermen elite found themselves at a distinct disadvantage. Over the course of the entire dynasty, only one Banner candidate (a Mongol) received the top grade in his testing section. 

Despite the disadvantages it conferred upon their own ruling elite, the Qing felt obliged to work within the examination system rather than abandon it. The question became, therefore, how to encourage the banner elite to undertake the examinations and excel at them. In most instances, test proctors for the palace examinations established quotas for every seasonal examination, automatically granting degrees to fixed numbers of banner candidates regardless of their scores in comparison to the Han examinees (who almost always scored far better). In instances in which test takers were required to analyze difficult excerpts of classical text, it was common to include Manchu translations of the text beside the Chinese original to aid Bannermen examinees. Bannermen taking the exams were also allowed to write their responses in Manchu, thereby largely ending the traditional anonymity of the examinations by alerting the test graders of the exam takers ethnic background. 

Yet the Bannermen still struggled to succeed in the palace examinations. In a further effort to help Bannermen obtain degrees so that they might qualify for high ranking positions, an alternative ""translation examination"" was introduced in 1661. Similar in form to the standard palace examinations, the translation exams simply tasked test takers with translating texts from Chinese (contemporary and classical) into Manchu. Separate exams also tested translation abilities in Mongolian. There is no doubt that the translation exam was considerably easier to pass than the palace examination; what's more, Han Chinese were barred from taking the translation exams. Achieving standard form by 1722, these translation exams offered successful candidates degrees that were competitive with the *jinshi* degrees conferred by the standard palace exams. As a result, the translation exam offered Banner officials seeking government posts an immense employment advantage over Han Chinese.

mormengil,"Not exactly reading like a modern novel, but quite a bit of narrative detail in the epic poem ""Beowulf"", from the 8th century.

Here the coast guard of the Danes spots Beowulf and his crew landing on the shores of Denmark.  They have come to assist Hrothgar King of the Danes, who's great mead-hall Heorot has been stalked and desecrated by the monster Grendel:

""Then well from the cliff edge the guard of the Scyldings

Who the sea-cliffs should see to, saw o’er the gangway

Brave ones bearing beauteous targets,

Armor all ready, anxiously thought he,

Musing and wondering what men were approaching.

High on his horse then Hrothgar’s retainer

Turned him to coastward, mightily brandished

His lance in his hands, questioned with boldness.

“Who are ye men here, mail-covered warriors

Clad in your corslets, come thus a-driving

A high riding ship o’er the shoals of the waters,

And hither ’neath helmets have hied o’er the ocean?

I have been strand-guard, standing as warden,

Lest enemies ever anywise ravage

Danish dominions with army of war-ships.
 
More boldly never have warriors ventured

Hither to come; of kinsmen’s approval,

Word-leave of warriors, I ween that ye surely

Nothing have known. Never a greater one

Of earls o’er the earth have I had a sight of

Than is one of your number, a hero in armor;

No low-ranking fellow adorned with his weapons,

But launching them little, unless looks are deceiving,

And striking appearance. Ere ye pass on your journey

As treacherous spies to the land of the Scyldings

And farther fare, I fully must know now

What race ye belong to. Ye far-away dwellers,

Sea-faring sailors, my simple opinion

Hear ye and hearken: haste is most fitting

Plainly to tell me what place ye are come from.”

I think this device, of using the thoughts and words of the Coast Guard as a perspective to see Beowulf through the eyes of another and set up his arrival before the king is quite a good example of narrative detail.

talondearg,"When did they stop?

I'm not merely being facetious. The invention of the printing press and the overall effect of the vulgar translations and spread of Reformation ideals lead to a great deal of widespread Bible-reading, these are key elements of this period of history.

But your question assumes a perspective shaped by the Medieval period, whereas in Late Antiquity literacy rates weren't *that* low, and someone like Chrysostom assumes that his congregation in Antioch could be buying scrolls of Biblical books to read at home. So I would actually suggest that prior to working out when non-elites started reading the Bible individually, the question has to be worked out when the shift to elites-only happened.

onthefailboat,"There's a newish book about Robert E. Lee called *Reading the Man* by Elizabeth Pryor.  It contains many of his private thoughts and opinions.  Lee was a very complicated person and owned slaves himself.  He does seem to express dislike for slavery as a system, but could treat his own slaves pretty badly at times.  He certainly regarded them as property, which their owner could do with what they wanted.

He certainly agonized about whether or not to join the Confederate Army.  Many of his compatriots from Virginia that were in the military stayed and fought with the Union, rather than support their home state.  However, we know that eventually Lee did decide to support Virginia and the Confederacy.  It was not an easy decision for him to make though.  

His letters after the war show how hurt he was by his participation, and how much he questioned his actions.  Not only had he lost his wealth, but the war itself, and the questions he had concerning the rightness of his actions, broke him in later years. ",null,2,cdiioia,1r11zx,askhistorians,top_week,40

restricteddata,"The most difficult part in developing the atomic bombs — and the main timetable for their readiness — was the procurement of enough fuel for the bombs. For the Hiroshima bomb this was enriched uranium, for the Nagasaki bomb this was plutonium.

The first bomb fully assembled was the one used in the ""Trinity"" test on July 16, 1945. It was a plutonium core bomb like the one used on Nagasaki and a more complicated design than the Hiroshima bomb. It detonated even more successfully than was anticipated.

The enriched uranium for the Hiroshima bomb was ready by that time. It was shipped to the island of Tinian, along many sets of non-nuclear components for both of the bombs, on the USS Indianapolis, which left port in San Francisco on July 16th. It arrived in Tinian on July 26. Also on July 26 the plutonium core of the Nagasaki bomb was sent by airplane to Tinian, having just recently been cast from plutonium on hand at Los Alamos.

(The plutonium production system would produce enough material for another bomb core to be ready by mid-August. By the end of August 1945, they had enough material for two plutonium bombs on hand at Los Alamos, one of which had been cast into a bomb pit, the other one had not yet been.)

Assembling the bombs on Tinian was not an easy endeavor and took a day or so for each bomb. Just to give you some perspective as to the talent involved, two of the bomb assembly crew later went on to win Nobel Prizes in physics. These were complicated apparatuses with thousands of parts and sensitive electronics. They are more properly conceived of as massive, expensive scientific apparatuses attached to the inside of gigantic metal bomb casings than they were stockpile military weapons.

The bomb crews were told that they were to drop the first bomb as soon as was possible (weather being the main consideration) after August 1st. The first good weather day for Hiroshima was August 6th. August 9th ended up being the next best weather day for the second bomb, which was scheduled to be detonated over Kokura. However it turned out to be too cloudy so Nagasaki was chosen as the secondary target.

Because they had tested the plutonium bomb already, they were very confident it would work though there was a non-negligible chance (something like 20%) of a failure (a premature detonation, or ""fizzle""). They were much more confident of the Hiroshima bomb because it was much cruder (but used many more fuel materials, and inefficiently), but they did not expect it to be as powerful. (It was only a little less powerful, in the end.) 

As for whether it was rushed, definitely. The entire project was racing forward as fast as possible. Its most salient aspects were that it was secret and it was proceeding as fast as possible.

The only hold-up was until after August 1st. This is because Truman wanted it done after he was no longer at the Potsdam Conference (which ended on August 2nd). As for why _as soon after_ August 1st as possible (as opposed to say, mid-August), Truman wanted them to use the bomb before the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and began its invasion of Manchuria. This was scheduled to happen sometime in mid-August. He hoped that if the Japanese capitulated quickly, it would would weaken Soviet postwar claims in Asia, and Truman no longer felt that Soviet military intervention was necessary to convince the Japanese to surrender. In reality, after the bombing of Hiroshima, Stalin ordered the invasion begin as soon as possible and it started on midnight August 8/9, just before the Nagasaki bomb was used. (Note that the US invasion of Japan was not scheduled until November 1.)

As for the non-technical history of what happened between July 14th and August 6th — it is a complicated history of the Potsdam Conference, Truman and Stalin's negotiations, Truman's internal discussions with his cabinet, and more. Recommended reading is Hasegawa's _Racing the Enemy_, as it covers this period nicely. The long and short of it is that Truman hinted to Stalin to the first time that the US had the bomb (Stalin already knew, because of his spies), Truman and his advisors decided that they probably didn't need the Soviets to get involved (but didn't tell the Soviets that because they thought they would take offense), and they approved the press releases to be released after the first atomic bomb attack (which is about as close as Truman got to giving an explicit order to use the bomb).

restricteddata,"Oh, and on the choice of targets — you can read the [May 1945 Target Committee Meeting Minutes](http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html) online. 

The notable parts are such:

&gt; A. Dr. Stearns described the work he had done on target selection. He has surveyed possible targets possessing the following qualification: (1) **they be important targets in a large urban area of more than three miles in diameter**, (2) **they be capable of being damaged effectively by a blast**, and (3) **they are unlikely to be attacked by next August**. Dr. Stearns had a list of five targets which the Air Force would be **willing to reserve for our use** unless unforeseen circumstances arise. These targets are:

&gt; (1) Kyoto - This target is an urban industrial area with a population of 1,000,000. It is the former capital of Japan and many people and industries are now being moved there as other areas are being destroyed. From the psychological point of view there is the advantage that Kyoto is an intellectual center for Japan and the people there are more apt to appreciate the significance of such a weapon as the gadget. (Classified as an AA Target)

&gt; (2) Hiroshima - This is an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focussing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target. (Classified as an AA Target)

&gt; (3) Yokohama - This target is an important urban industrial area which has so far been untouched. Industrial activities include aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries. As the damage to Tokyo has increased additional industries have moved to Yokohama. It has the disadvantage of the most important target areas being separated by a large body of water and of being in the heaviest anti-aircraft concentration in Japan. For us it has the advantage as an alternate target for use in case of bad weather of being rather far removed from the other targets considered. (Classified as an A Target)

&gt; (4) Kokura Arsenal - This is one of the largest arsenals in Japan and is surrounded by urban industrial structures. The arsenal is important for light ordnance, anti-aircraft and beach head defense materials. The dimensions of the arsenal are 4100' x 2000'. The dimensions are such that if the bomb were properly placed full advantage could be taken of the higher pressures immediately underneath the bomb for destroying the more solid structures and at the same time considerable blast damage could be done to more feeble structures further away. (Classified as an A Target)

&gt; (5) Niigata - This is a port of embarkation on the N.W. coast of Honshu. Its importance is increasing as other ports are damaged. Machine tool industries are located there and it is a potential center for industrial dispersion. It has oil refineries and storage. (Classified as a B Target)

&gt; (6) The possibility of bombing the Emperor's palace was discussed. It was agreed that we should not recommend it but that any action for this bombing should come from authorities on military policy. It was agreed that we should obtain information from which we could determine the effectiveness of our weapon against this target.

[...]

&gt; 7. Psychological Factors in Target Selection

&gt; A. It was agreed that **psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance**. Two aspects of this are (1) **obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan** and (2) **making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released.**

&gt; B. In this respect Kyoto has the advantage of **the people being more highly intelligent and hence better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon**. Hiroshima has the advantage of being **such a size and with possible focussing from nearby mountains that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.** The Emperor's palace in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value.

&gt; 8. Use Against ""Military"" Objectives

&gt; A. It was agreed that for the initial use of the weapon any **small and strictly military objective should be located in a much larger area subject to blast damage** in order to avoid undue risks of the weapon being lost due to bad placing of the bomb.

Kyoto was dropped from the list at the request of the Secretary of War who considered it too culturally valuable to bomb. Yokohama became a firebombing target shortly after the target meeting. Nagasaki was added to replace Kyoto and was a backup target on August 9th (the primary target was Kokura but it was obscured by clouds). ",null,1,cdiik9z,1r0tsw,askhistorians,top_week,6
Oxen_boxen,"Basically as soon as conditions allowed, the bombs were used. ""Rushed"" is a relative term- it'd take quite a while for any *more* atomic bombs to be made so dropping fat man and little boy on Japan was a *bit* of a gamble because honestly we wouldn't have been able to continue that kind of bombing campaign for the simple reason that *we didn't have any more nuclear bombs readily available.* It'd have taken weeks, months for more to be ready, and frankly the US government wasn't interested in waiting. 



There's always a non-zero chance that a bomb wont detonate. If you're asking whether the science and theory behind the atomic bombs we dropped was sound, *yes*. The Trinity Test demonstrably proved without a shadow of a doubt that the theories laid out about nuclear reactions producing massive force back in 1933 were sound. Fat Man used the exact same method of detonation. Little Boy used what was deemed an inefficient design, even by period standards.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_%28nuclear_test%29


Yeah, wikipedia, shoot me. The diagrams for Little Boy and Fat Man demonstrate the theory behind how they work. That's the main point behind the links.



The Manhatten Project always had hold ups. That's how directed scientific development *works.* Once someone bothered to light a fire under the US government, they spared no reasonable expense to make the project reach completion. Whether or not the atomic bombings were *rushed* is going to be subject to opinion. They could have always done more tests. They weren't *exactly* waiting around, if that's what you're asking. 


Beyond that, assembling the bombs was quite the ordeal. If the rank and file soldier used the proverbial Ford / Toyota / Honda econo-box, the nuclear bombs were like exotic German sports cars where every last part is hand made and fitted to the millionth of a millimeter. 




Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen because....

1: The US treated major industrial and shipping points as high-value strategic bombing targets.


2: The US also didn't want to risk killing the Emperor. Of the scenarios that could result from it, most weren't conducive to an occupation, or winning the war in short fashion. 


3: Tokyo was already basically fire bombed into oblivion. ",null,0,cdig1b3,1r0tsw,askhistorians,top_week,3

He wasn't truly punished, just brought back to the Britain. But he never returned to India despite the turmoil occuring there, which is evidence that they knew his of his wrongdoing, and were not going to let it happen again.

In the report of the commitee appointed to investigate the massacre, it clearly states his troops were not acting in self defence, he did not give enough time for the crowd to disperse, and the he 'continued firing for a substantial period of time after the corwd had commenced to diperse'. They state he continued firing for 10 minutes.

In this report you can read some of his quotations - he is completely unrepentant.

 There haven't been many examples of high ranking officers prosecuted for war crimes in history because the concept of war crimes is fairly recent. For most of history it has been assumed that the victors in war would steal everything they could get their hands on, rape all the women, murder any men who resisted, and enslave all the survivors. If you look at victors courtmartialing or killing their own generals for other reasons there are plenty of famous cases, many involving Kings jealous of the winning generals popularity, but other famous episodes like Alexander killing his top ranking general Parmenion for just in case, or the British executing Admiral Byng pour encourager les autres early in the 7 years war (which England won).",null,3,cdivshe,1r0smo,askhistorians,top_week,9

The European Ashkenazi Jews are generally the dominant group, somewhat sharing this with European Sephardi Jews. Indeed the sound of modern spoken Hebrew is mostly based on the Yiddish of the Ashkenazi of Eastern and Central Europe.

The Jews who came from the former Soviet Union since the 90's have formed their own community. I've heard a ""western"" Israeli tell that they are perceived not to be Jews at all, only saying they were to get citizenship. No doubt many Middle Eastern Jews are accused of the same thing.

Education is a prime battleground of this culture war. Many top schools are Ashkenazi, and in some cases flat out refuse to admit Middle-Eastern students. Rabbi Yosef, the leader of the main Sephardi party, Shas, said some years ago that Sephardi should not go to Ashkenazi schools, which would only turn them Ashkenazi!

That's how we got accurate coastlines of Europe and parts of Africa by the mid 17th century.

ColMcCouilles,"Based on Speed's own account on his encounter with Lincoln in 1837 (Joshua F. Speed, Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln and Notes of a Visit to California, John P. Morton, Louisville, Kentucky, 1884, p.21-22), Lincoln was moved to be offered to share Speed's bed while saving to buy his own bedroom furniture (which amounted, according to Speed, to $17, Lincoln was poor at that time but was confident his lawyer practice would help him gather enough money). This event triggered much question whether or not Lincoln had homosexual tendencies (there are no clear indications, at least from the primary sources we have, he has been involved in any romance with a male counterpart, nor that he developed romantic sentiments towards any men).

Sharing a bed was a common thing in these particular times, and lets not forget Lincoln grew up in a cabin, where bed sharing between family members and guests was not only permitted (between persons of the same gender), but often deemed necessary due to a lack of beds. According to H.G. Pitt  (Abraham Lincoln biography, Sutton Publishing, Stroud, Gloucestershire, 1998), Lincoln already had shared bedrooms with his friend and associate John Stuart, and also had the habit to do the same with other lawyers and itinerant Justices, sleeping in primitive hostels and taverns, many fellows sharing the same room and, often, the same bed. 

While we can understand that such behavior would raise suspicion in today's mindset, we must take into account the context in which Abraham Lincoln evolved, and there is no clear evidence he had homosexual thoughts or behaviors other than mere speculation by a few historians. C.A. Tripp's The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln (Free Press, NY, 2005) may well have been the most notorious essay in this respect, but it lies on very poor evidence: unreliable gossip from Gustave Fox' wife (based on someone else's gossip...), Lincoln's propension to tell dirty-minded stories, Lincoln's affectuous tone in his correspondence with Speed (""Yours forever""), etc. Such a tone was not at all unusual between friends in 18th (edit: 19th) Century correspondences, we must consider this argument with great caution. 

Tripp was not the first one to question Lincoln's presumed homosexuality. Just to name a few: Doris Faber (1980), Dennis Doty (1976), James Kepner (1971). Although the question is highly entertaining, especially in our times (edit: gay civil rights), as historian David Donald pointed out, no contemporary of Lincoln ever raised suspicion as to the nature of the Lincoln-Speed relationship, not even Herndon (Lincoln's associate) and others who occasionally shared a room with them (or, at least, we are yet to find evidence they ever did).",null,4,cdilafz,1r0ogn,askhistorians,top_week,43

The United States is estimated to have dropped about 20 million gallons of Agent Orange on Vietnam, which is said to have caused many of the outbreaks of birth defects in the country. However, according to Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense until 1968 (six years after the beginning of Agent Orange's usage), said the following:
&gt;""Just take Agent Orange as an illustration: I don't think anyone had even thought about whether it was contrary to the rules of war. I doubt very much that its toxicity was very much known"".

For further reading, he talks about this in relation to how international crime laws must be more definite:
&gt; ""Henry Kissinger was travelling in Europe the other day and there were suggestions that he should be brought before the Criminal Court.

ProfessorRekal,"The German-American and Italian-American communities were very large and diverse, with many different political perspectives and backgrounds. That said, there were elements of these communities that were pro-fascist and pro-Nazi.

The most notable group at the time was the [German American Bund](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005684), led by their clownish *Führer* [Fritz Kuhn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Julius_Kuhn). The Bund advocated for the establishment of a fascist government in the United States, and decried the Roosevelt administration as being controlled by the so-called ""International Jewish Conspiracy."" While the organization probably had over 10,000 members (maybe - the Bund fuzzed their membership numbers), in America they were perceived almost like the Westboro Baptist Church is today, as complete political pariahs. For example, in February 1939 the Bund held a rally in Madison Square Garden to celebrate the birthday of ""America's First Fascist,"" George Washington. While the rally had over 10,000 spectators, outside tens of thousands more were gathered in protest against the Bund. 

Despite their marginal political status and amateurish organization, the FBI was convinced they were a front organization for Nazi spies. They weren't - even the Nazi Party thought they were clueless and wanted nothing to do with them. Nonetheless, the FBI used every legal method and quite a few illegal methods to attack, undermine, expose, and finally destroy the Bund. Kuhn was arrested on tax evasion charges like Al Capone, spent WWII in jail, and was then stripped of his citizenship (he was an immigrant who became a naturalized 
citizen) and deported to Germany after the war. The Bund was also investigated by a new Congressional subcommittee that would go on to great notoriety during the Cold War, the [House Committee on Un-American Activities] (http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/huac.cfm), or HUAC.  

(A popular culture history connection - the [bumbling Illinois Nazis] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTT1qUswYL0) portrayed in The Blues Brothers is partially inspired by the Bund, as well as the infamous Nazi march in Skokie, Illinois, in 1978).

Ultra-radical Bund supporters and other German immigrants identified as [""enemy aliens""] (http://www.archives.gov/research/immigration/enemy-aliens-overview.html) were arrested at the start of World War II and interned in camps like [Crystal City Internment Camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_City_Internment_Camp) in Texas. Some pro-fascist Italian ""enemy aliens"" ended up in places like this as well. Approximately 30,000 German and Italian enemy aliens were interned during the war versus the 120,000 Japanese Americans interned during the same period. The major difference between the two was the the 30,000 represented a tiny fraction of the overall German-American or Italian-American population. However, nearly the entire Japanese-American population was interned (Hawaii being the major exception).

A recent book on the Bund recently came out that looks pretty good, Arnie Bernstein's [*Swastika Nation: Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund*] (http://www.amazon.com/Swastika-Nation-Fritz-Kuhn-German-American/dp/1250006716). For a great summary and interview with the author, I recommend [this podcast](http://newbooksinhistory.com/2013/10/31/arnie-bernstein-swastika-nation-fritz-kuhn-and-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-german-american-bund-st-martins-press-2013/) from *New Books in History.*

Wagner's influence stretched far beyond his music as well. As an artist, he was famous for assuming total control of his works, to the extent of designing the theatre in which they would take place, the lighting and sets, the choreography, etc, which was unprecedented, and helped heighten his status as a artistic genius.

mormengil,"To see ports that still have some of their old medieval characteristics, you might look at Bergen, Norway; Bruges, Belgium; and Venice, Italy.

All share a characteristic which is useful in preserving the past.  They were rich, then they got poorer (this means that fairly substantial buildings were built in the rich period, and then not demolished and built over, because the city became too poor.)

These cities have a variety of warehouses, often on the waterfront.  The merchants and their workers would often live over the warehouses.  Ships would tie up or beach on the shore in front of the warehouses.  

1.  The degree of organization in the port would vary.  Highest in Venice, least in Bergen (but there was always some organization, at least to collect tariffs and harbor dues).

2.  The freight varied from port to port.  Bergen shipped out primarily salt cod (from farther north in Norway), but also timber, turpentine, pitch and small quantities of exotic products from the north like furs.  They shipped in grain, cloth, smaller quantities of other products.  Bruges shipped in wool (from England and Scotland primarily) and shipped out cloth (woven in Bruges) but also a lot of other products in and out, including a trade in exotic spices, silks, and oriental goods from Genoa and Venice.  Venice shipped in exotic spices and silks from the orient and also shipped those out to other ports in Europe, as well as glass, olive oil, and a large range of other products.  They also shipped in European products (wool cloth, salt fish, timber products, grain) and shipped them out again.

3.  The buildings surrounding the port were mostly warehouses with offices and living quarters above them.  All the ports would also have fortifications (castles, walls in the case of Bruges).  Venice had mansions or palaces, and the Arsenale (the fortified naval base where warships were constructed, equipped and maintained).

4.  The smell was probably a mixture of the smells of the trade goods, the smells of shipping (pitch and tar), the smells of the sea, and the smells of primitive sewage systems.  Plus, the smell of woodsmoke (used for heating and cooking) which used to be a ubiquitous smell in cities, but is now long gone.  Bergen would not have had woodsmoke right near the waterfront, as fires were forbidden there (the wood-built town burned on several occasions, so fires were banned.  All the Hanseatic traders had to eat communal meals in a stone built Hanseatic Hall a block or two inland where cooking fires were safer.

The American West was broadly (though far from completely) settled well before the completion of the transcontinental railroad. By contrast, after Canada voted for confederation in 1867, one of the biggest concerns of Canadian leaders, and John A. MacDonald (the first Prime Minister) in particular, was that Americans would overwhelm the territory still controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company (everything from western Ontario to British Columbia). MacDonald and the Canadian central government took immediate steps to gain possession of the territory for Canada, and pushed hard to link it to the eastern provinces by means of a transcontinental railroad (completed in 1885). So, the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway was pushed far more actively by the Canadian government than was the case in the US.

There were settlers out west early on, but in very small numbers. The Selkirk, or Red River, colony in Manitoba was tiny prior to 1867 and had stronger ties to St. Paul and the US than to British North America/Canada. Settlers came in large numbers only with the railway, and with the advent of a homestead policy not all that different from the U.S. version, which granted cheap title to farmland after a period of occupation and improvement. In fact, a huge number of Americans settled in the Canadian west, especially Alberta, as the availability of free land in the US dwindled. 

This US settlement also caused an important and lasting impact on politics, even up to the present day. The Americans who settled in Canada brought existing ideas and organizations, many born of the Populist movement of late nineteenth century. Groups such as the Society of Equity, the Non-Partisan League, and, surprisingly, the Ku Klux Klan soon had Canadian branches, and they and others agitated in support of such causes as temperance, monetization of silver, tariff reduction, direct legislation, and a host of others. They saw themselves as the champions of morality and democracy, defending Canada from the plutocracy of financiers and industrialists. These mirrored the causes of American farmers twenty years before, at a similar stage of agricultural development, and found their eventual champion in the Progressive movement that culminated in Canada in the 1920s. 

To really oversimplify things, Tommy Douglas and the advent of universal health care in Canada can trace their roots to this movement. Hope this helped.

Ahhuatl,"Culture plays a definitive role in any society and by extension has a great deal of influence over the direction a group of people go in. However, it would not be appropriate to claim that a group of people are ""naturally"" prone to anything. Culture is not a static facet of human relations, it is under continual negotiation and revision as members of a particular culture face new circumstances.   Cultures often appeal towards a sense of continuity and tradition in the face of change as a means of ensuring the perpetuation of certain social structures or maintaining the internal cohesion of a society and so we often are given the impression that certain cultural attitudes are both universal and ancient.  In actuality however these cultural features usually undergo changes as well, often in a way that escapes the immediate notice of people living within a society.

Historians frequently work to understand the history of a group of people by interpreting elements of their culture and conversely many historians also make assertions about cultural trends in a society based on their past.  These conclusions are, however, both subjective and rooted in the cultural outlooks of historians too and as such our field works (albeit unevenly) to continuously review the underlying interpretative framework contained in histories.  The important point to take away from this is that how we define particular cultural features and use them in historical narratives is culturally founded too.  One could easily hold a different cultural view of what it means to be subordinated and forward an interpretation of Russian history that treats Russians as liberty seeking and other cultures - like Americans - as intrinsically inclined to supplicating to a ruling class.",null,1,cdijfwz,1r09bw,askhistorians,top_week,8

Tass237,"Constantine founded a city called Constantinople at the location of a Greek city named Byzantium, which continued to exist until it was renamed Istanbul by the Turks.  The ""Byzantine Empire"" is an entirely retrospective name for what was, at the time, referred to as the Roman Empire or Eastern Roman Empire.  In part, distinctions arose to differentiate the Eastern Roman Empire (which was not on great terms with the Papacy in Rome) from the romanticized ""greatness"" that was referred to as the Roman Empire.  Nobody who lived in the ""Byzantine Empire"" would recognize that term.
