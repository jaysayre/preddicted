LIPCSB,"The belief in some primordial ""Aryan Master Race"" came to prominence a short time after the Indo-European language family was discovered.  Analysis of ancient sanskrit texts revealed that, linguistically, the peoples of Europe, India, and Iran draw from some cultural progenitor.  This discovery was most clearly articulated in the late 18th century by Sir William Jones, who reached this conclusion through his study of the Rig Veda.  

German romantics leaped onto the idea, in their quest to find some mythical ""Pure Germany"" uncontaminated by foreign ways.  The Germans Herder and Von Humboldt in particular propagated the idea that language and cultural identity were inseparable ideas.  

These ideas were further mixed with the ideas of Social Darwinism after ""On the Origin of Species"" was published.  If the purest sense of Germany could be derived from the peasants' folk-tales, then the purest Germans must surely have been the first, uncontaminated by mixture with ""lesser"" races.  Thus was born the idea of the Aryan Master Race.  The Rig Veda's authors described themselves as Aryan, and so this was obviously the name of the oldest Germans--who, obviously, were blond, blue-eyed, tall, brilliant, and generally the best people who ever lived.  

What was once a generally neutral field of cultural study mutated into a nationalist struggle to justify their own superiority by claiming the purest blood of Western Civilization.  Jones and his contemporaries said the Aryans must have originated somewhere between Iran and the Himalayas.  By the early 20th century, German archaeologists were insisting that the Aryan homeland was obviously in Northern Germany.  

This is the basis for the idea of the ""Aryan"" race.  Hitler might not have given the occultists the time of day, but the idea of the Germans (and ""Nordic"" people in general) being of some superior, unmixed stock was pretty mainstream.  You didn't need to buy into occult claptrap to subscribe to the idea of German superiority by virtue of ancestral birthright.  

(Source: The Horse, The Wheel, and Language, by David W. Anthony)

That explains the terminology (""Aryan"") and why people cared (""because these were the first Germans, obviously"").  The symbolism follows from that--swastikas were found in a lot of archaeological sites, including Troy, and are notoriously common in India.  Obviously, it's a symbol of great importance to the Aryans!  

Its influence on German foreign policy comes down to a pseudo-scientific belief in racial struggle between the Aryans and the non-Aryan groups (""Slavs are obviously Asian--you can tell by their skulls!"" was a common line of reasoning).  German Aryans could only survive according to this narrative by wiping out their neighbors and taking their land.  ",null,1,cdktaz3,1r8z41,askhistorians,top_week,5

Yes, the Romans were strongly patriarchal. However, their female *citizens* retained a strong degree of influence and legal protection / immunity even from the standards of Europe 1000 years later. Meanwhile, if you were to compare the Romans to say, the Mongols of Genghis Khan, I think you would find that the wife of a Senator or the daughter of one of the first families of Rome would have significantly more status than chattel - even if many maneuvers might have to be executed through a politically orchestrated marriage (or other relatives and friends).

&gt;To raise pity and indignation for his murder, in the plays acted at the funeral, a passage was sung from Pacuvius's tragedy, entitled, The Trial for Arms: “That ever I, unhappy man, should save
Wretches, who thus have brought me to the grave?” And some lines also from Attilius's tragedy of "" Electra,"" to the same effect. Instead of a funeral panegyric [or eulogy], the consul Antony ordered a herald to proclaim to the people the decree of the senate, in which they had bestowed upon him all honours, divine and human; with the oath by which they had engaged themselves for the defence of his person; and to these he added only a few words of his own.

Samuel_I,"Yes, there most certainly were!

One of the easiest ways to demonstrate this is by looking at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The army of Harold of Wessex had just made it to the south of England after fighting off a force sent from the Kingdom of Norway at Stamford Bridge. His army was comprised almost entirely of infantry, with the housecarls as his elite backbone. They were a type of landed-man that typically fought with a kite-shield and a large two-handed axe. The majority of his forces, however, would have been levies armed with spears and shields. The Normans under William of Normandy were a mixed force. He had command of standard levy infantry, various ranged units such as archers and javelinmen, and cavalry. 

The *Gesta Guillelmi* and the Bayeux Tapestry are two of our most important sources for this battle.

Harold of Wessex chose to implement what we now call the shield wall. His troops stood in a tight formation and locked their shields together in order to better absorb an enemy attack, thus making it easier for his housecarls to counterattack when his foes floundered. William used his mixed force by applying his three types of soldiers intermittently in order to gain their maximum effectiveness. Ranged units to begin, infantry to assault, cavalry to break them or, should the infantry fail, recoup losses on the field. In fact, it is commonly suggested that Harold of Wessex himself died of an arrow to the eye, as the Bayeux Tapestry would seem to suggest.

In the end, William was victorious. It was not because he possessed superior equipment that Harold did not have access to, but rather because the military traditions and necessities of his army gave him an edge, namely, his mixed force. Why they differed so much is a difficult question to answer. We have multiple accounts from Bede to those of Alfred the Great that describe Anglo-Saxon battles and the way they were fought. The shield wall and housecarl were ingrained into their culture and were how they were accustomed to fighting battles. However, Normandy and William produced something different. Horseman and archers were apparently more necessary to his success in securing Normandy under his rule. In doing so, he found a set of strategies and soldiers that were sound against most armies of the day (largely static, infantry armies). He found something worked and he implemented it. Culture and necessity came together to generate a winning combination.",null,0,cdkz3wt,1r91wv,askhistorians,top_week,7
Lilaith,"Notable differences were certainly there, but they differed from general to general, and what kind of terrain/troops were there. The vision of the militairy staff was hugely important. Take the 100 years war for instance:

During the 100 years war between England and France(1337 - 1453) England under Edward III almost won the war before 1365 by innovating. 
Before the war, armies would largely consist of knights, professional hired soldiers and any footsoldiers brought by lords in the army. Edward however changed this, mass recruited english farmers and gave them the famous longbows. He also was the first to prefer skill over nobility(Roger Mortimer, his Fieldmarschalk, was of low noble rank, NOT the kingslayer with the same name) and used clever tactics. These innovations, and the fact the English did not put their lives blindly on the line believing god would save them made them almost won the war. This is most clearly shown in battles such as at Crécy and Poiters, where heavily outnumbered English forces managed to defeat French knight-armies. To make it clear: The prince of Wales defeated the French at Poiters(5400 soldiers, mainly archers vs 17500 soldiers, mainly knights) by making clever use of the terrain. The French king Jean II decided storming the hill on which the English were defending would grant him victory, although he knew the English were trapped and barely had food left. He preferred to battle them, rather than make them surrender. It ended catastrophically, with many knights killed or taken hostage, Jean II and his youngest song becomming hostages. This is a turning point in the war, since Jean's son, Charles, turns out to be a great king(later named Le Sage, the wise). In his 16 year long reign he recaptures almost everything the English had achieved, again by innovating(he innovates greatly with artillery) and clever use of politics/tactics.

conclusion: tactics and preferences can differ greatly. It relies however on the personal skill and preference of generals and the politics and finances of kings. A good king can achieve great things, a bad one can destroy even more. If you want to generalize greatly however, sure, differences existed. The French used knights and hired soldiers, the English used their famous longbows while the Italian citystates preferred crossbowarchers.

From reading the Victorians and their immediate successors, you'll get the sense that they felt their tutelage would not be indefinite (or unchanging) but would in any case extend well past their own lifetimes.

And Egypt was a possession that existed in name only--legally it was still Ottoman!  It was only really British for a few years, although their influence extended up to 1952.  Up until the Second World War, writing in the Dutch Empire was similar--they didn't really consider decolonization as a prospect in the near term, and were only concerned with reform and development under a progressively modified [*Ethische Politiek* (Ethical Policy) in 1901](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Ethical_Policy).

With that said, the early Arabic historical tradition attributes all sorts of letters or statements from Muhammad to other rulers or leaders in the Near East during his lifetime. But there are numerous problems with these early Arabic sources, namely that none of them are written down until centuries after the lifetime of the Prophet. That's not to say that we don't find material that is very likely authentic in this tradition - we certainly do.

As said, I did indeed weigh in on the [Ahdnâme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtiname_of_Muhammad) - the ""charter"" supposedly sent by Muḥammad to those of St. Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai - as being a forgery, based on looking at the work of a couple of scholars (e.g. Mouton 1988), and my preliminary impressions from reading its text. Puzzlingly, this work seems to have been totally neglected in scholarship. I had looked at the issue tangentially before, but if I have time, I'd like to do a fuller study (I've now transcribed the Arabic text and such).

As seen in my comments on the post you linked, I compared the Ahdnâme to the supposed [treaty with the Christians of Najrān](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_community_of_Najran#Najran_pact):

&gt;One of the most important historiographic strategies employed in Syriac literature was to claim that the Arabs had granted some Church leader a document at the time of the conquest. This does not appear to have been a seventh-century issue or motif. None of these claims seem to be any earlier than the ninth century and some are much later.

&gt;. . .

&gt;Scher is closer to the mark in saying that [the Convention of Najrān] was forged by Christians to induce the Muslims to spare them. Given the previous discussion, it is most likely that it served as an historiographic strategy to preserve Christian communities by claiming that particular rights and privileges had been granted by Muhammad himself. It also seems to reflect or to be related to the theoretical issue that had developed in Islamic administrative law concerning the taxation of particular places depending on whether they had been conquered by force or had surrendered peacefully (e.g. the Kitāb al-Kharāj or Abu Yusuf). It is no accident that Christians began to refer to such documents by the ninth century after about a century of threats to church buildings and pressures for conversion/apostasy. By employing them Christians were raising the ante.

Morony, “History and Identity in the Syrian Churches,” in Ginkel, J.J. van, Murre-Van Den Berg, H.L., &amp; Lint, T.M. van (2005). *Redefining Christian Identity: Cultural Interaction in the Middle East since the Rise of Islam* (Orientalia Lovaniensia analecta, 134).

&gt;While there are significant divergencies in the reportage of this treaty, indicating tampering or ""improving"", the text for political reasons during the early Islamic era, its general tenor, language and circumstances furnish no cause to believe that it is not basically authentic.

As was said, though, there were many supposed letters sent out - some info can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_letters_to_the_Heads-of-State). Quoting Serjeant again on these:

&gt;That Muhammad actually wrote to Byzantine or Sasanian officials or rulers of Arabian provinces allied to them is not impossible; Quraysh of Mecca had direct commercial relations with both empires. Yet it seems improbable that he would send provocative letters to Qayṣar or Chosroes when, even by the time of his death, he had still not mastered a large part of Arabia. Moreover, the more or less standardized pattern and ideology of the letters arouse suspicion. There are patently anachronistic items, such as the demand that [Heraclius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius), if he will not embrace Islam, should pay the *jizyah* tax - by which is clearly intended the poll-tax charged to Dhimmis (persons belonging to the protected faiths of Christianity and Judaism), though the term *jizyah* was not confined in Muhammad's lifetime to the Dhimmi poll-tax.

From what the monks told us, all Moslems had respected this rule up until the new extremists.

The local Bedouins are said to be descendants or Roman soldiers sent to guard the holy site, and once they converted to Islam, they took Mohammed's letter as a religious calling on top of their societal role in the region.

As said, I did indeed weigh in on the [Ahdnâme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtiname_of_Muhammad) - the ""charter"" supposedly sent by Muḥammad to those of St. Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai - as being a forgery, based on looking at the work of a couple of scholars (e.g. Mouton 1988), and my preliminary impressions from reading its text. Puzzlingly, this work seems to have been totally neglected in scholarship. I had looked at the issue tangentially before, but if I have time, I'd like to do a fuller study (I've now transcribed the Arabic text and such).

As seen in my comments on the post you linked, I compared the Ahdnâme to the supposed [treaty with the Christians of Najrān](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_community_of_Najran#Najran_pact):

&gt;One of the most important historiographic strategies employed in Syriac literature was to claim that the Arabs had granted some Church leader a document at the time of the conquest. This does not appear to have been a seventh-century issue or motif. None of these claims seem to be any earlier than the ninth century and some are much later.

&gt;. . .

&gt;Scher is closer to the mark in saying that [the Convention of Najrān] was forged by Christians to induce the Muslims to spare them. Given the previous discussion, it is most likely that it served as an historiographic strategy to preserve Christian communities by claiming that particular rights and privileges had been granted by Muhammad himself. It also seems to reflect or to be related to the theoretical issue that had developed in Islamic administrative law concerning the taxation of particular places depending on whether they had been conquered by force or had surrendered peacefully (e.g. the Kitāb al-Kharāj or Abu Yusuf). It is no accident that Christians began to refer to such documents by the ninth century after about a century of threats to church buildings and pressures for conversion/apostasy. By employing them Christians were raising the ante.

Morony, “History and Identity in the Syrian Churches,” in Ginkel, J.J. van, Murre-Van Den Berg, H.L., &amp; Lint, T.M. van (2005). *Redefining Christian Identity: Cultural Interaction in the Middle East since the Rise of Islam* (Orientalia Lovaniensia analecta, 134).

With certain caveats, the authenticity of the more ""domestic"" documents, like the Ṣaḥīfat *al-Madīnah*, the charter/constitution of Medina, and the [Treaty of Hudaybiyyah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Hudaybiyyah), are not challenged. Quoting Serjeant on the latter:

&gt;While there are significant divergencies in the reportage of this treaty, indicating tampering or ""improving"", the text for political reasons during the early Islamic era, its general tenor, language and circumstances furnish no cause to believe that it is not basically authentic.

As was said, though, there were many supposed letters sent out - some info can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_letters_to_the_Heads-of-State). Quoting Serjeant again on these:

&gt;That Muhammad actually wrote to Byzantine or Sasanian officials or rulers of Arabian provinces allied to them is not impossible; Quraysh of Mecca had direct commercial relations with both empires. Yet it seems improbable that he would send provocative letters to Qayṣar or Chosroes when, even by the time of his death, he had still not mastered a large part of Arabia. Moreover, the more or less standardized pattern and ideology of the letters arouse suspicion. There are patently anachronistic items, such as the demand that [Heraclius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius), if he will not embrace Islam, should pay the *jizyah* tax - by which is clearly intended the poll-tax charged to Dhimmis (persons belonging to the protected faiths of Christianity and Judaism), though the term *jizyah* was not confined in Muhammad's lifetime to the Dhimmi poll-tax.

But because Mohammed was illiterate, he did not write or sign the letter. Instead, he hired a scribe and then placed his hand at the bottom and had it traced. From what the monks told us, all Moslems had respected this rule up until the new extremists.

The local Bedouins are said to be descendants or Roman soldiers sent to guard the holy site, and once they converted to Islam, they took Mohammed's letter as a religious calling on top of their societal role in the region.

kevink123,"Answering this question first requires an in-depth exploration of the Qing's unique Eight Banner System so that we may contrast it with the far more conventional Green Standard Army.

The Eight Banners trace their origins to the reign of Nurhaci (posthumously recognized as the first Qing Emperor) in the early 17th century when the nascent Jurchen state still called itself the Jin. The system was modeled upon traditional hunting methods from Northeast Asia, in which 8-10 hunters would surround a large mass of forest and slowly drive the encircled game to the center. In essence, the system grouped the many diverse peoples from Nurhaci's rapid conquests of Northeast Asia into cohesive, loyal military units. Previously, Nurhaci's armies were plagued by factionalism, tribal-based loyalties, and old family feuds. The Banner System cut through these traditions, and placed each soldier in a military unit ruled by headsman that was unwavering in their loyalty to Nurhaci alone. In this way, Nurhaci overcame tribalism to create an army over whom his command was absolute. A soldier's position in his ""Banner"" was permanent and hereditary. It expanded beyond the military and into his daily life: as the families in a Banner provided soldiers to fill the unit, so too did the Banner's bureaucracy provide for the family's daily needs. The system, in those early days, created a highly militarized and decisively loyal military in a time where Nurhaci might otherwise have been plagued by crippling decentralization and lineage based command structures.^1

Initially, there were only four banners: the Yellow, White, Red, and Blue. In 1615, Nurhaci expanded the system to include a total of Eight Banners, having added the Bordered Yellow, Bordered White, Bordered Red, and Bordered Blue Banners. In the 1630's, Hong Taiji (Nurhaci's successor) separated the Banners along ethnic lines. As a result, distinct ""Mongol"" and ""Manchu"" Banners were created. By 1642, after the conquest of Liaodong, Han Chinese banners were created as well, often called the ""*hanjun*"" or ""martial Han"" banners. As a result, By 1644 (when the Qing seized Beijing), the Eight Banners were actually 24 different banners: the Manchu Red, the Mongolian Bordered White, the *Hanjun* Blue, etc etc etc. In terms of numbers, the *Hanjun* Banners were the largest by far, and the Mongolian units were certainly the smallest. The Banner System caused the three ethnic groups to grow ethnically and culturally closer over the course of the dynasty, and fostered within all of them a common ""Manchu"" identity despite their respective Han, Mongolian, or Jurchen origins.^2

The size of the Banner System was surprisingly large. During the conquest beginning in 1644, The Manchu Army's adult male population (not including slaves) was around 300,000. By the early ~~17th~~ 18th century, the total Banner Population (including wives and families, who were also important member of the Banner System's social structure) numbered at least 2.5 million, and perhaps as high as 5 million. Geographically, the Banner population was concentrated in Beijing (~50%), Northeast China (~20%), and throughout the garrisons of their Empire (~30%).^3

Despite their impressive size and growth, the Banners were too small to maintain security within their domain. As a result, the Qing relied on the Green Standard units to maintain stability. This was possible owing to the units' immense size. Throughout the Dynasty, the Green Standard armies were about three times the size of their Eight Banner counterparts. Ethnicity was a primary difference between the Green Standard and Eight Banner units. Although there were exceptions, the soldier in the Green Standard units were almost exclusively Han Chinese. Bannermen could become officers in Green Standard units, but almost exclusively soldiered for the Eight Banners. What's more, the Green Standard were simply an enlistment based unit. This was in contrast to the intricate Banner System, which went far beyond just a military unit. Whereas the Banners were a hereditary social/military unit that managed every aspect of its members lives from cradle to grave, the Green Standard were simple term based enlistment units.^4

EDIT: I should clarify that there is a distinct difference between the ""Han Chinese"" (that filled the ranks of the Green Standard infantry) and the ""Martial Han"" or ""*Hanjun*"" (members of the Han Banners). The *Hanjun* were descendants of the large populations of Han outside the Ming state that were integrated into the Manchu state prior to the conquest of the Ming. Their early entrance into the Qing at a time when manpower was sorely needed spurred the creation of Eight additional *Hanjun* banners. After there entrance into the Eight Banners, these *Hanjun* increasingly diverged from the cultural practices and identities of the Han Chinese throughout China proper. As stated above, *Hanjun* naturally forged a common Manchu identity with the members of the Mongol and Manchu banners over time (though they forever remained second class bannermen in the eyes of the Mongols and Manchus). The Han Chinese throughout China would also label the *Hanjun* as Manchus.

backgrinder,"Fire ships. It's borderline for you, since it's really a tactical innovation. But fire ships could be a massive leveler. Henry Morgan used fire ships and deception at Maracaibo when he was trapped in an inland lagoon by a Spanish fleet. He was laughably outgunned, the Spanish fleets tender, a 10 gun ship had as many cannon as his flagship. Morgans vessels were small and configured to carry men and loot, not weapons platforms. The Spanish had 3 heavy galleons that should have destroyed him but he turned his flagship into a fireship and destroyed the Spanish fleet. 

 As far as your other examples they are all good, but they all probably require a little context. None of them are super weapons in the sense of using machine guns against cavemen armed with rocks and sticks. The Macedonian phalanx was strong, but in battle after battle it was Alexanders cavalry that broke the Persians. Stirrups and bows were useful inventions, but the Mongols were able to defeat enemy after enemy by their aggressive and innovative use of mobility and flexible battlefield tactics. The longbow at Agincourt deserves it's reputation, but that battle may have turned as much on weather as the bow: torrential rains so soaked the field that the French could not maintain their standard combined arms doctrine and had to advance piecemeal, with their cavalry uncovered by their own bows and infantry. For super weapons to work they have to be paired with ingenious new tactics developed to maximize their advantage, and used effectively in battlefield conditions.

Without Ramones first UK tour there are about half a dozen prominent UK punk bands who probably wouldn't exist as they site that band and tour with their direct inspiration to start a band.

From the first paragraph of the Wikipedia entry on Ramones:

&gt;  Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the punk rock movement in both the United States and, *perhaps to a greater extent, in the United Kingdom.* 

(emphasis mine)

The UK scene can be credited with injecting a politcal (or just as often, faux or pseudo-political) energy as well as many of the fashion and stylistic elements (ransom note printing, etc.) associated with punk via Vivianne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren.

I must say I don't know as much about West Coast punk which was isolated compared to the NY and UK which were co-mingling quite a bit. Scenes where happening in LA and the Bay area, the midwest and DC scenes are also worth noting.

Eventually scenes popped up across the US, a DIY touring network of small town all ages venues that persisted even a punk slid from mainstream view but paved the way for the ""2nd wave"" in the 90s (Green Day, Blink) the Warped tour, etc.

*Punk Diary 1970-1979* by George Gilmarc (St. Martin's Press, may be out of print? I've seen it used and probably on amazon) is a good reference of the early UK scene.

The documentary ""Another State of Mind"" covers the early Southern California punk scene with a bit on DC and Steven Blush's *American Hardcore* (Feral House, 2001) is yet another ""oral history"" style text that pretty broad but captures a lot of perspectives.

Remember that as much as it is often said that Rome had no clear line of succession, it tended to give very clear favoritism to biological descent. This makes for a rather complicated dissonance with the rather pragmatic ideology of the empire that tended to emphasize the emperor as an individual suited to the post by his individual qualities.

Tiako,"To call ancient demography an art rather than a science is something of an insult to the rigor of art. Before the Middle Ages, for which we have government documents that help us determine the size of towns, we are largely dependent on archaeology to tell us how large settlements are. Because the archaeology of a settlement is very rarely complete, and even where it is we can not say for certain how many people lived in a given space, archaeologists rely on combining multiple different data sets to building a guess at how many people lived in a given settlement. This includes scarps of relevant ancient literature, scientific determinations of how productive the agriculture of a settlement's hinterland is, and a rather holistic method of seeing how much space is enclosed by a wall circuit and guessing the population density based on comparative evidence. It is all very uncertain, but this doesn't stop people from guessing, and these guesses can still be very intelligent.

Ian Morris, a prominent archaeologist of Greece, estimates a population of classical Athens at 35-40,000 inhabitants within the city of Athens, an perhaps a further 25,000 people living near the harbor of the Piraeus. Sparta is frustratingly difficult to work with. Due to its extensive imperial control of the countryside, some estimates put it at a roughly equal level, perhaps 40,000. However, literary evidence leads us to believe that the region was not extensively urbanized, and so the more likely model conceives of it as a large region made up of fairly conventional towns of no more 5-10,000 inhabitants.

Morris's article is available [free here](http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf) if you want to see the reasoning, though be aware it is involved in a set of debates you might not be interested in if you are just curious about populations levels.",null,1,cdkzhvo,1r9cni,askhistorians,top_week,14

That would mean a population of around 300,000 for the region of Attica.

I think it is harder to find information on the Spartan losses (especially on non-Spartiates) but there were only ~1,500 Spartiates by Leuctra (371 BC).

In Arabia, we have city fortification, usually topped with a stronghold called al-qasr, which survived as place-names in Iberia as Alcazar. In oasis, local Arab clans built castles called qasbah as a secure living place, that function exactly like European castles, as it was used as refugee in times of nomads' raids. The Arabs also build fortified caravanserai to secure trade route, the best surviving of them are in Jordan. Fortifications in Arab worlds, both built by local families or by ruling dynasties, is today an important tourist destination in Morocco, Yemen and Oman.

In China, apart from the famous Great Wall, all major cities had fortification. The city wall in Xian is now one of well preserved. In Northern China, as most population during pre-modern era lived in big cities, local strongholds are rare, as the fortifications efforts were mostly directed toward the building of city walls. However in Southern China, where many people lived in hard to reach villages, and where conflict between clans or ethnic groups were common (for example, Hakka-Punti war), the local clan built rounded communal houses which provide protections against rival clans' attacks. This rounded houses are called tulou (土楼).

Also, I don't suppose I need to mention the well documented prevalence of Japanese castles, that is used by the local daimyo during the shogunates.  The Japanese also built several of this type of fortifications in Korea during their failed invasion.

To take your questions in reverse order:

San Juan de Tenochtitlan (as it was known in the early colonial era) was not fortified during the early period of Spanish rule. It was, in fact, widely depopulated and almost abandoned in the first few decades after the Conquest. Notably, Cortés opted to base himself in nearby [Cuauhnahuac/Cuernavaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Cort%C3%A9s,_Cuernavaca). Tenochtitlan, at the end of the 3 month siege by the combined forces of the Tlaxcalans, Texcocoans, Spanish, and other indigenous groups, was virtually destroyed. In part this was a result of the Mexica themselves tearing up the city to build barricades and breastworks as the siege wore on, but was largely a result of the Spanish/Indian tactics during the latter part of the siege.

**The Siege**

The Siege of Tenochtitlan really had two phases: a long hard slog across the causeways onto the city proper and the subsequent advance of the allied forces across the city, forcing the Mexica back into a defensive position in Tenochtitlan's sister city, Tlatelolco. [Here's a map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Tenochtitlan-medium.png/725px-Tenochtitlan-medium.png), to help with the making of sense of things.

The causeway portion of the siege was mostly typified by a cat-and-mouse game between the brigantines the Spanish shipbuilder Martín López had put together (that such an expert was on the expedition at all was a *huge* boon to the Spanish, see their attempt at building a catapult). The Mexica used ambush tactics and placed stakes in the shallow waters of Lake Texcoco to restrict the movement of the deeper draft brigantines. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who accompanied Cortés and ended up writing what is the definitive Conquistador account, best describes the early part of the causeway slog thusly:

&gt; When we left a bridge or barricade unguarded after having captured it with much labour, the enemy would retake and deepen it that same night, and construct stronger defences^1

Eventually though, the combined forces of the Spanish and the numerous indigenous allies ground down the Mexica, and the Spanish reached the outskirts of the city. The problem the Spanish faced in the streets of Tenochtitlan was that they were unable to effectively deploy their most powerful weapons, cavalry and they were also open ambushes and attack from the rooftops of buildings. They solved this problem via the tactics they had developed on the causeways: filling in canals and pulling down buildings. Essentially, the Spanish and their allies systematically destroyed the city as they advanced across it. 

This passage, again from BDdC, is from when the Spanish were still advancing across the causeway, but contemplating how to further their advance into the city. It shows the debate of tactics, and which ones were ultimately adopted, since Cortés ended up suffering a huge defeat (and almost getting captured) by *not* following the advice below:

&gt; ... [S]ome of us said it was not good avice to or a good idea to intrude ourselves so entirely into the heart of the City, but we should remain as we were, fighting and **pulling down and levelling the houses**

**~~Quick~~ Post-Siege Wrap-Up**

After Cuauhtemoc was captured the immediate war against the Mexica essentially ended, though resistance by both Mexica loyalists and groups not wishing to transfer the allegiance continued. The twin city of Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco, however, was devastated. The main aqueduct into the city had been cut early in the siege, a smallpox epidemic had ravaged the population, and the siege itself took place during harvest time, which meant that the urban population of Tenochtitlan was unable to get the rural agrarian products on which it relied. The city was a starving, thirsty, razed, and pestilent wasteland, in other words. Here's BDdC again:

&gt; I have read about the destruction of Jerusalem but I know not for certain if there was a greater mortality than this, for the greater number of the warriors from all the provinces and towns subject to Mexico who had crowded in [to the city] most of them died, and as I have already said, thus the land and the lake and the palisades were all full of dead bodies, and it stank so much that no one could endure it...

The Spanish would eventually rebuild the Chapultepec aqueduct (only to let it fall into disrepair) and make some other efforts to restore the city, but it would be centuries before it achieved the population level it had during the Pre-Hispanic period. Part of this had to do with the destruction and/or abandonment of indigenous hydraulic controls, which in the seasonally flooded Valley of Mexico led to some catastrophic events that almost caused the city itself to be abandoned. I wrote a little more in-depth about this in a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jxsq2/what_was_the_native_mexican_reaction_to_the/cbjuls6).

There was really no threat of invasion though. While the final battle between the Mexica and the Native/Spanish forces is often lumped together as the ""Siege of Tenochtitlan"" there were skirmishes and battles happening around the Lake Texcoco basin. The fall of the concentrated Mexica-aligned forces in Tlatelolco, however, was a significant enough blow to the loyalist forces, both in morale and real terms, to make resistance to the imposition of a new regime moot. Cuitlahuac, who preceded Cuauhtemoc for a few weeks before succumbing to smallpox, had actually made it a policy to condense the leadership of tributary states into Tenochtitlan. There are some interesting political reasons for this which are beyond the scope of your questions, but suffice to say that the fall of Tenochtitlan marked the end of real resistance. The Spanish had allied themselves with enough indigenous powers that they jointly controlled a significant amount of the Valley of Mexico even before the Siege.

There were no Chichimec invasions, or even a threat. The Aztecs^2 themselves were really the result of Chichimec migrations/invasions in the centuries after the fall of Teotihuacan. By the Aztec Imperial period though (early 15th Century), the region had sufficiently stabilized and urbanized to make the introgressions of semi-nomads from the North a moot point. Far more pertinent were the surrounding state actors like the Tarascans and Mixtec, who focused on their own sovereignty following the collapse of the political order (and widespread pestilence) rather than devising plans to conquer the Valley of Mexico.

**Pre-Hispanic Fortifications**

I actually wrote an entire post about [Post-Classic Mesoamerican sieges](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1coe7f/siege_warfare_in_precolombus_americas_how/c9ixz4h). The takeaway is that siege warfare was not a particularly prevalent part of the Aztec period and it's immediate fore-bearers. Wars were instead fought with vast numbers of troops drafted from the general population on a kind of seasonal basis. When the dry season (i.e., Winter) rolled around, armies would march. When the wet season resumed, those same troops would be needed for agricultural work. 

Siege warfare did occur, as I note in the previous post, but the real duty of pro-longed warfare fell to professional warriors (i.e., the nobility) during *xochiyaoyotin* (Flower Wars). These more ritualistic and governed combats allowed the professional warrior classes of the nobility to hone their skills; achieve status and honor through taking captives; and slowly grind down less extensive enemies, just as in a siege. For further reading on this (since it's a bit of a tangent at this point), I would recommend Hassig's *Aztec Warfare*, which is literally the book on the subject. 

**Answering Your Question, Finally**

Tenochtitlan was guarded not by walls, but by men (and lots of water). One thing to keep in mind about the rise of the Mexica is that is was explosive. In the early 1400s they were vassals to the Tepanecs on the Western shore of Lake Texcoco. By the mid 1400s, they had subjugated, or allied with, the entirety of the Basin of Mexico and were expanding outward. 

That the Aztec Empire was truly an alliance between the dominant group on the Western shores of Texcoco (the Tepanecs) and the dominant group on the Eastern shores of Texcoco (the Acolhua) with an upstart military power on an island between them explains a great deal. What it explains in this case is the lack of massive fortifications in Tenochtitlan proper. The city really expanded only after it had already secured the support of the biggest military and political powers in the region; it's threats were beyond the Valley of Mexico, not necessarily within it. And even when domestic conflicts arose, the fact that Tenochtitlan was located on an island accessible only by canoe or causeway, *and* that it grew to be the largest polity in the region by far, meant that routes to attack it were limited and its best defense was its people. Note above that Cortés main obstacle was simply making across the causeways to the city, which had been ravaged by disease, dehydration, and hunger. 

This is not to say the city was completely defenseless. The causeways themselves had sections would could be removed and towers and strong points which could be manned by troops. Tenochtitlan, however, was a city of canals, not walls. It was surrounded by both allies and a lake. It was the combination of regional revolt along with introduced diseases that worked to bring it down.

To take your questions in reverse order:

San Juan de Tenochtitlan (as it was known in the early colonial era) was not fortified during the early period of Spanish rule. It was, in fact, widely depopulated and almost abandoned in the first few decades after the Conquest. Notably, Cortés opted to base himself in nearby [Cuauhnahuac/Cuernavaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Cort%C3%A9s,_Cuernavaca). Tenochtitlan, at the end of the 3 month siege by the combined forces of the Tlaxcalans, Texcocoans, Spanish, and other indigenous groups, was virtually destroyed. In part this was a result of the Mexica themselves tearing up the city to build barricades and breastworks as the siege wore on, but was largely a result of the Spanish/Indian tactics during the latter part of the siege.

**The Siege**

The Siege of Tenochtitlan really had two phases: a long hard slog across the causeways onto the city proper and the subsequent advance of the allied forces across the city, forcing the Mexica back into a defensive position in Tenochtitlan's sister city, Tlatelolco. [Here's a map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Tenochtitlan-medium.png/725px-Tenochtitlan-medium.png), to help with the making of sense of things.

The causeway portion of the siege was mostly typified by a cat-and-mouse game between the brigantines the Spanish shipbuilder Martín López had put together (that such an expert was on the expedition at all was a *huge* boon to the Spanish, see their attempt at building a catapult). The Mexica used ambush tactics and placed stakes in the shallow waters of Lake Texcoco to restrict the movement of the deeper draft brigantines. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who accompanied Cortés and ended up writing what is the definitive Conquistador account, best describes the early part of the causeway slog thusly:

&gt; When we left a bridge or barricade unguarded after having captured it with much labour, the enemy would retake and deepen it that same night, and construct stronger defences^1

Eventually though, the combined forces of the Spanish and the numerous indigenous allies ground down the Mexica, and the Spanish reached the outskirts of the city. The problem the Spanish faced in the streets of Tenochtitlan was that they were unable to effectively deploy their most powerful weapons, cavalry and they were also open ambushes and attack from the rooftops of buildings. They solved this problem via the tactics they had developed on the causeways: filling in canals and pulling down buildings. Essentially, the Spanish and their allies systematically destroyed the city as they advanced across it. 

This passage, again from BDdC, is from when the Spanish were still advancing across the causeway, but contemplating how to further their advance into the city. It shows the debate of tactics, and which ones were ultimately adopted, since Cortés ended up suffering a huge defeat (and almost getting captured) by *not* following the advice below:

&gt; ... [S]ome of us said it was not good avice to or a good idea to intrude ourselves so entirely into the heart of the City, but we should remain as we were, fighting and **pulling down and levelling the houses**

**~~Quick~~ Post-Siege Wrap-Up**

After Cuauhtemoc was captured the immediate war against the Mexica essentially ended, though resistance by both Mexica loyalists and groups not wishing to transfer the allegiance continued. The twin city of Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco, however, was devastated. The main aqueduct into the city had been cut early in the siege, a smallpox epidemic had ravaged the population, and the siege itself took place during harvest time, which meant that the urban population of Tenochtitlan was unable to get the rural agrarian products on which it relied. The city was a starving, thirsty, razed, and pestilent wasteland, in other words. Here's BDdC again:

&gt; I have read about the destruction of Jerusalem but I know not for certain if there was a greater mortality than this, for the greater number of the warriors from all the provinces and towns subject to Mexico who had crowded in [to the city] most of them died, and as I have already said, thus the land and the lake and the palisades were all full of dead bodies, and it stank so much that no one could endure it...

The Spanish would eventually rebuild the Chapultepec aqueduct (only to let it fall into disrepair) and make some other efforts to restore the city, but it would be centuries before it achieved the population level it had during the Pre-Hispanic period. Part of this had to do with the destruction and/or abandonment of indigenous hydraulic controls, which in the seasonally flooded Valley of Mexico led to some catastrophic events that almost caused the city itself to be abandoned. I wrote a little more in-depth about this in a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jxsq2/what_was_the_native_mexican_reaction_to_the/cbjuls6).

There was really no threat of invasion though. While the final battle between the Mexica and the Native/Spanish forces is often lumped together as the ""Siege of Tenochtitlan"" there were skirmishes and battles happening around the Lake Texcoco basin. The fall of the concentrated Mexica-aligned forces in Tlatelolco, however, was a significant enough blow to the loyalist forces, both in morale and real terms, to make resistance to the imposition of a new regime moot. Cuitlahuac, who preceded Cuauhtemoc for a few weeks before succumbing to smallpox, had actually made it a policy to condense the leadership of tributary states into Tenochtitlan. There are some interesting political reasons for this which are beyond the scope of your questions, but suffice to say that the fall of Tenochtitlan marked the end of real resistance. The Spanish had allied themselves with enough indigenous powers that they jointly controlled a significant amount of the Valley of Mexico even before the Siege.

There were no Chichimec invasions, or even a threat. The Aztecs^2 themselves were really the result of Chichimec migrations/invasions in the centuries after the fall of Teotihuacan. By the Aztec Imperial period though (early 15th Century), the region had sufficiently stabilized and urbanized to make the introgressions of semi-nomads from the North a moot point. Far more pertinent were the surrounding state actors like the Tarascans and Mixtec, who focused on their own sovereignty following the collapse of the political order (and widespread pestilence) rather than devising plans to conquer the Valley of Mexico.

**Pre-Hispanic Fortifications**

I actually wrote an entire post about [Post-Classic Mesoamerican sieges](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1coe7f/siege_warfare_in_precolombus_americas_how/c9ixz4h). The takeaway is that siege warfare was not a particularly prevalent part of the Aztec period and it's immediate fore-bearers. Wars were instead fought with vast numbers of troops drafted from the general population on a kind of seasonal basis. When the dry season (i.e., Winter) rolled around, armies would march. When the wet season resumed, those same troops would be needed for agricultural work. 

Siege warfare did occur, as I note in the previous post, but the real duty of pro-longed warfare fell to professional warriors (i.e., the nobility) during *xochiyaoyotin* (Flower Wars). These more ritualistic and governed combats allowed the professional warrior classes of the nobility to hone their skills; achieve status and honor through taking captives; and slowly grind down less extensive enemies, just as in a siege.

Celebreth,"Hey there! Saw this thread and figured I would pop on over. Rome was indeed an incredible city - it was the largest city in the ancient world (with the possible exception of a Chinese city - I'm not terribly well versed in the Far East), and had the grandeur to match up. However, what *Gladiator* doesn't show is that most of Rome wasn't exactly grand. The city was filthy, disorganized, and one of the first great, documented instances of pollution is shown (The Tiber River was Rome's sewage outflow) - which the Romans responded to by building their famed aqueducts (The first one is generally assigned to 312 BCE).

One of the biggest things that *Gladiator* doesn't bother showing is that disorganization that I mentioned earlier. In Rome, many streets weren't named, houses were unnumbered/named, and the vast majority of the populace lived in cramped tenement housing known as *insulae*. 

Anyways. Let me directly answer your question with the best modern reconstruction of Ancient Rome that I've seen.

Astrogator,"That is an extremely convoluted and complicated question, if simply for the fact that the Romans conquered a ton of native civilizations over more than five centuries. 

First, your question is already making a few assumptions, for example that the Romans were being less advanced than the civilizations they conquered. They were evidently more advanced militarily if they could conquer as many of them as they did, just for a start. There are so many cultural and social differences between the people that became part of the Roman Empire that it is really useless to make such a claim in the first place. Then, how would you measure advancement? How would you measure destruction of advancement? Knowledge in general doesn't easily get destroyed. And the Romans were pretty good assimilators. 

The most amazing thing to me is that they managed to mold it all into an Empire in the first place. The institutions were simply not there when the Empire expanded as rapidly as it did during the two centuries around the year 1. They had to find new ways of administrating the conquered territories, and to integrate them, and in the beginning, they often failed, evidenced by the countless local revolts. The Pannonians (then part of Illyricum), after being freshly conquered, revolted *every year* for ten years straight until the Romans could pacify them. 
Generally, established political and economic structures, where they already existed, were kept after conquest, integrating the local established elite into the new provincial organization, quickly making them Roman citizens and thus depriving possible resistance groups of leadership (ideally, of course). Those leaders could, in time, rise to equestrian or senatorial rank. Others acquired citizenship by service in the auxiliary troops, and many did. Being part of the Empire meant a rise in opportunities for a lot of people, particularly as soldiers or traders. 

The amazing thing is that by the end of the second century AD, all these natives had become Romans after a fashion, some more, some less quickly, and by 212 every freeborn inhabitant of the Empire became a *cives Romanus* by decree of the Emperor. The nature of this process is debated. It has been seen as a process of Rome imposing her values on newly conquered natives, making them 'Roman', stressing the active Roman part. Other interpretations, influenced by postcolonialism, have put the natives in the foreground, stressing the process of emulation and mutual influence of the different cultural traditions, evident for example in Religion, where Romans added local deities into their pantheon (interpretatio romana). The debate has not ended, and there are a lot more nuances to consider. 

To the matter of improving lives: I'll again talk about Pannonia. Before the Romans came, it was the place of devastating wars and tribal feuds. When the Boii, a celctic tribe who had carved themselves a little empire on the lower Danube around modern Bratislava and Vienna, were defeated by the Dacian king Burebista in the first century, they were defeated so resoundingly that their empire vanished, they became subject to the neighbouring Norii, and their lands became known to Pliny as the ""boian desert"" (*deserta boiorum*). The Boii themselves had only come to Pannonia from Bohemia after evading the pressure of Germanic tribes from the north. This is an example of Rome really bringing *pax romana*, a measure of stability. Those people had been roving around Central Europe for two centuries, I think they might have welcomed a period of safety and prosperity. There is the simple rise of material culture during Roman times in the archaeological record that directly shows a rise in prosperity. Houses, cities being built, coins hoarded, decorations made, beautiful villae being built in the countryside and so on. 

There's no saying whether it 'generally' improved the lives of the conquered. Many died during the conquest, many more died in revolts. There was a lot more social mobility, and while evidence for upwards mobility is easy to come by, there is circumstantial evidence for downward mobility as well. The trend to set messages in stone soared during the first and second centuries, possibly marking a desire to set ones achievements in stone as well, showing a sense of insecurity, guarding them against possible future misfortunes. People were proud of having become Roman citizens, proud of having become successful soldiers, traders, priests, mayors, magistrates or otherwise members of the local elite. Others were proudly showing off their cultural heritage in a new Roman context, wearing their traditional clothes or ornaments, women often more so than the men. In some places, the Romans learned new technologies and cultural practices from those they conquered, in some they brought things that had never been seen before. In the East, Latin never replaced Greek as the lingua franca, and hellenic cultural tradition was always dominant over Romes. But I'd say they surely improved the lives of some, maybe the majority. 

After reading your question again, I think your discussion partner might hace been talking about the myth surrounding the burning of the library of Alexandria, since that one is pretty popular. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1nqrl0/carl_sagan_the_library_of_alexandria_and_the/) a pretty amusing deconstruction of a particular version of that myth.

AlextheXander,"To provide another viewpoint than the one very eloquently and accurately put forth by Astrogator let me recommend '[An Imperial Posession: Britain in the Roman Empire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Imperial-Possession-Britain-Penguin-History/dp/0140148221/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385213657&amp;sr=1- 1&amp;keywords=an+imperial+possession+britain+in+the+roman+empire)' by the archaeologist David Mattingly. Its a few years since i've read it and it was before i began studying Archaeology so my summary of his books is sparse and unprofessional. 

One of his central points is that Rome, historically in Academia, has been exempt from the otherwise scathing critique of Imperial power structure. Where we tend to see Empires as constructs of Exploitaiton and Subjugation we've viewed The Roman Empire in a much more benign light. Even going so far as to believe Roman occupation a positive force in the regions they conquered. 

David Mattingly essentially tries to put the 'E' back in Empire and paints a picture of an Empire mainly interested in the natural resources to be exploited in Britain with little regard for the local people. To facilitate this, Rome adopted a policy of allying with the local Elite because this, more or less, ensured the pasification of the native lower classes. 

Mattingly covers a lot more besides an analysis of Empire. He goes into great detail to, archaeologically, describe the lives of stationed roman soldiers and Urban/rural dwellers. I highly recommend the book if you're interested in a take on Rome's influence on the regions under its dominion. ",null,0,cdl5lbg,1r9mqu,askhistorians,top_week,5
King_of_Men,"&gt; apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order... what have the Romans done for us? 

I know joke answers are not permitted, but I'm making a serious point, as was the movie: The Romans really did build a lot of infrastructure. In Britain, their roads were still in use (because after some centuries of entropy they were *still* the best ones around!) as late as the reign of King Alfred. Infrastructure tends to be underrated, but it's *really important*. They also put down bandits and pirates, and made the Med (plus Britain) into a single trade zone for the first time; consider all the benefits of globalisation, without the problems caused by it happening in a single century and not giving people time to adjust. 

It's true that the Romans were unlikely to introduce much *technology*, per se, to a conquered people; but that's not the only form of being advanced. There was a hell of a lot of capital investment going on, which likely would not have occurred in the patchwork of tribes and cities that you, presumably, get in the counterfactual world where Rome did not exist. 

I suggest that, in measuring ""improved lives"", scholarship tends to be highly overrated, partly because the people doing the rating are themselves scholars. The average peasant was perhaps not likely to care whether the Romans introduced a lot of new philosophy or not; in fact he was unlikely to hear about it if they did. On the other hand, a road that would let him bring his produce to the big market in town, for a much improved price - not to mention participating in a money economy so he could buy stuff from the other side of the Med! - that was a big, visible improvement.

The severe whipping that the slave Patsey is subjected to in the movie is straight from the book and there's no reason to doubt it is true as described. There are plenty of instances of slaves being whipped to death in the historical record, and we've got lots of photos of slaves whose backs are covered in whipping scars.

lukeweiss,"What stuff are you referring to? What kind of manufacturing? and, when?

From the 11th Century onward, China was the single largest manufacturing economy in the world, with Porcelain and raw/finished silks leading the way. The silk industry was mostly household, but the Porcelains were often produced in massive factories, and could be gathered easily for export, as exemplified in the Zheng He voyages. If you are referring to any of the intervening time and/or the modern day, the answers stem from the Song Dynasty period referenced above.   

So, how do we answer your questions? Well, here goes:   

1. Population. to make a lot of stuff, you need a lot of people. China's population has been the largest under one organized government for about 2200 years, with small interruptions that grew lesser over the centuries. By 600 CE, the population was around 50-60million. 1100, we are talking twice that. Some dips due to plague and wars only delayed the inevitable - 15th century Ming populations were around 120-130million, and the Qing began their reign over a population of roughly 150million. from 1650-1800 this population as much as doubled. That's right, the population of China in 1800 was pretty close to that of the US TODAY. So, lots of people, lots of potential.  

2. Commerce, ingenuity, entrepreneurship.  

China underwent what several economic historians have described as not one, but two commercial revolutions. The first took place under the Song, in the 10th-13th centuries. The Song were the first to successfully use fiat money, which didn't last forever, but still, cash money in the 11th century! One of the other elements of most dynastic governments was low-tax, relatively laisse-faire economic policy. Sure there were occasionally government industries/monopolies, but they were fewer and fewer as time went on. For instance, Ming officials set up a taxation depository for all salt produced in the empire. Salt would pour in to the depots, then would be picked up by private distributors, the government pulling in their tax haul in the process. This was no small endeavor, with all but three provinces producing salt in some form or another at the time.   
Anyway, most industries were small and non-governmental, many un-taxed and/or regulated. What this meant was an explosion, with the population bursts in all three of the last dynasties, of commerce. In the Song, the big new thing was Champa rice, and the big cultural thing was book culture (printing and champa rice were introduced around the same time, at the end of the 10th century). In the Ming, there was the burst of international trade and later, the influx of new world crops. The Qing saw the full flowering of new world crops, and also saw the malthusian rise (to 1800 or so) and fall (1800-1900 crisis) that inevitably followed.   
Throughout all this you have this incredible ingenius flow of new goods and technologies, from mining, to fired goods, to arms and artillery, to paper, household furniture, etc, etc, etc. With low government oversight, and the emergence of national markets for goods, we are talking about lots and lots and lots of diverse ""stuff"" made by lots of diverse people.   
This is the smithian dream. A government that focuses on infrastructure, and low-targetted taxation. An economy dominated by small businesses with national market outlook. Pretty incredible.   
Anyway, that leads us to the last 113 years. What happened to China that we think the last 30 are anomolous?    
Well, there was the major crisis of about 1840-1950 - loss of crops, wars, famine, bad policy, lost wars with Britain and Japan, several times, etc, etc, etc. Then there was some upsurge, quickly knocked to the side by Mao and the great leap. This caused the famine that informed all of our opinions about china who grew up in the 60's-80's - poor, starving china.   
But then a funny thing happened - the party decided to revert to dynastic economic practices, to a certain extent. They unleashed the economic forces that lay dormant for almost two generations. The result - you guessed it - lots and lots of stuff!",null,1,cdl59wp,1r9wht,askhistorians,top_week,4

2) I think to a considerable degree the reverse is true. A living person is guaranteed a certain minimal level of scrutiny and care, while a person dead, especially long dead, can be used to tell whatever story you're trying to tell, regardless of the exact facts of his life.

3) Sometimes a person can have so many secrets that it might be safer to write a ""true"" history of them later, without fears of repercussions. So there might indeed be a chilling effect of litigation and prosecution that people would try to avoid. But the problems of looking back through time in my opinion are more severe than that. And in the digital age anonymous publication should not be a problem. 

4) It definitely has had an effect. As a teacher I was often conscious that my statements should not be too controversial, regardless of what I believed. But political interpretations way heavy on some events of the past as well. Topics like the holocaust, crusades, labor union movement, in the US the Civil War are as capable of stirring up political controversy as the life of a living figure like George Bush.

Domini_canes,"This may not be the type of response you're looking for, but your inquiry reminded me of a moment from my undergrad years.  My professor, a Dominican priest, was discussing the canonization process.  He said that the Church waits to start the process until the subject is ""safely dead.""  So, he was approaching the topic from a bit of a different angle.  Basically, their legacy could not be determined until they had no more opportunities to screw up.  

Personally, I have never really been concerned about ""objectivity.""  Basically, since we are each raised in a particular culture, we have certain cultural ""blinders"" that are nearly impossible to remove.  Even if we could, you can't be able to look at a subject with *all* of the viewpoints possible.  My view is that disclosed backgrounds and biases is the way to go.

rosemary85,"Here I was imagining Ambarenya was going to answer this... and then I see you're the one that posted it!

To get a *really* authoritative answer to this you'd probably need to ask someone like Geoff Horrocks directly. Until I started reading up on this question, my understanding had been that from late antiquity onwards, the phonology of Greek was essentially the same as Modern Greek. That would make 

* κατάφρακτοι = ka-TA-frak-tee

* Ῥωμαίοι = ro-MEH-ee

But for each diphthong, it turns out, you need to do a separate check to see how and when its pronunciation changed. Allen's *Vox Graeca* has this to say about οι (p. 77):

&gt; **οι** &amp;nbsp; Here also a diphthongal pronunciation is clearly indicated at least until Roman times... At a later date οι became confused with υ; thus (c. 240 AD) ποιανεψιωνα = πυαν[εψιωνα], indicating a pronunciation [ū] for both...

This reduces the question to how υ was pronounced in any given period. At p. 64 Allen tells us that confusion between υ and ι started fairly early on -- they were already confused in Indo-Greek coins by the 2nd century BCE (but only because Indo-Aryan didn't have a rounded front vowel), and even in the 4th cent. BCE we find ἥμυσυ for ἥμισυ in one inscription. But he finds these to be isolated cases, and concludes that υ was still not fully equivalent to ι until at least after the 4th cent. CE (because Wulfila/Ulfilas was still using y to transliterate Greek υ at that date). He goes on (p. 65)

&gt; Confusion of υ with ι is first occasionally found in Egyptian papyri of the 2-3 c. AD, but this is probably a regional peculiarity; and the eventual change of [ü] to [i] seems not to be general until around the end of the millennium. The Byzantine naming of the letter as ὗ ψιλόν still suggests a pronunciation [ü]; for ψιλός is commonly used by Byzantine writers as the opposed term to δίφθογγος, and so in this case to distinguish the spelling υ from οι (which had come to have the same phonetic value: cf. p. 76 on ἒ ψιλόν), and not from ι.

So the upshot seems to be that, perhaps until the time of Photios or thereabouts, οι was pronounced identically to υ; **but** both were still distinguished from ι. That is, ι was unrounded, but οι/υ was still at least somewhat rounded.

**Edit.** I've taken a look at Horrocks' *Greek: a history of the language*, and he's in good agreement with Allen (though his book is a lot harder to find your way around, because it's arranged chronologically rather than by topic). At p. 168 he mentions in passing the merger of οι and υ in the Roman era, and at p. 274 he writes

&gt; The shift of /y/ &gt; /i/, already apparent in some substandard varieties in the ancient world, was probably completed for all speakers of mainstream dialects by the 10th/11th century (see Macharadze (1980) for the evidence of Georgian loans, and cf. Browning (1983: 56-7)). The major exception is provided by Tsakonian...

**Edit 2.** The above only deals with one part of your question, of course. Can I leave it to you to look at the books I mentioned for the other points? In particular I'll mention that the phonetic value of β in Byzantine Greek is a bit hazy: it was used to transcribe Latin *b*, of course, but sometimes also *v* (e.g. Malalas is already writing Vergil's name as Βεργίλλιος by the 6th century; cf. Οὐαλέριος for *Valerius*; perhaps this really reflects variance in the Latin pronunciation of *v*, though). I don't know when it lost the value /b/ (in Modern Greek /b/ is usually represented by μπ).",null,2,cdl4kra,1ra00f,askhistorians,top_week,10

Last names were frequently derived from peoples professions.

archaeontologist,"The huge stores (Target, Walmart, etc.) that we all know and love today are the offspring of the department store, which as a phenomena really began to appear in Great Britain, France, and the United States in the 1840s and 50s. 

Huge stores need both 1) relatively cheap, mass produced goods to fill them and 2) a growing social class with the means and patterns of consumption to support them. The first of these requirements was enabled by the industrial revolution and novel technologies for producing and distributing goods at remarkable paces/prices. The second is a result of the rising bourgeois society of mid-19th c. Western Europe, a class whose disposable income and consumption habits (concerned not only with necessity but also with fashion &amp; novelty) enabled the 'retail revolution' of the department stores.

Thus the rise of the department store was both an economic and a social development beginning in the mid-19th century, centered around W. Europe's new practices of production, distribution and consumption. That's about all I know - I wish I could tell you more, as it's a really fascinating subject.

I can, however, recommend a work of fiction that can give you insight into this period:

* Émile Zola, *The Ladies' Paradise* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992).

This novel, published in 1883, is a story of commercial triumph chronicling just this topic - the rise of the Parisian department store. Zola is well known today for his more political naturalist works (on coal miners, etc.) and his role in the Dreyfus affair. However, this lesser-known novel has recently gained a healthy amount of attention for its depictions of consumer capitalism and bourgeois life in the mid-19th century - this latest edition from the University of California Press has a fantastic introduction written by Kristin Ross, the literary critic and French cultural historian (also, the author of the excellent *The Emergence of Social Space: Rimbaud and the Paris Commune* and *Fast Cars, Clean Bodies: Decolonization and the Reordering of French Culture*, both of which I thoroughly recommend).

Despite the upper comment having over 500 karma, it misses the deeply ideological justification of Napoleon's exile, and the subsequent implications that had on the development of both Europe and France in the 19th Century.

Quite frankly, Napoleon was exiled because the execution of monarchs was taboo. Exile was the most common form of punishment for aristocrats since the Middle Ages, simply because it avoided the messy political problems of having to kill someone important. Galvanizing any resistance movement, creating a martyr, establishing a dangerous precedent, etc. However both of Napoleon's exiles mark a diversion from the surety with which this taboo was enforced. Improved technology and increased speeds of communication had begun to invalidate the distance, and thus security and effectiveness, provided through exile.

In the case of Napoleon this is an especially important note because his exile is a tacit admission of his status and clout. However it is always a controversial topic because he technically *was not* a noble by birth or blood, and *could* have been killed like any other insurrectionary leader. However he *was* crowned emperor by the Pope. So it leads into understandably complex waters about his political status, and whether or not he meets the requisite protections of the ruling status-quo.

In deciding his fate, the Congress of Vienna was very conscious of the implications that his legacy would have upon the development of France, so recently removed from their Revolutionary Spirit of the 1790's. They ultimately decided to try and avoid making Napoleon into a martyr, and exiled him. In doing so, however, the European nations essentially reaffirmed the values of meritocracy by which Napoleon rose to the title of Emperor when they treated him as an equal instead of as a low-born peasant.

intangible-tangerine,"The word for Iran and Iranians inside Iran itself has been Iran and Iranian or variations thereof such as Arya, Iranshah or Aryānām at least since the time of the collation of the Zorastrian Avesta texts, dated roughly between the 2nd and 6th centuries BC.

Which was a lie concerning the military, but true regarding food and raw materials. Generally, most people in Sweden expected a repetition of ww1, which had left the Nordic countries (with exception of Finland towards the end) untouched. The problems facing Sweden then had been the British blockade, a lack of food and raw materials creating hunger and unemployment, combined with a political fight for universal suffrage and parliamentarism that almost ended up in a revolution 1917.

1939, the situation was much better. The framework of neutral shipping through the blockade had been agreed upon with both the British and the Germans, and a small number of merchant vessels, 459 in total, were allowed through, bringing in much needed meat and grain (from Canada, USA, Brazil and Argentina primarily), oil (from Venezuela) and a small amount of tobacco (from USA) and some other goods. 10 ships were sunk by both sides, mostly by mines during this traffic. There were also large stockpiles of food, raw materials and other goods in storage in Sweden.

Malmö was (and is) the 3rd largest city of Sweden and an industrial and economical centre. Malmö was also the centre of the fledgling (and pretty pathetic) Swedish nazi movement. Gunnar Sträng, social democrat and future Minister of Finance recounts meeting a bunch of nazis at a hotel, and noting that when making death lists (while rowdy and quite drunk) prominent social democrats ended up on the list AFTER prominent nazis of the competing party. The various nazi groups gathered 0,7% of the vote 1936, which was the best result they managed to get. Generally, the city was dominated by the social democrats.

Generally, the Swedes never forgave the Germans for their invasion of Denmark and Norway, and the willingness to defend the country against a German invasion was very high.

The rationing was hard during the war, and dropped to its lowest point in autumn 1942, when it consisted of;

Per day allowance;

22g meat and pork.

67g sugar.

4g cheese.

36g fat (oil, butter, cream etc).

3g coffee.

170g flour.

One also gets 8 eggs per month.

Vegetables, milk (3% fat), potatoes, wild game, fish, fruit and berries were never rationed. However, vegetables are impossible to get out of season, and mostly consists of what can be grown locally - turnips, cabbage and carrots, with some cucumbers and tomatoes thrown in. Milk and potatoes are readily available. Wild game is only available during the hunting season, and in limited supply - you had to know a hunter to get any. Fish was available as long as the sea was open (which was 8-10 months a year, depending on if you were in the Baltic or North Sea and which of the hard war winters it was) and you were reasonable close to the coast. Fruit was available during the season, and only locally grown - mostly pears and apples, but also some cherries. Berries you had to pick yourself in season.

Scania would have decent access to Baltic fish and to fruit (pear and apple orchards are common), but far less wild game and berries than other parts of the country. ""Non-coupon"" food became common. Eating badger, fox or crow stew at the restaurant (since it counted as wild game and was not rationed) was not uncommon.

Having a friend at a farm could allow you to buy meat and other food that had been sneaked away from the ration system - the black market thrived. There were also a substantial market for trading rations - thsoe that did not smoke often traded away their tobacco ration to those that did, for clothes, food, coffee or other rations.

All rubber and petroleum products were reserved for the military, and most cars were confined to storage. Some ran their cars on produced gas, burning charcoal and using wooden tires. So did much of the army, and the air force ran its older planes on a 85% ethanol 15% gasoline mix and castor oil for lubrication. I have met a ground technician who worked on the light bombers running this mix, and he stated that the castor oil fermented in the hot engine and smelled so bad the pilots puked in the cockpit. His laconic statement was ""Those planes were no fun to work on.""

Alcohol was rationed since before the war. A man could get up to 1 litre of *brännvin* (vodka) per month, Weak beer (3,5%) could be had at shops or restaurants, while stronger beer was only available by doctor's note from a drugstore. At a restaurant, one could only have strong spirits with food, ""two whites and a brown"" which meant two 5cl vodka shots and 5cl of cognac with the coffee. ""Weak grog"" was also available, 3cl of vodka or cognac mixed with 33cl of soft drink or fizzy water, max two per visit. It was common to send the food, called the ""paragraph sandwhich"" back and get the money back after ordering. It is said the same portion of food could be served hundreds of times during one evening. Women had half the ration on everything compared to men.

People biked and walked far more, and the city was under curfew, or blackdown, meaning that accidents were more common. Crime also went up.

Socially, it was a time of upheaval. The unemployment which had existed before the war dissapeared practically overnight. To replace coal and coke, which could only be had in limited supply from Germany (as opposed to liberal and cheap from Britain before the war) charcoal was made in enormous quantities, and the cities filled up with large piles of firewood - armies of men and regiments of women (to handle cooking and cleaning for a work team) travelled to the forests to cut down the trees needed for this. Large amounts of men were called into the army - In May 1940, 400 000 men were in the field, in September 1943, 300 000. The army never had less than 100 000 men called in during any time of the war. Add local defence meets (small exersises for the older soldiers), home guard training and the requirements of the military for production, and the civilian market suddenly experienced a lack of labour.

House servants had been common before the war, paying a miniscule pay and providing food and boarding were enough to have several young girls applying for a maid position. However, with *Lottakåren*, the women's auxiliary services, regular work with the men absent, office work with the huge administration around rationing etc, young women could find other positions. House servants pretty much disappeared during the war, and never really returned afterwards.

Another group that pretty much ceased to be during the war was *statare*, a position of farm labourer where the pay was had in goods from the farm, where contracts were signed for a year. Generally, these people could not save up, had deplorable living conditions and only a single week per year to switch estate at which they were employed - with the lack of savings, this was usually impossible, making this position eerily like that of a serf. However, during the war other jobs were available and when paying in produce was forbidden in 1945, the group had already almost ceased to exist, with many of them movin gto the cities to take jobs in the industry or to the forests to work with lumber (both of which was paid in money).

A Malmö citizen would most likely serve in one of the local regiments, I6 Norra Skånska Regementet (infantry), I7 Södra Skånska Regementet (infantry), A3 Wendes Artilleriregemente (artillery), A10M/Lv4 Skånska Luftvärnskåren (anti-aircraft), F10 Kungliga Skånska Flygflottiljen (fighters) were all part of the Scanian local regiments. If he was older than 47, he would serve in the local defence, and probably man one of the 1 063 bunkers of the 500km long Per-Albin Line that protected coast of Scania (which mostly was soft sand beaches suitable for a landing). He could also serve at one of the emplaced batteries (Batteri Helsingborg, Batteri Viken, Batteri Trelleborg and Batteri Ystad, each with 4x21cm guns). People with work vital to the war effort (such as on the railroads, the tank factory at Landskrona, ammunition factory etc) would not be called up after their initial conscription, but rather placed in the local Home Guard at their place of work.",null,4,cdm1c3n,1racc5,askhistorians,top_week,12
PapaInfidel,"Malmö was hit by three bombs on October 3, 1940. At the time it was unknown which nation had launched the attack. The Magazine ""Sydsvenska Dagbladet"" made the conclusion that it was Allied, based on flyers containing ""Anti-german text in English"". Meanwhile, Försvarsstabens luftförsvarsavdeling (Air Defence department of the Swedish defence forces) named it ""unknown aircraft"". It was subsequently discovered that Britain was behind these bombings, and the aircraft was Whitley-Bombers.

His health was good, for though indulging in every kind of riotous excess, he was ill but three times in all during the fourteen years of his reign, and even then not enough to give up wine or any of his usual habits. He was utterly shameless in the care of his person and in his dress, always having his hair arranged in tiers of curls, and during the trip to Greece also letting it grow long and hang down behind; and he often appeared in public in a dining-robe, with a handkerchief bound about his neck, ungirt and unshod.""

white_light-king,"Navigation, meaning specifically finding where you are and how to get where you want to go, at sea was rather difficult, but the ""book learning"" involved in navigation wasn't extensive.  You might think of 18th century navigation as having three skill groups:

1) Book learning, which would comprise the ability to read, ability to do arithmetic, geometry and a specific subset called spherical trigonometry used for celestial navigation.

2) Practical techniques for navigation.  How to take a sun or star sighting (to determine latitude) how to measure speed with a log line.  How to read a nautical chart, and how to make one, etc.  

3) Seamanship, understanding currents, leeway, weather, how the sea and land interact and so forth.  This would help a navigator estimate how much error could be introduced into his navigation from real world stuff.

James Cook went to sea as a teenager in colliers (ships that carry coal off the English and Scottish coast.)  I believe before he went to see he had already received enough education to read and do arithmetic.  He spent five or more years picking up the practical elements of navigation (points 2 and 3.)  Picking up the book learning was relatively easy given Cook's interest and aptitude because it's not really all that much math.  In modern times it's basically just what we call ""high school math.""  In the 18th century it wasn't often taught as a matter of routine, so it'd require a self-motivated, curious student who could afford the books and had the spare time.

So to sum up, the book learning part is relatively easy if you had a basic early education.  The practical techniques are relatively easy and would be taught to promising sailors routinely as an apprenticeship.  But mastery requires a good amount of experience of all the things that can go wrong At Sea.  This would be difficult to acquire except by long time spent sailing in varied and sometimes hostile conditions.",null,2,cdl9r22,1ral9v,askhistorians,top_week,7

dolan0,"Her position only makes sense when you consider the circumstances that the French were in; when they turned to Jeanne, they were essentially out of ideas. Turning to her was either an act of desperate faith, or a last-ditch effort to improve morale by turning the conflict into a religious war. Even then, with their backs against the wall, the French nobility proceeded very cautiously.

Her claim of divine guidance, and the miraculous stories associated with her, garnered a great deal of support among the peasantry. After being rebuffed by the royal court several times, she impressed a couple minor nobles who got her an audience with a count, at which she correctly predicted the outcome of the Battle of the Herrings. That scored her an audience with the Dauphin, who sent her to be examined by the religious authorities (if she proved heretical, the political fallout would have been disastrous.)

With a clean bill of orthodoxy, they sent her to the Siege of Orleans, which proved to be the turning point of the war. Historians disagree about her actual command role, but as a symbol, she was certainly important.

Qweniden,"Lets look at wine first:

Wine for most of history was not ""aged"" per se.  Though there were some exceptions, the goal for most producers of wine were to get the product to market and sold before the harvest of the next year.  This is because before the advent of the combination of the glass bottle, a cork stopper and sulfites as a preservative wine would simply spoil within a year.  So aging was a bad thing for most of wine's history.

In the 18th century the above mentioned technological advances all came together and people (particularly the British) started developing a taste for aged wine.  But it was the consumer who would age the wine after purchasing so that there were no large capital costs borne by the growers or middlemen merchants.

So TLDR: growers and merchants did not have to age the product when that style was desirable/possible. It was the consumer who would age their own wines.

Whiskey:

As popular tastes transformed and the consumers wanted whiskeys that gained the flavors, colors and concentration that barrel aging brings there was already an existing base of manufactures that were turning out whiskeys to be drank young.  Since they were existing companies backed by wealthy families with cashflow already coming in it would not have been too difficult to capitalize the aging process.  When distilleries did need more capital than they could get via sales-driven cash flow there would have been banks to lend the money for operating costs just like any business would have access to.

Initially scottish whisky was drunk straight from the distillery and the law passed in late 19th century that stated that whisky had to be aged, was meant to check the widespread alcoholism in the region. 

The beneficial effects of aging whisky (improving taste and diminishing strength) had been noted before but it wasn't (just as you intimated) thought economically viable to do it, and many smaller distilleries that lacked financial backing *did* go out of business as a result of the passing of that law.

I don't believe its truly possible to definitively state that any single course of action would have been planned and followed through had Hitler been taken alive. While the Moscow Declaration of 1943 did state that punishment for crimes with no specific geographic locale would be handled jointly by the Allied powers, this could be open to interpretation. As the Red Army reached Berlin significantly before the other Allied powers, if Hitler we're alive he would have surely been under Soviet custody. Whether Stalin would claim that the extreme Soviet losses in the course of the war gave a specific geographic locale for (many of) Hitler's crimes and thus allowed themselves to take charge in meting out punishment is a highly likely possibility, it cannot be positively concluded. 

As for what the specific punishment would have been, as I previously mentioned the thoughts of the Allied leadership on the matter of general post-victory punishment shifted as the war progressed and concluded. There was disagreement over how to punish Nazis generally upon the war's conclusion at the Tehran Conference in 1943. The intent of Stalin (who would have had custody of Hitler) at the conference can be seen in his suggestion to simply summarily execute roughly 50,000 German officers. A simple summary execution (whether under official Red Army auspices or more akin to the fate of Muammar Gaddafi), is certainly one likely possibility. Although the other Allied leaders were somewhat less bloodthirsty than Stalin in their thinking regarding the punishment of Nazi leadership, immediately executing Hitler and definitely ending the war in Europe is a likely scenario.

On the note of trials, it is highly unlikely that Hitler would have been prosecuted by the German people. The judiciary of Germany was comprised just about exclusively of Nazi party members. The only Germans who could even theoretically prosecute Hitler somewhat reliably would have been those with communist leanings, which simply puts the ball into Stalin's court regardless. Were a trial to be held under strictly Soviet custody, there is absolutely no doubt that the event would be a show trial in Moscow leading to inevitable execution. If Stalin were instead to abide by the previous arrangement for joint decision making on the punishment of Nazi leadership, Hitler would have been tried jointly by the Allies at Nuremburg or potentially separately at a unique trial for himself alone. It should be noted that, essentially, all roads lead to execution. Any plans for the Denazification of Germany would have been seriously hampered by Hitler still being alive.

According to the Geneva Convention, the repatriation of POWs was to commence as soon as hostilities came to an end. In practice, however, this rarely happened. In many cases, Germans remained in Canada until 1946, and some even later. Withholding repatriation acted as a form of political leverage for Canada--and I would argue this is the case for other states, too.

1. Do the Great Purges have a primarily psychological and personal explanation, stemming from Stalin's paranoia?

2. Were the stated reasons for the Purges, combatting various military and/or capitalist conspiracies against the USSR or against Communism, the genuine motivation?

There is quite a bit of debate on #1, but pretty much no debate on #2 (nobody seriously believes the official charges were anything but invented).

On #1, though, one can distinguish something like three positions (possibly more), and there is some shift in their relative strengths since the 1970s or so. A decent capsule summary of the (fairly large) literature can be found in Alex Bellamy's *Massacres and Morality: Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity*, starting on p. 106. A first-person account of the post-1970s developments can be found in Sheila Fitzpatrick's article ""Revisionism in Soviet History"", *History and Theory* 46(4): 77-91.

The first view is the one you allude to: that it was indeed primarily Stalin's personal paranoia leading him to attempt to liquidate any perceived threat or alternative source of power. In this view, it was primarily a top-down affair coordinated by Stalin, a series of irrational violent rages and seeing plots behind every corner. A second view is that it was indeed mainly planned by Stalin, but for more deliberate, rational, and less psychological reasons: this view holds that Stalin viewed terror as a key tool in building the industrial state, maintaining order, and maintaining his control over the party. Among Soviet dissidents, Roy Medvedev and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn are classic exponents of these two views: Medvedev ascribed Stalinism in large part to Stalin's personal paranoia, while Solzhenitsyn instead saw Stalin as a coldly rational, methodical planner of totalitarianism.

Against those two classic views—Stalin the paranoid madman, and Stalin the ruthless dictator—a third view has gained more prominence among historians since the 1970s ""revisionist"" [1] work of Sheila Fitzpatrick, Moshe Lewin, etc. It argues that there was not one single phenomenon, but rather a number of different events with somewhat different explanations, and somewhat downplays the omnipotent/omniscient role of Stalin (though only somewhat, as he clearly had enormous power). For one thing, this school sees the show-trial purges of Old Bolsheviks, and the much larger liquidations and deportations of mass populations such as the Ukrainians and the kulaks, as considerably different phenomena, and also tends to emphasize the role of social and bureaucratic forces in the latter. This group of historians tend to see Stalin as a bit less cynical, perhaps, and more interested in actually strengthening the USSR—not against the actually stated conspiracies, but against Stalin's and the bureaucracy's view of weaknesses in the system that could be corrected. Hence the purge of the Old Bolsheviks is seen by Fitzpatrick as, in part, a genuine attempt to replace old idealist revolutionaries with a new generation of scientifically trained cadres trained in the Soviet academies. And both Lewin and Fitzpatrick see many of the mass liquidations and deportations as attempts to reshape Soviet society by simply ruthlessly removing elements that didn't seem to fit into its vision.

In short: nobody really doubts that the various conspiracies were invented pretexts to carry out purges, but whether the real motivation for these purges was Stalin's paranoia, or something else, is more debated.

[1] ""Revisionist"" in the study of Stalinism just means revising the pre-1970s understanding, not necessarily defending Stalin (Lewin in particular is vociferously anti-Stalin, but thinks previous historians were anti-Stalin for the wrong reasons).",null,2,cdlrv4d,1razkx,askhistorians,top_week,14

On #1, though, one can distinguish something like three positions (possibly more), and there is some shift in their relative strengths since the 1970s or so. A decent capsule summary of the (fairly large) literature can be found in Alex Bellamy's *Massacres and Morality: Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity*, starting on p. 106. A first-person account of the post-1970s developments can be found in Sheila Fitzpatrick's article ""Revisionism in Soviet History"", *History and Theory* 46(4): 77-91.

The first view is the one you allude to: that it was indeed primarily Stalin's personal paranoia leading him to attempt to liquidate any perceived threat or alternative source of power. In this view, it was primarily a top-down affair coordinated by Stalin, a series of irrational violent rages and seeing plots behind every corner. A second view is that it was indeed mainly planned by Stalin, but for more deliberate, rational, and less psychological reasons: this view holds that Stalin viewed terror as a key tool in building the industrial state, maintaining order, and maintaining his control over the party. Among Soviet dissidents, Roy Medvedev and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn are classic exponents of these two views: Medvedev ascribed Stalinism in large part to Stalin's personal paranoia, while Solzhenitsyn instead saw Stalin as a coldly rational, methodical planner of totalitarianism.

Against those two classic views—Stalin the paranoid madman, and Stalin the ruthless dictator—a third view has gained more prominence among historians since the 1970s ""revisionist"" [1] work of Sheila Fitzpatrick, Moshe Lewin, etc. It argues that there was not one single phenomenon, but rather a number of different events with somewhat different explanations, and somewhat downplays the omnipotent/omniscient role of Stalin (though only somewhat, as he clearly had enormous power). For one thing, this school sees the show-trial purges of Old Bolsheviks, and the much larger liquidations and deportations of mass populations such as the Ukrainians and the kulaks, as considerably different phenomena, and also tends to emphasize the role of social and bureaucratic forces in the latter. This group of historians tend to see Stalin as a bit less cynical, perhaps, and more interested in actually strengthening the USSR—not against the actually stated conspiracies, but against Stalin's and the bureaucracy's view of weaknesses in the system that could be corrected. Hence the purge of the Old Bolsheviks is seen by Fitzpatrick as, in part, a genuine attempt to replace old idealist revolutionaries with a new generation of scientifically trained cadres trained in the Soviet academies. And both Lewin and Fitzpatrick see many of the mass liquidations and deportations as attempts to reshape Soviet society by simply ruthlessly removing elements that didn't seem to fit into its vision.

In short: nobody really doubts that the various conspiracies were invented pretexts to carry out purges, but whether the real motivation for these purges was Stalin's paranoia, or something else, is more debated.

[1] ""Revisionist"" in the study of Stalinism just means revising the pre-1970s understanding, not necessarily defending Stalin (Lewin in particular is vociferously anti-Stalin, but thinks previous historians were anti-Stalin for the wrong reasons).",null,2,cdlrv4d,1razkx,askhistorians,top_week,14

bitparity,"Reddit tends to go through phases with regards to ""The Dark Ages"", depending upon what political point you're trying to make with that period (which itself is a microcosm with how ""The Dark Ages"" is wielded in actual academic historiography).  I think I saw a recent /r/atheism post where they were actively trying to revive that term for... reasons that are rather obvious (Christianity leading to ignorance, etc.).  On the opposing side, people also take the tack of Cracked.com, which enjoys a certain contrarian streak in some of their articles with the whole ""the real truth behind X"", thus the idea of ""the dark ages as not dark at all.""

Professionally, ""The Dark Ages"" is not used to define the era historiographically.  However, that does not stop that term from being used academically, even if for no other purpose than as a frame of reference that the historians are seeking to clarify.  A good example being famed historian John Haldon describing the most chaotic period of Byzantine history: 

*""The seventh century (in Byzantium), traditionally, belongs to the 'Dark Ages', in the fullest sense of the phrase, a period when both the sources available to the historian are fewer than in earlier or later times, and when the exigencies of the struggle to survive made the production of a widely based secular literature both less relevant to the cultural identity of the dominant elite and subordinate to the demand for political and theological certainties.""*

You'll notice despite the fact Haldon puts ""Dark Ages"" in quotes, it's still usefully illustrative of his point. 

In many ways, its similar to the nomenclature of ""byzantine/roman empire"".  Is it misleading?  Is it a perjorative or a useful categorization?  As well, both of these terms are argued fiercely in both the academic and the lay (specifically, the computer wargaming) communities, which is a microcosm of the debate regarding ""how dark were the dark ages?""  

It's true, ""the dark ages"" were not ""as dark"" as traditionally thought.  But as I pointed out in another post, the thoughts on that period of time boil down into 3 statements.

1. The era was as bad as everyone thought it was.
2. The era wasn't as bad as everyone thought it was.
3. The era wasn't bad at all.

You'll notice the one position missing from this list.  ""The era was in fact great for everyone.""  The best that people argue for is a semi-relative neutral position from the late Roman era.  Which should be as good as any indicator that some kind of traumatic transformation occurred in this period.

So given this framing and going back to your question, you're asking if it's wrong to call the period ""The Dark Ages"".

Here's an unsatisfactory answer: You do what you like :)  Ultimately, what matters is you understand why you're using or not using the term.  Are you using it for a convenient shorthand for a particular period in history that everybody knows?  Are you trying to indicate your belief in that period as one of socio-economic and technological regression?  Are you NOT using it because you believe that the need to acknowledge the advancements made during that age outweigh the convenience of its use?  And so on.

tl;dr - You call it what you want.  Everyone, including the academics, is still arguing about the fundamental question of that term, ""how dark was it really?""  There is in fact, no answer.  Thus, you do what you want with that term.  Just understand why you use it.  ",null,1,cdlh7mr,1rb1lj,askhistorians,top_week,17
Gadarn,"One of the main problems is that 'dark' is meant as a pejorative term that is not only not helpful - it sets up a damaging connotation - but it isn't very accurate in a number of ways.  There is simply no reason, as historians, to use the term ""Dark Ages"" when we can simply label that same period ""Early Middle Ages"" and avoid making a value judgement.

Beyond that, ""Europe between 450 CE and 1000 CE"" wasn't necessarily ""quite dark compared to the Roman Empire before it"". 3rd century Rome wasn't exactly ideal when it came to political stability - by comparison, many Early Medieval kingdoms/regions were far more 'bright'.

""Dark Ages"" also ignores the learning and cultural 'advancement' taking place. Ireland was a beacon of learning from the 7th century on, and I would argue that the Book of Kells speaks for itself when it comes to the cultural works created during this period. We owe much of our knowledge of Greek and Roman literature to the Carolingians and they were doing their own work too, including attempting the first public school system; hardly simply a ""bright spot"".

So when it comes down to it, it isn't helpful to use a pejorative term to blanket such a large period that simply can't be described in such a way. It is much more useful for historians to use more neutral language that ensures the reader isn't making a value judgement right from the start.",null,1,cdlgi27,1rb1lj,askhistorians,top_week,12
TheVitruvianDan,"I had Faramerz Dabhoiwala as a tutor last year and he was in the middle of a huge tour promoting his book The Origins of Sex in which he explores differing conceptions of this kind of stuff over time. One of his points was that in the Middle Ages in England female and male bodies were seen as the inverse of each other (ie the ovaries were internal testes, the vagina an inverted penis). Tied to this was the belief that therefore, just as a man had to orgasm to release semen, in order to conceive a woman had to reach orgasm. This was problematic in cases of rape obviously as if the woman fell pregnant it was assumed she enjoyed it

How this changes later on is less clear but it seems that eventually the opposite view came to be held - women were entirely different from men and consequently there was no reason to assume that they even COULD orgasm. And certainly that they shouldn't.

This is a very general outline of Dabhoiwala's views (I was not actually studying this topic and this came from conversations with him) nor do I know how accepted they are. I recommend you find his book and read that.",null,0,cdltepy,1rb290,askhistorians,top_week,3
young_dick,"I will only answer part of your question from what knowledge I have.  My family has resided in far eastern Kentucky for over two hundred years.  They fought on both sides for very similar reasons really.  The reason the people in my family joined the army wasn't because slavery, taxation, or a crooked election.  In these small back woods towns there were no large plantations only family farms. Most of these people lived in object poverty so having the option to buy a slave was impossible.  As for the elections Appalachia has a history of mistrust of the government in general, they are clannish, and self sufficient people.  Many did not or could not travel the miles into town to participate in elections even if they could they were ill informed. So this mattered little to them.  My family and I could assume many others in the Appalachian region fought in the war because of a sense of ""outsiders"" coming into the region.  At the idea of these ides of war and outsiders coming in some men left to fight and defend their homes and towns.  After the war those who returned it was the same they had always lived.  Isolation and poverty.  There were few slaves to be set free because blacks have always been an extreme minority in Appalachia. This is one account and perspective from my family.

fdedio,"I can shed some light on this for World War I.

As both Germany and France were working on war strategies against each other, each had a plan for Switzerland as well.

The French plan was called [Operation H, for Helvetica](http://www.schweizer-festungen.ch/1914-18_ww1.htm#Plan%20H) (link in German).

Germany had a similar plan (for which I can't right now find a reference, my apologies.

However, in 1912, Switzerland hosted German emperor Wilhelm II. for a large-scale army maneuver, called [Kaisermanöver 1912](http://www.derbund.ch/bern/stadt/Grosser-Bahnhof-fuer-den-deutschen-Kaiser/story/15524995?track).

Military planners from other European powers were in attendance as well.

While [Switzerland has a long reputation of providing mercenary troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Guard), its standing army had not been tested in warfare in centuries, and was thus not thought of too highly in Europe.

To the surprise of many, including and especially Emperor Wilhelm, the maneuver was extremely well executed.

Combined with the natural defenses of Switzerland (which, after all, is a very mountainous country, to put it mildly), [and the fortresses that had been built to enhance these](http://bit.ly/1c2X8c3), this impressed foreign military planners so much that pretty much all invasion plans were put on hold, and not carried out afterwards.",null,0,cdly0dx,1rb5q3,askhistorians,top_week,3
pharmaceus,"I think that everyone is addressing the problem from the wrong angle. Switzerland did not emerge as a significantly richer nation until after both World Wars. And the wealth of the country is quite relative - it comes as the result of a high purchasing power of Swiss Franc relative to other currencies. For the length of duration of Bretton Woods agreement (1948-1973) the USD had a much higher purchasing power and thus you get the higher GDP ration. The Swiss franc was considered a much more stable currency - more stable than even the west German Mark - the US Dollar was not so stable as it was considered fundamental for global economy. It was in the most recent years that Switzerland skyrocketed to insane levels of nominal wealth - compared to Norway - but that is all in relative terms. Once you take purchasing power into account it becomes evident that high prices translate to much lower real wealth within the country. Switzerland's riches weren't backed by any significant resource supply or industrial base - the Swiss were simply careful not to waste their wealth and capital away on wars like other countries.  Compare those lists:

**Historical nominal GDP per capita**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_future_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita

in 1960 Switzerland has GDP per capita of approx 1776 USD  while Canada has 2295USD, the US 2880USD and Sweden 1983 USD.  In comparison France has 1320 and UK 1380 - that is not a huge difference for countries devastated by war.

**Historical GDP per region - adjusted for purchasing power**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_PPP

Compare the number between Switzerland, Sweden and  Germany, France, UK starting from 1820. You can clearly see that while both Switzerland and Sweden have a steady growth in GDP other countries have large fluctuations depending on the growth of population (Unification of Germany in 1870) and wars.

To sum things up from strategic standpoint Switzerland is not worth the effort because once you get rid of their relative position in the world economy by invading them you wipe out most of their wealth which in case of Sweden and Switzerland was significantly boosted by their neutrality which allowed for financial and other vulnerable industries to find a safe haven during wartime and shortly afterwards.

WinterWolf77,"The Ottoman Empire's participation in WWI directly caused its dissolution as an empire... but the end of the Ottoman Sultanate as an imperial power was likely an inevitable occurrence as a result of its loss of strength relative to other world powers.  Its total destruction as a political entity occurred in 1922 (after the war) and was done, arguably, because the leader of the Turkish nationalists (Mustafa Kemal Ataturk) just wanted the Ottomans gone.  For this topic, I won't get into the details of Ataturk. In very short and simplified summary, he blamed the Ottomans and Islam for what happened to the Ottoman Empire in World War I.

After the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent/the Lawgiver (1494 - 1566), the Ottoman Empire began to suffer a steady decline (although some historians would have my head off for using that word). A more accurate way to describe Ottoman ""decline"" would be to say that its strength (economic, military, political, etc.) relative to its top competitors (France, Russia, Britain) became weaker and weaker.  In terms of technological, military, and geopolitical impact, European imperial powers began to hugely outpace the Ottomans.

Being outpaced in these fields by another power isn't necessarily a guarantee of a political entity's destruction (the Vatican is a good example, the state of Italy has held a decisive military advantage over the Vatican for a long time, but the Vatican is still around).  However, the Ottomans geopolitical position made them an important target for imperial powers.  Talk to any historian of Russia long enough and they'll eventually tell you about Russia's historical obsession with obtaining a Mediterranean port.  The easiest way for them to do that was to go through the Ottomans. There were numerous other reasons why the Russians and Ottomans clashed almost constantly throughout their history, but this port issue is particularly relevant because it worried France and Britain (who really didn't want another imperial power sailing around the Mediterranean).

The Crimean War (1853-1856) had the Ottomans fighting the Russians again, but with the French and British assisting the Ottomans directly. As long as an imperial tug of war continued between the European imperial wars, the Ottomans served as a useful buffer state (a sad state of affairs compared to the 1500s when they were considered the terror of all Europe).

World War I is hugely significant for the Ottomans because it ended the tug of war.  Russia, France, and Britain found a reason to stand united... and they no longer needed the Ottomans as a buffer state.  The Ottoman government, ruled by a group called ""The Young Turks"", saw WWI as a chance to stop the Empire's steady decline into irrelevance. More desperately, the Ottomans HAD to join Germany. If the Ottomans didn't ally with Germany and beat the Allies, then the Empire was likely to be forcibly dissolved by the Allies.  This is particularly reflected in the failed Gallipoli Campaign (1915 - 1916) of World War I, where the French and British attempted to knock the Ottomans out of the war. Ataturk made a name for himself in this fighting.

Did Ottoman participation in WWI lead to their downfall? Absolutely. This war ended their empire.  But their empire had been coming to an end for some time now.

Astrogator,"What is meaningful dissent and resistance? Where does opposition end, and dissent begin? Where does active resistance start? Is the woman, standing in line at the bakery, telling a joke about Marshal Görings incapacity to protect the Reich from allied air attacks just voicing dissent? Is it an act of defiance and resistance against the regimes claim to totality? What about someone deserting from the Wehrmacht because he disagreed with the regime's aims? What about someone deserting because he was afraid? It's a murky field. It's a field that has been a battleground for German political for a long time. One of our former chancellors, Willy Brandt, was as Herbert Frahm a member of the socialist resistance and the resistance in Norway. This got him branded as a traitor by his political opponents. The deserters from the Wehrmacht (about two 2-300.000 were long denied) official recognition and pardon, and hat to fight the stigma of traitors as well. The members of the ""Rote Kapelle"" resistance group were hailed as heroes in the GDR and the Soviet Union, presented with the 'Hero of the Soviet Union' medal, and unjustly branded as a 5th column from Moscow and forgotten in the west. It's really murky. What is resistance in the face of a regime that has at its core the goal of total control over the private and the political? Or, the other way around, what is not?

There was quite a bit of what one could reasonably call resistance, spanning the whole field from passive opposition to armed resistance. But German resistance faced difficulties the resistance groups in occupied countries did not face. Firstly, resistance meant treason. There was no way around it, and for many that was an obstacle too difficult to overcome. Secondly, there were not only a few Quislings and cooperators, like in occupied countries: there was the majority of the German people that could denounce you, act as informants for the regime, or would oppose you. Thirdly, many of the resistance fighters were complicit in the crimes of the regime as well. This was particularly a problem for the resistance among the officers. Many of them had not only seen the war crimes on the Eastern Front, but hat participated in them in some form. Von Boeselager, for example, was involed in the brutal and inhuman warfare against the partisans in the back of the front. 

That doesn't mean that there was no meaningful resistance. But there was considerably less than in other countries. 

One oft-cited example is the church. Groups like the 'Bekennende Kirche', or the names of Bonhoeffer or Niemöller are well known. But the church was also mainly concerned with keeping the doctrinal and organizational integrity and sovereignty of the church intact in the face of NS encroachment. This was particularly successful in the case of the catholic church, and the regime never managed to get control over the catholic unions and many of their churches. But the catholic church was more interested in a defensive and reactionary defense of their milieu, they were interested in peaceful coexistence with the regime (albeit on their terms), and they were indeed afraid of Bolshevism. 
The resistance that originated from the church was not a platform for the organization of political resistance, and it could not be, that was clear to Bonhoeffer, too. There was of course resistance that was motivated by religious principles, but the church as an organization did not practice political resistance. It was pastors and ministers that acted on their own, like Theophil Wurm with his sermons against the Euthanasia or the murder of the Jews, or Bishop Count von Galen, who was convinced of the duty of the church to resist against a destructive regime, but who didn't find much support for active resistance among his colleagues.

Then there were the Jehovas witnesses, who were probably one of the most practically effective resistance movements. Their members, due to their faith, were opposed to serving in the army, and practiced conscientous objection in the face of the active conscription. And even after their religion was outlawed, they kept practicing, and also kept up a network of information, printing pamphlets and keeping up their organization. Most of them were not broken, not even in the KZs. There were a few other conscientous objectors, who were punished by death, but the Jehovas witnesses were by far the most numerous.

Other religious groups also practiced forms of resistance. The Quakers built up a network to help politically and racially pursued persons, tried to help individual prisoners, by intervention on their behalf with the authorities, or by sending packets, with the support of the American Quakers. The Seventh-Day-church practiced conscientous objection and refused to make the Hitler salute. Individuals like the Mormon Helmut Hübbener practiced religiously motiated resistance on their own. He spread foreign news that he listened to illegally and spread pamphlets to enlighten people about the true character of the NS-regime and the nature of German warfare, imprisoned in 1942. 

All this religious motivated resistance was in general not political in nature, it didn't aim to throw down the regime, but it was an act of defiance against a totalitarian regime that didn't leave them room to practice their faith freely. 

There was also the resistance of youth groups, like the Edelweiß- and Kittelbach-Piraten, the different *Meuten*, the Swing-Youth and so on. Youth resistance is also a difficult field. Youths are notoriously rebellious against authority. This is of course more prominent in an authoritarian context. There is an interesting area of tension there between dissent and consent, between embracing the new ideals of the new man, the cult of masculinity and adventure on the one hand, and the desire for cultural autonomy on the other hand, between not being 'like everybody else'. Some might have just been in it for the music, or the dream of a freer world. 

There was Jewish resistance, many young Jews featured prominently among the communist youth organizations, like the group around Herbert Baum, or the *dj 1.11.* of Helle Hirsch, who planned a bombing of the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg, but was imprisoned and executed. Another Jewish group was the 'Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens' (central union of German citizens of Jewish belief), who put up a defiant propaganda campaign against the defamations of the Regime, 1934 f.e. they published a brochure against the allegations of Jewish ritual murders, tried to help other Jews emigrate and cooperated with the social-democrat Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. Other groups continued circulating and publishing illegal material and pamphlets, trying to leak inormation to the public about the plans of the regime. An estimated 3.000 German Jews were active in the resistance from 1933 to 1945, many of them with communist groups, fighting amongst Titos and the Italian partisans, and participating in other resistance groups in Germany itself.  

There were countless small and individual acts, of individuals hiding and saving one or two Jews (many of whom died during bombings since they couldn't go into the public shelters), alone and independently, of others helping people escape across the border to Switzerland - some did this out of conviction, for strangers, others for close friends, others in turn to make some money off the refugees. There are cases of women protesting in front of the police station until their Jewish husbands were released, of soldiers refusing to participate in executions, of officers refusing to carry out illegal orders, others collecting information about crimes and war crimes. But all these individual acts are hard to generalize, since the motives are so different and personal. 

I've written a lot about the resistance among the communists (and why it so horribly failed), which was numerically the most important the socialists, Georg Elser and last-days resistance [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1muijr/in_wwii_germany_were_there_citizenbased_antinazi/); and about some of the difficulties the military resistance faced [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1n6io3/why_didnt_the_germans_just_shoot_hitler_instead/ccfue9s). 

To reiterate something I wrote earlier on the same topic: As a whole, German Resistance remained fragmented and ineffective throughout the war. And it always remained a small fraction of the population.

I apologize if I have been a bit generalizing here, but I tried to keep it short. If there are any questions, I'd be glad to answer.

peabodygreen,"At the moment I am taking a class on Nazi cultural policy, so I will answer your question to the best of my knowledge from the books I have read.

The laws the Nazis implemented encouraged ""degenerates"" to leave society, so over time many of those that fit that description--Jews, the physically deformed, gypsies--left Germany for countries such as Poland and France. There was not much outright dissent considering these laws affected a select group.

Additionally, the Nazi aesthetic was very alienating and encouraged appreciation for realistic form. Any art that did not fit this was banned. This was done through the Ministry of Propaganda and Public Enlightenment, headed by Goebbels. To combat the increasing laws that barred them from public life, Jewish populations actually created their own organizations that would enable them to continue working and teaching Jewish children. They were confined in certain areas of certain cities. Some sympathizing non-Jews would attend these events of Jewish musicians and Jewish artists to preserve the presence in society, but it was by no means a predominate movement.

Within German society in particular, there wasn't actually a lot of lash against these laws. Hitler was a very popular guy, even if people did make fun of his fervor and humorous mustache. After the Treaty of Versailles, which the German people saw as a reparation for WWI that they did not agree upon, the increasing poverty, and the ceded land they were forced to give up, Hitler was like a breath of fresh air. Yes, the laws were extremely harsh, but many saw them as necessary for the improvement and preservation of German society.

Gadarn,"Crusader Kings basically uses a simplified model of feudal relationships. These ranks and relationships varied between regions/kingdoms but, for the most part, the Crusader Kings model is accurate as long as one remembers that it is just a basic overview.

The system was more complex in a number of ways and, as I mentioned previously, had variations among different kingdoms. It's important to keep in mind that the period that encompasses feudal society (the combination of feudalism and manorialism) lasted centuries and was always changing.

For example, in Anglo-Saxon England (prior to 1066) an Earl was a noble directly below the king but after the Norman conquest the rank of Earl, while continuing to exist, became the equivalent of a Norman count. The first English dukedoms were created 300 years later under Edward III.

Another example of how the medieval system was more complex is the rank of Marquess. A marquess ruled a march, just like a count rules a county, but generally a march was on the borders of the realm so a marquess was trusted to defend the kingdom's borders. As such, a marquess was of higher rank than a count.

We haven't even mentioned knights yet. A knight was lower in rank than all of those from the game that you have mentioned; basically a professional soldier who was granted land by his liege in return for his service. While technically any free man could be granted knighthood, in practice this was very rare, with potential knights singled out in childhood from among the children of existing knights/nobility.

Beyond the simple relationships the game depicts, the description of 12th century English feudalism at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism) has a pretty good description of how complicated the whole thing could get.

Cultures the world over have celebrated the end of the year at the winter solstice, and nearly everyone in the world holds some kind of celebration on the years shortest (or longest) day.

It's a touchy subject to delve too deeply into, without discussing the historical accuracy of religious beliefs. You can measure the movement of the Roman holiday Saturnalia though.

koliano,"Ottoman History is not my field of study, so I'm sure someone else will be able to give a more comprehensive answer, but I can tell you that a key concept in addressing this question is the Millet system.

The Millet system gave a very effective sort of self-government to non-Muslim citizens of the empire. Living in a millet, one would abide by the religious community's own laws, pay taxes to their own representatives, and generally live in peace without interference from the Ottomans, as long as one recognized the political power of the empire- or, depending on where and when you were, the power of the ayans, petty (but sometimes quite powerful) regional lords.

There were millets for Christians of many different types: mostly divisions that skirted the line between sectarian and ethnic: Armenian, Greek, Syrian, etc. The Jews had millets as well, and unfortunately for the minority Muslims, Druze and Shiites and the like, they ended up lumped in with the majority Sunnis.

I have never heard of Pagan millets. That doesn't mean there were no pagans in the Ottoman Empire, just that they weren't numerous and well-organized enough to receive religio-political autonomy.

Thus, while Islam was 'supreme', as in, if your dispute involves a Muslim you have to go through the Islamic legal system and not your millet's, everything still worked pretty well. After all, it had to. The Ottoman Empire was the bridge between the East and the West. It included a mindblowing variety of peoples and religions and cultures.

As for how effective the millet system was, well, one of the funniest quotes from the late, late Imperial period comes from a disgruntled leader of the Greek Orthodox church: responding to the new reforms which sought to establish universal equality regardless of religion. ""The State has made us equal with the Jews. We were satisfied with Muslim superiority."" What this illustrates is that despite living in a state ruled by what was for centuries the wellspring of Islamic authority, non-Muslim communities felt surprisingly comfortable and unrestrained.

As for 'converting people to Islam', you may be referring to the Devşirme system: the process by which mainly Christian youth would be forcibly recruited (or stolen, depending on your perspective) at a young age into the Janissary Order, over time a cadre of elite warriors who became a dominant political force in the Empire.

The system had its ups and downs. Obviously, nobody wants their child to be taken as a glorified slave soldier, on the other hand, the Janissaries were *really, really glorified slave soldiers*. Boys who likely had no chance at being anything other than Balkan peasants would instead have a chance to become politically significant- all the way up to the position of grand vizier.

--- 

Formal answer is *average women survival rate during Stalingrad battle was much higher*. 

Caveat - direct comparison is impossible and incorrect, IMO. You see, women did not serve in USSR infantry as grunts. And that's where the bulk of losses were. They have served in many special or supporting roles though and were critical for Stalingrad defense. 

See my post about 1077th AA regiment. It was instrumental in not letting germans to enter the city on 1st push, got  wiped out in 2 days - but it's not typical at all. It happened only because there was no other forces in vicinity, capable to stop german tanks.

&gt;Any numbers would be fantastic, especially percentages.
---

I am not aware of any gender-specific research of USSR losses at Stalingrad. 

Very difficult to assemble numbers and %%. You'd have to go thru all loss reports (and that's millions of names). Sometimes it's not possible to tell from last name whether it's a woman or man (e.g. *-ko, -yh* suffixes don't reflect a gender, while other common suffixes, like *-ov/-ova, -in/-ina* - do). Loss reports do not mention a gender, just a name and place of birth. Most of women fought but were assigned to special roles (combat medic, signal spc., sniper etc.) in regular 'male' units, not in 'female' units. All-female units were mostly in air force - fighter, bombers. Even pairs of female snipers were attached to male infantry units.

BeondTheGrave,"I assume you are talking about strategic air power (the bombing campaigns of Germany specifically), as opposed to operational or tactical air power. 

And the answer to your question probably the Red Army. Their constant, grinding battle with the German forces occupied over 60% of all German divisions for the entire 41-45 conflict, and most Germans were killed by Soviets, not ""Allies"" (to lump together the Americans, Commonwealths, and other ""westfront-ers"").

The major problem with the Strategic Bombing campaigns is a question of how useful were they? The main aim of the bombing campaigns (especially the American ones, the British focused primarily on De-housing) was to grind the German economy to a halt. This was mainly accomplished  by first destroying *all* factories, but then transitioned to destroy ""bottleneck"" factories. These would be places that produced goods critical for all other industries, like ball bearings. Cut off the ball bearings, and everything from tank turrets to plane engines to heavy machinery grinds to a halt right? Wrong. It was discovered that the German economy had the annoying tendency to decentralize, distribute, and regenerate otherwise destroyed production. And this regularly happened so quickly that the German economy (or war effort) never ground to any serious halt. While there were certainly disruptions, the German economy regularly produced more weapons, and in greater numbers, than it had previously. So the American strategy of economic destruction generally failed. 

But then we need to Ploesti and oil. In 1943 the Americans began to bomb the Ploesti oil field in Romania. This was the major oil supplier for Nazi Germany. By 1944 the Americans had shifted their major focus to attacking oil refineries, and oil production (as a part of the bottleneck strategy). Aside from a brief respite during the transportation bombing phase of Operation Overlord, the Americans kept up series pressure on both Ploesti and the German oil refineries. This had a massive effect on German oil production, and by 1945 they were experiencing major shortages. So the Strategic bombing campaign had a tremendous effect on Germany. The problem was, it took a really long time, and nobody realized what worked until it was already over. 

But by 1945, (even by 1943) the Red Army had already won the war. It was merely a question of what the world would look like afterwards. On the other hand, the Bombing Campaigns did distract a major amount of *Luftwaffe* squadrons and flak batteries (remember that that dreaded 88mm was originally a flak gun. Imagine how Germany would have fared if more of them were in Tigers, instead of guarding Germany's skies. On top of that, keep in mind that Germany had basically stripped the Eastern Front of aviation by 1943, with most of its fighters going to defend the against bomber raids. This gave the Soviet air arm air superiority). So its a really complicated issue, and requires a lot of hair splitting and debate on what was really important. If I had to come down on one side or another (to solve your debate) Id say the Red Army, but thats what kind of guy I am. But that is not to discount the impact of the air campaigns against Germany.

Georgy_K_Zhukov,"Baseball evolved over much of the 19th century, but if you want to pick any one point of ""origination"", the American Civil War is where what we think of as baseball really started to appear.

Bat and ball games had been around for ages, being played in Great Britain for centuries, and they no doubt came to America from there. Cricket, baseball and rounders all have their origins somewhere back there.

Now, with baseball specifically we start to see regional variations that kind of, sort of resemble baseball being played in America in the first half of the 19th century. The Knickerbocker rules - which date to 1845 - were the dominant set of rules being played in the area of New York, but they were by no means the only set of rules. The game would be kind of recognizable to a modern observer, but rules such as making an out on a catch after one bounce would be pretty weird now. It also lacked 'balls', although three strikes was a rule.

Now, as I said, the Civil War was a key component of the rise of baseball. When the war started, hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers from all other the country found themselves camped together and with a lot of downtime. Baseball became an exceptionally popular game for them, and with New Yorkers everywhere, the Knickerbocker rules found themselves to be the most popular used, essentially becoming the de facto rules for Union Army baseball. When the war ended and the Army disbanded most of its men, soldiers headed home, bringing with them either a new game, or else a new set of rules for one they had already played.

In the wake of the war, amateur athletic clubs started sprouting up all over, and within only a few years, the first Professional club was founded in Cincinnati, in 1869. More clubs followed, and in 1876, the National League was founded (It was not the first league though, as there had been a pre-war association, the NABBP, that governed amateur clubs in the New York Area). The rules continued to evolve beyond that point - [here is a handy list](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rulechng.shtml) - but by 1889 or so (with the introduction of 'four balls'.

[Many people like to draw parallels between the two](http://www.a-rccf.org/exhibitions.html), both being Emancipators, and both meeting their death by assassination (although for different reasons). Now, that being said, there is zero reason to believe one actually had any influence on the other's actions in this regard. Alexander II began the process of liberating the Serfs in March of 1861, before Lincoln had even been inaugurated, and before it was known just what he was going to end up doing in regards to the slaves (While he was privately opposed, his public position was to stop the further spread of it, not totally abolish it in one fell swoop), and the Emancipation Proclamation was a reaction to the situation of the war, not something Lincoln could have passed in peacetime.

Broadly speaking, the idea of Western exceptionalism hinges on an outdated Whiggish historical outlook that history is constantly and inevitably progressing to some ultimate state of betterment (typically culminating in the rise of liberal democracy).  This idea is itself a Western construct and no historian really subscribes to the belief anymore.  History is not so neat as Whig historians would believe; it's much more chaotic, non-linear, and pluralist.  Historical pluralism recognizes that history can be viewed from a variety of perspectives.  For instance, many people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America take issue, to put it mildly, with the idea of Western exceptionalism.  Moreover, the term carries a great deal of racist or otherwise bigoted thought toward the non-white peoples of the world.

archaeontologist,"Although I can't speak to the specifics of the Estonian situation, I feel the need to intervene here, seeing as the only other comment is an ahistorical polemic.

The notion of foreign conquest bringing 'civilization and prosperity' has a long, trans-European history of justifying imperial expansion. It is firmly rooted in a 19th century political and intellectual climate - the age of imperialism, where older and younger empires expanded their colonial holdings. Intellectual conceptions of an advanced Europe at the vanguard of historical progress were both formed through these imperial encounters with non-European subjects, and informed how empires negotiated the positions of these 'others'. Belief in technological, social, political and moral progress supported hierarchical understandings of nations, where different peoples could be plotted on a singular, linear path of development. In this vision, 'less-developed' peoples were situated on a path towards modernity (at the forefront of which was, of course, Western Europe), and colonial intervention could beneficially lead these 'children' of mankind down this path.

This is NOT a particularly Russian view - its intellectual origins can be located in Enlightenment thought, and its political origins in the imperial debates of late-18th c. England. And for all its reactionary connotations today, understandings of colonialism as a civilizing mission was NOT limited to conservative demagogues - recent scholarship into colonial politics and 19th century political culture has stressed the ties between nascent liberalism and apologetics of empire (particularly fascinating are the imperialist doctrines of James and John Stuart Mill, as well as Tocqueville's justification of the conquest of Algeria). Furthermore, the development of the social sciences of Sociology and Anthropology in the late-19th century can be tied to this drive to 'understand' and 'aid' the uncivilized colonial other. For the latest scholarship on liberal imperialism and justifications of imperial conquest in the 19th century, see:

* Sankar Muthu, *Enlightenment Against Empire* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003).

* Jennifer Pitts, *A Turn to Empire: The Rise of Imperial Liberalism in Britain and France* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005).

* Karuna Mantena, *Alibis of Empire: Henry Maine and the Ends of Liberal Imperialism* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010).

Of course, I've painted a rough and quick picture of this period - the notion of empire and civilizing the colonial other was a thoroughly ambiguous one, perpetrated in political projects, scientific discourses, and literary productions, but also contested and debated in these same mediums.

It's even more complex in the Eastern European case, where the Russian Empire justified its own 19th c. expansion in the east as a civilizing mission, while Western European political and cultural thought portrayed Russia itself as a backwards nation, itself in need of civilization. I find it incredibly alarming that the poster below me ruthlessly criticizes Imperial Russia for using a discourse of backwards 'others' in need of civilizing, while he uses the exact same discourse to look down upon 'murderous', Russian 'barbarians'. In fact, there is a long history of what can be called 'Russian Orientalism' (in the Saidian sense), where W. European cultural and scientific discourses have constructed a backwards, uncivilized E. Europe against which to define their own 'Europeaness'. For recent works on this topic, see:

* Maria Todorova, “The Balkans from Discovery to Imagination.” *Slavic Review* 53: 2 (1994) 453-82.

* Milicia Bakić-Hayden, “Nesting Orientalisms: The Case of Former Yugoslavia.” *Slavic Review* 54: 4 (1995) 917-31.

* Larry Wolff, *Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment* (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2004).
  

Against his comment (as well as 19th century imperialism and its modern intellectual influence, seen in the interview you describe above [unfortunately, certain 19th c. notions have yet to vanish from the public consciousness]), it is not the task of historians to 'rank' peoples and nations in a hierarchy of progress, or wield a binary lens of 'civilization/savagery' - the goal is instead to *historicize* these discourses and their lingering effects, and ask *how* this particular vision of the world was constructed.

In the particular instance you site above, it seems to be a naive, modern expression of this civilization/barbarism binary with roots in the 19th c. (and, unfortunately, still latent in much popular thought to this day), probably with the added influence of the Soviet nationalities policy. If you're interested, I would be more than happy to recommend some books on Russia's historical engagement with its multi-ethnic polity, up to and including the Soviet period.


And one last thing: the quote by Noxchi below on Russia's engagement with the Caucasus is entirely inaccurate. In writing ""the xenophobic and bleak Russian could only discern 'savages' and 'blacks'"", the complex, variegated history of interactions between Imperial Russia and these southern neighbors is entirely erased. Leaving aside shifting imperial political mechanisms of negotiating difference, 19th century Russian culture saw complex strategies of understanding this region - from the 'nobel savage' of romantic lyrical poetry and travelogues of the first decades of the 19th century (exemplified in Pushkin's ""A Prisoner in the Caucasus"") to Tolstoy's incredible novel *Hadji Murat* (published posthumously in 1912), which superbly examines the conflicts of colonial empire and whose richly presented Caucasian protagonist (who is the furthest thing from a 'savage') is used to direct a withering critique against the imperial policies of a far more barbaric Tsar Nicholas I. For a history on 19th c. Russia's rich engagement with the Caucasus, see:

These deserters called themselves the Knight Company after their captain, Newt Knight, and set up their headquarters in the swamps of Leaf River, Mississippi. Generally around this time Mississippi was relatively poor comparably to their southern counterparts. The Confederate government passed the ""Twenty-Negro Law"" which exempted all slave owners who owned more than 20 slaves to be exempt from service. This prompted the desertion of the Knight Company from the Confederate army. Newt Knight's comrade, Jasper Collins, remarked, “This law … makes it a rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight”. To make matters worse the Confederates had a system in place called ""Tax-in-kind"" where tax collectors took what they wanted from the populace to sustain the Confederate army and government. This had a massive effect on poor whites who were already struggling to make ends meet. Women and children were starving to death as their husbands were risking their lives against disease and yankee muskets. Newt Knight left his post in 1863, following the Siege of Vicksburg, with 125 men from Jones, Jasper, Smith, and Covington county to defend their families and ward off Confederate troops rounding up deserters. The Knight Company would attack supply routes and Confederate columns and then disappear back into the swamps. Newt and his Knight Company were so successful at disrupting the Confederates that the news travelled to Jefferson Davis. Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk informed President Jefferson Davis that Jones County was in “open rebellion” and the combatants were “… proclaiming themselves ‘Southern Yankees,’ and resolved to resist by force of arms all efforts to capture them.” The Natchez Courier reported in its July 12, 1864, edition that Jones County had seceded from the Confederacy.

lokhagos,"From 1863-1864 a band of Confederate deserters found their way back to Jones County, Mississippi and declared the county the Free State of Jones. These deserters called themselves the Knight Company after their captain, Newt Knight, and set up their headquarters in the swamps of Leaf River, Mississippi. Generally around this time Mississippi was relatively poor comparably to their southern counterparts. The Confederate government passed the ""Twenty-Negro Law"" which exempted all slave owners who owned more than 20 slaves to be exempt from service. This prompted the desertion of the Knight Company from the Confederate army. Newt Knight's comrade, Jasper Collins, remarked, “This law … makes it a rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight”. To make matters worse the Confederates had a system in place called ""Tax-in-kind"" where tax collectors took what they wanted from the populace to sustain the Confederate army and government. This had a massive effect on poor whites who were already struggling to make ends meet. Women and children were starving to death as their husbands were risking their lives against disease and yankee muskets. Newt Knight left his post in 1863, following the Siege of Vicksburg, with 125 men from Jones, Jasper, Smith, and Covington county to defend their families and ward off Confederate troops rounding up deserters. The Knight Company would attack supply routes and Confederate columns and then disappear back into the swamps. Newt and his Knight Company were so successful at disrupting the Confederates that the news travelled to Jefferson Davis. Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk informed President Jefferson Davis that Jones County was in “open rebellion” and the combatants were “… proclaiming themselves ‘Southern Yankees,’ and resolved to resist by force of arms all efforts to capture them.” The Natchez Courier reported in its July 12, 1864, edition that Jones County had seceded from the Confederacy. A few days after his destructive Meridian campaign in February 1864, Union General Sherman wrote that he had received “a declaration of independence” from a group of local citizens who opposed the Confederacy. Much has been written about whether the “Free State of Jones” actually seceded or not. Although no official secession document survives, for a time in the spring of 1864, the Confederate government in Jones County was effectively overthrown. And alas the Confederates operating in the backwoods and swamps of Leaf River, Mississippi knew Jones by another name, ""The Kingdom of Jones"".

Tiako,"I'm assuming the question is for the Imperial period.

Roman recruitment is something of a complex topic, and one that has a fair amount of difficulty around it. The best answer is probably that there was no single way of getting recruits that applied in all situations, all times, and all places. The process was probably not terribly formalized, and seems a bit ad hoc. A theory that was once popular was the idea of the Roman army as a self-sustaining institution, that the pool of recruits was drawn largely from the various orphans and children legitimate and illegitimate that any military fort is going to accumulate. This is probably not correct, although undoubtedly was part of the story, both because it has no real evidence for it an because legionaries proper (who were increasingly a minority within the army as a whole) were citizens, a category that doesn't include orphans.

Conscription did happen, although it was never a levee-en-masse affair implemented across the empire. Rather, it would be targeted for specific regions and specific circumstances--the Romans tended to view certain people as producing better soldiers, and they weren't above coercion as a strategy of getting recruits from them. Most notoriously, the Batavian revolt of 69 CE was triggered by overly heavy handed recruitment methods, as Batavians were seen as some of the best material for soldiers. Probably the majority of soldiers were willing recruits, fleeing from rural poverty into the fairly solid and stable military institution.

As for how they maintained it, it is best to remember that the Roman army actually wasn't that large. That is, the amount of money required to maintain it was significantly less than the aggregate amount of money required for the pre-Roman military situation of multiple competing polities. This is an important principle behind certain views of the Roman economy.",null,0,cdlwkkn,1rchua,askhistorians,top_week,11
Spoonfeedme,"Expanding on Tiako and dawbles' comments, it also really depends what period we are talking about exactly. The Republican period was far different than the Imperial period that followed, and recruiting practices differed.

It's also important to note that, as Tiako mentioned, the army wasn't actually that large by modern standards; for a population that might have reached almost sixty million, the imperial army had less than thirty legions under arms for most of its existence, which would have been approximately 150,000  'regulars' and about an equal number of auxiliaries, so we can say roughly 300,000 men under arms. The auxiliaries would have come from both inhabitants of the Empire as well as neighboring territories. We have to make a distinction between them.

The Legions themselves were theoretically manned by Roman citizens, while the auxiliaries basically took the role of the 'allies' of the Republic. The idea that you would receive citizenship after your term of service was actually directed towards auxiliaries. The Emperor Caracalla made every free man in the empire a citizen in 212 to possibly to offset falls in recruitment among current citizens.

That possible fall in recruitment probably had something to do with money. Let's talk about economics. Rome itself and Italy had a high slave population that continued to grow into the Imperial period. This meant a high percentage of people in Italy would be basically urban poor; Rome itself could have had a population approaching one million in the early Imperial period for example. The legions offered an attractive and stable career choice. If one had familial connections, one could leverage those into even more attractive postings; most officers would have been men who basically bribed their way into such postings. 

I think we can probably safely assume the majority of the Imperial legion, at least under the Principate, was thus simply recruited under the idea of a decent job for decent pay. However, the costs of maintaining a standing army is incredible. The army itself was basically **the** budget line for the Roman Empire. Not only was it costly to maintain in terms of regular financing, each successive emperor was obliged to pay donatives to the army. Legionary pay itself was increased over time (inflation) likely in order to continue to be able to recruit. However, these increases were highly irregular; the first increase came a century after the Imperial period started, the second a century after that. When factoring in the likely levels of inflation caused by economic growth and the not so irregular devaluation of coins by debasing them, in absolute terms it would likely be that legionary pay actually fell over time. Finding money to pay the army was a constant challenge, and some think that the faillure of the Roman economy to be able to support the army was one of the main reasons for the Empire's downfall (Peter Heather is one notable proponent of this).

But there are also those auxiliaries I mentioned. This is a far more complicated answer because they could have been recruited in many different forms because the units themselves came in so many different forms. Some auxiliary units were levy's from conquered/subject tribes. Some would have been freely recruited men from non-citizen areas looking to gain citizenship and a job. These units still received (lesser) pay so there would be some who would be attracted by the status of citizenship. Because auxiliaries also generally receive less attention from writers, less survives from letters, and fewer inscriptions remain, we unfortunately know a lot less about them in many ways.

If you'd like to know more about the economic theories of Rome's decline, Peter Heather's 'Decline of the Roman Empire' is a good place to start. In terms of more info on legion recruitment, Adrian Goldsworthy's 'Complete Roman Army' and Pat Southern's 'The Roman Army'.

In any case, the Queen makes a point of staying out of politics and allowing government to make its own decisions.  This has been the case with all recent monarchs in the 20th century (and beyond).  Constitutionally, the 3 powers the British Monarch possess are:

Appointment of the Prime Minister.  In theory the Queen could appoint anyone she feels it up to the job, in reality she appoints whoever the public elects.  However, in the case of a hung parliament she can step in.  This has happened once, in 1974, when Harold Wilson was appointed.  It could have happened in 2010 also, but they decided to form a coalition instead. 

Dissolution of parliament.  In theory, the Queen could dissolve parliament if they were not up to the job.  This has not happened since  1834 and is unlikely to ever happen again as it would cause a constitutional crisis of epic proportions.  The dissolution of parliament after the 1974 election was done at the Prime Minister's request.

Royal Prerogative.  As I stated all British Government business is done in the Queen's name so in theory she is in charge, however she is constrained by the constitution (you can thank the Civil War for that).  In practise, the Queen's role is purely ceremonial and she only acts on the advice of parliament.  The current queen has been around since 1952, and is is well known that she takes a keen interest in government affairs.  British Prime Ministers will often ask her for advice before acting and she hosts weekly meetings.

TheForceiswithus,"Body armor has been around for centuries; however, its use by modern infantry didn't become widespread until the onset of World War I. ""The first official attempt to outfit military members came in 1915 from the British Army Design Committee, in particular a 'Bomber's Shield' for the use of bomber pilots who were notoriously under-protected in the air from stray bullets and shrapnel. The Experimental Ordnance Board also reviewed potential materials for bullet and fragment proof armor, such as steel plate. A 'necklet' was successfully issued on a small scale (due to cost considerations), which protected the neck and shoulders from bullets traveling at 600 feet per second with interwoven layers of silk and cotton stiffened with resin. The Dayfield body shield entered service in 1916 and a hardened breastplate was introduced the following year"" [\(Bull 12\)](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sXCn3WrINjwC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;focus=viewport).

The states of the CSA didn't just sit down and say ""Gee, let's secede"".  There was a concerted effort by the anti-Unionists to propagandize secession which went hand-in-hand with a hawkish stance towards the Union. 

Many of the noted proponents of secession(called the ""Fire Eaters"") had a virulent hatred of the North- Edmund Ruffin being one famous example: credited with firing one of the first shots at Ft. Sumter, he killed himself after Lee surrendered, writing in his diary:

&gt;And now with my latest writing and utterance, and with what will [be] near to my latest breath, I here repeat, &amp; would willingly proclaim, my unmitigated hatred to Yankee rule—to all political, social and business connections with Yankees, &amp; to the perfidious, malignant, &amp; vile Yankee race.

So, in reality, by the time of Ft. Sumter, there was little that could have been done.  It would have been like trying to stop a massive freight train barreling full-speed towards war.

I would say it was possible in the short term, but probably not in the long term. Some people in the North, including incoming Secretary of State William Seward, wanted to give up Fort Sumter to the Confederacy. There was a belief that doing so would 'calm down' the South, so that hopefully secessionist fever would run its course.

&gt; [Seward] wanted to give up Sumter for political as well as military reasons. Such a gesture of peace and good will, he told Lincoln, would reassure the upper South and strengthen unionists in Confederate states.

-James McPherson, *Battle Cry of Freedom*

From the South's point of view, there's no way they could have let Fort Sumter stand indefinitely. It was, for all intents and purposes, a foreign fort in their territory, and there was concern that public opinion would turn against the new government if they didn't do something.

dualmanias,"By the time the attack on Fort Sumter began, the Confederacy was still forming and shaping its self. The simple answer is no, war could not have been avoided. Here are some of the factors why:  
  
South Carolina was the first state to leave the union on the 20th of December, 1860. A little over a month after President Abraham Lincoln had been elected.  
(up to this point many in the ""north"" had been anti slavery but it was not an overall major point in the agenda of the administration, nor did Lincoln run on a serious anti-slavery platform. Many prominent voices pushed for its abolition but it was still an issue that was easier to ignore than address as a whole.)  
  
By the start of February, 1861 several more states had seceded from the union and joined the confederacy. A constitution was drawn and adopted on the 8th of February and its elected president the following day.  
  
In the few short months from an American President to a northern and southern presidency, a lot of rhetoric, scheming, plotting, and reinforcing of positions and causes came to the forefront. Slavery became a prominent issue. Lincoln had argued as tensions grew that he would not abolish slavery but would not allow the nation to be divided either. This was a major talking point in his inaugural address on March 4th. You could view this as the first absolutely clear ""public"" stance Lincoln held on the whole affair. However, ""privately"" the administrations thought process could have, and perhaps was very different. In any case, it was a direct attempt to avoid war but also a clear assertion that secession would not be accepted. You can essentially view it as a promise of war rather than a deceleration of war if all other options have been exhausted and the nation could not be preserved.  
  
South Carolina, leading the charge so to speak towards secession knew that a conflict was unavoidable. Unlike many of the other states that had left the union, SC had a large presence of Federal troops on its soil. Most notably, the sea forts which protected American commerce and its shipping lanes. Fort Moultrie which was commanded by Major Robert Anderson, responsible for all of the harbor defense and all of its related garrisons , was the initial headquarters but fearing attack, Anderson switched his command to Fort Sumter.  
  
While the politicians debated, Anderson had already prepared as best as he could for the coming fight. Interesting fact, because SC had already left the union, Federal troops had no means for resupply. Food and munitions had been blockaded from the forts since January. The first shots of the Civil War actually happened on January 9th when SC vessels enforced their blockade and turned around northern supply ships.  
  
The growing situation of the forts and the blockade of SC waters from the north became the hotbed issue that directly escalated it into an armed conflict. Despite repeated calls to abandon the forts and remand control to the Confederacy, Anderson refused, meanwhile his men grew closer to facing starvation. Knowing that many of the Forts would be out of supplies and rations soon, Lincoln ordered a small fleet to attempt to sneak past the blockade and resupply the forts.  
  
Numerous attempts were made to find a way out of the situation but in the end Anderson would not leave, nor surrender. (and why would he, it would meant treason and surrendering to even bigger traitor in a way)  
  
Long story short, with union troops stationed on their soil, refusing to leave and an increasing number of Union ships attempting to force their way in, the south had little choice. On Friday, April 12, 1861 in the wee hours of the morning, they opened fire.  
  
Shortly after, war was officially declared by both sides.

JarlGrimnar0311,"There was a very serious concern that some of his higher military command, especially General Curtis Lamay, were too eager to get into a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. Lamay had been pushing aggressive policies before Kennedy with having modified air force bombers loaded with signals intelligence equipment fly right along the Soviet Border antagonizing them and advocating for pre-emptive nuclear war. Lemay during the Cuban Missile Crisis was also a strong advocate of bombing Cuba and opposed the naval blockade, going so far as to advocate invading Cuba even after the crisis had ended and the Soviets agreed to withdraw the nuclear missiles. 

As far as a actual fear of a coup attempt, I can't quote or cite any actual historical documents, but from what I know and read of a lot of the higher ranking members of the military at the time, the fear of the domino effect of communism, the idea of monolithic communism, Cuba having become so friendly to the Soviet Union, and the fact that many of the higher ranking military in Kennedy's administration had been hardened by World War Two experiences all helped to create a highly unstable and dangerous atmosphere during that time of the Cold War.

l_mack,"The clenched fist was not unique to leftist action during the Spanish Civil War. From what I gather, the clenched fist as a workers' symbol began to spread during the wave of labour agitation during the 1880s. It was broadly popularized through two famous paintings: Robert Köehler's ""[The Strike](http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artwork.php?artworkid=10758&amp;size=large)"" and his ""[The Socialist](http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=1451)."" 

By 1917, the Industrial Workers of the World had appropriated the symbol to represent workers' revolutionary intentions and the importance of syndicalism. It was also used extensively by the German Communist Party (KPD) during the 1920s. In terms of the Spanish Civil War, historians Gottfried Korff and Larry Peterson argue that ""the clenched fist first became an international left-wing symbol [during the Spanish Civil War] and was later taken up by European and American youth in the 1960s and 1970s, sometimes ironically,"" which perhaps relates to your own discussion of the black power appropriation of the symbol.

I think that a very informative article for you to read would be:

Gottfried Korff and Larry Peterson, ""From Brotherly Handshake to Clenched Fist: On Political Metaphors for the Workers' Hand,"" *International Labor and Working-Class History* 42 (Fall, 1992), pp. 70-81.

tobbinator,"During the Spanish Civil War it was used not only by the Left wing elements within the Republic but also by some of the Right Opposition in the Republic. Orwell in *Homage to Catalonia* describes it just as the ""anti-fascist salute"", implying that it had become a symbol of those in opposition to Franco, who was seen as a fascist by those on the Loyalist side. 

As for why it seems to have become a strong emblem of the Spanish Civil War, I'd say that would be because of the strength and size of the left wing militias (the CNT-aligned Durruti Column alone had 8,000 militiamen in 1937) as well as the very ideological nature of the war as a whole; internationally it was seen as a defence of democracy and freedom fighting against a fascist menace due to the attraction the Republic had towards many intellectuals and journalists, including Hemingway, Picasso and Orwell who were heavily involved in the conflict. In addition there's the very romanticised view of the revolutionaries, who were met with surprising success but crushed, and International Brigadiers, who went to a foreign land to fight an ideological enemy voluntarily.

thebullfrog72,"TL;DR No: not how the alliance worked, wouldn't make sense for Japan, impossible to pull off. 

Formal military plans, no. In fact, it would be very unlikely for the two Axis powers to discuss any such plans, as an important part of Nazi-Japanese relations was that the two empires did not overlap. 

From the Nuremberg trials, we have [this copy] (http://www.holocaust-history.org/works/imt/03/htm/t375.htm?size=2) of a Nazi Order outlining what cooperation would mean. The two realms would remain entirely separate, working together economically, and it's important to note that nowhere in the document is the Middle East or even India (a necessary precursor to Japanese intervention in the Middle East) mentioned. 

Two other major reasons why this plan wouldn't be considered is the strategic goals of the TriPartite Pact and the feasibility. For Nazi Germany, Japanese involvement was crucial in that it tied down British colonial forces, which it did quite successfully in its invasions of Burma and Singapore. By invading Burma, Britain was forced to maintain a garrison within its important territory of India, limiting the amount of reinforcements it could send to fight in the Mediterranean theatre. This actually worked; by 1942, India Command had mostly stopped sending forces to fight in the North African campaign or to defend the Middle East, and were focused entirely on defending India from an invasion from Burma, which they successfully repelled two years later. 

Japan's conquest in South-East Asia, particularly within Burma, were focused on accomplishing both the goal of hampering the British ability to attack Japan in the Pacific Theatre but also for the strategic resources, particularly the oil fields, that could be obtained in Burma. 

Regarding feasibility, this has as much to do with timing as anything. Japan's invasion of Burma was complete in 1942. With the Pacific Theatre beginning, it would be imprudent of Imperial Japan to devote further resources to attack India, not to mention the subsequent garrisoned British lands in Persia and then Iraq. In addition, on the Nazi side, a link-up would require devoting more personnel to the North Africa campaign to win the Battle of El-Alamein, thereby gaining access to Egypt, and through it, the Middle East. 

Greater cooperation between the Nazi and Japanese militaries could have proved beneficial to the Axis war plans, but were never a major focus for either country. For a while joint attack on the Soviet Union on both fronts was an option, but never occurred and Japan was not included in the Operation Barbarossa planning or execution. Any such action would have likely changed the face of the war between the USSR and the Nazis, as the Soviets were able to bring in reinforcements from the East that had been protecting against such a threat. The absence of this threat was confirmed repeatedly through espionage. 

In the end, any such plans would have been highly unfeasible, and if the situation was changed such that they could actually link up in the Middle East, it would probably be tactically unsound to do.  ",null,0,cdmjufc,1rcwqk,askhistorians,top_week,2

piper06w,"I've studied this a bit, but can only really give you a proper answer to the  second part of the question regarding property, as well as a little bit of an overview of the first bit, and some literature recommendations. I do know that the U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems predated the wall, and actually West German U-bahn trains would pass through Frederichstrasse, though not stop, so there wasn't too much of an issue that I can recall in joining the mass trasit systems. As for times and dates, I unfortunately do not know. 

As for property in East Berlin, it was actually quite the opposite. Property values in East Berlin plummeted, largely due to the mass exodus of the Ossies. A lot of this property was quickly snatched up by squatters, and a lot of redevelopment of land, especially land around the buffer zone and in areas either vacant or planned to be developed by the GDR. As for the ideology change, there wasn't exactly a mass shift to the left in German politics. In fact, the Easterners largely supported Helmut Kohl, and supported him for 8 more years until his defeat in 1998.That's not to say that there isn't still remnants of Ostalgie manifesting itself politically, if you look at the recent elections, the support for the communist party manifested itself largely around old GDR borders. But ostalgie is mostly manifested culturally, rather than actually wishing to return to the GDR.

khosikulu,"By ""through"" I assume you mean ""up to the period of,"" because proto-Bantu speakers worked iron by around 1000 BCE and took that toolkit with them into the Great Lakes region and beyond.

The old model was diffusionist, basically suggesting that all ironworking technology came in some form from one origin outside of Africa (usually Anatolia).  Archaeological, linguistic, and cultural evidence now promotes a model of independent events within Africa; in the mountains of Aïr, for example, we have iron slag that dates back at least to 1000BCE (elsewhere in the Great Lakes there are some disputed dates before that, and [Zangato &amp; Holl](http://www.african-archaeology.de/index.php?page_id=154&amp;journal_id=24&amp;pdf_id=172) actually are trying to push it back past 2000BCE--read also the critical responses in that issue if you can), many centuries before iron's regular appearance in the Nile Valley and across North Africa.  

Although some do still cling to the old model of diffusion, the question now really involves where iron technology emerged south of the Sahara and when, because there are a number of sites from Lake Chad to Lake Tanganyika with similar antiquity.  Jan Vansina wrote an article in 2006 (in *History in Africa*) mobilizing linguistic evidence to suggest that proto-Bantu-speakers took the technology from other West African groups first, but he remains agnostic about whether to join the chorus against the old Asia diffusion model; [see this article if you can access it](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4895863889).  The language around ironworking, and the social position of ironworking, are traceable, and point to African origins--although whether it's one origin south of the Sahara or several that sort of ""merged"" over time, we still don't know.  We also, as per Chris Ehret (2003), still don't have a clear picture of how it spread across those societies, but it spread quickly with all other forms of knowledge carried or transmitted by Bantu-speakers.  

So in short, historical and archaeological study still haven't settled the question permanently.

In addition, the poor farming climate and volcanic eruptions made survival very difficult when Iceland depended on farming. Denmark became Iceland’s main controller in the 1600s after the Norwegian royal line ended. Iceland’s economy fell drastically because Denmark did not require its wool and fish, and it was not protected by Denmark. During the Turkish Abductions, Iceland was raided by the Barbary Pirates and many Icelandics were sold into slavery. Iceland was also converted to Lutheranism after Denmark converted. In the 16- and 1700s, Denmark imposed the Danish-Icelandic Trade Monopoly, a mercantilist policy which forbade it from trading with any country other than Denmark.

xi_yangyang,"At the time, China had a very large population of lower class people, and Communist ideas were very appealing. Many people were drawn to the idea that the bourgeois were evil because they were on a higher class. Thus, the idea of removing such evils grew into the huge movement it became because of the idea of total social equality and its appeal to the lower class. Doctors, teachers, scholars, etc. were persecuted because of their higher education and class. Eventually, religion, art, etc. was attacked not only because they were seen as superstition and an instrument of the ruling class, but also because it was reminiscent of the “old society.” In addition, the removal of any sources of culture and ideas other than the Communist Party helped solidify their hold on China. Children were taught from an early age that Communism was the greatest, and this brainwashing created the idea that anything from the old society was bad, and they were encouraged to work hard for this new utopia. Non-Communist people and ideas were foreign and threats to Chinese society, so they were destroyed. 

So, to answer your question, many people were taught that Communism was the only way as well as a sign of hope for the lower-class. The increasing fanaticism for Communism as well as the intensifying view of culture and religion as instruments of ruling-class power and also as foreign threats created the increasing need to destroy all signs of it.",null,6,cdm4j7u,1rd4yf,askhistorians,top_week,11
tidyupinhere,"To understand the Cultural Revolution, you have to understand a bit about Mao, the history of communism in China, and the age-old social traditions that run deep in the Chinese psyche.

The people at the core of the Cultural Revolution were the youth. In the years prior, Mao had reorganized peasant society from traditional communities to state-run communes. Families were uprooted, sometimes split apart. Children were taken from their parents' care and put into state care, where they were imbued with a vast amount of propaganda condemning communism and anti-""bourgeois"" (capitalist) behaviour, and a vast amount revering Mao.

Mao orchestrated the Cultural Revolution, but did not control it, especially not in the later phases. It began when he had a conflict with his political rivals. He leveraged his popularity against them by publishing [more propaganda](http://triplehelixblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/china-propaganda.jpg), painting them as bourgeois men.

With the youth on his side, he changed the target to anyone doing ""bourgeois"" things. The meaning of this word was vague and, once the Revolution was in full swing, was widely interpreted. 

Mao played to the youths' desires by encouraging them to realize their autonomous power. China has a long history of deference to one's elders. Mao told the youth they no longer had to do this: they could choose their own lovers, choose their own career, make what they wanted out of life. Frustrated and resentful youths stabbed their parents in the back.

It got out of Mao's control, but he let it go for a while until it was clear his political rivals were adequately muzzled (he ousted a few too, iirc). Then he asked the youth to moderate their behaviour, and had them shipped off to the countryside to reacquaint themselves with hard labour. It took a while, but he effectively squelched the movement and leveraged himself into more power.

Rosstin,"MORE DETAILS:
Right now I'm imagining that the battle has two major decision points. 

Point 1: In the first one you have to demonstrate some type of basic tactical combat knowledge. Your opponent does something, and the player gets a few options of how to respond to his move.

* Do something tactically insightful and continue fighting.

* Do something that seems like a good idea, but isn't, because of a detail the player may have missed.

* Make a rookie mistake.

Point 2: Then in the second decision point, I want to illustrate the difference between fighting in the yard and fighting on the battlefield. You see some kind of opening and get some options.

* Do something tactically sound that would only work in the yard, winning the practice battle.

* Do something else tactically sound that would only work in the yard, winning the practice battle.

* Fight dirty, winning the practice battle.

* Make a rookie mistake, losing.

For the practice battle, everything is nonlethal, and the protagonist and player are both able to learn from their mistakes. In the real battle, when the player gets to the second point, using a ""yard tactic"" will get her non-lethally injured and up the stakes, and she'll have to fight dirty in order to survive (opening up a third decision point, but not killing her outright.).

My big problem is that I can't come up with clever things for her and opponent to do that aren't either too technical or hollywood-style-fakery.

I have an alternate idea that would involve her getting into her opponents' heads more, and using their psychology against them. There are some problems with that, in that her opponents in these two battles will be different and I don't really want to break the battles's symmetry.",null,0,cdm4pvj,1rd6ph,askhistorians,top_week,1

Maklodes,"Monarchy as a system of government predated Christianity in Europe, and existed in places where Christianity (and monotheism in general) never had much influence. Macedon and the diadochi successor states were all monarchic well before Christianity. Rome basically became a monarchy thirty years before Jesus was born, and was a monarchy for about 400 years before it became Christian. Some of the Germanic kingdoms that arose in the west after the collapse of Roman authority created their kingdoms before they were Christianized (such as the Anglo-Saxons and the Franks). (The Goths, though, were Christian (albeit a somewhat heretical variety (Arian) before they conquered significant territory) Outside of Europe, of course, kingdoms like Japan and Thailand have had monarchic governments without Christianity or any other monotheistic theology.

The interaction between religion and politics has been very complex in Europe. A Europe that retained its old pagan beliefs, or which had embraced some Eastern faith not rooted in the Abrahamic tradition, such as the Mithraic mysteries, would have been a very different place in unpredictable ways.

LIPCSB,"The LK was significantly smaller, as you note.  It had to be--the Soviet N-1 booster was not as powerful as the Saturn V due to its use of kerosene in the upper stages rather than hydrogen.  It did have a companion module (a modified Soyuz, cousins of which are still in service today), but to save weight, there was no docking tunnel on the LK--the cosmonaut was expected to climb out of the Soyuz and use handholds to climb over to the LK before landing.  These drawings depict the overall mission profile rather well.  http://spacemodels.nuxit.net/n1/n1_miss.htm

As for why the Soviets could send robots but not people, it came down to launch capacity.  Their lander got as far as tests in Earth Orbit, and the capsule worked out after a while.  Their moon launcher, though, was unsuccessful, for a number of reasons--no testing of stages on a test stand before launch, inefficient resource allocation (they had a whole separate lunar program going unrelated to the N-1 system) due to office politics, a comparatively late start (Saturn development actually goes back to the 1950s--the hardware was repurposed to Moon flights from its original space-station-centric goal).  Without that Moon launcher (or experience in docking refueling upper stages in orbit), they couldn't send a man to land on the Moon.

Bismarck managed to convince Wilhelm I not to press on, to keep France and Russia from intervening. None the less, Prussia actually made huge territorial gains, albeit in the north of Germany. Compare the maps from [1818](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map-DB-PrussiaProvs-1818.svg) and [1871](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map-DR-Prussia.svg), most of that was due to this war.

At least as importantly, this pretty much settled the [German Question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_question). The result was that Austria was effectively out of the picture of German politics, which made it possible for Bismarck to eventually form a German nation state without it, and therefore under Prussian hegemony.

Maklodes,"Well, of course, there's the fact that the conquest of Gaul enabled Caesar's political career to reach the level it did, both in giving him money for bribery and such and in giving him a popular reputation as a war hero. Depending on your view, this might have lead to the destruction of the Republic and the creation of the Principate. (You could argue that the transformation was preordained from the time Sulla crossed the Rubicon and Marius reorganized the army to have a structure favoring loyalty to generals more than loyalty to the state, or you could argue that there was nothing inevitable about it even after Caesar's death, until Octavian actually started using the title of princeps, but many people see Caesar as having a pretty big role.)

One argument from William McNeill's *History of Western Civilization* that I found intriguing is the claim that the Roman conquest of Gaul ultimately lead to deterioration of the rural Roman economy; Gaulish vineyards drove Italian vineyards out of business.",null,0,cdm5aua,1rdei0,askhistorians,top_week,2

KaiserKvast,"I don't often watch or even find all that many movies set in the 18th century as there doesn't seem to be that big of a quantity of them. However, a few movies come to mind if you ignore historical accuracies and focuses on how accurately the movie portrays food, fashion and courtesies. The movie ""Maria Antoinette"" released in 2006 springs to mind (takes place in the very end of the 18th century). It explores food, fashion and Versailles courtesy rather good and gives a pretty good idea about how life for french royalty could have been in certain situations. On top of that it's an okay movie. Do keep in mind that it takes place late 18th century and might not be a top portrayal of how people dressed for most of the 18th century. 


You've already seen Barry Lyndon otherwise I would have recommended that movie. There's always ""The Last of the Mohicans"" though, it's based on the novel by the same name and takes place during the Seven years war. It's a good movie in itself and actually has really well-made costumes and props.

LordSariel,"I cannot comment on the exact number of Union vs Confederate memorials in the country, but I've recently been scholastically exploring the concept of ""History of Memory."" It's especially relevant in French History, but I actually got started on the subject based on the ""Lost Cause Narrative"" that arose following the American Civil War, and relates to your topic about how the war is remembered in terms of physical statues or monuments.

It has been noted by Historians like Caroline Janney that the Civil War is the only war in which the losers have written the History instead of the Winners. The so-called Lost Cause Narrative sought to attach a justification to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people for a cause that ultimately proved unattainable. Janney points especially to General Order No. 9, issued by Confederate General Robert E. Lee, which was read to his troops the day after Appomattox.  The speech hails them for being ""brave survivors of so many hard fought battles"" and ultimately concludes that his army was ""compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources"" fielded by the North. 

Basically the origin of the claim that Southerners clung to, roughly summarized as ""we had fought valiantly, and we tried, but we were overrun."" One that deliberately ignored many of the much more structural problems of the Confederacy, and their racialized goals. Her book, which is incredibly fascinating and titled ""Remembering The Civil War"" goes on to unpack the development of the Lost-Cause Narrative, and highlights how the Civil War came to be remembered as the War of Northern Aggression by the Southerners. A brief summary of her argument is that the Northern policies during reconstruction actually framed and favored the ultimate renegotiation of the War's legacy.

Caroline Janney, *Remembering The Civil War*. 
Also read Drew Gilpin Faust's *This Republic of Suffering* to better comprehend the sheer amount of death and destruction that was wrought by the conflict, and why both sides *needed* to secure a justification.

Hope some of this answers the question as to *why* there may be more Confederate statues. ",null,7,cdmcsdz,1rdjfq,askhistorians,top_week,66
tinyshadow,"This is a very interesting question. As a starting point, it should be noted that many Northern battlefields and Northern towns did not allow any decorations or memorials for the Confederate cause or Confederate dead. For example, at Gettysburg, the first Confederate monument was erected in 1884 to the 2nd Maryland Infantry, CSA and ""met a great deal of resistance from the battlefield commission authorities."" After this monument, the next seems to have been in 1904, and after that, Confederate veterans stop doing regimental monuments and started doing state monuments at Gettysburg. [Source](http://www.gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/Confederate/2MD.php). 

Likewise, only until 1900 after the Spanish-American War did Arlington National Cemetery make a section for Confederate war dead. [Source](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/visitorinformation/MonumentMemorials/Confederate.aspx).

But what is certainly true about the South is that those who carried its legacy were tenacious and absolutely reveled in marking and memorializing the Lost Cause. By 1900, three organizations (the Ladies Memorial Association, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the United Confederate Veterans) had undertaken a movement across the South to honor Confederate veterans. They dotted the entire South with markers and monuments. These range in size and material; they can be as big as state buildings or as small as a plaque; they can be marble, fieldstone, bronze, iron, etc. As one encyclopedia notes, ""The most common style is a shaft supported by a pedestal and topped by the figure of a Confederate soldier, but other styles include obelisks, columns, boulders, arches, tablets, cenotaphs, fountains, benches, and even one totem pole."" [Source](http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/confederate-monuments).

Many monuments to the Confederacy were built immediately after the war in the 1860s and 1870s. They did not stop building then, however, and continued into the 20th and now 21st century.

To use one state as an example, let's take Georgia and show the break-down for Confederate monument-building:

* 1865-1900: ~25 monuments  
* 1900-1920: ~60+ monuments 
* 1920-1980: ~25+ monuments
* 1980-2005: ~30 more monuments 

Now, these don't include smaller works, such as plaques or simple memorials. Instead, these are large monuments. [Source](http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/confederate-monuments).

At Gettysburg, many of the Confederate monuments were built around the reunion years (think anything ending in 1-5) and the big centennial in 1961-1965. This suggests that while the North has perhaps eased off its Civil War memory, the South continued to push ahead and try to get more monuments and memorials for the Confederate dead.

These are the in-chronological-order dedication dates for the Confederate monuments at Gettysburg:

1. Virginia = 1917 
2. North Carolina = 1929 
3. Alabama = 1933 
4. Georgia = 1961
5. South Carolina = 1963
6. Florida = 1963 
7. Texas = 1964 
8. Arkansas = 1966 
9. Louisiana = 1971
10. Tennessee = 1972
11. Mississippi = 1973
12. Maryland = 1994

In contrast, the seemingly most common time period for Union monuments built at Gettysburg was around 1884-1890. West Virginia's seem a little late in 1898. All in all, this proves the point: the North finished most of its memorial making early on, but the South continued for a long, long, *long* time and, in some places, even continues today.",null,4,cdmdi0v,1rdjfq,askhistorians,top_week,36
Shartastic,"Finally, something I can answer! I don't have the concrete numbers, but I can state with almost positive certainty that yes, this is true.

The interesting thing is that most of the Confederate monuments didn't go up until the 1890s-1920s. The most prominent groups erecting these monuments were women's organizations, like local Ladies Auxiliary Clubs and the most common group, after their organization in 1894, the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

The early monuments which went up immediately after the war were small plaques and such that were put in cemeteries. Especially in areas under heavy rule in Reconstruction, some of these monuments tried to divorce the soldier from the war, praising him for his courage, without mentioning the cause. But for the most part, there were few of these early monuments as the aid organizations for the veterans (again, mostly organized by women) had the dilemma of ""bread or stone"" - that is, they could either spend their money to put up monuments for the dead, or they could feed the living veterans. Most opted to spend more on the living veterans, so this early period (1865-1880) sees only small muted monuments, mostly in cemeteries.

After the failure of Reconstruction (which is another topic in itself, but for the point of this, I'll generalize with just that), there was another push for national unification (in spirit). Most of white America was able to reform a common bond while trying to put the issues of the past behind them, but of course this new unity just further cemented the racial hierarchy present in the nation. So it was during this nadir of race relations (1890-1920), when most of the monuments were erected praising the Confederate dead. There was a spirit of nostalgia that swept the country and veterans from both sides would often meet to reminisce over their shared experiences. There was a new mythology of the Confederate cause that began to emerge during this time, which was now being permanently erected on the landscape in granite. The monuments of this period were often grander, had plaques not only honoring the Confederate soldier, but offering some explanation of why he fought, generally using the kind of vague terminology that means something different to whoever is reading the plaque. The key difference now though, is that these monuments were also now being placed in public spaces. In front of city halls, in downtown parks, in front of court houses, state capitols, etc. The memory of the war is no longer something that you would go to a cemetery to reflect on in *private* tranquility. Now it's a matter of *public* celebration. Not only that, but it's meant to instruct the community as to how they should feel about and honor the Confederate dead/cause. This last point is the most salient, especially in areas with large black populations. Not only were they already being oppressed through Jim Crow laws and lynchings, but now they had to regularly view monuments to the soldiers who fought for the country that wanted to keep them in chains. The Confederate memorialization impulse mostly died off after World War I. I don't quite remember why right now, but I can recommend a few books that cover these topics succinctly.

To end though, I'll cite some of my favorite UDC monuments. First, as I mentioned with the monuments not only honoring a white supremacist past (I use this loaded term loosely to mean a past in which whites were dominant over blacks), the monuments also served as active tools for white supremacy as well. The UDC put up many water fountains in Southern city parks, each with its plaque honoring the Confederate dead, as well as them always being placed in pairs: one labelled ""Colored.""

My favorite is the one in Union City, TN, only because most monuments use vague terms honoring the ""brave sacrifice of the soldier in the most noble cause"" or ""protecting the values that he believed in"" (never actually defining the cause or values, but they were well-known in the mind of the Southern reader). [The one for Obion County](http://i.imgur.com/dEEoUiO.jpg?1) on the other hand is quite explicit in exactly what it means. It honors the soldier who was ""killed in battle, who was starved in federal prison, and who has preserved Anglo-Saxon civilization in the South."" (er. 1909)

I've done extensive research on the topic of Confederate monuments and the memory of war, so I'd be happy to answer anything else if I can. Or provide more monument pictures since I've got thousands that I took during the course of my research. Or just provide books if you'd like to read about it yourself.

tinyshadow,"Herbert Hoover first and foremost believed in volunteerism and private charity. He did not encourage federal intervention whatsoever. He expected that the Great Depression (which wasn't considered that during Hoover's years just yet) would be solved if everyone worked together. The National Historic Site of his childhood home in Iowa states his belief quite clearly: 

*Committed to individualism and opposed to direct Federal intervention, he hoped at first that local governments and traditional charitable organizations could solve the problems that arose.  When the massive unemployment and poverty of the 1930s overwhelmed the political system, public opinion soon transformed this internationally famous humanitarian into “the man with ice water in his veins.”* [Source](http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/herbert_hoover_nhs.html).

Hoover really meant ""rely on private charity."" Here's a fine example of that belief: when a 10-year-old Ohio girl wrote Hoover saying she and her friends were collecting blankets, clothing, and food and wanted to send them to Washington D.C. for him to distribute to the needy, he wrote her back:

*My dear Barbara, 
I have your very sweet letter of November 10th. It is a beautiful undertaking. I would suggest, however, that instead of sending the contributions which you collect to me, that you should distribute them to those in need in your own locality.

gingerkid1234,"&gt;I Know their were plenty of nations willing to aid in the protection of the Jews

Well, there's your problem--this really wasn't the case.  The most famous example is the [MS St Louis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_St_Louis).  A ship full of German Jews sailed around trying to get asylum in 1939.  After a retroactive change to the visa system in Cuba, they were turned away, and subsequently were unable to gain entry to the US.  Eventually some of the passengers were allowed into the UK, but most could only gain entry into the Netherlands, France, or Belgium, which were of course under Nazi occupation anyway.

The British also could've removed or relaxed the Jewish immigration quota in Palestine, but they were unwilling to risk more unrest from Arabs (a point which caused much resentment towards the British among Jews during the period), since they were the ones taking the fall for the Arabs' unrest in the form of the Arab Revolt of the late 30s and other unrest.  This factored into the political discussions in Britain at the time, but ultimately didn't matter.

The perhaps-more-important example is the Evian conference, where a whole bunch of countries met to try and figure out where to send Jewish refugees.  They all seemed to agree that the Jews should be helped in leaving, but no one would actually take them, with the exception of the Dominican Republic.  But by the time that could be arranged, the war had begun.

For during the war, the Jews were trapped behind German lines--there wasn't a whole lot that could be done.  The only thing that could've been was bombing the camps, which the Allies decided wasn't in the best interest of ending the war.  Additionally, the death camps, whose bombing would've saved the largest number of people, were in Poland, relatively out of range of the US and British bombing runs I think.

&gt;Also, lets say there were Germans who were against the genocide, but did nothing about it. Why would they not help?

Personal risk, I assume.  There actually was a successful protest by a bunch of German women at the deportation of their Jewish husbands--the men were spared.  But that doesn't mean people would've felt safe protesting, especially if it wasn't their family.

Additionally, the Nazis took pains to attempt to have the genocide occur behind closed doors, so-to-speak.  Even if it was pretty obvious to Germans what was occurring (though how obvious is subject to some debate), it wasn't something most Germans would've had to come face-to-face with regularly.",null,1,cdmc7xl,1rdtld,askhistorians,top_week,4

Vincenti,"In 1913, Hitler left Vienna (where he had often been homeless and destitute) for Germany, at the age of 24. He had no job or permanent residence. He had failed to be accepted into art school after attempting the tests, and though he knew he had a good chance of being accepted to architecture school, he never applied. 

While he had always had a personal longing for Germany, it's likely he left Austria for Germany at the time he did to avoid compulsory military service. Not as an act of cowardice, but because he found it repulsive to have a military where Slavs, Jews, and other minority races of the Austro-Hungarian empire could serve. Since 1910, at age 21, Hitler had been subject to compulsory military service in Austria, but authorities had been unable to locate him while he lived in Vienna; unsurprising since he had no permanent residence or employment. He was later found by authorities in Munich and was examined in Salzburg in 1914 and found unfit for service due to poor health.

On August 3, 1914 he petitioned King Ludwig III of Bavaria to be able to volunteer in a Bavarian regiment, and his request was granted. By all accounts he served bravely and proficiently, receiving both the Iron Cross First and Second Class, and was wounded twice. He was in hospital recovering from a gas attack when the news came of the Kaiser's abdication and thus the defeat of Germany in WWI. Interestingly, though he served in the war and lived in Germany for some years, he did not become a German citizen until he had risen greatly in German politics, in order to be eligible for the Chancellorship.

I can't recall how he managed to get accepted, but I know Ian Kershaw goes into it in his book, *Hitler*, though I don't have it available at the moment.

Islamic law is different from the Western application of law in that it is not codified. Unlike the Western legal tradition where there are a set of rules that are generally applied the same way throughout, Islamic law is more about a way of living. Qadis were there to settle disputes on a case-by-case basis (generally following a certain school of law tradition like the Hanafi or the Hanbali), finding authority in the Quran and the Sunna. Most of the time, traditionally, they would obtain an opinion from a specialized legal jurist and they would rule according to that opinion. 

There are a lot of books and articles on this sort of thing. Most of the information that I put down comes from my reading of Wael Hallaq, a professor from Columbia University who specializes in Islamic Law.

In regards to bombing it turned Germany into a living hell.  The Dehousing Bombing Campaign (Terror Bombing) destroyed a majority of houses in dozens of German cities.  A huge % of Germany's population ended up homeless and the bombing was pretty relentless.  However, again according to Ian Kershaw, the bombing didn't cripple the German economy.

I'm not sure if you have heard, but the New Museum of Contemporary Art is in the process of opening an incubator aimed at young creative professionals next door to its building in New York City.  I am curious to hear your thoughts about a museum collecting entrepreneurs. Do you think this is within the purview of the museum as an institutional type?

How do you feel about the increasing overlap of the spheres of private collection and cultural institution? Do private museums like the Pinault Foundation's Punta Della Dogana, the Broad's upcoming building in LA, or the Deste Foundation expand public encounters with contemporary art/artists, or is it enforcing a ""Top 40"" phenomenon, reducing the diversity that comes with a specific institutional mission?

gnomemania,"Good afternoon Dr. Potts,

I am interested in the idea of restoring and displaying art that is uncovered via noninvasive x-ray imaging. For example, earlier this year, the Getty had a mock-up of Rembrandt’s *Old Man in Military Costume* transported and scanned to see if they could obtain a better image of an underlying portrait. If the hidden painting was such that it could be recreated or restored somehow, do you feel that preliminary work has a place in the museum, too, or only the finished product? And what causes a museum to look for hidden works behind an established painting, other than noticing the under layers during restoration? I think the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam did their entire collection and found a good percentage contained underlying works – would the Getty ever do the same (if it hasn't already)?

First off, let me say that I love the Getty Center. Especially after the renovation, it has been one of my favorite places to visit in the LA area.

1. How has the Getty tried to compete with the uprising of modern art and galleries like the MOMA and MOCA? Personally, I love Renaissance art which is not easy to come by in LA. 

2. I work for a small company that sells stone supplies and the Getty Trust is one of our customers. Does the Getty intentionally purchase from small businesses in the area as opposed to big box stores? It's a noble effort if so.

There was a show of many of them up at Pepperdine earlier this year that was stunning and it drove home for me what a gap there is in the collection and display up at the Getty.

For example, earlier this year, the Getty had a mock-up of Rembrandt’s *Old Man in Military Costume* transported and scanned to see if they could obtain a better image of an underlying portrait. If the hidden painting was such that it could be recreated or restored somehow, do you feel that preliminary work has a place in the museum, too, or only the finished product? And what causes a museum to look for hidden works behind an established painting, other than noticing the under layers during restoration? I think the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam did their entire collection and found a good percentage contained underlying works – would the Getty ever do the same (if it hasn't already)? 

Thank you for doing this AMA. I hope you've enjoyed your first year at the Getty. ",null,0,cdms06d,1re3pm,askhistorians,top_week,3

First off, let me say that I love the Getty Center. Especially after the renovation, it has been one of my favorite places to visit in the LA area.

1. How has the Getty tried to compete with the uprising of modern art and galleries like the MOMA and MOCA? Personally, I love Renaissance art which is not easy to come by in LA. 

2. I work for a small company that sells stone supplies and the Getty Trust is one of our customers. Does the Getty intentionally purchase from small businesses in the area as opposed to big box stores? It's a noble effort if so.

gingerkid1234,"Because they weren't starting from scratch.  It's a very common misconception that Israel was willed into existence by the Western powers and UN, but that's the final chapter of how Israel came to exist.  That's what I suspect you're talking about when you say that it ""popped into existence and immediately had independence declared upon it"" (though I think you have a typo in there, which I corrected based on what I think you meant).  Independence had been hoped for for decades, and the Jewish community declared it.  Granted, it was with the international go-ahead (kind-of), but it wasn't externally controlled.

As a consequence, the Jewish community had various paramilitaries, which had previously been involved in circumventing British restrictions on immigration, fighting the British, and fighting the Arabs.  Jewish-Arab violence had been ungoing since the 1920s  The largest and most mainstream of these, the Haganah, essentially became the IDF, with the other, more radical ones eventually folded in (though not without problems).  This meant that there was a significant proportion of local Jews who already had a command infrastructure and weapons.

An additional smaller point is that the war of independence didn't begin overnight.  Violence had been escalating for the decade-ish prior.  Once the UN voted to partition, the British essentially stopped being one of the sides in the conflict, and the Jewish-Arab violence intensified.  While the nearby Arab countries didn't invade until independence, the war was very much under way.  It wasn't just various guerilla attacks, either, though neither side was fighting with a recognized (or even declared) state.  See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine).

On the political end, things were controlled by the Jewish National Council (together with the Jewish Agency), which was sort of a representative body for the Jewish community in Palestine during the British Mandatory period.  It functioned as sort of a proto-government, and became the provisional government of Israel until elections were held post-war.  There were other national institutions around, such as the Histadrut, the Jewish labor union in Palestine.

The main reason is because we have a long standing history of poor children attending school in America without a consistent source of funding for their schooling, and their families could not afford uniforms. 

1. Schools are local affairs in America and essentially always have been, and receive relatively little overarching influence from either a state or a federal level. Modern American schools are organized on a “school district” level, which is *loosely* by county but not strictly limited to that boundary. In my hometown we had 2 major school districts, who were pretty different in terms of policy but neither had uniforms, and a private school, which did have uniforms. Decisions about uniforms/no uniforms are made on a local district level. [Funding for schools was historically sort of cobbled together from taxes, subscriptions from parents (sliding scale), and charities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hdsww/in_america_before_the_true_establishment_of/) If uniforms would have been adopted by an early school in 19th century America, funding for these special school clothes would have had to fall on the parents, and many on the low income scale couldn’t have afforded it. Most clothes for poor children in the 19th century would have been cut-down from used adult clothes[1], a poor mother would have had to buy fabric and make a uniform for each child, which was just not viable. Cheap ready-made clothing wasn’t available to most people until the beginning of the 20th century. 

2. So we’ve got the possibility for uniforms with cheap ready-made factory clothes at the start of the 20th century or so, but where are they? Now we must look at America’s widespread rural poverty. I’m talking the classic, walked-uphill-both-ways-in-the-snow, working on the farm in the summer, one room schoolhouse 1920s Depression schooling going on in this rural poverty. This might be a bit of a mind-bender, but current school children (maybe 5-10 year olds) in many parts of America are only about 3 generations away from a one-room schoolhouse. (So the great-grandchildren of people who went to school in a one-room schoolhouse.) Either my grandparents and their generation (people now in their 80s-90s) would have gone to school in their normal clothes or they wouldn’t have gone at all. Families in my area in the Midwest (which is relatively rural) simply could not have afforded school uniforms prior to maybe the 1950s, and old habits (and cultural memories of poor times) die hard. 

3. The first public school district to adopt uniforms in the US was [The Long Beach Unified School District in 1994.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach_Unified_School_District#School_uniforms_and_single_gender_classes) It’s almost 2014 so I’ll squeak it in with the 20-year-rule, but it very well demonstrates that public school uniforms (requiring a relatively high amount of disposable income for the majority of school families PLUS a good ready-made market) have only been a viable option pretty recently in American history.

And, it was primarily the (dying) Prince Albert's intervention that settled the Trent Affair down without dragging Britain into the Civil War.

The opinion in the Confederacy was that they would receive British recognition because of cotton; unfortunately for the Confederacy, Indian cotton was beginning to come on-line (the Suez Canal, though, did not open until 1869).  What I did **not** realize until answering this question was that the British were importing significant amounts of wheat from the North.

Moreover, what did the British really have to gain from recognizing Mason &amp; Slidell?  If the Confederacy had been successful in achieving their goals, plenty of time then to recognize them.  Until then, why buy into trouble?

BeondTheGrave,"Two suggestions, narrow your topic and then read as much as you can stand. 

On narrowing your topics, most history books (even textbooks!) pick a specific period, region, or event to discuss. Take, for example, a book I once read concerning the history of the United Kingdom from 1815-1914. And the follow up was a book on the growth of the welfare system, 1945-1989. The problem with bigger books (I think) like the ""History of the Western World"" type books are that they gloss over so much, youll probably not get much out of them. Even more important is making a real connection with what youre reading. If you like Rome, read about that. If youre into political history, read about that. Hell, if youre into music, read about that! 

And that brings up another big point, history is a lot of reading. There are really cool podcasts out there to listen to, /r/lectures, /r/documentaries , but history really is based primarily in reading.

So my question to you is, what are you interested in? ",null,0,cdmc9q1,1re5ge,askhistorians,top_week,1
SplendourFalls,"Well, the costumes and props are generally pretty solid, which is a big step up from Braveheart which featured some bizarre and completely invented wardrobes. 

The 'One tyrant 3000 miles away, or 3000 tyrants one mile away?' quote is also a real one, though it's attributed to a loyalist, clergyman Mather Byles.

Also there's a scene where Mel Gibson uses his kids as child soldiers - this happened, on both sides. 

The nature of warfare is simplified, but fairly enough for a movie - it's emphasised that the Continental Army cannot go, as Gibson puts it, 'muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats' but the militia can have great success by turning to guerrilla tactics. This is the kind of thing you might find in a school textbook. It's a simplification, but it's not a crime. The Continental Army did beat the British Army in set-piece battles, sometimes without French help.

On the other hand:

Slaves who fought for the Continental Army were not freed and were not paid - both happen in the film. Slaves who fought for the British *were* freed in accordance with Dunmore's Proclamation of 1775. The Declaration of Independence does hint at this. One of the grievances against the Crown is that the 1775 emancipation 'excited domestic insurrections' - colonial slave-owners feared a revolt. 

After the war, of course, many freed slaves fell back into slavery unless they had made their way to England. For their part the British certainly didn't help them as much as they could have, and abandoned many freed blacks to their fate in the South when they began to pull out of the colonies. 

The contribution of the French was vastly underplayed but it really was too much to hope for them to be fairly represented in a patriotic Hollywood film. 

The episode where the moustache-twirling, Disney-villain Brits lock innocent civilians in a church and burn it down is also complete fiction and was inspired by the [Oradour-sur-Glane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oradour-sur-Glane) massacre of *1944*.  

That being said, the attitude of the British towards captured Americans is reasonably accurate. Captured Americans were not regarded as prisoners of war as, like the Brits say, they are legally traitors, given how 'international law' worked at the time. Americans weren't regarded as prisoners of war until 1782, one year before the end of the war.

However it's important to note, despite being declared traitors, the official policy was still to negotiate a settlement to the war and, wanting to avoid alienating the Americans, the British avoided hanging the captured, though the conditions prisoners were kept in were inhumane to say the least and several thousand died of neglect or disease. 

I don't really think I need to go into Mel Gibson cutting down innumerable redcoats with a tomahawk. 

The real-life inspiration for Gibson's character (Francis Marion) was less of a principled, moral man and more of a psychopath with a reputation for raping his slaves and killing Indians for fun, but as it's not explicitly stated that Martin is based on Marion we can let that pass. 

The final battle, where Cornwallis is defeated in South Carolina, is fictitious. It's inspired by the Battle of the Cowpens, where similar tactics that you see in the movie were used by the Continental Army and militia to score a victory over the British.

SplendourFalls,"At the time - 1789 - Gibbon's book was controversial for its scathing attack on the Church and how it had, he argued, destructively supplanted traditional Roman culture. The adoption of Christianity is upheld as one of the leading causes of the downfall of Roman civilisation and Gibbon implies Christianity is responsible for the 'societal decline' that followed the collapse of Roman power. 

Nowadays it's controversial because Gibbon, and Chapter XV in particular, is one of the progenitors of the 'Christian Dark Ages' myth which you still see trumpeted around on /r/atheism and other less informed subreddits, all over the internet and throughout many amateur historical discussions and debates about religion - this myth that Christianity somehow suppressed scientific progress and stifled learning, and that the whole post-Roman period was an age of backwardness and general decaying of society overseen by a monolithic and tyrannical Church, which is categorically untrue at  best and downright laughable at worst.

The myth still exists because it's a popular one and it *does* get taught to schoolchildren in black-and-white, two-dimensional history curricula where everything is neatly divided into periods. I'm not necessarily against that, but when you start really getting into history, one of the most important things to do is abandon this idea of the 'Dark Ages' because at a serious historical level the idea just does not hold up.

This was after the 1944 constitutional reforms that allowed each republic to have its own branch of the Red Army, constitution, etc. Technically speaking, Belarus sort of joined the Soviet Union on its own--obviously there was coercion going on, but it wasn't just taken over and absorbed. In 1991, Belarus wasn't a constituent republic of the USSR anymore because the USSR didn't exist, so it went solo and now it's an independent country.

Some speculation: Stalin might have used it to sort of placate the Kyrgyz and prevent a possible uprising, or he might have decided that trying to Russify them was too much trouble, and he might as well just let them have an autonomous SSR and leave it at that. This second idea is problematic because it raises the question of why Tatarstan (similarly Turkic-speaking, Muslim, and fiercely proud of it) wasn't given an SSR. So basically, I don't know what happened with Kyrgyzstan. If there are any Central Asia experts here, come at me, because now I'm kind of curious.

I really can't speak to Tuva because I know nothing about it, but Chechnya is an interesting case. Chechnya has never been AT ALL happy about being part of Russia. The Russians have been bothering (read: invading) them since the turn of the 19th century. Ever since, whenever the Chechens think Russia is looking weak, there's an uprising to try to shake them off. Unsurprisingly, they declared independence in 1991, which Russia refused to recognize, and that's where you get the First Chechen War. The Russians manage to defeat them after protracted violence in 1996 (they basically had to raze Grozny), but war flared up again in 1999. Would it have been easier to let Chechnya go? Absolutely, but you have to take into consideration the situation in Russia during the Chechen Wars. During the First Chechen War, Yeltsin was in power, and the domestic situation in Russia was going to hell (crime everywhere, the Mafia, crashing economy, etc). Yeltsin didn't want to be perceived as weaker than he already was, so he pursued the Chechen War to demonstrate that he was still in charge. Likewise, Putin used the Second Chechen War to shore up his popularity and demonstrate that he wasn't going to mess around when it came to security/counterterrorism in Russia. Allowing Chechnya to be independent would have saved Russia a lot of trouble and soldiers, but it also would have created a radical Islamic state on Russia's border and made Russia look weak and pathetic at a time when it didn't need any more of that. 

So basically, there's no blanket answer to this question. It's a very complicated calculus of how states came into the USSR, how they exited, what their ethnic composition was, and their prerevolutionary history with Russia. ",null,0,cdndsrx,1reawl,askhistorians,top_week,1

Superplaner,"This question is perhaps better suited for askscience, at least in part. I will however do what I can to throw some light on the topic.

&gt; So if the cold war escalated to total nuclear war, what would happen?

MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) is the most likely case. Assuming one side launches a preemptive stirke, attempting to neutralize as much of the enemy strategic arsenal as possible. There is no real defence against an ICBM or SLBM. The ICBM is simply too fast and flies to high and the SLBM, while ""low and slow"" in so far as missiles go, is fired too close to the point of impact for an effective defense to be used. Even if the first strike was 100 % effective, neutralizing the entire land based strategic arsenal of the enemy, there are still enough mobile launchers (mainly submarines and aircraft in the US case, the USSR also had a significant number of mobile ICBM launchers). This ""second strike"" capability was sufficient to cause damage similar to the first strike, resulting in what is known as mutually assured destruction.

&gt; How many nukes were there to fire?

1982 figures:  
US figures: 2000 individual launchers, 11000 warheads for a total of 4100 megatonnes.

USSR figures: 2400 launchers, 10000 warheads for a total of 8200 megatonnes.

&gt; What cities would likely be targeted? 

Impossible to say for sure but assume that ALL major metropolitan areas (say 1M people or more) would be targeted in a second strike or tertiary retalitory strike. The US and USSR both had over 2000 launchers (methods of delivery capable of nuclear strike) during the cold war, most of these MRVs or MIRVs capable of carrying 10-12 warheads each. A single Trident can carry 12 warheads, each capable of individual targeting. A single missile can deliver 300 times the megatonage of the Hiroshima bomb. An Ohio Class submarine carries up to 24 of these. Meaning that it can deliver the equivalent destruction of 7200 Hiroshima bombs. There are 14 active Ohio class submarines with nuclear strike capabilities which puts the second strike capability at roughly 100000 times that of Hiroshima. Each warhead can be individually targeted meaning that a single Ohio class sub can take out upwards of 288 targets so long as they are relatively closely grouped (or 4000+ targets for the Ohio fleet in all). 

&gt; What would the suspected casualty rate be?

Essentially total. Tough the initial blasts may ""only"" kill a few hundred million (depending on what the target is) the resulting radiation, firestorms, fallout and nuclear winter would wipe out the vast majority of the worlds population of everything. 

The explosions and radiation aren't the real killers of a nuclear war, the fires are. What happens when an entire city is set ablaze is that massive amounts of particles are lifted high into the atmosphere, potentially remaining there for a very long time. This reduces the amount of sunlight that can penetrate the atmosphere, effectively cooling the earths surface.

The Journal of Geophysical Research published an interesting study in 2007 that mentions two scenarios, one with 150 Tg of particles, another with 50 Tgs. The 150 Tg scenario is projected to lower the temperature by up for 8 degrees (compare this to the last ice age which, at its coldest point, was only 5 degrees cooler than today). This would effectively make agriculture impossible in very large parts of the world, especially on a scale that can match the output we're seeing today. The effects would also be long lasting with an estimated temperature drop of -4 degrees even after a decade. The reduced temperature would also slow the hydrological cycle resulting in ~50 % less rainfall globally which further reduces agricultural potential. 

The same article mentions a 1986 study that points out that even the loss of agricultural output for one year would lead to the death of most of the human race. 

Exposure, starvation and dehydration would likely kill far more than the blasts and radition would, regardless of how far from the blasts you are. 

&gt; How would this nuclear bombardment affect the existence of governments in USSR, USA and other involved countries? Would it mean a potential total governmental collapse?

In essence a complete lack of government control. All non-shielded electronic devises would be knocked out as a result of the massive EMP shockwaves. Society would sieze to function almost immediately. Communication would be nearly impossible, especially on a large scale. With most major cities in flames, there would be little left to govern. 

&gt; What plans did these governments have in place if nuclear war did occur, were there plans for additional attacks such as naval or troop deployment?

MP3PlayerBroke,"While not a historian, I've always been fascinated by that period of history and learned about it here and there over the years.  My knowledge is limited and I can only address a few points.

The novel was based on Record of the Three Kingdoms (the historical text), A New Account of Tales of the World (which a Chinese teacher of mine described as tabloid stories of the time), as well as local stories that were popular among the people of the time.

A lot of the stories in the novel are made up, and some quotes from the original historical records were changed in the novel to skew characters a certain way.  For example, in the novel, Cao Cao says ""I'd rather do wrong to the rest of the world than have the rest of the world do wrong to me"" after he mistakenly killed the family of his father's friend.  The original historical text had fewer characters (as in words) and could have been interpreted in a few different ways, most of which don't necessarily paint him as this sociopath/egomaniac.

The novel had a skew in favor of Liu Bei's Shu Han regime as the legitimate regime of all China, on the grounds that Liu was a descendant of the Han imperial family.  The reason could have been that during the Ming Dynasty (when the novel was written), there was an emphasis on the legitimacy of Han rule over China, having just ended the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty.  The historical records, on the other hand, may have had a little pro-Cao bias because it was written during the Jin Dynasty, which was the successor to Cao's Wei regime.

Wikipedia has a list of [fictitious stories in the novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictitious_stories_in_Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms).

If you know Chinese, I recommend [this series of talks ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_xrYY3jLCw&amp;list=PLBKYZjqmKjb9YMxybfFGqIp0wa9Gdsgh2) that Professor Yi Zhongtian gave on the Three Kingdoms period.  In this series, Professor Yi goes over events and people from that period of history by looking at different sources, which include Record of the Three Kingdoms and its annotations by Pei Songzhi, as well as the novel.  He also gives his own professional opinions on what might have been an accurate explanation for things.  It's a long series that goes into a lot of details, such as how many times did Liu Bei really visit Zhuge Liang and who sought out who in the first place.

tobbinator,"In the Anarchist controlled areas of Catalonia and Aragón, the local government and police forces were dissolved and replaced by locally formed Committees made up of the local working population. Orwell describes that:
&gt; Along with the collectivization of industry and transport
there was an attempt to set up the rough beginnings of a workers'
government by means of local committees, workers' patrols to replace the
old pro-capitalist police forces, workers' militias based on the trade
unions, and so forth.

These worker patrols more or less replaced the local police operations, and were organised by the said revolutionary committees and the large trade unions, especially the CNT (the socialist UGT was more favourable of a central control by the Republican government). After the initial uprising, there were only 5,000 government armed men in Barcelona, compared to over 30,000 CNT militia (Thomas, Hugh. *The Spanish Civil War*). 

The anarchists aimed to reduce crime in their controlled areas by communicating with and collectivising workplaces in order to raise productivity and wages, hopefully deterring them from criminal activities, as well as these worker patrols to keep a watch over the streets. 

Justice was divided between the Republican government and the local committees, depending on the local allegiance. There isn't much detail (that I know of) on the processes for crime and punishment by the local committees, but I suspect the defendant in question's fate was put to a vote in the community. In the revolutionary areas held by the more Republican friendly revolutionaries (UGT, PCE aligned), the state often administered justice. Most criminals were imprisoned, and the International Brigades even operated their own prison camp with over 4,000 prisoners, Camp Lukácz ([source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3653035/A-revelatory-account-of-the-Spanish-civil-war.html)).

Commustar,"**West Africa**

   Everything I have read suggests that Roman trade on this front consisted of exchanging goods at Roman trading posts with berber traders of the Garamantes kingdom, centered in the Fezzan region of south-western Libya. 
   
   There seem to be two schools of thought on the Garamantes. One school of thought, as expressed by Katya Schorle in *Saharan Frontierss: Space and Mobility in Northwest Africa*
 in chapter 3 ""Saharan Trade in Classical Antiquity"" holds that the Garamantes were a centralized kingdom that established well regulated trade routes spanning from the Roman frontier to the Middle Niger region. This theory naturally lends credence to the idea of merchants making the entire trek from the region of Carthage all the way across the sahara to Djenne-Djeno.

On the other hand, Sonja Magnavita presents the view in [this article](http://afriques.revues.org/1145) that trade was ""down-the-line"". That is, that trade items were carried from oasis to oasis, where they changed hands many times. Thus, the merchant that brought the beads found at Kissi in Burkina Faso would be far removed from whomever first brought these beads south across the Roman frontier. 

Whatever is the truth, there is no written evidence that would suggest that a Roman trader would have made it deep into the Sahara. Although, an inventive explanation for that advanced by some scholars is that Roman and Byzantine merchants did not write down such travels, in order to maintain trade secrets.

Barring an extraordinary discovery of a written testimony, we won't be able to say conclusively that a Roman either did or did not travel deep into the Sahara.

**East Africa**

 We are much more fortunate in our sources here. The *Periplus of the Erythrean Sea* is a travelogue that discusses the coasts of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, focusing on the ports, cultures and trade items likely to be encountered. The Periplus most likely dates to the mid-1st century CE, and its author seems to from Roman Egypt. 

The Periplus describes ports beyond the horn of africa, and down the coast of East Africa (which the author locates as ""Azania""). It is somewhat difficult to be certain where the locations referred to are located now. Unfortunately, there has been a decided lack of archaeological research about this time period in Eastern Africa.

However, some circumstantial support for the Periplus is the fact that there have been finds of Roman trade items along the western coast of India, and even some indications of Roman contact along the eastern coast of India. So, it certainly seems feasible that the Romans may have reached the coast of East Africa, perhaps as far as Mogadishu or even further.",null,0,cdojayb,1rek43,askhistorians,top_week,2
Samuel_Gompers,"First, taxes do not equal communism. One can support all sorts of left-wing ideas and not be a communist; in fact, you can be virulently *anti*-communist. There is no transitive property in public policy, as useful a propaganda tool as that idea may be. There are many examples of groups within the post-war American liberal coalition fracturing over the issue of Communism, such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations and, more specifically, the United Auto Workers. To look more politically, the Democratic Party split three ways in 1948, first over the issue of race, leading to Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats, and second (among many reasons) over the issue of how the United States should deal with communism and the Soviet Union, leading to Henry Wallace and the Progressive Party. 

Second, American public policy changed drastically during World War II. There are several ways to pay for a war, which includes borrowing money, raising taxes, and printing money. During WWII, the U.S. government preferred the first two options, relying on significant hikes in marginal tax rates and borrowing money from the American public through War Bonds. Remember also that there are multiple types of taxes, not just the income tax they talk about in ""Mad Men"" (my favorite show, by the way). Corporate taxes also went up during the war, both as a method of funding and as an attempt to prevent profiteering. Many of these taxes remained in place in some form or another after the war in an attempt to bring down the debt the Government had incurred. To another degree, these taxes were also used to fund the expanded programs of the post-New Deal state, though signature programs like Social Security often had their own dedicated taxes outside of the standard income tax.

Additionally, it is important to bear in mind the difference between the marginal tax rate (and to know what marginal rates mean) and the effective tax rate. Basically, though someone's income may have put them in a bracket where part of their income was taxed at above 90 percent, through various deductions and loopholes, as well as the fact that marginal rates by definition only apply to part of one's income, the effective total rates were much lower than the highest marginal rate was. It is even more important to know that there were **many** more income brackets as far as personal income taxes were concerned. For example, in 2013, there were seven tax brackets; in 1944, there were **twenty four**. Additionally, the vast majority of these tax brackets were well above the median income; incomes in the highest brackets were also very rare.  In 1947 (this is as early as Census info goes), median income was approximately $3000. This would put the median family in the *second* tax bracket, again, out of ***twenty four***, the marginal rate of which was 22 percent. The *vast* majority of Americans were not affected by the tax rates which the elite class, which ""Mad Men"" for the most part portrays, paid.

Now, there was always resistance to this type of policy from a traditional, conservative movement within the Republican Party which opposed such taxes and programs on principle, though would begrudgingly accept them to do things like pay off war debt. This faction of the Republican Party, however, was out of power for most of the mid-20th century. For a good history of the changing nature of American political coalitions, [see these two comments here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nolzz/why_was_there_such_a_huge_shift_in_the_core/cckrkh5). The key was that conservatives also favored decreases in spending. New ideas in economics, however, namely E. Cary Brown's concept of a full employment budget, led to a push to cut taxes from the left. There is very bad trend of polemic history which calls John F. Kennedy conservative, for example, because he cut taxes. Kennedy did indeed pass the largest tax cut in decades, but the motivation was to fix what he called a ""growth deficit"" (IIRC, I can pull out an econ history notebook if I really have to) by stimulating consumer demand while maintaining levels of government spending. I think it was Paul Samuelson who Kennedy sent to Congress to plead that taxes be cut without commensurate cuts in spending. This type of demand side, Keynesian tax cut, however, focused on the lowest brackets and not only kept a large number of brackets, but kept rates within the top ones at high levels. 

If you really want me to talk about the way Reagan type conservatives cut taxes with supply side justifications (though Reagan's rhetoric, if not policy, often echoed demand side reasoning), I will consider it.

It's true that much of Western historiography on Communist leaders like Stalin or Mao are very little more than propaganda pieces - intentional or not, but not very accurate all the same. Upon realising this, some people look towards non-western or non-mainstream views on the subject - but these often just swing in the opposite direction. I've actually got a book here called 'A different view on Stalin'. While it does dispel some of the myths about the man propagated in mainstream historiography, it's also blatantly written by a Stalinist looking to whitewash history. While I'm not saying the answer is in the middle (it's not), when reading about Mao you'll have to be acutely aware of the controversial nature of pretty much every work about him. Look for works by authors that don't have a point to prove (either way) - a good rule of thumb is to look for the most boring works. Historians that are devoted to the Rules of Historiography(tm) tend to pay close attention to their personal bias, even though they are problematic in their own right.

Keep in mind that the only reason the UN was able to intervene in such a massive way in Korea was because the Soviet Union was boycotting the United Nations at that time as a result of a conflict over the proper representation of China at the UN.

That being said, there were a number of smaller interventions, including:

* Lebanon (1958)
* Yemen (1963)
* Cyprus (1964)
* India/Pakistan (1965)

* Suez (1973)
* Golan Heights (1974)

Starting off with a hunter-gatherer environments, it is a common misconception that the work week was longer than is it today.  Even including work that would not be classified as hunting or gathering, the average workday would be well below 5 hours! [1]  There would only be a few (2 to 4) days that would be considered a workday as well.  So for the average week, there would be 8 to 16 hours of work accomplished.  Richard Lee describes a hunter-gatherer environment where ""They spent between twelve and nineteen hours per week obtaining food, devoting their ample leisure to social interactions, ritual dancing and the creation of glorious rock art."" [1a]

Jumping forward to the industrial revolution, the workweek was extended greatly from before.  Were workers before were bound to the day/night cycle, now the workers could work into the hours of darkness.  Another factor is that most jobs now did not depend on the season, and could be done year round.  It is common to hear of schedules consisting of six grueling 16 hour days in a single week. [2]

Labor laws, unions, as well as a strong movement my Henry Ford (who believed in a shorter work hours) gradually caused the amount of work hours in a week roughly get cut in half and doubling the average wage at the time.  Henry Ford was a large catalyst in American culture, setting the example for other work centers.  [3]

Each culture treats breaks in the week in a different way.  A very common cause is religion.  Most of the western world is Monday-Friday (or Saturday), with Sunday set aside for the traditional day of the Sabbath.  Several Muslim countries work Sunday-Thursday or Saturday- Wednesday due to Friday’s prayer, Jumu'ah.

 I know in medieval Europe the weekend started with a half day on Sabbath's eve, followed by a day of rest for the Sabbath Day. Church services would often be that evening, with the following full day off dedicated as a day of rest. There were also around 30 Feast days each year, with work ending early the day before and the Feast day itself being a day off. Around 82 days off and 82 half days, versus a modern 104 full days off for weekends (plus any vacation time). Medievals also worked a lot less in winter.

 The shorter weekend probably sounds harsh to many modern people, but when I think of how many busy activities most of us try to cram into a weekend versus a full day of rest I'm not sure the medievals didn't have a lot more actual down time.

 The Romans didn't have a weekend, but they did have a lot of feast days, so many that some months were essentially half months.

leavenworth,"[Sir William Stanley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_(Battle_of_Bosworth), the younger son of the 1st Baron Stanley, basically made a career out of reversals. 

He was a soldier during the War of the Roses. His family was aligned with the Lancasters; however, over several decades, William helped the Yorks defeat the Lancasters, then helped the Tudors defeat the Yorks, and then finally was caught conspiring against Henry Tudor. He and his brother, Thomas, had a reputation for staying firmly in one camp throughout the whole war, and that camp was Camp Stanley. 

Background: the War of the Roses centered around two lines in the House of Plantagenet. There were the Yorks, whose herald was a [white rose](http://www.scottish-country-dancing-dictionary.com/images/white-rose-of-york.jpg), and the Lancasters, whose herald was a [red rose](http://www.jewelsdujour.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Roseof-Lancaster.jpg). Towards the end of the war, the throne passed back and forth between [Henry VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England) of Lancaster and [Edward IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England) of York, with Henry ruling until 1461, then Edward ruling from 61 to 70, then Henry coming back and ruling from 70 to 71, and then Edward returning and ruling until 1483. In 1471, William Stanley captured Margaret of Anjou, Henry VI's wife and a major Lancaster player. He was a Yorkist hero and received land and honors under Edward. He continued to be well regarded under Edward's brother, the next king of England, Richard III, who took the throne in 1483.

Right after Richard took the throne, a guy named [Henry Tudor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England) began gaining support. He had a Lancaster claim through his mother, and soon was betrothed to Edward IV's eldest daughter Elizabeth, Richard III's niece, and a York. (When he was crowned and they were married, he created [a new Herald for House Tudor, a white and red rose](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Tudor_Rose.jpg). Symbolism!) It became increasingly clear that Henry Tudor was planning on taking the throne. William was still considered a staunch Yorkist, but his older brother, Thomas, was married to Henry Tudor's mom, so Richard III was a little worried about where the Stanley's allegiance might lie in the upcoming battles. He stripped her of her titles and gave them to Thomas Stanley, thinking that would appease the brothers. 

Henry Tudor's and Richard III's armies met at the Battle of Bosworth in August of 1485. The Stanley brothers were summoned by both sides before the battle, but they deferred, preferring to see where the winds blew on that specific day. Richard III actually wrote to Thomas Stanley and warned him that he had his eldest son and heir and that he would execute him if the Stanleys did not show up for battle. In an epic ""oh snap"" moment, Thomas wrote back, ""Sire - I have other sons."" During the Battle, Richard III decided to defeat Henry himself, and went after him. His guard was outnumbered and he was separated from the rest of his large army; seeing this, our good friend William Stanley decided he was a loyal Lancaster after all and joined Henry Tudor's forces with his men. Richard III was unhorsed - unlike Shakespeare's Richard, however, the real Richard III was offered several horses and turned them all down before he was killed by Henry Tudor's forces.

William Stanley, now a Lancaster/Tudor hero, once again enjoyed a very comfortable, even wealthier position. The new king Henry VII gave him *more* honors and lands, including the post of [Lord Chamberlain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain). But you know that bit of advice you always give people when they date someone who is in a relationship? ""If they're cheating on their current partner with you, then they're probably going to cheat on you with someone else""? Yeah, Henry VII learned that about ten years later, when William was accused of conspiring to help [Perkin Warbeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkin_Warbeck) overthrow Henry VII. 

Who was Perkin Warbeck? Without getting too much into it, Richard III had [two nephews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_in_the_Tower) who'd had a better claim on the throne than him, who mysteriously disappeared about three months after their father, Edward IV's, death. They were most likely killed, but this has never been confirmed, so Warbeck was one of the people who popped up claiming to be royalty (kind of like a [Anna Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Anderson)/Anastasia situation). Anyway, Sir William admitted that if Warbeck was Edward IV's real son, then he wouldn't take arms against him and suggested that, sure, maybe Warbeck had a claim to the crown. Since his brother, Thomas, was still in good standing, it's possible that Sir William thought himself safe; however, Henry VII was worried about the message such lenience would send, and so William Stanley was executed as a traitor. 

Or, more accurately, William Stanley was executed for being a traitor for the wrong side, because the other two times actually went pretty well for him. ",null,4,cdmtogu,1rf8su,askhistorians,top_week,13
Spinoza42,"The liberal turn of the British Quakers was quite a reversal. In the 1850s and 1860s the British Quakers had started to move towards a more Evangelical position. Members who questioned the importance of the Bible or of Jesus' resurrection were censured or sometimes removed from the Society. Meetings that had been mostly or completely silent for years or decades were stirred up by inspired speakers, who refocused the Quakers' attention to the Bible and the figure of Jesus.

But by 1920 the British Quakers had completely turned this around. For many Christianity became not much more than heritage, and the British Yearly Meeting as a whole began to accept that such a view existed within it. Quakerism became more of a way of life than a message. 

This stunning reversal of fortunes of the liberals and the evangelicals can be explained by a third group which switched its allegiance: the traditionalists. Early on the traditionalists had supported the evangelicals, fearing that the liberal criticisms of Bible and Jesus would destroy the Quakers as a Christian organization. The evangelicals' support of reading the bible in meeting, and other forms of more ""programmed"" meeting might be constructed as innovation, but if it would ensure that ""unsound"" doctrine would be compensated by sound and Christian religion, then so be it.

But the evangelicals overplayed their hand. In 1887 American Evangelical Quakers had made a joint statement, the Richmond Declaration. In 1888 this statement was submitted to the British Yearly Meeting, where it met with resistance. The declaration was seen as a creed, and as giving too little recognition of the inner light. This marked a turning point for the traditionalists, who came to see the evangelicals as a greater threat to the Quaker identity than the liberals. Over the next thirty years British Quakerism would be modernized spectacularly, and completely change its relationship to the rest of Christianity and the wider world.

The question remains whether this movement would have happened without the Richmond Declaration as well. The modern world was challenging all Christian denominations, which meant that sooner or later all of them had to choose to either accept modernity or contrast themselves to it. That the British Quakers chose to largely accept it is surprising, and that they largely rejected the evangelical spirit of the third great awakening is altogether baffling. The discussion of the Richmond Declaration really seems to be a turning point.",null,3,cdmxvxw,1rf8su,askhistorians,top_week,11
sn0wdizzle,"One of the most important changes in New Deal history was when United States Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts systematically switched voting blocs and started consistently voting to uphold New Deal legislation.

[Prior to the this switch, the Supreme Court had struck down most of FDR's 'first New Deal.'](http://www.dlt.ncssm.edu/lmtm/docs/newdeal/script.pdf) This annoyed FDR so greatly that he proposed a law which would allow the President to appoint six additional justices (for a maximum of 12), one for every sitting justice older than 70.5. The move was incredibly controversial and it caused significant grief to him at the time. He wasn't deterred however and tasked future SC justice Robert Jackson to write a book defending the President's power to do this from a legal and historical stand point. Instead of backing down, he doubled down.

So anyway, the bill goes forward and ultimately is killed with a 70-20 vote (which sent it back to the committee). This happened on July 22, 1937. Even though FDR lost the legislative battle to 'pack the court,' he won the Court because in *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish* Justice Roberts (decision published that spring) switched from generally voting with the conservative bloc to voting with the liberal bloc. In the rest of cases for that SC term, Roberts voted with the pro FDR bloc, voting to uphold as constitutional little programs like the NLRA and twice, the social security tax.

If you've heard of it, you know it as the switch in time that saved nine.  What is regrettable, however, is that we don't know why he switched as he, like Hugo Black, burned most of his notes^1.  Was he concerned for institutional integrity? Did he want to be on team Roosevelt? There is speculation in [Feldman's Scorpions] (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/books/review/ACohen-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) that it was institutional legitimacy (I'll make sure when I return home) and that is one of the more recent good sources on the issue.

LordSariel,"Many people don't know this, but the initial Franco-American Alliance of 1778 was not a planned event.

Benjamin Franklin, and his fellow diplomats Silas Deane and Arthur Lee, were sent to France with a ""Model Treaty"" draft that was ratified by Congress in 1776. This draft, and the orders that accompanied it, explicitly stated that the Commissioners to Paris were to seek a commercial alliance with France. In the minds of Congress, this commercial diplomacy would infuse the American cause with some much needed money, and simultaneously increase American credit abroad. Ideally this would allow for money to build and crew ships to protect an increase in shipping, as well as allow the United States to purchase supplies on their own in Europe. To compound this, Congress deliberately tried to avoid any entanglement in the complex web of European affairs, hoping for a purely capitalist alliance.

However upon arrival in France, the Commissioners were woefully unprepared to meet this steep task, and the virtually non-existent U.S. navy was scarcely a match for the British domination of the High Seas. So, in an unprecedented change of tact, Franklin pursued, and successfully negotiated, a political alliance in addition to the commercial one. This explicitly brought France into the war on behalf of the United States, but was on friendly terms, and without sacrificing too much autonomy of the nascent American Union. More importantly, Franklin did this without the knowledge of the Congress, who had not received any of his dispatches 11 months, prompting some historians to call the diplomacy ""the great improvisation.""",null,3,cdn8eae,1rf8su,askhistorians,top_week,8
FeatofClay,"""A color barrier"" (to me) suggests a situation where a significant number of athletes in an ethnic group are playing the sport, but are being kept out of leagues due to bias.  Hockey presents a different situation.  Hockey is not a very ethnically diverse sport; there aren't that many black hockey players at any level.  Therefore I think it's an open question whether it's access to the sport, or racial bias, that keeps black players out of the NHL.  

The first black hockey player in the NHL, Willie O'Ree, joined the roster in 1958, which was certainly later than the MLB and NBA dates.  There has been plenty written about the racially-oriented abuse he got from fans.

earthpresidentnixon,"I apologize if this reads as a bit cobbled-together but I hope it's at least in the direction of what you're looking for. My main sources are Nicholas Sammond's Babes in Tomorrowland and Steven Watts' The Magic Kingdom, but most criticism of ""classic"" Disney films usually has a lot of interesting history as well. I also recommend Richard Schickel.

The image of Disney that both he and his company worked so hard to perpetuate is that the man embodied ""essentially American values."" Sammond includes a very interesting quote from Fortune magazine in 1934, which profiled Disney and described him as combining Abraham Lincoln's humble origins and work ethic, Horatio Alger's entrepreneurial determination, and Henry Ford's industrial efficiency and management. His early animation-- here I'm referencing everything from the 1920s until 1937-- is characterized by a number of conventions, particularly sentimentality and the satirization of high cultural signifiers. Essentially, the themes of Disney's films were populist. Disney was ""one of us""-- he didn't go in for the highbrow and elitist, his interests and preoccupations were folksy, humorous, and common, and the sources of much of his stories were popular folklore. (Even the phrase ""Silly Symphonies"" suggests highbrow entertainment being brought to a popular level.) 

Consider the role of the movie theater in 1920s and 1930s America: this was a cheap form of entertainment that was not only accessible by, but hugely popular with, every class. The most popular stars of the era were those who frequently played down-on-their-luck characters: Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Shirley Temple (a bit later). This was a format that was constructing ""American-ness"" while simultaneously perpetuating it: self-denial and delayed gratification, hard work, consistent humour supplemented by emotional depth. However, early films were ""immoral,"" the lives of movie stars famously dissolute (Fatty Arbuckle in 1922, the introduction of the Hays Code in 1930), and there was a tremendous debate about the role and influence of these films on the minds of young people (a particularly influential study from 1932 compared the effect of movies on the minds of young people to the effect of World War I on the minds of combatants). What's important here is that people believed that the types of films children saw would influence the type of people those children would become.

Enter Disney, who provides reliably moral, genuinely entertaining film that quickly becomes very technologically sophisticated and appears to perpetuate real American values: not only of the success of scrappy underdogs and the virtues of thrift and perseverance in his films, but also through the image of himself perpetuated through a staggering amount of product licensing, even in the mid-thirties. Disney characters were mischievous, certainly, but they were clean and happy, romantic yet sexless. Mickey Mouse's eyeballs never popped out of his head when big titted Minnie sang jazz, for example. Basically, if your kids went to see Disney films, they might grow up to become like him, so you were quite happy to let them spend their afternoons at the theater. Magazines like Photoplay profiled him quite breathlessly. It also really is hard to overstate his influence on film and animation technology, but also on the general shape of film narrative: if you take a bit of time to watch pre-1928 animation on Youtube (1928 = the release of Steamboat Willie), it really is astonishing how, well, primitive and even amateur it appears compared to even Disney's earliest work. Tex Avery and Chuck Jones, who worked on Looney Tunes for Warner Bros in the thirties, did great work, but in general it was a case of other studios desperately trying to keep up with Disney. Max Fleischer (Betty Boop) is pretty much the only person who could come close, and he didn't have the marketing strength of the Disney Studio behind him.

Also, the image the studio perpetuated of itself in the thirties played a significant role in the public perception of Disney the man. The studio workers were simultaneously depicted as (I'm borrowing Sammond's words here) ""models of industrial efficiency [and] members of one big, happy family, with Walt as their avuncular leader."" The Fordist philosophy of manufacturing was of course still very much the ideal at that time, so imagine the significance of the Disney Studio during the Great Depression: a success story both in terms of industrial output and the warmth and sentimentality of family life. The release of Snow White sort of cemented everything, too: it was a huge artistic gamble, and still remains one of the most successful animated films of all time in terms of artistic influence (Sergei Eisenstein and Orson Welles both cited it as an influence).

Basically, what you have so far is: Disney's concept of himself as a quintessential American artist-manufacturer, relentlessly marketed. He undoubtedly believed it himself, and for the most part it was true.

Continuing briefly into the fifties and sixties, when the Studio's animated films were uneven and sometimes floundering, Disney himself hosted tv shows like The Wonderful World of Disney. His various nature shows were testaments to the ideas of the Wild West and the American frontier, helping cement Disney's image as a real American treasure, and his Buckminster Fuller-ful vision for the future of America (geodesic domes everywhere!) were popular and, people believed, only a matter of time. Disney intended to be at the forefront of that development. He was both visionary and traditional.

Despite his apparently populist thematic preoccupations, however, people like to talk about Disney's anti-union leanings. To be sure, he was very anti-union. After the success of Snow White, Disney didn't promote or give raises but gave ""salary adjustments"" to the animators he considered the most exceptional. In 1941, his animators went on strike (after, but not because, he accused the union leader of being a Bolshevik). After the strike was finally resolved, Disney (the individual) largely gave up on pushing the ""big happy family"" picture of the Studio; everyone knew it wasn't true, but mostly Disney didn't feel like he could trust anyone anymore. Later full-length films aren't directed by him; instead he later committed himself to television. There's no question that he was immensely unpopular among the animators that left after the strike, although a few of them eventually came back.

What is interesting to note here is that, despite the glee of the other studios at the apparent crumbling of the Disney Family, the animators' union was first formed when Max Fleischer fired every one of his staff animators who had signed with an artists' union. Warner Bros was also very unhappy with the new union and tried to lock them out but failed. Disney's animators, pre-Snow White, were among the best paid in the industry, but the production of Snow White was so risky and bloated that they all had to take large paycuts and work overtime; when the film was successful, they were understandably bitter that things weren't put back to rights. Being anti-union was pretty par for the course in the late thirties and forties, sadly. Disney was not the exception to the rule.

Anyway that's all I can tell you about the man himself. I haven't read Neal Gabler's biography which is supposed to be fantastic, but I do know that his daughter was infuriated by its publication and the negative image of him she believed it portrayed. Insofar as he can be judged good or bad, Disney was one of a breed of American industrial capitalist-- comparisons to Henry Ford and Rockefeller are apt-- ruthless but determined. I don't know if it's true whether or not he'd go around randomly accusing his dissident workers of being Communist, but it's certainly true that he was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in the 1950s, along with prominent film industry right wingers like John Wayne and Clark Gable (and Hedda Hopper!) (and Ayn Rand!!), which was extremely anti-Communist and a big support of the House Un-American Activities Committee (the blacklist). I think it's important to judge him independently of what the Disney Studio has become; you can chalk up a lot of the ""evil"" commonly associated with it now to Michael Eisner, who arguably was trying to follow in Walt's footsteps, but obviously was about sixty years out of date.

Hope that helps!

Edit: breaking up the wall of text, but also, in response to charges of anti-Semitism and racism: I've heard the anti-Semitic stuff before-- mostly that he and Leni Riefenstahl were ""good friends,"" and that he was bitter because a Jewish producer had stolen his Oswald character (both of these are unsubstantiated although he did like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will pre-1938) but Neal Gabler denies that he was any more anti-Semitic than his contemporaries. As for racism, again, all the evidence I've read or seen doesn't suggest tendencies any more racist than his contemporaries. People point to Song of the South and the crows in Dumbo but these works seem to me to be motivated by a (obviously woefully misguided) attempt at humour rather than to denigrate Blacks.

ArtemisSolie,"The where and how is a bit difficult to pinpoint, as religious art of martyrs has always been popular. In my own expirence of the Catholic faith, my first answer to this would be to think of St. John The Baptist...but when we look at imagery of him, he is oftentimes not in fact shown holding his own head--rather, it is on a platter as told in the story. We then should look to other saints whose beheading helped define them in the history of saints. It could be argued that the popularization of St. Denis of Paris, as noted by Butler in *The Lives of the Saints*, was the patron saint of France, and Bishop of Paris, and perhaps serves as the answer to your question. 

It is, I would say, St. Denis whose figure popularized the cehpalophoric images you're referring to. St. Denis preached the word of Christianity, and was ultimately beheaded for it, but before dying he walked a substantial distance while holding his head, or so the story goes, thanks to his religious purity and divinity. With a following dating to 400 AD, it would be [King Dagobert who would take St. Denis' sainthood to a nationalistic level.](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04721a.htm)--this popularization from 600AD onward of course would mean the production of religious imagery corresponding to St. Denis' figure. The popularization then, of not just St. Denis' figure but the Catholic church in general, we can see, continued right up until the Reformation and the religious civil wars in France in the 16th century. The St. Denis Basilica today remains as a testament of his popularity in the 12th century.  Imagery of St. Denis holding his head date back to these times, and is shown in the Notre Dame, the St. Denis Basilica, and many other places in Paris such as Montmartre. Cehpalophorism can also be seen referred to in literature, such as Dante's 14th century *Divine Comedy*, *Sir Gwain and the Green Knight* dating again to the 14th century, and even more recently, in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, in which the black knight is reduced to no more than a talking head. 

Overall, I would say that the cehpalophoric saints depictions originated thanks to the popularization of St. Denis between 600 AD, and the 15th century in France. ",null,0,cdmw3br,1rfllc,askhistorians,top_week,7

Until that point, it had been a more localised veneration. That doesn't mean that there was not some bolstering that took place from official recognition, just that it wasn't a formalised process (Cambridge Medieval history volume 4.)

It almost reads like Martin of Tours was some sort of super hero: Martin deflects fire, Martin calls storms to raze idols, Martin deflects a tree some pagans dropped on him etc. (there are dozens of examples like this, [dozens!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI) ). Scholars have different takes on Sulpicius' account. You have to take into account genre, what is the ""truth"" is not always ""true"", and the historical context and purpose. Clare Stancliffe has an excellent book called *St. Martin and his Hagiographer* that is a very fair treatment. Others like T.D Barnes, who is brilliant and at times divisive in the field, seems to take great umbrage with the [chronological problems](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iqxFfcRzqh8C&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=t.d+barnes+on+martin+of+tours&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7v-_9QMGcV&amp;sig=laKePwaU72S9iOehDF_jfkQe3QQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qLuTUoSqGIeohAf6z4Bo&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=t.d%20barnes%20on%20martin%20of%20tours&amp;f=false). Why is Martin relevant, again? The sensationalism. 

The Edict of Milan in 313 changed everything. Or at least it symbolises the great change brought on by Constantine. This lead the way for great councils like the one at Nicaea in 325, Constantinople in 381, and Chalcedon in 451. Already, in the early 4th century there is a sense of reverence for those that survived and were martyred in ""the great persecutions."" This usually is referring to the Diocletian persecution. This lead to veneration, and what better reminder of a blessed ""new age"" than a tangible reminder of the saints' sacrifice. Thus the rise of relics and things attributed to them. Perhaps this was a workable model for a worshipful piety but things could get out of hand. 

You have to remember that, as literacy, the spread and exchange of writings, and the economy went downhill in Western Rome in late antiquity, people reverted much more to an agrarian, sustenance, and localised way of life. I am not arguing for a complete catastrophist way of looking at things, only saying that there was a notable decline. In many ways, it is clear there was a decline, even if there wasn't a ""fall"". Thus, many of the fertility, harvest, maternity etc. deities were replaced. The god of... the patron saint of... This does not mean that saints were ""worshipped"" like the Christian God, but just that their function may have in some instances replaced earlier pagan tradition. This is not an explanation of sainthood, as it goes back to the Apostolic Age, but it is merely how some (especially amongst the recently converted) communities purposed them. This is a simplification, but it will have to suffice.

I better get to the [good stuff](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090416101205/harrypotter/images/1/19/Nearly_headless_nick_petrified_basilisk.jpg) before we lose our heads... terrible just terrible. 

Setting all of this up with some contextualisation, keeping in mind the veneration of martyrs and also the growing cult of saints, let's look at some examples of Cephalophoric lore. Oh, one more note before the examples: hagiography would remain a really popular genre, even into later medieval England with the Carolingian renaissance reintroducing Latin accounts. This is probably where accounts like ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" derive some origin. 

St Pantaleon, c. 305, was martyred under Diocletian. Here is an excerpt from the Catholic Encyclopedia:
 ""An attempt was made to behead him, but the sword bent, and the executioners were converted. Pantaleon implored heaven to forgive them, for which reason he also received the name of Panteleemon (the all-compassionate). It was not until he himself desired it that it was possible to behead him.""

Nicasius, Bishop of 5th century Rheims:
Nicasius was beheaded by the Vandals. It is said that he was reciting Psalm 119:5 when he was then decapitated as he said ""My soul is attached unto dust."" But then his severed head continued to recite ""Revive me, Lord, with your words. 

Saint Denis, probably [the most famous cephalophore](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Saintdenis.gif). 
It is reported that he was martyred during the terrible Decian persecutions in the mid-third century. He was reportedly a missionary to Gaul, according to Gregory of Tours. After he was beheaded, he picked up his head and walked 10km/6miles with his head. The spot he finally ceased at, is now, by some accounts, commemorated by [St Denis Cathedral](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1246/767914888_066c1e620b.jpg). 
 
Which brings me to the point that France is most rich in the cephalophoric tradition. With legendary saints such as 
[St. Valerie](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Limoges_Crypt_03_Tomb_of_St_Valerie.jpg). I can't think of any Orthodox examples, though many Western saints are venerated in the by the Orthodox tradition. Perhaps some Byzantine expert knows. Anyway, hope that gets you started and contextualises things a bit.

spanktruck,"The answer is: depends who you ask.

One theory is that people misunderstood burial customs that placed the skull on the torso, which ehhhhhh. 

There is a strong connection cephalophores with the miraculous deeds of martyred saints--waking up, grabbing their beheaded head, and going about their way. In this way, they follow the tradition of saints who survive against all odds (lions quiet, executioners take pity, chains are loosed), to the point that the saint in question was briefly able to overcome death (cf. Acts of Paul and Thecla). If this is the case, then the cephalophores are an extension of the martyr cult, elaborated to such an extent that they manage to cheat death for a time to further devote themselves to the word of God. 

(As a sub-question of this, was St Denis 'patient zero' of this, or was his head-holding depictions merely the earliest known example of a train of religious thought that was known or gaining currency at the time, especially in the symbolism of conquering death?)

Another theory, by Montgomery in the book *Disembodied Heads in Medieval and Early Modern Culture*, links cephalophores and the practice of gathering parts of saints in reliquaries. Thomas Aquinas was apparently beheaded after death (13th century), so as to gather relics from his body. Montgomery links cephalophores with the rise of relics and reliquaries, which itself seems to date from late antiquity, [as this article on Victricius states](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0254.00083/abstract), and which itself leads to the cult of the saints, famously explored in Brown's The Cult of the Saints (1981). 

For Montgomery, then, cephalophores (in the model of St. Denis, who walked, and not in the model of those saints that simply spoke the gospel without moving from place to place) were an attempt to legitimize relics and locuses of power by imbuing their burial places with the spectre of their 'choice'. I find this unconvincing because Polycarp has people feasting at the graveside of martyrs, so it already seemed relatively legitimate. But I do like his idea of relics-cephalophores being linked, but perhaps not as causally as that. 

According to Wendy Meyer's introduction to her translation of the works of St. John Chrysotom, believers might attempt to be buried next to a martyr by the third century (itself documented in the Life of Polycarp, a non-canonical tale of a martyr). 

Mayer argues that the cult of the saints is a distinctly non-Christian set of practices--pilgrimages, some works on violent death (Maccabees), engagement with the dead, etc. 

To quote Mayer, 15-16:

&gt;In association a ""distinct theology of relics and the resurrection"" arose, which held that relics neither made a place impure [my note: a common belief at the time] nor had a neutral impact, but in fact purified the place where they resided, a reversal of traditional beliefs which paved the way for the placement of relics initially inside places of worship and ultimately within churches located inside city precincts. 

It is possible that St. Denis was the first cephalophore saint; alternatively, cephalophore saints originated with martyrs (including but not limited to Denis) holding their heads as a symbol of their spiritual triumph over death, since one of Jesus' powers--and a key component of the messianic eschatology seen in some, but not all, gospels--is the defeat of death. For more, Rosalind C. Love has some excellent footnotes on the historiography of the question in her Three Eleventh-Century Anglo-Latin Saints Lives (1996), page 60-61.

pharmaceus,Larger population. in 1914 Germany had ~60 million people while Britain had ~40 million. If you have more people working with similar efficiency it is just a question of time. Germany took a bit to start since they were late with the first wave of industrial revolution (1750-1800) and the second wave (1850-1900) was not as prominent as in Britain because the country was only undergoing unification and German states had different degrees of industrialization at the time of establishment of German Empire in 1871.

King_of_Men,"Germany had several advantages. First, as pharmaceus mentions, was the larger population. Second, their emphasis in education was different: Britain educated its upper classes to be leaders and administrators and looked down on science and technology; Germany had much less of the ""ew, teknikol stuff"" attitude. The research university is a German invention. Then, consider that Britain had got its industrial lead in textiles and iron; Germany outcompeted it largely in chemicals, optics, and steel, where the lead didn't really exist - these were newish industries. Britain also had a lot of already-installed machinery that gradually became obsolete in the face of new technology; Germany could get a leg up by installing the newest stuff right away. 

An example of the British educational attitude from Kipling's ""Stalky &amp; Co"", which is moderately autobiographical: 

&gt; ""I've found out how the houses are built. Let me get up. The floor-joists of one room are the ceiling-joists of the room below.""

&gt; ""Don't be so filthy technical."" 

Well, really now. This is in service to a complex plan of vengeance, involving insults about not bathing and a dead cat. And what's the response to vital intelligence, without which no revenge can be carried out? ""Don't be so filthy technical""! It's all the more telling in that Kipling is not writing propaganda for anything in particular, unless it's the superiority of public-school education for making officers. It's just a piece of colour. So it presumably follows that it's the sort of thing a British schoolboy would be likely to say. And boy, doesn't it give you confidence in their leadership?

onthefailboat,"There were a number of laws to try and limit the punishment of slaves to something fairly reasonable.  If you're looking at Spanish colonies, you have to start with the indigenous labor of the sixteenth century.  Bartolome de las Casas wrote several tracts opposing native labor on religious and humanitarian grounds and instigated several laws, like the New Laws and the Laws of the Indies.  It should be mentioned, however, that he suggested African labor instead of native labor, so how humanitarian he was is debatable.  Spanish laws, called *cedulas*, were supposed to protect slaves and make sure that they converted to Catholicism, but they were only occasionally enforced at the best of times.  In Spanish colonies, slaves could bring cases before courts and/or the church against their master if they were being abused or not brought into the church, which was very important to the Spanish.  In fact, there are examples of slaves using religion as a defense.  ""My master is so abusive that he made me renounce God and go to the devil"" sort of thing.

These laws were not terribly effective, however.  Many plantations were far away from the city where the courts were.  Though an official was supposed to check out the plantation, the fact of the matter is that they rarely did or could be bribed by the owner.  Even in the city, where slaves might have had access to the courts, it was likely that the master would be believed over the slave, unless there was overwhelming evidence of cruelty.  

During the 19th century, the Spanish seem to have backed away from stopping the owners' cruelty in favor of receiving more profit.  Cuba had become their main source of sugar, which was highly profitable.  To keep sugar production high they let the owners do what was necessary to keep the slaves working.  The mortality rate for sugar slaves was phenomenal, because of the cruelty and drive of their owners, but also because sugar production is destructive regardless.

You know about [A Queer History of the United States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10065595-a-queer-history-of-the-united-states) right? Big deal when it came out, very comprehensive. 

There is an overall lack of records for gay individuals and gay history in American archives, I can tell you first off, because I work in one and I am aggressively gung-ho about collecting in that area to correct this. There are various reasons archival holdings in traditional archives don't have good coverage of marginalized people of all types, the typical story is that in the early years the archives actively won't accept the materials, and then when they come around the people don't trust the conventional archives with their materials, so they end up elsewhere. There are many small LGBT archives scattered around in that vein, [rukus](http://rukus.org.uk/archives/) is my favorite. 

Coverage is improving though. One rather unhappy reason: archives usually get stuff when people die, and lots of the big gay rights people are of the right age to start dying about now. [For instance, the Barbara Gittings papers](http://archives.nypl.org/mss/6397) are totally processed and available for use, and she was a big deal. 

In addition to lots of archives trying to correct the gaps in their records with living people of a retirement home age (we get a lot of stuff from olded people who need to move out of their homes) AND getting stuff from Late Greats, there's also a lot of wonderful local-level gay oral history projects going on with older gay folks.

Flavored_Crayons,"Spain's involvement in the Revolution proved to be very important. Before officially joining the war in 1779 the Spanish secretly supplied the rebels with much needed resources such as gunpowder. This was conducted mostly via Spanish Louisiana. When Spain actively joined the war in 1779 they immediately played a key role. The entrance of Spain as well as France gave them numerical advantages especially at sea. The proximity of the French and Spanish threat to the British West Indies forced the British to stratify their military even further. In addition, the entrance of Spain in the war bolstered the threat of a mainland invasion of Britain.

Those factors can be described as passive side-effects of the Spanish entrance in the war. Spain did actively accomplish several objectives which directly aided the war effort. One of the most successful ventures was the conquest of forts in the Mississippi valley and British West Florida . Bernado de Galves (who you eluded to) was the governor of Louisiana at the time. He and many other Spaniards sought to recapture Florida which had been ceded to the British after the Seven Years War. British Florida was a loyalist haven during the revolution as many loyalists flocked to the territory to avoid the conflict and persecutions. It also served as a strategic stronghold and supply line of the Gulf Coast. With this in mind Galvez sailed to the capital of West Florida, Pensacola, and captured it in 1781 effectively gaining Spanish control over all of Florida (East Florida was not as populous and considered an afterthought) and the entire Gulf Coast. This paid great dividends as it eliminated any chance for the British to use the Mississippi River not only for supplying troops by also denying them the chance to perform a western invasion. 

So as we can see the Spanish did play a role in the revolution. Did they effect the eventual outcome of the war? Possibly, but it can be safe to assume that French support outweighed Spanish in terms of significance. This is not to say the Spanish efforts were not necessarily important. Spanish support greatly diminishes British presence along the Gulf Coast and severed their access to the Mississippi. As for Bernardo de Galves, I know he was promoted to general after his capture of Pensacola so that may be the reason he marched by the side of Washington, as he was an acting Spanish general. However, that is speculative and I don't know for sure.

pharmaceus,"In what period? From 3000BC to 1500AD American capitalism had absolutely nothing to do with it - in particular that I doubt that Aztec Maya or Inca cultures had capitalism let alone any contact with Asia.

Also regardless of whether you look for definition of capitalism to lassez-faire or marxist sources there is no such thing as ""American"" capitalism. Capitalism is an economic system that can be and is applied almost anywhere. Because there are cultural differences we can speak about ""x economic model"" or ""y economic model"" but it is largely incorrect to say ""Chinese capitalism"", ""American capitalism"", ""European capitalism"". 

To answer your question as I think you meant it - no. ""American capitalism"" is not the result. China for example had arguably in many ways higher standard of living than Europe until it got closed off from the rest of the world by Ming emperors in 15th century. The standard of living in most of Europe was just as high as in America throughout most of XIX century and up until WW1 and Western interventions in China and Japan in XIX century were not just American interventions. The British had much larger influence than Americans in China.

The comparison of standard of living of an average person in Asia and in America is difficult for a number of reasons and requires an indepth study that could fill a book. There were some factors that made Asian societies a bit more backward socially - most importantly more archaic government and social class systems - but in any other sense they caught on very quickly.

It was WW1 that put a stop to that advance because of the eruption of civil war in China and then WW2 that had a devastating effect. Most Americans are taught about how far more destructive the war was in Eastern Europe but rarely it is mentioned with respect to Asia. The Sino-Japanese war cost 20 million lives and war in the Pacific cost another 10-15 million if you count native populations of Philippines and Malaya.   After that only some countries were ""blessed"" by American capitalism and those were:

* Japan - which was a large and rapidly developing economy before WW2
* Taiwan - which was in essence old pre-Maoist China on a small island
* South Korea - which was largely a copy of Taiwan/Japan in a different culture.
* Singapore - which became a city-state with its own economic model based on old British capitalism
* Hong-Kong - which remained British territory with old British economic model until 1997.

Those countries were pretty much responsible for their own standards of living regardless of American influence and their own choices affected how well they did develop. As for the other side of American capitalism I would point out to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia which for the next 40 years after WW2 were under very strong influence of American capitalism but without introducing any reforms of their own. They kept American-supported dictators which killed millions of people or were bombed to dust by bombs made in American capitalist factories. It wasnt until late 1980's and 1990's that some things began to change but still it is a far cry from any capitalism - let alone ""American"" one.

However if you are asking whether ""capitalist"" economic solutions improved the standard of living in places where they have been introduced as opposed to ""non-capitalist"" solutions - yes. But it has little to do with America and everything with economic efficiency and other things that a Scotsman called Smith wrote about in 1776.",null,1,cdneerb,1rfrwi,askhistorians,top_week,1

DonaldFDraper,"Hello, this is a question that was somewhat asked by [someone else](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1qujn6/was_napoleon_a_child_of_the_revolution/).

With what I had said earlier in respect to Napoleon being a child of the Revolution, I still asert that Napoleon is a more moderate continuation of the French Revolution. He pushed reforms throughout the Empire and created many long lasting inovations (like the Napoleonic Code).

Again, it must be noted that Napoleon was a devout Jacobin and was arreste following the fall of Robespiere for being too Jacobin as the Directory was looking to purge the more radical elements of French politics. 

Despite the royal titles, I still see Napoleonic France as a continuation of Revolutionary France. When Louis XVIII sat on the French throne, he allowed people to purchase Legion of Honor medals and military commands. Quickly the people were alienated and the constant warfare that Napoleon had endured seemed better than the Ancien Regieme. Thus, Napoleon was able to rally most of France behind him during his Hundred Days campaign, desptie the fact that France was exhausted from over twenty years of near-constant war.

If there's anything to say what might give the best example of the spirit of the French Revolution in Napoleonic France, it would be the Legion of Honor. It could only be awarded to soldiers whom have shown extreme bravery and merit, and was approved by Napoleon himself. It couldn't be bought or awarded for no reason, it was for the bravest of the brave.

In the end, I will argue that Napoleon was the moderate but final phase of the Revolution. One where royality existed but anyone could become a noble.

&gt;On a side note, for a popular view of this, look toward Les Miserables. The father of Marius Pontmercy was awarded with a the title of Baron by Napoleon for retreiving five enemy standards and throwing it to The Emperor's feat. While a Colonel in the story, the view is that Napoleon gave titles to those whom deserved it, not because they were born into it.

&gt;A second side note, most of the titles Napoleon handed out were victory titles, not actual noble holdings. Some were given thrones (Bernadotte was Prince of Pontecorvo, Berthier was Pince of Neuchâtel, and Murat was King of Naples. All three were French Marshals and shown their skill in battle) but most of the titles were simply ""Prince of the Moskova"" (Ney) which entitled the holder to a heritary pension of a certain amount of money. There are still people whom hold these titles, the great grandchild of Massena wrote the introduction to Napoleon's Marshals, a collection of essays edited by David Chandler.

I want to start with saying that its very dubious to try and diagnose mental disorders based on historical writings, take these with a grain of salt at best.

Firstly, lets start with a discussion of FASD itself.
This particular disorder has several particularly major symptoms to it. Deformities of limbs, deformities of the heart, deformities of the face, vision difficulties and hearing problems... Ancient and middle aged medical science was so underdeveloped that the most severe expressions of this disorder would die outright, as well as probably most moderate cases. The high mortality rate of children during these eras (well up to the 1700's) would do the sufferers of this disorder no favors. (It is quite possible the severe expression of it would have contributed to the infant mortality rate over time in ancient peoples, though this is difficult to determine. Possibly the high death rate may have acted to reduce the incidence of the disorder, while the disorder did not significantly contribute to the death rate.)

FASD does not occur in all pregnancies when alcohol is consumed. (What I mean by this is, it may have an effect, but be so completely unnoticeable as to be undiagnoseable) The factors that interact with it are many and complex, and we really don't have any particular idea as to why it affects some but not others at varying amounts. Time of consumption IS important though, drinking with in the first 3 months of pregnancy is MUCH more destructive to the fetus than it is in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. This is simply because much of the critical neurological development is occurring in the first 3 months, and alcohol has the greatest effects on these structures at this time. (Note that alcohol consumption does not affect the embryo in the first two weeks of conception, it doesn't do any damage until the blastocyst has implanted into the uterus and resource exchange occurs more directly.) Research is ongoing and is focused on mice and rat analogies, no one really wants to put actual kids through the problems and disability associated with FASD, so a true clinical study of this is difficult. You have to find mothers willing to not only be a part of the study but also willing to drink while pregnant. It is important to note that FASD only is expressed as an environmental condition, much like most teratogenic activity in the uterus. It does not impact the person's genes, as a result, a parent (or both) suffering from FASD will not produce an FASD baby unless the mother drinks while pregnant. The mental disorder occurs ONLY when the fetus is exposed to alcohol.

Finally, a major effect on this disorder is severity, which I touched on earlier but didn't really go into much discussion on. A ""textbook"" example of the disorder is understandably severe, and might have difficulty surviving even on modern medicine, depending on complications. A ""minorly"" affected FASD person may be nearly indistinguishable from the general population except by those who deal with and experience the disorder daily and know exactly what to look for in behavior and appearance. These persons function in society just fine, and will probably live a perfectly normal life (for whatever time they exist in)
A moderately disabled person is already at a severe disadvantage. Many of them would probably die to various causes, depending on their abilities to cope, some may be able to live a semi-normal life in their time period. Many will probably live in destitution, even by the standards of the time. Severely afflicted persons are unlikely to survive owing to lacking medication and a complete inability to survive on their own.
FASD is a major problem today due to the mass production and ready availability of alcohol. It is also strongly correlated with poverty, though it is present at all socio-economic levels.

And as to the historical perspective, since we haven't nailed down the requirements as to how much alcohol creates how much FASD, its difficult to say how prevalent the disorder may have been in ancient populations. Since interactions such as time, food intake, amount of alcohol consumption, and good ol' genetic resistances all play a role, its difficult to nail down an answer. Chances are that yes, it did occur in the past, its prevalence would be somewhat dependent on alcohol availability in ancient times. A quick search brings up some sources that suggest alcohol was readily available. However one key factor still exists. Specifically, how much alcohol are WOMEN consuming, and in how great a quantity per session. A small amount of alcohol every now and then might not give most children diagnosable FASD (though there is still a chance it will.)

The website, http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/Controversies/1114796842.html#.UpPZ-sTUDz4, claims that drinking to the point of being drunk was actually fairly rare. If this is the case, then chances are you'd have mostly ""light"" and ""moderate"" expressions of FASD, these persons would be able to cope and survive reasonably well. You would probably notice deviations from the norm among afflicted individuals, depending on prevalence, they would still have a harder time functioning than most would. Interestingly, if the majority of persons are FASD, those that are normal might learn to act like an FASD person to an extent, without actually having the disability...

TL/DR: Yes, FASD likely occurred in the past. It is not expressed at the genetic level, it only occurs if the mother drinks while pregnant. 

Final Note: The most critical point for fetus vulnerability to alcohol (and other teratogens) is the first trimester. Second trimester will still have some risk of strong effects, but they will be somewhat muted. Third trimester is mostly about weight gain and finishing off development, alcohol exposure here is not as damaging.

Gadarn,"Here is my response from a similar question asked recently:

A.L. Martin writes in ""Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in Europe, 1300-1700: A Review of Data on Alcohol Consumption and a Hypothesis"" in Food and Foodways:
&gt;My research on drinking behavior in late medieval and early modern Europe, between 1300 and 1700, focusing on England, France, and Italy, revealed that people consumed enormous amounts of alcohol as a matter of course. Then as now women did not drink as much as men, but they drank enough for me to wonder if fetal alcohol syndrome might be one of the contributing factors to the high rates of infant and child mortality in preindustrial European societies.

She concludes that it is incredibly difficult to determine if fetal alcohol syndrome played any part in infant mortality but that there may be some signs that it was not unknown to people, including facial deformities in portraiture and 'traditional wisdom' that drunk parents (even men during conception) lead to weak or ill (or even female!) children.

Overall, while FAS may have been prevalent, I think it was likely lower than we would expect considering the amount of alcoholic drinks consumed. While alcohol was consumed regularly, the actual amount of alcohol per drink was usually lower than today and drinking to excess was more constrained to feast-days. This would help to limit the fetus' exposure to dangerous levels of alcohol.",null,0,cdn5xfs,1rfwwf,askhistorians,top_week,4

A ""textbook"" example of the disorder is understandably severe, and might have difficulty surviving even on modern medicine, depending on complications. A ""minorly"" affected FASD person may be nearly indistinguishable from the general population except by those who deal with and experience the disorder daily and know exactly what to look for in behavior and appearance. These persons function in society just fine, and will probably live a perfectly normal life (for whatever time they exist in)
A moderately disabled person is already at a severe disadvantage. Many of them would probably die to various causes, depending on their abilities to cope, some may be able to live a semi-normal life in their time period. Many will probably live in destitution, even by the standards of the time. Severely afflicted persons are unlikely to survive owing to lacking medication and a complete inability to survive on their own.
FASD is a major problem today due to the mass production and ready availability of alcohol. It is also strongly correlated with poverty, though it is present at all socio-economic levels.

And as to the historical perspective, since we haven't nailed down the requirements as to how much alcohol creates how much FASD, its difficult to say how prevalent the disorder may have been in ancient populations. Since interactions such as time, food intake, amount of alcohol consumption, and good ol' genetic resistances all play a role, its difficult to nail down an answer. Chances are that yes, it did occur in the past, its prevalence would be somewhat dependent on alcohol availability in ancient times. A quick search brings up some sources that suggest alcohol was readily available. However one key factor still exists. Specifically, how much alcohol are WOMEN consuming, and in how great a quantity per session. A small amount of alcohol every now and then might not give most children diagnosable FASD (though there is still a chance it will.)

The website, http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/Controversies/1114796842.html#.UpPZ-sTUDz4, claims that drinking to the point of being drunk was actually fairly rare. If this is the case, then chances are you'd have mostly ""light"" and ""moderate"" expressions of FASD, these persons would be able to cope and survive reasonably well. You would probably notice deviations from the norm among afflicted individuals, depending on prevalence, they would still have a harder time functioning than most would. Interestingly, if the majority of persons are FASD, those that are normal might learn to act like an FASD person to an extent, without actually having the disability...

TL/DR: Yes, FASD likely occurred in the past. It is not expressed at the genetic level, it only occurs if the mother drinks while pregnant. 

Final Note: The most critical point for fetus vulnerability to alcohol (and other teratogens) is the first trimester. Second trimester will still have some risk of strong effects, but they will be somewhat muted. Third trimester is mostly about weight gain and finishing off development, alcohol exposure here is not as damaging.

Gadarn,"Here is my response from a similar question asked recently:

A.L. Martin writes in ""Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in Europe, 1300-1700: A Review of Data on Alcohol Consumption and a Hypothesis"" in Food and Foodways:
&gt;My research on drinking behavior in late medieval and early modern Europe, between 1300 and 1700, focusing on England, France, and Italy, revealed that people consumed enormous amounts of alcohol as a matter of course. Then as now women did not drink as much as men, but they drank enough for me to wonder if fetal alcohol syndrome might be one of the contributing factors to the high rates of infant and child mortality in preindustrial European societies.

She concludes that it is incredibly difficult to determine if fetal alcohol syndrome played any part in infant mortality but that there may be some signs that it was not unknown to people, including facial deformities in portraiture and 'traditional wisdom' that drunk parents (even men during conception) lead to weak or ill (or even female!) children.

Overall, while FAS may have been prevalent, I think it was likely lower than we would expect considering the amount of alcoholic drinks consumed. While alcohol was consumed regularly, the actual amount of alcohol per drink was usually lower than today and drinking to excess was more constrained to feast-days. This would help to limit the fetus' exposure to dangerous levels of alcohol.",null,0,cdn5xfs,1rfwwf,askhistorians,top_week,4

Vincenti,"The conquest of Russia was to be brutal and total. Franz Halder, chief of the German OKH (Supreme High Command of the Army) took some very accurate notes during a briefing by Hitler to the chiefs of the three armed services and some other high-level commanders in March 1941:

&gt;This struggle is one of ideologies and racial differences and will have to be conducted with unprecedented, unmerciful and unrelenting harshness . . . The commissars are the bearers of ideologies directly opposed to National Socialism. Therefore the commissars will be liquidated. German soldiers guilty of breaking international law . . . will be excused. Russia has not participated in the Hague Convention and therefore has no rights under it . . . I insist absolutely that my orders be executed without contradiction.

From a directive issued by General Keitel May 13, dictated by the Fuehrer:

&gt;*[Russians] suspected of criminal action will be brought at once before an officer. This officer will decide whether they are to be shot.* With regard to *offenses* committed against *enemy civilians by members of the Wehrmacht, prosecution is not obligatory* even where the deed is at the same time a military crime or offense.*

Another from July 23:
&gt;. . . forces available for establishing security will be sufficient only if all resistance is punished not by legal prosecution of the guilty, but by the spreading of such terror by the occupying forces as is alone appropriate to eradicate every inclination to resist amongst the population.

So Hitler had directed for a brutal invasion, where a large-scale application of the piercing tactics used in Poland would be matched by subjugation of the native peoples. His commanders were told to encourage outright brutality and that soldiers who committed acts typically seen as war crimes would not be punished. Such would the large expanses of Soviet land be initially seized.

********

Another directive of Hitler from May 13 outlined that Heinrich Himmler (head of the massive SS) would be given immense administrative power for the execution of ""special tasks"", independently of the Army and under his own responsibility, for the socio-political transformation of Russia. Occupied areas were to be cordoned by the military, keeping even the ""highest personalities of the Government and Party"" from infringing on the SS.

Undoubtedly most of these tasks would focus on the eradication of certain undesirable Slavic peoples. It was envisioned by Alfred Rosenberg, one of the original ""thinkers"" of the Nazi Party when it was just a handful of anti-Semites meeting in pubs and a bit of an idiot**, that Russian territory in the European continent be divided into ""Reich Commissariats"". In the Baltic, some Germanic peoples would be assimilated; most others, especially in Latvia and Estonia, would be ""banished"" and replaced by Germans, probably war veterans.

These local governments would basically be vassal states under complete control from Berlin, formed to give some semblance of native representation and government structure. Poland was to be the protectorate of Ostland, Ukraine some sort of ""independent state"" (of course allied to Germany), Caucasia ruled by a German ""plenipotentiary"". All throughout his rise to German political power and the bloodless conquests of the early Reich, Hitler preferred a veneer of legality, however thin, to honesty about his subjugation of weaker states.

Hitler had long envisioned, and even laid out in *Mein Kampf*, that the large territories of Eastern Europe should one day be used as farmland for the Reich. Rosenberg espoused with savage honesty on what this would mean for the remaining Russian peoples in a meeting just a few days before the invasion:
&gt;The job of feeding the German people stands at the top of the list of Germany's claims on the East . . . We see absolutely no reason for any obligation on our part to feed also the Russian people with the products of that surplus territory . . . The future will hold very hard years in store for the Russians.

That's putting it mildly, since the populations would be forced into agricultural labor and given no thought for their own sustenance! Goering makes it clear:

&gt;Any attempt to save the population there from death by starvation by importing surpluses from the black-soil zone would be at the expense of supplies to Europe. It would reduce Germany's staying power in the war, and would undermine Germany's and Europe's power to resist the [Allied] blockade. This must be clearly and absolutely understood.

Had the German invasion and occupation gone off as planned, a secret German conference concluded that ""many millions of persons will be starved to death"". Russia was to be brutally seized and its population terrorized and liquidated when they had outlived their usefulness to the Reich.

As an aside, the high-level German planners seemed to view possible Russian emigration positively, thinking some may move to live in Siberia. To answer your question about the Asian elements of Russian territory, the Nazis did not seem to much care; they wanted the farmlands, oil fields, and population centers, not frozen wasteland with nobody in it. Germany was soon to cozy up to Japan, who had designs on East Asia; the Reich wanted Eastern Europe.



*The emphasis is in the original directive

**It's easy to give Nazi leaders a hard time in retrospect, but Rosenberg truly does seem pretty dim. His crackpot ideas helped solidify the early social/racial platform of the NSDAP, but are just as dumb and poorly thought-out as your typical /r/conspiracy post or what have you. After Hitler's ascension to master of the Nazi party he was mostly shuffled to an ineffectual general advising role.

First, it is a matter of equipment. A Roman soldier of the Late Republic was simple but effective. Wearing a strong bronze or iron helmet that covered his head but gave him a  good view that isn't restrictive. The armor, a chain shirt called the lorica hamata, covers most of the chest and protects from slash attacks and arrows from a distance. The scutum is a tall shield that would he able to cover 80% of a man on a full standing stance (crouch a little and the entire body is covered up). Finally the gladius hispanolis is twenty eight inches of steel that is meant for the stab from behind the aforementioned shield. This is a standard set of equipment that every legionnaire was given by the State/Caesar.

The standard Gaul could have anything. It could range from primitive plate armor from the rich to being naked; swords, spears, and clubs were used; shields to would vary to size, shape, and purpose.

Roman; d, there is a political situation to consider. At the time, up until Vercingetorix, Gaul was fragmented and tribal. They were eager to see each other come to ruin, so Caesar exploited this in order to defeat a lot of small enemies in several battles rather than one giant army that could overwhelm him. Caesar had the advantage of being the only Roman in the province to give orders, making him the central command with a strong army.

Third is the main reason for Roman victory, training and organization. If there is anything Rome is best known for, it is their training. In battle, a single Roman soldier against a single Gaul, the Gaul would wipe the floor with the Roman; however, the more Romans you add, the more they work together and can overcome armies much larger than themselves.

The most important thing for a Roman legion is how well they work together. They twin and fight together, they understand that the shield beside them is also helping protecting themselves. So the real skill for Romans isn't fighting, but fighting together, they could conquer the world.

The Gauls didn't train in the same way. Combat was focused on individual skill rather than as a team. This feeds into the Roman method of battle,. They didn't fight together but rather attacked the enemy with little local tactical control. This is why Rome won, because of training and skill.

tbcwpg,"France had been in almost constant conflict since the Revolution. The Reign of Terror, the Napoleonic Wars, and conflicts like the Franco-Prussian War kept the country in a state of near-constant warfare. Modernization to the rural areas came about due to the need to move troops and conscripts from rural towns. 

Remember, the gap between the so-called First Republic, in 1789, and the so-called Third Republic and Belle Epoque, was only 82 years. In between, France had the royalist restoration, Napoleon was emperor twice, they embarked on a major European campaign, Napoleon's sons were emperors, and France stuck into every major conflict in between. France had 3 republican eras, a monarchist era, and two ""empires"" in 82 years. By the time there was a peaceful era, they were only 40-ish years away from World War I.

sodade,"From a sociologist's point of view:

The economy of France was very different from England's. They had a culture of government sponsored jobs, where you had to succeed in an exam and if you did, you received a job that you were pretty much guaranteed to have for life.
This has been often indicated as the main reason for the industrial revolution happening much later and on a much smaller scale in France than in England (and the rest of continental Europe, which was far more inclined to follow the English model). There was just no real incentive for it.

The initial poverty that was caused by the industrial revolution (the link between poverty and having large families has been well researched) and the boom in healthcare and modern technology that were eventual results of it were, I would guess, some of the main reasons for the different population increase rates.

The military argument doesn't completely hold up for me (though it may explain a part). After all, the industrial era wasn't exactly a peaceful period elsewhere in Europe. Furthermore, the Grande Armée was typically a lot smaller than most people seem to think, except for the Russian campaign.

brennabru,"I suppose you're asking about women at court. For richer women who were inside, maybe a silk or cloth slipper (A bit like a ballet slipper) or a shoe that came to the ankle with a strap across the foot, probably again made of expensive and not hard wearing cloth. Rich women in towns would wear shoes with built up heels to keep their dresses out of the filth in the streets. London was one only three or four big towns at the time, so it's possible they would have worn these to go out, or boots for riding.  
Other rural women may have simple leather shoes that came to the ankle. Think the sort of shoe with a buckle strap across the foot for wealthier women, or for poorer women just a plain closed shoe, still leather that was simple and stitched together and hardy. Of course there were some who went bare foot. I believe that the strap and buckle sort of shoe was popular across England as seen here, styles and decoration would have varied according to class. I hope I could help! http://revival.us/luxurytudorshoe.aspx P.s- don't trust The Tudors on costume! As lovely as they look, I don't think they were particularly historically accurate.
Oh I forgot about men. Not too sure, I'm less sure about this. Probably more closed shoes for lower classes, not the buckle and strap. It's possible clogs (Made of wood and leather) would have been popular for working men, but generally more closed shoes would have been worn. Also, shoes like slip on leather loafers with much of a heel. I know the king would have worn the strap and buckle shoe too, like women, but with more of a flat front. Different materials would have varied. I'm pretty sure they generally wore shoes over boots (Boots for riding), and to us they may have seemed quite slipper like in comparison to the shoes we wear today, but the were only for the floors of court. 

I am a history student hoping to specialise in domestic history from the early modern period (1450-1750).

gwenever,"Heels first arose during Elizabeth's reign and were worn by both women and men.  Style was largely influenced by Italy during this time period, and Venice popularized a platform shoe called a chopine.  This site has some great original shoes, but they really demonstrate [extreme examples](http://blog.lulus.com/fashion/lady-gaga-meets-her-match-the-chopine-shoe/).  There could be some fashion competitiveness in court and if fashion could be taken to the extreme, you could bet at least a handful of flashy nobles would try to acquire the finest materials, or tallest shoes.  Elizabeth, it is said, was fond of her small feet and as a result had the hems of some of her dresses shortened in order to show off flashy, bejeweled heels.  It was not common prior to Elizabeth for noble women's footwear to be visible.  

While Elizabeth encouraged the nobility to consider elevating foot fashion, her father Henry VIII was interested in more northern regions.  Henry VIIIs great pride were his shapely legs.  In the Tudor dynasty well muscled but elegant legs were a highly desirable trait for men, and young Henry had sexy gams.  He frequently wore hose or tight fitting breeches and wore leg garters to tighten his legwear and accentuate his legs.  It's very likely that his obsession with leg garters contributed to the leg ulcer that became a debilitating issue later in his life.  But Henry's most interesting contribution to fashion was probably the tremendous size of the codpiece, which reached its zenith during his reign.  [This pic](http://www.backtoclassics.com/gallery/hanstheyoungerholbein/henryviii/) shows Henry rockin the leg garters and codpiece that he made popular.  You can also see his shoes, which are the turnshoe style mentioned by brennabru.  [Here](http://oxthepunx.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/img_1446ed.jpg) we see Henry's armor, with impressive codpiece on display.  

During Elizabeth's reign the codpiece fell quickly out of fashion and reduced greatly in size.  Elizabeth had far more of an influence on bringing changing shoe fashions to England.  The first heeled incarnations were similar to clogs, with a wedge heel, and eventually evolved into what we think of as a heeled pump or court shoe today.  The shoes would be made out of any fabric, with wealthier citizens having elaborate embroidery and extra high tongues (a display of wealth since they could afford the extra fabric and decoration).  

Boots were worn for practical reasons, like hunting, and could be any height from ankle to hip.  Tall boots might have a slashed and bloused top, be folded, crenelated or other decorative styles.    ",null,0,cdn670p,1rg195,askhistorians,top_week,2

onthefailboat,"Well, the really big change occurred after the US took over in 1803.  The first change in 1769 wasn't all that much of a deal as far as slavery was concerned.  Most of the citizen brought over by the French were prisoners or very low class people, without the capital to purchase slaves.  The colony was kind of a backwater and neither nation could really control the smuggling and extralegal activities that were the colony's primary source of profit.  There were certainly slaves, but the underpopulated areas of the territory gave them plenty of room to develop their own lifestyles, relatively free of interference.  This led to a very African creole culture.

Furthermore, as Catholic nations, Spain and France shared many cultural similarities regarding their slaves.  Free people of color and manumitted slaves were both more common in French and Spanish colonies than in English colonies.  This high proportion of free people of color persisted after the US took over, but it slowly decreased over time until the Civil War.  Before the Civil War Louisianians often kept the distinctions between the various degrees of ""blackness"", such as quadroons and mulattos.  After the Civil War, the ""one drop"" way of looking at African-Americans began to dominate, though former slaves and free people of color frequently ran into friction between each other.  

We've also come to realize, when looking at slavery in the western hemisphere, that the laws that the imperial power passed bared little relation to what was happening on the ground, most of the time.  Both Spain and France passed laws that were pretty nice to slaves, but slave owners rarely obeyed those laws.  Slaves in the area may not even know that the territory had changed hands for a good while afterwards.  And once sugar began to dominate southern Louisiana owners did whatever was necessary to squeeze the most profit out of their farms.

pwfd1177,"Different historians will give you many different answers to that question.  For one of the better analyses of what fascism ""is,"" I would consult Stanley Payne's *A History of Fascism*.

In short, fascism is a radical, authoritarian, rightist response to Communism and liberalism.  A fascist regime will espouse a fervently ideology in its political culture, bordering on a religious zeal.  This zeal is espoused by a charismatic leader that reinforces his (really has to be a man) extreme nationalism with romantic symbols.  The regime will enforce this ideology with a mass mobilization and militarization of the population, leading to an emphasis on masculinity and the vibrancy of youth.  

Fascism emerged from the Italian futurism of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.  [Futurism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism) took hold as the ideology of several political figures in Italy before being adopted and molded by Benito Mussolini.  It would later be adopted by Adolf Hitler and taken to even greater extremes of militarization.

Is it bad?  What defines a ""bad"" regime?  Technically, one might be able to see a nation prosper under fascism, depending on the leader in question.  However, it might be difficult to see fascism as a long-term regime in a political system.  Mussolini maintained fascism for quite some time, but he did so with great subjection of his people and countless rights abuses.  The historical conditions necessary for fascism to emerge tend to make one consider it as a ""bad"" system I suppose, but with the right charismatic leader, one could probably see ""benevolent fascism.""

depanneur,"The fundamental roots of ideological fascism lay in the changes caused by industrial society on traditional hierarchies and social institutions. It was philosophically based in a 19th century critique of liberalism and positivism, as well as the writings of Gustav Le Bon and George Sorel, who wrote of the importance of mass movements led by a leader and myth which would direct man’s chaotic tendencies into constructive avenues through some sort of dynamic activism.  The assumptions of these authors were based on a widespread ‘fin du siècle’ attitude towards the challenges imposed by an industrial society which alienated man; on one hand, their individuality was robbed by industrial society but at the same time they sought an avenue to assert this individuality. 

Fascism was consciously constructed as a response to the theories put forward by Le Bon, Sorel and others and was meant to not only expunge industrial alienation through mass participation in an organic society, but also to provide a quasi-religious alternative to Marxism which would overcome the inherent dichotomies of industrial society (individual v. society, private v. public etc.) through a powerful state. Fascism's solution to industrial alienation was mass participation in an organic state led by a charismatic leader. Mussolini believed that a totalitarian state would be able to multiply an individual's abilities and creativity if he submitted to its authority.  It was also an open-ended ideology which allowed it to attract a whole spectrum of dissatisfied individuals, from conservative anti-Bolsheviks to more radical socialistic corporatists. It must be emphasized that the aims of fascism were meant to produce a sort of national rebirth, and was thus inherently nationalist. Paradoxically, because all fascisms are tempered by their nations' historical and social particularities, there can be no monumental fascism, just a 'fascist minimum' that has to be generally defined. It was necessarily brutal as well because fascist activism took on a militaristic aspect due to the fact that most members of fascist squads were veterans of the First World War, their leaders were frontline officers during the war and both viewed the post-war world embodied in liberalism, socialism and sometimes conservatism as an enemy to be destroyed. Fascist activism could take the form of rural anti-socialist campaigns in Italy, SA streetfights with communists and arguably the SS' role in the attempted eradication of European Jewry. 

On less philosophical level, fascism was a movement of the bourgeois class meant to protect traditional hierarchies from social revolution and also to organize societies in ways which would continue its social advancement.  Indeed, fascist traditionalism always coincided with bourgeois values and prejudices; fascism always thought of itself as a cultural rather than socio-economic revolution, which made it attractive to the upper classes.  Fascism was an outlet for bourgeois frustrations and anxieties that would simultaneously protect their treasured hierarchies and private property. Corporatism, fascism’s sole contribution to economic thought, was meant to reorganize economic and social relations into guild-like structures of workers and bosses that in practice amounted to a façade which hid a complex system of public and private bureaucracies.  Fascists believed that society and the economy should transcend class divisions (perceived as a Marxist invention) and be organized into a collection of corporatist bodies united under the all-embracing state.

Fascism, as has been described, was fundamentally anti-socialist because of these bourgeois prejudices. In Germany and Italy, both regimes came to power largely because of their physical anti-socialist campaigns and because conservative elites wanted to eliminate the Left in parliament who had institutionalized their power through the recognition of union rights, not because of their ambitious plans for cultural revolution.  As well, fascism’s anti-liberalism had no small part to play in its popularity. Liberalism, during the inter-war period, had become associated with Wilson’s Fourteen Points and consequently the results of the Paris peace treaties, which gave resonance to the ideology in revisionist countries like Italy, Germany and Hungary. Fascism was also anti-Conservative in the context of a generational conflict between old (conservative) and younger (fascist) reactionaries. In reality, fascists always cooperated with conservatives to some extent, and fascist leaders, most notably Hitler, preferred conservatives to other fascists.

adimwit,"I think Corporatism is essential to Fascism but few people really understand what that means and there are quite a few terms that people misinterpret so I'll start by defining them.

**Liberalism.** Today we generally use this term for the Left but back then it was a broad term for Liberty. We could probably call it Libertarianism, but, still, back then this term was typically applied to Anarchists.

**Corporatism.** Sometimes called Corporationism. It's an expanded form of Syndicalism. Rather than it being the organization of strictly Labor, it was the organization of Management as well. A Corporation was basically a confederation of Labor Unions and Business/Managerial Associations that were oriented in a specific industry/field. So a Transportation Corporation would be comprised of Train workers unions (and all others like buses, planes, etc.) and the managers of these businesses. Together they would manage the Transportation industry together (like decide wages).

**State Capitalism.** This is what we would probably call Corporatocracy (if we didn't mistakenly call it Corporatism). The Fascists believed that too much Liberty would inevitably result in interests groups seizing control of the State. If Business Interests exploited the State, it was State Capitalism. If the People exploited the State, it was Socialism. They opposed both concepts.

&gt;What is Fascism . . .

Basically, Fascism was a system that rejected Class Warfare, meaning they rejected Capitalism, Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism, as all of these perpetuated class conflict. Liberty was seen to be the underlying ill that facilitated the expansion of these groups. Like I said earlier, they believed too much Liberty (and Democracy) gave various interest groups the ability to exploit the State.

Liberty was also seen as an offspring of Capitalism. They did not think it was a natural right that people were born with or possessed. Mussolini said that Capitalism, Liberty and Democracy could work fairly well until the businesses got too big. When they got too big, the dogmatic Liberals would refuse to regulate them, allowing the State to be exploited by Capitalists. The Great Depression seemed to prove this for the Fascists. The same could be said of Socialism. If the people gained too much power, they could exploit the state, gradually leading to Socialism.

The solution was the rejection of Liberty in all its forms (i.e. Democracy, Capitalism, Free Markets, independent Unions, alternative parties, etc.). The State was supreme. Everyone had to be a member of the Fascist party to receive the benefits of the State. They implemented Corporatism as their alternative to Capitalism and Socialism. They forced businesses and unions to cooperate for the nation's well-being.

&gt; . . . and is it ""bad?""

This depends on your beliefs. Communists and Socialists rejected it while moderate Socialists supported it. Capitalists early on supported it then rejected it. The New Deal was partly (but briefly) influenced by Corporatism. Even the Weimar Republic, and pre-Republican Spain experimented with Corporatism. Fascism was also praised by people from different political backgrounds. People like Mises, Orwell, Churchill and Roosevelt.

Prior to 1935, Fascism was seen fairly favorably. 1935 was the year Italy became imperialistic (13 years after Mussolini came to power) and this was largely because of the Great Depression. In 1927, Mussolini established the Corporate State by enacting the Labor Charter (which expanded Labor Rights). Despite their best efforts, the Fascists did not really improve the economic conditions but through propaganda, they led the world to believe that Fascism was a great success. This led to investments and loans from foreign nations. Eventually, the banks wised up and cut off funding by 1933. The last option was empire and war.

There are a variety of reasons why we generally think of Fascism as strictly right-wing and anti-Labor and this is understandable considering it was the Fascists themselves who wanted the West to believe this. Before Mussolini's propaganda, many Westerns journalists went to Italy in 1920 believing another Bolshevik revolution was imminent. Although the Fascists at the time were supporting some strikes while breaking up others, the journalists believed this was an anti-Communist movement that had saved Italy from Bolshevism. Early on, Mussolini (truthfully) said this was not true, but then later used this to gain support (and funds) from westerners. Once he gained power, he portrayed Fascism as an anti-Communist, pro-Capitalist system to the west and became popular.

At the same time, the Great Depression was proof to many that too much economic liberty was dangerous and as a result many intellectuals began studying Corporatism. The most prominent Fascism-influenced American was Hugh Johnson, who was appointed to administer Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration. The NRA was undoubtedly Fascist Corporatism. Another was Lawrence Dennis who was actually persecuted by the administration. Father Coughlin seems to have been some kind of social corporatist rather than a nationalist/statist corporatist. These three were the only ""American Fascists"" who seemed to understand Corporatism. There were a large variety of groups that became prominent but simply believed Mussolini's propaganda that Fascism was an anti-Communist movement.",null,0,cdovegz,1rg6xc,askhistorians,top_week,1

Oxen_boxen,"&gt;What started WW2?


A number of things. The *formal* event was Germany and the USSR partitioning off Poland. Western allies didn't necessarily *like* the Soviet Union, but they still had contractual obligations and treaties to fight with Poland, and Germany was the new kid on the block- I think everyone at the start of WW2 figured that if they had to fight anyone, it'd be the Germans and not the Soviets that would be easier to deal with.


But you need to go a lot deeper than that. 


First, you need to appreciate WW1. Now, where most countries funded the war by taxes, Germany took the unusual route of paying it off via loans. Which wasn't traditionally a *bad* idea. Countries don't go bankrupt in a conventional sense- Once Germany took itself off the gold standard the value of it's currency was in effect a guarantee to German *labor* rather than a concrete concept like *gold*. 


But then the Germans lost the war. Which both stuck out as bizarre to the Germans- not one set of enemy boots stepped into German territory- and insulting. They were made to look like the *bad* guys when they were fighting on behalf of allies who were dealing with states who were endorsing *terrorism*. Archduke Ferdinand had been assassinated by a state funded terrorist organization. Not to say Germany wasn't looking for an excuse to flex it's military muscles- it had already thumped more than one state who reasonably should have been doing the thumping, not being the thumpee, but Germany wasn't in a position where it could just sit on it's laurels- it was late to the colonization party. *Too late*. North America was colonized, South America was colonized. Asia had been colonized. Africa too. There was essentially nothing *left* to claim. What's more, it'd take *decades* to roll out a fleet that'd stand up to the likes of the British empire, or any other major players. If Germany wanted to prosper, it would essentially have to be on the corpses of it's European rivals. 



*At any rate* after this huge humiliation in WW1 which felt like it was more a consequence of grossly incompetent politicians domestically, and vindictive ones abroad, they got handed down the Treaty of Versailles. Aside from asking that a ludicrous amount of money be paid in reparations- most estimates have it being more than the country was even *valued* at- they were still out for the debt accrued to pay for the war in the first place. And the way the reparations would be payed would be a flat rate, plus around 25% of the money they profited off exports. Essentially Germany was wedged between massive war debt, war reparations, and their export economy, which they were obviously dependent on, got slapped with a 25% tax. 


So three things happened- Germany went *off* the gold standard, the quality of goods took a nose dive because no one wanted to pay a premium for something which fundamentally hadn't *changed*, and the value of the Reichmark imploded. Hyperinflation ensued because Germany had to make good on it's reparations and debt, but couldn't afford to cover it on the gold standard. Once off it, everything became a self-perpetuating cycle. As Germany spent money, the value of it decreased, which caused them to print more. Eventually it got to the point where France and Belgium threw up their hands and said, ""enough!"" German currency was beyond worthless at this point (people would express money in logarithmic functions rather than write out 16, 18, 20 zeros) and demanded raw goods. When Germany could make good on these (there does seem to be an argument that some elements in the Wiemar republic did this on purpose) France then occupied sovereign German soil. For reference on just *how* inflated reich marks would get, look at the wikipedia article on German hyper-inflation. 



So now we have Germany with a crippled economy, worthless currency, and with foreign soldiers occupying sovereign German territory in the Ruhr. 



Now, we'll add in the other terms in the Treaty of Versailles. First, Germany had to turn over land to Poland. Whom they hadn't lost to, and hadn't really fought either. In fact, Poland hadn't even existed! Despite being a state which had been constantly traded between the Russian Empire (historically), the Austrians and the Prussians, it was only Germany who really got stung by this. 



Additionally, the Germans were basically told they couldn't maintain an army, *at all.* This'd become a major player in Hitler's early propaganda to justify action in Poland and the Battle of France- while being told to disarm, no one really bothered following through. The Treaty of Versailles told everyone to take their hands off the trigger for the guns they all had pointed at each other, but in all reality their other hand behind their back was doing something else *entirely*.



So WW1 was kind of a swift kick in the nuts for the Germans, and they were reasonably aggravated by it. They were the victims of rival nations in Europe, and subjects of what they saw as incompetent politicians domestically, and it was *their* quality of life that was getting obliterated as a result.



And then Hitler shows up. To be certain, while he was popular, he wasn't *that* popular. Hitler didn't get elected into office, so he kind of had to browbeat his way into it. ""Cheat"" if you will. He tells everyone it wasn't really their fault. He throws out the treaty of Versailles. He modernizes the German army (ok, lets be frank: The panzer 1 and panzer 2 were awful designs and the Germans had a poor understanding of forecasting where tank development would go, while dramatically over-spending to fight what would come from it) and goes after the ""real"" enemies within and restoring German dignity abroad- Hitler actually got Chamberlain to balk at the idea of standing up to Germany! But there was an eventual end to Germany being able to politic their way around things. 



First, there were the Bolshiveks who were ideological opposites to the Nazi party, who'd now basically thrown out any pretense of republic and democracy. Hitler wanted a nation that chose a sort of middle path- not pawns of capitalism, but not mindless cogs in a grand communist machine either. Furthermore there was that whole issue with Poland- while it may very well have been political rhetoric to keep folks at home happy, Polish leaders had said a couple of times they weren't going to stop with just the land they won from Versailles. Hitler used this as pretense to war- which he'd further use to justify fighting France and the British. You'll notice the French and British declared war on Germany, but not the Soviet Union. It's not like Germany took all of Poland- some of it went to the USSR, under a treaty no less! 



In other words, the short answer is that WW2 started because Nazi Germany needed something to ""colonize"", and needed political fodder to justify itself. The state wouldn't have been self-sustaining under Socialism without making value come from *somewhere.* A lot of this was extracted from minorities and whomever they happened to conquer. 

&gt;why did the Nazis really hate the Jews?

As for the bit about Jews, its *complicated.* The were a victim of circumstance and convenience. Hitler needed to sell his concept of the German monoculture, and it just so happened that either through willful disinterest, or ostracism, Jews weren't a part of that. And a number of wealthy Jews happened to own some compelling businesses. Jewish bankers helped fund the allies in WW1. Jewish media (This was a feature of Germany's propaganda, I don't know to what extent the Jews owned media rings in the early 20th century. In short, the Nazi party wanted to ""call out"" the Jewish media for being a bunch of spin doctors, turning a country like the US which still was fairly distrustful of states like Great Britain due to their large populations of Irish and German immigrants) helped draw the US into WW1 and portrayed the Germans as monsters where they were previously just fighting another European war. Hitler basically sold Germany the idea that the Jews were ruled by some sort of hive mind, and that the actions of one Jew, or a group of Jews in the US was doing was the sin of the *whole* race / religion. 


It's a classic miss-use of correlation and causation being misunderstood. The Nazi party could plausibly demonstrate that some Jews happened to be in positions where they could fund efforts to make sure Germany lost the first world war, ergo *all* Jews were a problem for the state. Add some pseudo-science making them see sub-human, and boom, public enemy number one. 


When you hide a lie or two behind a truth or three, your average person is never going to know the difference. If you dig *far* enough you can make *any* group look bad. 


This'd only be further fueled by a willful disinterest in establishing *what* to do with the Jews. Krystallnacht had been orchestrated by Goebells (Goerning?) to impress Hitler. At some level initially the Nazi party had even talked of simply deporting all Jews to Palestine. The *reasoning* behind what is probably the most *core* reason behind all of this is actually in how they proposed to *pay* for it- the Nazi part was to seize all property of these Jews and compensate them in machinery. Which of course would be done at a rate that favored the State. 


Basically the Nazi party needed a political scapegoat to justify themselves, they needed money because the ghosts of war's past still haunted the German economy, and it just so happened that if everyone hated an entire minority (or several groups) they would be *far* more willing to turn a blind eye when they get shipped off to labor camps. Making the Jews a band of minority villains covered *all* three bases.

i_330,"A lot. For our purposes, we'll begin with the Russian Civil War. There were understandably some people who were sort of upset about the abdication of the tsar and the events of 1917. Those people are known as the Whites. The Whites put up a pretty good fight, but the Bolsheviks ended up defeating them. The Bolsheviks were now running the country out of Petrograd (which became Leningrad in 1925, after Lenin died) and the USSR was beginning to (sort of) be recognized as a legitimate state abroad.

In the meantime, it had been discovered that state ownership of the means of production was causing severe economic hardship, so Lenin developed the New Economic Plan (NEP), which allowed for limited private enterprise and, pretty crucially, mostly left the peasants alone (collective farming was a really unpopular idea, but I'll talk about that in greater detail once we get into the 1930s under Stalin). Basically, NEP held the Soviet Union back from famine, economic collapse and open revolt for most of the '20s. 

But in 1924, Lenin died, and a power struggle ensued. Stalin managed to come out on top, abolished NEP in 1928, and embarked on a very ambitious, destructive plan to bring the entire Soviet economy under state control. Chaos ensued. Stalin started by taking everything away from the peasants and establishing massive collective farms. The peasants were really, really not into this, to the point where they start slaughtering their livestock rather than surrender them to the state. At the same time, Stalin was on a ruthless campaign against kulaks (wealthy/wealthyish peasants) around this time, most of whom were shot or exiled to Siberia. Collectivization was also one of the factors that contributed to the Holodomor, a famine in Ukraine that killed somewhere between 2 and 5 million people. 

So that's what was going on with the agricultural sector. There was trouble afoot in other spheres of Soviet life, as well: Stalin was embarking on a massive campaign of executions known as the Great Terror. That went on on roughly from 1934-39, although there's a lot of disagreement on that. It's almost impossible to overstate how absolutely nuts the Great Terror was. There's an apocryphal story about a man who put his coffee mug down on a picture of Stalin's face in the newspaper, leaving a wet ring that a passing KGB officer happened to notice and arrested him on the spot for. That particular story is probably not true, but it gives you a sense of the prevailing tone in Soviet life during that period. Everyone was listening to/informing on everybody else. Forced ""migrations"" of ethnic minorities (Tatars, Kalmyks, Volga Germans, and many others) were happening on a massive scale. People were being arrested for literally nothing, tortured, forced to sign confessions, and either executed or sent to the gulag (an enormous system of prisons spanning the entire country--we're still not completely sure how many there were). People usually never came out of the gulag, but some people did and lived to write about it (the most famous is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, but the work of Varlam Shalamov is also highly recommended if you're at all curious about the gulag). Basically, what Stalin was doing was using a climate of paralyzing, all-encompassing terror to consolidate power at home. It was effective. Devastatingly effective. I'm doing my thesis on the legacy of Stalinism in Russia, and I'd argue that it still informs contemporary Russia in a MAJOR way, but I digress.

I gather from your question that you're primarily curious about domestic developments in Russia, but there is one foreign policy thing that I should probably mention: the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which is signed in 1939 and guarantees mutual non-aggression between Germany and the USSR in the event of another European war. In 1941, Hitler completely breaks this treaty and invades the Soviet Union, and that takes us up to the beginning of Soviet involvement in WWII.

That was a very long-winded and simultaneously simplistic account of what happened. Stalinism is far more complex and horrifying than can possibly be expressed in a Reddit post, but I think this more or less covers the major events. If you're curious, I can point you towards some further reading on this period.

g-gorilla-gorilla,"Just a note, Russia did not have to back out of WWI to deal with the revolution.  The revolution(s) occurred as Russia was still fighting.  One of the big issues on which the Bolsheviks came to power, over other rival groups, was their determination to immediately end the war (most other groups supported continuing Russia's participation in the war, which was quite unpopular).  

Additionally, while other posters will almost certainly (correctly) mention the horrible things that happened, it's worth remembering just how far the USSR came in this period.  I don't want to engage in apologism, but the mere fact that they were able to defeat Nazi Germany, lose 20 million men, and then quickly recover again and become a power to challenge the United States globally is one of the most extraordinary things seen in a long time.

RedPurpleBlack,"The top comment is really good, but I'd like to add a few more things.

* The Soviet-Polish War happens between 1919 and 1921. The Poles are able to fight them to a standstill, and it ends in the division of disputed Belorussian territory. This is important because it ends the idea of global revolution and makes the Soviet Union into a belligerent power expanding for its own sake.

* After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviets started to reach out and take control over their sphere of influence. They invade Finland in the Winter War, are stopped by winter and fierce resistance, and only win by having the bigger army. They take some disputed territory and a naval base, but I'm not sure if they thought they'd take the whole country. The Union's weak performance in the Polish and Finnish war contributed to Hitler's belief that it would quickly collapse when the Axis invaded. The Finns would fight again after the start of Barbarossa in the Continuation War, which they planned together with the German action.

* Russia gives an ultimatum to the Baltic States to accede to the Union. They give in, and Moscow later demands that Romania cede a region called Barbarossa. This, and the earlier Vienna Dictate which forced it to transfer Transylvania to Hungary, brings about a right-wing coup. Romania joins the Axis and participates in Barbarossa. 

* While the Pact was in effect, there was a lot of Soviet-German economic cooperation. The Russians would provide oil, ores, and grain in exchange for technical information and industrial and naval hardware. 

* There were a series of border clashes between Soviet Union (and its puppet Mongolia) and the Empire of Japan (and its puppet Manchukuo) in what is now northeastern China. They don't escalate, but it showed how ineffective the Japanese could be fighting a professional military on land.

In 1846 a British businessman bought a junk named *Keying* in Hong Kong and sailed it all the way to New York and London as a travelling exhibit. Among the crew were 30 Chinese sailors, who had been duped to believe they were only sailing to Singapore and Jarkata. This, as far as I know, was the only Chinese junk that managed to cross oceans (the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic) before the twentieth century; but by that time steamships had become the principal method of ocean crossing: 26 of the disgruntled Chinese crew boarded a steamship back to Guangzhou once the *Keying* reached New York, and the junk itself rotted away in Liverpool after the exhibition in London.",null,0,cdnyggo,1rggjh,askhistorians,top_week,2

It is a mixed bag of admiration and superiority. He led the Egyptian queen Arsinoe IV through the streets in chains, but he also borrowed the Egyptian calendar. Lucan even goes so far as to attribute Caesar's stint in Egypt as his reason for seeking autocracy. But equally interesting is an incident with Vespasian. Many Egyptian deities would make their way into the Roman pantheon. Vespasian seems to accept the Egyptian god Serapis as his patron deity, even believing he has a vision and is given powers to heal. This is telling as the cult of the emperor as deity was more an Eastern and Egyptian precedent. Here is an excerpt from Tacitus' *Histories*


"" This deepened Vespasian's desire to visit the holy house of Serapis, for he wished to consult the god on matters of state. He had everyone else excluded from the temple, and went in alone, fixing his mind on the deity. Happening to glance round, he caught sight of a leading Egyptian named Basilides standing behind him. Now he knew that this man was detained by illness far from Alexandria at a place several days' journey distant. He inquired of the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple that day. He also inquired of those he met whether he had been seen in the city. Finally he sent off a party on horse, and ascertained that at the relevant time he had been eighty miles away. Thereupon he guessed that the vision was a divine one and that the reply to his query lay in the meaning of the name Basilides.""",null,0,cdn1v9m,1rglly,askhistorians,top_week,4

rosemary85,"A book that adequately covered the literatures of *all* ancient cultures would be quite a sight! Let's see, if we set a cut-off point at, say, 400 CE we've got Sumerian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Ugaritic, Hittite/Hurrian, Greek, Israelite, Indian (Sanskrit, Tamil, and Pali), Chinese, and Roman. Some of these are much more copious than others: we've only got a few snippets in Sumerian; by contrast, we've got far more Greek literature than any of the others (though it isn't all literary), followed -- I think -- by Sanskrit and then Latin. If you extend the date a bit closer to the present you get lots more, like Syriac, Armenian, and so on.

Comparing them: how can you compare the literatures of a dozen cultures, when each culture's literature has a story of its own, with huge variation in styles and content? I wouldn't dare. A few comparative efforts have been made: Erich Auerbach's classic *Mimesis* (1946) devotes the first few chapters to comparing the styles of Greek, Israelite, and Roman literary works; a couple of recent books by Bruce Louden try to compare the Homeric epics to Israelite literature, though without any historical basis (*The Iliad: Structure, Myth, and Meaning* [2006]; *Homer's Odyssey and the Near East* [2011]).

Much more sane is the developmental approach that tries to isolate specific tropes and trace their development through many cultures' literatures and mythologies back to a hypothetical archetype, often Sumerian or Indo-European. This includes linguistic approaches, like Gregory Nagy's *Comparative Studies in Greek and Indic Meter* (1974) and Calvert Watkins' *How to Kill a Dragon* (1995), and mythological/typological approaches like M. L. West's *The East Face of Helicon* (1997) and *Indo-European Poetry and Myth* (2007). The good news is that, unlike the books I mentioned in the previous paragraph, studies like these are on pretty firm ground methodologically.

The bad news is that they also tend to be rather technical and forbidding. They deal with minutiae, rather than with grand things like ""world view"". I doubt very much that there is *anything* useful to be said about a monolithic world view: does the Hesiodic *Theogony* have more in common (in terms of world view) with Thucydides or Euclid than, say, with the *Ba'al Cycle*? I rather think not.

This is a very complicated topic and your question doesn't have a simple answer. There's a nugget of truth in this relating to events described in the primary sources, but popular perception of what happened has been heavily distorted in a way that bares little resemblance to the truth. Essentially, a number of factual events, misunderstandings, and outright myths have been confused with each other over time. This has ultimately produced this elaborate (but largely inaccurate) story that Cortés was an incarnation of Quetzalcoatl.

**Mesoamericans calling Europeans Gods**

There's a common tendency for European conquest sources to describe the natives referring to the Europeans as gods. Most of the Spanish accounts just take this for granted. The only first-hand account I've been able to find that seems to hint at what the natives might have actually thought is this quote from Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Bit of context, Cortés had just told the local Totonac people to imprison an Aztec tribute collector. They explained this was effectively a declaration of war, to which Cortés replied that he would take responsibility for it. The Totonacs were shocked:

&gt;The act they [the Totonac nobles] had witnessed was so astonishing and of such importance to them that they said no human beings dared to do such a thing, and it must be the work of teules. Therefore, from that moment they [natives] called us [Spanish] teules, which means gods or demons.

After this, the conquistadors start calling themselves ""teules,"" and the natives apparently do too.

There's a few issues with this though. First, ""Teule"" isn't a word. ""Teotl"" is, but it isn't a word in Totonac. It's a Nahuatl word. The Totonacs translated their word into Nahuatl, and then from there it was translated to Mayan, and from there to Spanish, where it was rendered as ""gods or demons."" It's hard to know what the original context of the phrase was because we don't know how it was used in the Totonac language. When later people continue calling the Spanish teotl, it's unclear if they actually thought the Spanish were divine or if they're just calling them that because the Spanish are calling themselves that.

**Possible Meanings**

The other problem comes with different concepts of divinity. The Mesoamerican concept of a ""teotl"" is not the same as the Grecko-Roman concept of a god. It's probably closer to the idea of a kami in the Shinto religion, in that it's not necessarily omnipotent or immortal. To put it another way, if you were to try to translate the major figures of the Christian religion into the Aztec world view, God, the Devil, all of the saints, all of the demons, all of the angels, and all of the prophets would be rendered as ""teotl"". For that matter, so would elves, goblins, fairies, or other creatures of Germanic folklore.

So when the natives were calling the Spanish ""teotl,"" they could have meant gods, or they could have just meant non-human. Or they could have meant that they were human, but simply had the backing of supernatural powers. For all we know, the Totonac lords could have meant it sarcastically. We only have the interaction recorded in Spanish, so there's no way to know. Either way, the Spanish thought that the natives thought they were gods and they began claiming divinity.They continually referred to themselves as 'teules.' When the Spanish arrived in Tenochtitlan, Motecuzoma put a stop to this immediately (Diaz del Castillo 2003 p207):

&gt;[Cortés], I know very well that these people of Tlaxcala with whom you are such good friends have told you that I am a sort of God or [teotl] ... I know well enough that you are wise and did not believe it but took it as a joke. Behold now, Señor [Cortés], my body is of flesh and bone like yours ... that I am a great king and inherit the riches of my ancestors is true, but not all the nonsense and lies that they have told you about me, although of course you treated it as a joke, as I did your thunder and lightning.

It doesn't take a PhD to see that while Motecuzoma is talking about himself here, he's also talking about Cortés. He's letting Cortés know that he knows he's just a human being, so he should stop claiming to be something else. Now, during the early colonial period the Spanish didn't have the nuanced understanding of this that we do now, and this ""Spaniards as gods"" thing was accepted as historical fact for a while.

**Cortes as Quetzalcoatl**

After the conquest, this myth got conflated with another myth: the returning god-king Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin. Some time (likely in the 13th century AD) there was a king of a city called Tula named Ce Acatl Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl. (IIRC, he was probably a real person as his name is carved on a pillar at the site of Tula, but much of his story has obviously been mythologized.) He was basically like a Mesoamerican ""King Arthur"" and is closely associated with the god Quetzalcoatl for whom he is named. (Often the two are equated with each other. Mesoamerican concepts of divinity are complicated and it wasn't uncommon for kings to associate themselves with gods.) The story goes that his nobles were jealous of his power, and so they tricked him into disgracing himself and forced him into exile. Before he left, he cursed those who betrayed him and vowed one day that he would return to reclaim his lost kingdom. He then got on boats and went east across the ocean. (If the story is true, he likely went to the Yucatan Peninsula, which is due east from the coast nearest to the Basin of Mexico.)
During the Early Colonial period, this story got conflated with Cortés. Supposedly the Aztecs believed that Cortés was a reincarnation of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin - supposedly because he arrived in the year One Reed. One Reed was the calendrical portion of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin's name (Ce Acatl). However, most modern scholars (for example, Mike Smith, Matthew Restall, etc.) consider this to be one of these post-hoc prophecy attributions. Cortés does not mention it in his letters to the King of Spain, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo only makes vague references to a prophecy about ""white men with beards"" who would rule over Mexico. However, Diaz del Castillo was writing decades after the fact, when this legend of Cortés-as-Quetzalcoatl had already been established. It seems more likely that the prophecy was attributed to Cortés after the conquest as a means of explaining what happened.

**EDIT**: As others have pointed out, the attribution of the Quetzalcoatl prophecy to Cortés is discussed by Sahagún, who is writing decades after the conquest but largely pulling the account from indigenous informants. However, as Restall (2003:112-114) demonstrates, this version of events was popularized by Christian missionaries like Motolinía in the late 1520s as a conversion tactic - it helped if the natives saw the conquest as divinely ordained. And as /u/400-Rabbits pointed out (referencing Brumfiel), many of Sahagún's informants were Christian Nahuas, who would have been influenced by these early missionaries. So yeah, just because it's mentioned in a colonial era source doesn't make it true.

BeondTheGrave,"Im having a little trouble understanding your question? I think youre asking why people stop being incensed by atrocities. Or maybe why do conquered peoples eventually assimilate? 

The answer to the first question is simple: who still cares? Take the Carthage example, youll be hard pressed to find a Carthaginian whose incensed about those Italian upstarts. And those Italian upstarts have been conquered and reconquered so many times that their ancient culture has been virtually annihilated. So why would I get upset about it?

As for why cultures seem to assimilate (instead of carrying that ""beef"" with them forever), is one day it becomes better to be a (say) Roman than a Carthaginian. Your country was destroyed, you certainly cant rebel, the Romans will discriminate against you if you self-identify as Carthaginian (or if *they* identify you as a Carthaginian), so at some point it just becomes too hard for the common person to resist. And children especially, who are taught by the conquering culture, taught in a foreign language, raised with foreign children, eventually see *themselves* as a ""foreigner"". Its just natural. 

But these are ancient examples. I think if you look more recently, youll find that these acculturation processes take many generations. Look at the American Natives, some have assimilated, but an equal number are still angry about their conquest. And the Russians, they still celebrate the ""Great Patriotic War"", their expulsion of a conquering German army. So there are a lot of these passions still boiling in modern society which many people still have not forgotten and are still outraged over. (Armenian Genocide, Bay of Pigs, American Revolution, US Civil War, World War One, and the other aspects of World War Two, just to name a few hot button issues). 

The subtext here Im picking up is a general question as to why people arent more outraged by wars, especially older ones. And, aside from the previous comments on conflicts in cultural memory, I would like to point out that war is natural. We humans, for whatever reason, really like to kill each other. Weve been doing it a while, and were getting quite good at it. So the process of conquering, and being conquered, is fundamentally part of human experience. The people of the past understood this a lot better than we do now (assuming you are American or European), given our prolonged period of peace. So on a fundamental level, its hard to get upset over somebody being conquered. Its a natural fact of life, and it has gone on millennia (its even in the Bible!). In fact Id bet itll go on for millennia more.

Tahkoxi Menatay is the name for North America in the Lenape language. Turtle's foundational role in establishing a homeland for the people of the Eastern Woodlands is widespread, though the details differ from place to place, and so the local equivalent of Tahkoxi Menatay is also widespread. The name *Turtle Island* itself has become especially commonplace in English-language indigenous literature in the last century or so.

EATCHEX,"One major factor, and the basis for the Nazi stock term ""Judeo-Bolshevism"" or ""Jewish Communism"", was the fact that many prominent communist revolutionaries were Jewish. Trotsky, ally of Lenin and creator of the Red Army that would eventually capture Berlin, was born Lev Brohnstein, and was ethnically Jewish; Lev Kamenev, first Soviet head of state and later acting Premier as Lenin was ill, was mixed Jewish-Russian (born Rosenfeld). Zinoviev (head of the Comintern), Uritsky (People's Commissar of the North Commune), Sverdlov (Chairman of the Secretariat RCP), and Sokolnikov (Commissar for Finance) were all Jews with high positions in the Soviet Union's leadership. 

Hitler pointed to this as evidence that the Jews had conspired to overtake Russia and pull her out of a war, and then asserted that they had infiltrated Germany with the same intentions, and had made her weak. Germany was humiliated following the end of WWI, and many Germans were more than happy to find someone -- anyone -- to assign blame to. Jews, as 'outsiders in our midst', have long been easy scapegoats and targets for outrage and panic, and they became so again.

In reality, Jews made up ~7% of the Bolshevik membership under Lenin, and ~20% of its leadership. This *is* disproportionately high on both counts, but that's not evidence of a Jewish conspiracy, it's evidence of the fact that socially oppressed groups are more likely to agitate for radical change, and that people who join because their ethnicity/identity is discriminated against are more likely to be educated (and thus reach leadership positions) than people who join because of their work conditions in the mines and factories.",null,0,cdn56m9,1rgw7e,askhistorians,top_week,5

The issue of the existence of distinct human races is problematic and controversial in and of itself. Certainly, no contemporary scientist will agree that there is such a thing as the Aryan race. Obviously, which such a flawed premise, it is hardly surprising that the experiments yielded no results.

&gt;in 1944, he began his own project on twins, [...] **Were there reproducible racially determined differences in serum following an infectious disease?** [...] Dr Mengele infected identical and fraternal twins, Jewish and Gypsy twins with the same quantity of typhoid bacteria, took blood at various times for chemical analysis in Berlin, and followed the course of the disease. According to [Jewish inmate doctor and forced assistant) Dr Nyiszli, he also worked with tuberculous twins. [...] Dr Mengele's letters and reports to  [Nazi research physician] Professor von Verschuer were probably destroyed by von Verschuer [who went on to pursue a successful academic career after denazification]. [...] Right up to the last moments of the war, Professor von Verschuer was still hoping for a major breakthrough. [...] **Dr Mengele and Professor von Verschuer did not solve their problem**. (Benno Muller-Hill, *Murderous Science*, 1998)

For more on the tuberculosis study in particular and why it was scientifically flawed for other than racist reasons, see Benno Muller-Hill, [*Genetics of susceptibility to tuberculosis: Mengele’s experiments in Auschwitz*](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~piecze/MengeleBennoMullerHill.pdf) (Nature, Vol 2, August 2001, pp 631-634). Essentially, Mengele and his supervisor **clung to an outdated theory**.

Mengele also used the twins in (extremely painful) experiments to try to change their eye colour, but failed. This was an attempt at research on phenogenetic eye pigmentation and eye colour heredity. A particular Nazi focus was to find out **whether the structure and colour of the eye could be used to determine the ""race""** (Jewish or Aryan) of the subject. (Benoît Massin, *Mengele, die Zwillingsforschung und die „Auschwitz-Dahlem Connection""*. In: Carola Sachse (Ed.): *Die Verbindung nach Auschwitz. Biowissenschaften und Menschenversuche an Kaiser-Wilhelm-Instituten. Dokumentation eines Symposiums.* Göttingen 2003)

Secondly, many ""experiments"" seemed to have sprouted from an impulse of the moment and were not part of an integrated study as were the two experiments described above. No original paperwork survives on the other experiments, we therefore rely on a great number of eyewitness testimony. Some of these bizarre experiments were: sewing twins together to create conjoined twins, surgeries such as organ removal, castration, and amputations.

A symposium uniting experts from the field of law, history and medicine was held at the University of Minnesota in 1989 to discuss the Nazi human experiments. It had this to say about why Mengele's research was useless:

&gt;The experiments were carried out under circumstances that were scarcely representative of the normal human condition. The debilitated physical conditions of many of the victims most certainly confounded results from the experimental procedures.  [...]

Beck2012,"I am afraid that the core of your question is against this subreddit main rule - history starts 20 years ago.

As for the historical relations between Vietnam and China - well, they've been historically quite hostile. Vietnam, quite succesfully, has been able for centuries to oppose Chinese effort to conquer it by military means. Sure, cultural influence of China on Vietnam is tremendous. But the war of 1979 was one of many.

Diffrence between Vietnam and Korea in a larger scope (not only 20th century) is that Korea was more welcoming of Chinese hegemony. Which was pretty much symbolic and China wasn't very eager to support its (de iure) vassals. INtervention in Korea-Japan war in late 16th century was crucial for China - they were protecting status quo in the region, Japan wanted to take the position of China as a regional hegemon.

As for intervention in 1979 - Vietnam was an ally of China's biggest rival (or even enemy) - USSR. Also, China was the only country close to Kampuchea (calling them allies, especially in 1979, would be exaggeration; even Chinese communists were pretty negative towards Pol Pot's politics and economic ideas - but they had no other choice than supporting them and, from time to time, scolding for idiotic ideas; remember that since 1978 China takes the route of liberalization under the rule of Deng Xiaoping, so agrarian state of Saloth Sar was far from the new economic policy of CPC).

Kim Il Sung was very crafty politician that was able to balance between USSR and China. And both countries needed him as a leader of a frontier nation of communist states (rivals to the position of leaders of communist movement in the world but still joint enemies of capitalist world). In the sino-russian split he decided to remain neutral but other countries had to decide - as I've written, neither of those powers could allow themselves to stop supporting NK, because one of the pillars of the East Asia strategy of both China and USSR was to keep the status quo and not to let the South to attack North Korea. Neither China, nor USSR could afford another Korean War, which was a catastrophy for Chinese economy.

Also, war of 1979 wasn't a full-scale war - again, china didn't want to spent to much resources on it, they just wanted to show Vietnam where its place is. They didn't succeed, forgetting that Vietnamese soldiers were one of the most exeprianced and best equipped in the world at that time - geography was also on their side. The main goal of Chinese army was to quickly break Vietnam and crush its imperialist ambitions. Remember, that the decisions in Cambodia came from Hanoi till the late 1990s (and some say that the influence is still enormous, Hun Sen was for years Vietnamese puppet, but now he changed his priorities to China - yesterday came a shipment of 12 Chinese helicopters to Cambodia, btw).

rosemary85,"No! This is a modern myth.

The story that irrational numbers were a source of horror to the ancient Greeks seems to come indirectly from a book published in 1892, John Burnet's [*Early Greek Philosophy*, page 117:](http://archive.org/stream/burnetgreek00burnrich#page/116/mode/2up)

&gt; For the present, the incommensurability of the diagonal and the square remained, as has been said, a ""scandalous exception."" Our tradition says that Hippasos of Metapontion was drowned at sea for revealing this skeleton in the cupboard.

Hippasos is known from other sources to have been an important Pythagorean in the 5th century BCE. 

Burnet's use of quotation marks around ""scandalous exception"" suggests that he may have got this from a still earlier source, but I've not been able to isolate it by searching for that phrase in Google Books prior to 1892. Anyway, the more responsible online science writers that discuss Greek attitudes to irrationals cite Burnet as their ultimate source. I've also seen the same myth come up in very non-scientific contexts, like William Messner-Loebs' wonderful (but very inaccurate) *Epicurus the Sage*.

Unfortunately for all these people that cite Burnet as their authority, Burnet simply got it wrong. He himself, in a footnote, attributes this story to Iamblichos, *Life of Pythagoras* (§34) 247; but it's just not what Iamblichos says. In charity I'll assume that he misremembered it, rather than supposing that he never actually bothered to look at the text of Iamblichos. In Iamblichos, the story has nothing to do with irrational numbers, and Hippasos doesn't get murdered by his fellow Pythagoreans. Instead, Iamblichos says, 

&gt; Some say that a divinity took vengeance on him for making Pythagorean teachings public. For he perished in the sea, on the grounds of being impious, for revealing the the structure of the eikosagon -- that is to say, the dodecahedron, which is a single solid composed of five-sided shapes folded in a spherical manner.

So in other words, Hippasos drowned in a storm or shipwreck, and some people with vivid imaginations attributed it to divine vengeance. Burnet misremembered this story as being about irrational numbers, and compounded his error by adding the ""embellishment"" that Hippasos was deliberately drowned by his companions.

Long story short: there's no basis at all for supposing that the Greeks thought irrationals were a thing of horror. That misconception only comes from John Burnet having a brain-fart in the 1890s. Ancient mathematical writers that discuss irrationals treat them as any other mathematical problem. It's much more realistic to regard the discovery of irrationals as the *greatest achievement* of the Pythagorean school!

Muskwatch,"Questions of matriarchy are tied up in questions of authority.  Within a western context when we think of patriarchy or matriarchy it's often with the idea of male or female leadership, with significant authority to give orders, make important decisions, and so on.  Within most Indigenous North American cultures this view doesn't really hold water entirely. Many of the nations in my area of North America (British Columbia) are matriarchally organized, so in that sense at least, matriarchy was commonly practiced.  However, that matriarchal organization might not have the same sort of power that you might think.  Power - the ability to influence others, at least in this area was heavily tied in to obligations developed through the potlatch system.  You cement connections with people, you build up your name, and as a result build up influence.  The matriarchal nature of your community would determine who you saw as relative, who your primary obligations were to (and there were often separate father side obligations as well as mother side).  Women did have a lot of power, they often controlled a lot of wealth, territory, rights, but it did not match up to the idea of a political leader as we might see it today or as it is sometimes portrayed.  

At the same time, the very egalitarian nature of many communities often meant that the division of labour between men and women was much more equal - families that make their living off the land generally work together, and value each other in a different way than agrarian societies, and spiritual leadership has almost always been with women in any community I've interacted with.",null,0,cdngykt,1rh3gw,askhistorians,top_week,3

Second: No, actually it's not safe to assume naturalism (realistic representation of observed visual reality) was any ancient artist's goals. Think of Christian icons, which are highly stylized and governed by strict protocols in representation. Greek sculpture excelled at naturalism. In the Renaissance, studies of optics and the development of receding perspective in drawing (not to mention use of the camera obscura) allowed for increased naturalism.

The art you linked to heavily relies on photography as a tool. Through photography, humans could see details, for instance at high speeds, that cannot be observed with the naked eye (such as the water splash in the cup with lemon slices). Conventions such as cutting images off with the edge of the picture plane only developed after the introduction of photography (as in the image of strawberries).

The introduction of photography in the 19th century freed painters from the need to represent observed reality, ushering in the many movements of the Modern Era. Photorealists of the 1960s and 1970s embraced representation, not of observed realities, but of the photographic surface.

diana_mn,"Japan set a fairly unique course in its interactions with Western nations from the start. Even before Japan's famous ""opening to the West"" in 1854, they had observed a succession of Western powers militarily and economically defeating and humiliating China. Their main fear in their own relations with the West was that they might suffer a similar fate. 

Their initial interactions with Western powers seemed to confirm these fears, as a succession of nations forced acceptance of treaties granting themselves access, trade, and certain extra-territorial rights for their citizens within Japan itself. While military encounters never broke into open war as they had in China, the threat was persistent, and Japan's leaders were keenly aware that they were in no position to conduct a full scale war with Western powers in its current state.

The failure of the previous government (the Tokugawa lead shogunate) to resist the Western powers soon lead to its overthrow, under the popular rallying cry ""sonnō jōi,"" (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians). However the new government resisted a reactionary approach in ""expelling barbarians."" Instead they undertook a thorough study of the Western powers in order to understand what made the world's great powers so successful. 

The prime symbol of this effort was a famous around-the-world expedition lead by Prince Iwakura Tomomi. The Iwakura Mission had two main objectives. The first was to gather information about the modern world to inform Japan's own decision making about necessary reforms. The second was to renegotiate the unequal treaties Japan had been forced to accept under the prior regime. 

The mission was a huge success in meeting its first objective. The information brought back and the relationships forged with Western nations fired the imagination of Japan's reform-minded leaders, and gave many examples in technology, government, education, and commerce upon which to model their efforts. 

However when it came to the second objective - renegotiation of the unequal treaties - the mission utterly failed. It was such a failure that certain leaders within the mission were blamed for having even attempted such a thing before Japan had sufficient leverage at the negotiation table.

The insight that Japan gained from this failure was that Western powers like the United States, United Kingdom, and France did not view them as an equal power. Until Japan established itself as a peer to the world's great powers they would forever be treated as an inferior. The motivation to correct this was the overarching goal of Japan's policy for the next several decades. It not only fueled helpful reforms like democracy, universal education, industrialization, and free markets, but also lead Japan in an increasingly aggressive militaristic direction. 

So, to recap, Japan embraced Western ideas about modern government, economy, and technology as a direct response to Western intervention in Asia in general, and Japan specifically. Their relations with Western nations were hugely affected by their desire to be seen as an equal to Western powers, understanding this to be the key to being treated as an equal in diplomatic affairs. The wrenching changes required were in large part palatable under Japan's reform-minded Meiji government because the prior regime (under the shogunate) took the blame for getting Japan into its unequal mess in the first place.

[Central heating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_heating#History) is just one of ways to provide uniform temperature in a building - the other being a source of heat such as ceramic or iron stove. While I agree that Roman technology that many Imperial officials brought with them was both superior to anything people used Britain or much of Europe for that matter (with exception to certain monasteries) and effectively lost to general populace as an advancement I would seriously debate that someone who was able to put a stove in every habitable room and provide for servants to maintain them had it sufficiently worse than a person with central heating. On the continent stoves were in use as far as into 1950's and 1960's and they only went out of use because of the work that needs to be done - especially if you're living in a multi-story building in a city.

However Churchill might simply relate to the fact that because of English climate many people would not bother with having a stove everywhere and just rely on two fireplaces in main rooms to dissipate the warmth (which would be very ineffective). So it might be simply the case of tradition rather than technology or affordability.  In Russia stoves in every room were used by any person that could afford it as far as XVII century.

Pramoedya,"I am definitely not an authority on this, but I did a project on the symbolism behind the swastika a few years ago and looked into this a bit (I was interested because I have Indian heritage). 

Essentially, Hitler (etc.) viewed the contemporary Aryans in India as not fully Aryan. That is to say, they are descended from Aryans, but their 'purity' was diluted into the general south asian/ dravidian population. By the term 'Aryan' he was referring to the ancient, white, proto-european conquerors that settled/invaded the sub-continent and much of asia. Although as far as I am aware they originated somewhere near Iran(?). I always thought it was weird that Hitler always banged on about Aryans and then in the same breath held blonde hair and blue eyes in such high regard. This was because all the people I had met who identified as Aryan were south asian (i.e. black-dark hair, darker skin, etc.). 

However, I think the problem is in the semantics. By 'Aryan', Hitler meant the old school horse-riding peoples from east europe/west asia who bandied around conquering and settling much of europe and asia. Whilst, many south asian people, or people who are more familiar with that culture than western culture view the word 'Aryan' as denoting a current population, who (through years of intermingling) became largely intertwined with the indigenous population. In contrast, Nazis viewed the european breed of Aryan and pure-blood.

I think the one thing both Hitler and Indian people can agree on are that the Aryans were fair skinned. In hitlers mindset I think this translated into the blonde hair, blue eyes thing, whilst in the Indian mindset this translated into simply a fairer complexion in comparison to other ethnic groups in India (such as the darker Dravidians) - a skin tone similar to, say, Iranian people.

What I think is interesting is that in both cultures the notions of being Aryan is linked with superiority. Whilst we are all very familiar with Hitler's ramblings, it is important to also note that skin tone is very important in India, with society having a preference for lighter skinned people. Hence, this translates into people of Aryan descent (them being fairer skinned) as being seen as superior. A cousin of mine, when I asked her why she prefers men with lighter skin, even said it is because it makes them look more european... when you actually think about the implications of that view its pretty fucked up. Sometimes I think India is having some kind of post-colonial withdrawal issue. :/

Anyhow, in conclusion. Hitler's opinions of the Aryans in India was probably not very good. He would have been aware that the Aryans settled and colonised vast swathes of the asia and europe.    The Nazis viewed themselves as pure bred Aryans while they saw the Indian Aryans as being simply descendents of Aryans. 

To be honest, it is very difficult to think of any objective rhyme or reason for any extremist view, and if you try to find one you will probably be looking for a long time. Extremist philosophy and politics is steeped in biased views of history, and unscientific science. Hence, its not surprising that Hitler's views on who the Aryans were/are end up equally as hodge podged.

tinyshadow,"It is certainly true that Hitler persecuted Catholics in particular. You are correct that many in the Third Reich were Catholic, but you may not know that those individuals tended not to vote for Hitler and the Catholic churches often denounced the Nazi party fairly publicly. In the early 1930s, Hitler promised he would not silence other political parties or the churches. However, what would soon occur is now known by many historians as **Kirchenkampf** or the Church Struggle.


Kirchenkampf follows a clear chronological timeline. In regards to Catholics specifically, here's what happened:

1. Early 1933: Catholic political parties are dissolved. Hitler installs Ludwig Müller as Reichsbischof, or Reich Bishop, a man who would control the new conglomerate of Germany's 28 regional Protestant churches. There is no Catholic equivalent to this. 

2. Late 1933, early 1934: Continued Gleichschaltung, or coordination, which meant the dissolution of other organizations in favor of one unified state-run Nazi-based organization. This meant that Catholic Youth Leagues were totally dissolved, and Catholic children are forced into Hitler Youth programs. Meanwhile, a Protestant opposition has formed called the Confessing Church, led in part by Martin Neimoller. During the Night of the Long Knives, several Catholic leaders were targeted and assassinated. Hitler appoints anti-Catholic men to high-ranking positions with the Nazi regime, who go out of their way to persecute Catholics, albeit sporadically.

3. Late 1934 to early 1937: Hitler forces the removal of crucifixes from schools and bans daily religious periodicals as well as begins censoring weekly periodicals. The Nazis continue to dominate the Protestant church and replace Müller (who has failed to accomplish that goal conclusively) with Hans Kerrl. The Confessing Church protests loudly, and they are often violently silenced. This includes mass arrests of opposing pastors.

4. Early 1937 to 1939: Pope Pius XI issues Mit brennender Sorge, or With Burning Concern. It is smuggled into Germany and read in every Catholic church on one Sunday. In this, the Pope denounces Nazi ideology and criticized Nazism for contradicting Catholic dogma. It strongly condemned racism and even protected baptized Jews. The Gestapo visited nearly every Catholic church and took any copies that they found. Anyone who had a hand in the printing or publication of the paper had their business attacked and shut down. Indeed, the Pope's speech only seems to have provoked the Nazis, because from early 1937, Hitler *hated* Catholics. He went out of his way to make sure that they were persecuted. He began ""immorality trials"" which often suggested lewd and horrible behavior and actions from clergy, who would endure false trials and receive outrageous punishments for crimes that they did not commit (such as sexual perversion and homosexuality, among others). In the summer of that year, the Confessing Church is formally banned, and Martin Niemöller is arrested.

5. 1939–1945: There is all out war between Christianity and Nazism in the Third Reich. Countless clergy of both Protestant and Catholic denominations are arrested and put in concentration camps (so many that Dachau had ""The Priest Barracks"" - 95% of them were Catholic). Against their will, many clergy were drafted into the military services. Publications and sermons were restricted, censored, or even banned outright. Services were increasingly dissolved or banned from occurring. 

Whew. **tl;dr** - Yes, Catholics were singled out among the Christian denominations, which is not to say that Protestants had it any easier. However, Hitler did particularly dislike Catholicism, especially its separate organizations and its radical priests and nuns. His response to them was assassination, imprisonment, false trials, as well as dissolving their political and social organizations, ending their services, censoring and destroying their publications.

**Oh, and PS: Hitler's mother may have been very Catholic, but his father was not. As Hitler grew into adulthood, he began to hate Christianity more and more and preferred secular ideas, though he certainly understood the power of Christianity and used it early in Nazi ideology only to fully remove it later.**",null,0,cdnfew5,1rhbey,askhistorians,top_week,11

It's difficult to point to an exact moment at which we can say that the empire 'split up' -- we do so in retrospect and with the benefit of hindsight, but it is less effective to make such claims from the point of view of the people living at the time.
Important thing to consider -- there had been multiple emperors ruling Rome simultaneously long before we would consider the empire divided; for example, Marcus Aurelius actually ruled alongside Lucius Verus until Verus died. Diocletian famously established the Tetrarchy, which established four simultaneous emperors of different status and with different zones of control, perhaps laying the foundation for a theory of multiple empires, but his system lasted about as long as he did; Constantine reunited the empire. 
Thus, the relationship would perhaps be best described as one in which the two parts of the empire saw each other as parts of the same ""nation"" -- a loaded word -- but with separate, and often rival courts. Two simultaneous emperors would often work against one another, and many of the major battles of the empire were fought by Romans against Romans, rather than foreign nations, so that doesn't mean that they always cooperated well, and it suggests that we ought not see competition and strife between the two 'halves' as suggesting that they viewed themselves as separate nations.
Note that when the western Empire 'fell,' the Ostrogoths were theoretically governing Italy on behalf of the eastern Empire -- there was no concept that Italy fell outside the purview of Constantinople. There continued to be a 'Byzantine' presence in Italy until the Normans, and Justinian I saw the invasions of Italy, Sicily, and Iberia as reconquests of Roman land rather than taking 'western' imperial territories.",null,0,cdnejac,1rhbz2,askhistorians,top_week,7
pharmaceus,"There are two separate problems here. 

If you are referring to the famines in the Soviet Union it wasn't just the result of collective farming (which in itself can be sufficiently efficient as seen in the kibbutzem ) but the fact that the collectivization was - besides ideological reasons -  a method of centralizing all agricultural products in one place and then expropriating it for further redistribution and export. Also it was an efficient tool of subjugating unruly peasants in Ukraine.

If you are referring to inefficiency of collective farming then it is an economic problem that has roots in how work is organized in a collective arrangement without even symbolic price systems.  An interesting take on a historical example can be found in *Conceived in Liberty vol.1* by Murray Rothbard who referring to the Thanksgiving legend put the causes of famine in American colonies on collectivist ideas and the ""miraculous""improvement on simply returning to more rational method of management.  Right now I can't think of a ready-made historical example but essentially it boils down to this: If a farm is run this way it puts the whole incentive system for really hard work upside down and agricultural production being very labour-intensive (and even more so in the past) is very easy to fail if everyone is not doing their best.",null,1,cdndrc2,1rhelo,askhistorians,top_week,2
HeloRising,"The issue tends to be with expectations rather than the farming system itself.

It's a problem seen in places like North Korea today; the government sets a target for a particular farm to reach and that target is nowhere near what that farm is able to produce. The target is arrived at with a formula that basically says this much land + this many people = this much food except farming is almost never that precise. This leads to farms inflating how much they've actually grown to meet quotas and a huge overestimation of the food supply.

If you're talking about an authoritarian government they may be ordering people to do jobs for which they lack the skills for. China made this mistake during the Great Leap Forward when it commanded collectives to melt everything down to produce steel in their backyards. Except very few people actually knew how to make steel and most of it was garbage.

MarcusDohrelius,"In 494 in the Early Roman Republic there was a *secessio plebis* or plebian revolt as part of the ongoing ""conflict of the orders"" with the patricians, who at the time were still closely related to the advisors of the recently deposed monarchy (509 B.C). Slave debt was a big issue, where, in a simplified explanation, Roman farmers who were full citizens would have their farms fall into disarray during wartimes and they would be forced to be indentured servants to pay it back. There was sense of honouring the veterans. So in 495B.C soldiers were exempted from this practice. That eased some tensions, but outrage at underrepresentation and exploitation amongst the plebeians was on the rise. 

[This map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Roman_conquest_of_Italy.PNG) is phenomenal and shows Rome's neighbours and its expansion during the Republic. The Volscii were a particular threat and in 494 the Plebs seized the opportunity and retreated to the *Mons Sacer* and refused their military service. This caused a panic and their demands were met with the creation of the sacrosanct office of the Tribune of the Plebs. 

Another revolution to check, led by Tribunes, would be the grain reforms of the Gracchi brothers in the late Republic. 

All of the accounts of the Plebian Seccessions can be found in Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita* and Appian on the Civil Wars for the Gracchi.

lukeweiss,"It is absolutely the case from as early as we have reliable history. The Han conflict with the Xiongnu saw much mixing along the northern borders of the imperium, but was not the first such ""northernification"" (my term, just thought of it!). In fact, we are pretty comfortable with the image of the earliest ""dynasty"" (not an appropriate term for them, as they weren't ruling over an empire of any consequence), the Shang, as that of a semi-nomadic (or at least peripatetic), horse dependent chiefdom. This characterization is more like the later northern non-han peoples than that of the Han. So, and the work of Victor Mair, among others, has especially driven this point home, the influx/mixing of northern peoples with ""han"" peoples strikes to the very roots of chinese society.  
Flash forward to the post Han dynasty period, and we have a north dominated by invading northern peoples for the better part of 400 years. This period was capped off with the Tang Dynasty (618CE onward), a dynastic household of not-so-thinly-veiled mixed blood. The Li family were  clearly of mixed ""barbarian"" decent, but worked extremely hard both to hide that fact, and to legitimize their ancient family creds. They did this in two major ways:  
1. By literally re-writing the list of great families. A list that formerly gave primacy to the old guard families of the Shandong area. The power structure of the Tang was wrapped up in this change, as the Tang were eager to shift the familial power structure to the northwest, from the center/east. It is not clear how seriously the change was taken, but no matter the answer to that question, both sets of aristocratic groups wouldn't survive the Tang.  
2. Aligning themselves with that great ancient philosopher, Laozi. This was an astute move, the old master sharing the surname Li with the imperial house gave them instant credibility as potential holders of the mandate of heaven (a tenuous grip that could always be relinquished). Again, it is not all that clear how seriously this was taken, but the early Tang rulers drove home the connection time and again.   
After the Tang we see another influx of northern semi-nomadic peoples, this time upping the ante significantly. Chinese historiography for generations tried to minimize their importance - for example, the period is known as the ""Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms,"" a title that gives credit only to the areas ruled mostly by Han chinese. It ignores the significance of the northern regions under the Khitans, Shatuo Turks, and Tanguts, who all held power pretty solidly until Mongol expansion a few centuries later.     
These regions were full of Han chinese, and the new states of the Xi Xia and Khitans clearly modeled themselves politically after the Middle Kingdom. Many adapted and adopted new official scripts, that their imperial edicts could be read far and wide - a very chinese thing to do!  
So the mixing continued and continued. The Mongols tried desperately to maintain their non-Han status, but this only isolated the upper strata of the Mongol power structure. F.W. Mote mentions, in his history of middle period china *Imperial China 900-1800*, that the Mongols in Han China became destitute by the 14th century, because they had no official status, and a shrinking share of the imperial booty. Isolation was therefore bad for longevity.   
The Qing brought a massive influx of Manchus, who also tried to maintain cultural isolation. But again, this wasn't sustainable, and many mixed in with Han China. A small group, mostly those closest to the imperial family, remained ethnically isolated, and were on the long train back to Manchuria in 1911.   
So, TL:DR - Mixing of northern ethnicities with Han chinese is as old as chinese civilization itself. It only increased as time went by. Interestingly, it seems the only successful invaders NOT to stay for a while and mix it up in China were the Tibetans, who's 9th century invasion did not involve sticking around for breeding.

skyanvil,"Ethnic mixing happened far more often in Chinese history, particularly in Northern China, than most people think (more than even some modern Chinese think).

The short answer is, YES, Northern Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the North.  Even before that, Western Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the West.  And Southern Chinese also mixed with various tribes of the South.

Ancient Chinese maps indicated that China was surrounded by Barbarian tribes in North, West, and the South.  Border region people mixed a lot, and the Chinese had no prohibition of that.  Indeed, early Chinese partly spread out on the concept of ""civilizing"" the Barbarians by mixing with them, and attempting to IMPRESS the Barbarians with Chinese culture, Chinese agricultural technologies, Chinese customs and virtues.

When China was occupied by Barbarians, and even subsequently when China overthrew those dynasties, Han Chinese encouraged mixing with the Barbarians, which formed mixed-ethnic vanguard troops and mercenaries for the Chinese to guard their frontiers.

For example, after Ming Dynasty overthrew the Mongol Dynasty of Yuan, Ming Emperors employed vast numbers of Mongolian mercenaries, by promising them stable salary, and land for them to settle in China.  (This was very attractive offer to the Mongols, who traditionally only got paid well when they managed to take spoils in battle.  And in contrast, the Chinese were willing to pay them well to be on guard duty.)

So, slowly, the Mongol mercenaries settled in China, and mixed into the Chinese population.  Those who didn't settle in China, remained Mongolian nomads.

Bottomline:  1 of China's strengths is the ability to attract non-Chinese to mix into its population, with its riches of culture and technology.

MarcusDohrelius,"Medieval Europe borrowed exclusively from ancient medical precedents and intermixed these with spiritual causations like sin, fate, and other supernatural powers. The most prominent source was the ancient Greek, Hippocrates. He is where modern medicine gets its ""Hippocratic Oath."" He was the first to synthesise and record (despite there being earlier references, like the Egyptians) the idea of the four humours. These four humours were the cause of health. 

The four humors of Hippocratic medicine are black bile (Gk. melan chole), yellow bile (Gk. chole), phlegm (Gk. phlegma), and blood (Gk. haima). These are to be kept in balance or else sickness occurs. Increasing and decreasing these four elements was a central component of medieval, European medicine and some Islamic medicinal theory as well. Avicenna would be the most prominent amongst the Islamic medical theorists; he borrowed heavily from another ancient Greek, Galen. The four humours corresponded with the four states of hot,wet,cold, dry. Theophrastus, who was a successor to Aristotle in his school, would attribute the humours to aspects of character, thus one with too much blood was ""sanguine"".

An interesting medieval character to look at, though later than your stated dates(*The Canterbury Tales* are late 14th century), would be [Chaucer's Physician.](http://www.librarius.com/canttran/genpro/genpro413-446.htm).

thebullfrog72,"TL;DR Structural Engineering, Sources are fairly non-existent, I go through a pretty fringe argument at the end - it is useful in that it draws on common similarities and allows me to address each in turn. 

The pyramids that are so widespread are the Step Pyramid variety, which were built throughout the world. Although overshadowed by the Pyramids of Giza, Step Pyramids were the predecessor for these massive structures. 

Short answer, similar to why arches became ubiquitous; it's the best way to build large and tall structures that don't fall down, and remain stable over a long time. Without access to lighter building materials that would allow for greater vertical height, such as wood and metal, Step Pyramids were by far the most feasible, tall structures to build. The more ambitious Great Pyramid of Giza remained the tallest structure in the world until a new 150m spire was added to the Lincoln Cathedral in England, although that spire did collapse after just over 200 years. 

I'm not sure if you've tried to do any research on this yourself, but you will find yourself quickly in a realm of pseudoscience and pseudo-history that has come to dominate the topic. I'll go through one below.  

[This piece argues](http://thegreaterpicture.com/pyramids.html) that the pyramids around the world were built to honor aliens, using as evidence these common characteristics, some that are very common when looking at pyramid pseudo-science, and are the ones that on the surface make a connection seem clear:

&gt;The triangular form with a square base
&gt;

Engineering, like above, the best way to build a sturdy structure, one that is also as tall as possible. Having a cube structure would require more material for less height. 
 
&gt; The sides face the cardinal directions precisely

This claim only works with the Mayan step pyramids and the Egyptian Great Pyramids, it falls apart when dealing with the Temple of the Moon in Mexico and Borobudur in Indonesia. Both the Mayan and Egyptian cultures placed importance on solstice/equinox days, and worked to align their major, large-scale religious structures accordingly. 

&gt; They lie around the ""celestial equator"" (16) (the line that would be &gt;our equator if the Earth' axis wasn't tilted)

The Jared Diamond hate is mostly justified, but it was the place I encountered the counter-argument to the Europe-centric theory of geographic determinism, whereby a country's success is greatly affected by its distance from the equator. Prior to European advances, the reverse holds just as true, with numerous vast empires arising on this 'celestial equator,' closer to the equator than geographic determinism would account for. The climate allows for substantial agriculture, and the pseudo-science would extend to Mesopotamian and South East Asian civilizations, if they worked with the arguments. 

&gt; They contain all types of corridors and chambers

They were religious buildings, with the exception of Egypt meant to be used regularly, and Egyptian mythology provides the explanation for why large chambers, filled with supplies, would be necessary in their construction.  

&gt; They are made of stone (though most Chinese pyramids are made of &gt;a type of hard earth and some are even made of iron)

See available building materials above, various types of stone were used as they were around and provided durable structures. 

&gt; They are built the same way, on a base of large, uneven stone blocks &gt;that fit together seamlessly. This ground plane is extremely resistant to &gt;earthquakes

This point argues that they all build a strong base, and, without pointing to the Inca, touches on the idea of mortar-less structures. Although I'm a layman in engineering, mortar degrades and is still a major cause of old buildings being destroyed in earthquakes. Considering that earthquakes were a part of Egyptian mythology prior to the construction of the great pyramids, at the very least part of a god's attributes (see [Geb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geb)), it's not unlikely that the design of buildings which took over 20 years to build, involved tens of thousands of laborers and were made as tombs to their rulers and gods-to-be would take into consideration such destructive forces.   

&gt; Underground passages link the pyramids with each other

The Pharaoh's pyramids were linked with the similar so-called Queen's pyramids, not with each other. As these were tombs, rather than temple complexes which easily explain the use of tunnels between structures, it is a popular point. 

&gt;They are oriented on star(sign)s, especially Orion, Sirius, the Pleiades and Cygnus (Swan)

This comes off as similar to the argument that inter-empire contact must have necessary because of the ubiquity of sun/moon worship. Features of the sky, particularly when they represent in the mythologies of these empires the heavens, would make sense. 

Further, much of the arguments behind the specific alignments and the importance to Egypt of these star constellations has been debunked. Drawing parallels to constellations that come from another civilizations understanding of the night sky have no bearing on the way the Pyramids were constructed. [This argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_correlation_theory) revolves around the relationship of Orion's belt and the Pyramids at Giza. The concept of perfect symmetry doesn't hold up when the authors invert the maps in their own book.

BentNotBroken,"They were never really considered ""bomb shelters"" but rather ""Fallout Shelters"".  Properly stocked, you could hold out as long at your stocks held out and your water supply lasted.  There was no convenient bottled water at the time so the usual fall back was to be a cistern either in the shelter structure or under a sheltering structure for that purpose nearby.  All of this took money, tme and a great deal of forethought and constant upkeep to have a successful outcome.  Nature was included into the equation because it was expected that the first rain after the event(s) would wash away some of the fallout.  One did not want to have contaminated rain water to flow to the cistern so some provision had to be made for diversion of flow in the immediate aftermath of any hostile event.  

Holding out?  For what?  If the major cities were destroyed and the usual flow of commerce depended on the cities, the surviving population was then back to ""hunter/gathering"" or subsistence foraging. 

""Bomb Shelters"" were the opiate of the people at the time.  There was a bluster having to do with a ""bring it on to the rude bridge that arched the flood"" mentality.  ""We have our guns"".

restricteddata,"The technical goals of fallout shelters were two-fold:

* To help protect people from the effects of blast and fire. This would require advance notice of impending attack and would rely on the shelter itself not being too close to ground zero. Civilian shelters were _not_ designed to withstand a direct nuclear detonation, certainly not of the yields that became common in the later Cold War. (Even military/presidential shelters could only take so many megatons directly.) This sort of thing becomes more important in the suburbs than it does the areas of direct targeting — i.e. in the vast regions where the blast effects are enough to collapse civilian structures and break windows (e.g. 1-5 psi overpressure) and the thermal effects are enough to burn flesh or start small fires.

* Protection from radioactive fallout. Nuclear weapons that detonate on or near the ground mix with debris and dirt and the result is that highly-radioactive by-products ""fall out"" of the nuclear cloud within a few hours to a few days of detonation. The initial radioactivity of these by-products can be _very_ high — enough to kill you, give you radiation sickness, or dramatically increase your lifetime cancer risk. However things this radioactive do not stick around long. The more radioactive something is, the shorter its half-life, and the less time it sticks around. The consequence of this is that for the first week or so, the area immediately downwind of the blast can be incredibly radioactive and dangerous. If you stay inside for that amount of time, then you avoid most of the radiation. After a week or so, the radiation drops to levels safe to travel through (though not necessarily to live in). Note that airbursts, which are used against ""soft"" targets like cities, do not create the same level of contamination at all.

Fallout shelters were never intended to save everyone. What they were intended to do was to increase the total survivability of the population. Even just making sure people don't walk through the contaminated areas in the first week or so can (in various simulations and models) save hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives. 

Now one can look at this and say... well. You've saved several million people, but we're still talking about many many millions dead. That doesn't seem like a great success to me. And there is something to that. On the other hand, if you are a government bureaucrat, and your options are ""don't do anything to try and save lives"" versus ""do what you can, even if it is inadequate,"" you can see why they went with the latter approach. And hey, a hundred thousand or a million saved lives is nothing to sniff at. 

I will note that my reading of the FCDA files indicates that most of them were boring, hard-working bureaucrats assigned a kind of impossible job under terrible conditions (including the fact that they were not cleared to know a lot of weapons effects information or information about the composition of the US or Soviet stockpiles). I have never seen anything that indicated to me that they were really trying to hood-wink the public or anything like that. Whether that was an inadvertent or inevitable consequence is a separate question, but the notion that these people were trying to pull a grand shuck doesn't seem right to me. 

The reason fallout shelters get such a bad rap is that their purpose is often misunderstood (they are not meant to protect you from a direct hit, they are not meant to be inhabited for months or years), and because survivability is a grim business. Civil Defense in general is easy to criticize. There is something to the notion that a nation that thinks it can ""survive"" nuclear war might be more eager to get into one, but I've never seen evidence that US civilian officials were actually was that keen on getting into a nuclear war. A lot of the criticisms of Civil Defense, however, are just rooted in a criticism of the broader Cold War nuclear context. Which, of course, one gets. But given that ""everybody just play nice and get rid of nukes"" was never really on the table in a realistic sense, I don't really see what that gets us, either as an understanding of the past or a prescription for the present.

This marked the end of an 'independent' Welsh principality and Edward II became the first English Prince of Wales. 1400 beginning of the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr (d.1415/1416) Although not much is known of him post 1412, his death has been blamed in Welsh folklore on the English.

In 1925 the formation of Welsh nationalist party (later Plaid Cymru) 

1936 Burning of the bombing school, an RAF bombing school was built on a farmhouse on Penhros which had been home to countless poets and their patrons. The burning was justified because the Llŷn Peninsula was ‘an essential focus of this Welsh culture, the most aristocratic spiritual heritage of Wales.' [Saunders Lewis]

1960s growth of militant nationalist groups

Saunders Lewis describes Welsh Nationalism as;
&gt; ""What then is our nationalism?  It is this: to return to the principle of the Middle Ages; to repudiate the idea of political uniformity, and to expose its ill-effects; to plead therefore for the principle of unity and diversity.  To fight not for Welsh independence, but for the civilization of Wales.  To claim for Wales not independence but freedom.  And to claim for her a place in the League of Nations and in the community of Europe , by virtue of her civilization and its values""

Conservative cultural nationalists have placed an emphasis on preserving distinct features of medieval society in the 20th century. This has been criticised by the historian J.E. Lloyd as the medievalism of nationalist leaders of Wales easily creates a mystical an romantic image of an independent Wales, this view ignores the poverty and precariousness of life in the Middle Ages. Resurrecting these old traditions and mindsets is quite different from transmitting a living culture. Much of this idealisation is rooted in its literature, and at its focal point is the Welsh language as a protector of Classical and Christian traditions.
Gwynfor Evans sums up the importance of the Welsh language in Nationalism:
&gt; ""Wales has a great national heritage. The Welsh poetic tradition, for example, stretches back in unbroken line to the sixth century. For many centuries the Welsh language has been under attack and under siege. Its survival is the crowning glory of Welsh history. It is the enduring badge of our self-respect; the hall-mark of our identity"".

**Welsh Nationalism and historical injustices**

A narrative of historical injustice has been cultivated to justify contemporary political nationalism and its aims. This promotes links between historical 'injustices' and contemporary 'wrongs'.
One such example is the link made between the Acts Of Union 1536-1542/43 leading to 20th century political impotence, meaning a decline in the Welsh language, and economic decline.

Overall the rivalry has developed over time due to popular narratives becoming part of Welsh culture. Dr Ceinwen Thomas suggest the idea that the duty of the Welsh is to restore the heroic past of Wales. But by doing so should be aware that, as a subject nation Welsh history has been interpreted for them by their conquerors (the English) and those who have been educated in their schools. The history of the nation has been presented to the Welsh through English eyes.

You can see how this heritage has led to the rivalry we see today through Welsh rugby union captain Phill Bennet's pre match talk for England vs. Wales in 1977:
&gt;""Look what these bastards have done to Wales. They've taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our homes and live in them for a fortnight every year. What have they given us? Absolutely nothing. We've been exploited, raped, controlled and punished by the English — and that's who you are playing this afternoon"". ",null,0,cdnt3ef,1rhq6j,askhistorians,top_week,3

ssflanders,"The question seems to imply that before recorded music there was only classical music. Pop music before recording technology was much closer to what we call ""folk music"" today -- it was played and spread around by everyday people, not the elite orchestras in grand concert halls. Think of the songs everybody knew like Yankee Doodle Dandy or Swannee River, the songs that slaves sang in the fields, etc.

The idea of a ""professional musician"" was not unknown, but certainly very unusual in most people's experience. Usually you just performed it yourself, or listened while friends and neighbors performed it. With the growth of a prosperous middle class in the latter half of the 19th century (speaking of the U.S. here, although it was true elsewhere), a piano become something almost everybody had in their home, and the ability to play piano and sing was very widespread. The predecessor of recordings was printed sheet music, and sheet music publishers were the first wave of what we know now as the Music Business, and a song's popularity was measured in sheet music sales.

The first blockbuster pop hit was the sheet music of Alexander's Ragtime Band, a composition by Irving Berlin which borrowed heavily from traditional black folk music (a pattern which, incidentally, would continue through almost every form of pop music up through the present day).

Recording and broadcast technology essentially ended the practice of mass musical ability, beginning with the player piano, then wax disks and radios, and finally vinyl, TV, 8-track, cassette, CD, and mp3.

caffarelli,"Okay, the modern classical canon. Who actually listened to this stuff back then? 

* Was it a prerogative of the rich?

By and large, yes. Art takes money, rich people funded and kept most baroque/classical music going. Opera houses made their money a couple of ways, one was subscriptions (rich family would rent a box for the season), and then the floor seats which would be sold ad hoc to merchant class people. Here’s an interesting consideration -- if you bought a floor seat ticket, it was just benches, no assigned seats with numbers, so you’d customarily send a maid or manservant ahead of time to go physically save your seat. If you even went to opera on the CHEAP you probably had a servant or two. 

Rich patrons (right up to royalty, so state sponsorship almost like modern NEA grants!) would both fund opera houses, and directly patronize singers and composers. Lotsa rich people. 

But here was a way to get yourself some live music on the cheap if you were poor -- go to church! Organs, famous composers, real live castrati, quality music making all around. 

* Was going to operas expensive? 

Once again, by and large, yes. If you have access to Jstor check out [Patronizing Handel, Inventing Audiences: The Intersections of Class, Money, Music and History](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3518970?uid=3739656&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102794966243) which is a great breakdown for opera's unaffordability in 18th century England. I'll quote the choice bits with nice numbers: 

&gt;Households with family incomes above £200 comprised a tiny 3-4 per cent, some 53,000 families in all, of which perhaps 5,000—6,000 lived in London year-round or for the season. An income of £200 was probably too low to support regular attendance at the Italian opera and oratorio, given the high ticket and subscription prices for those entertainments. Raising the minimum to £400 reduces the potential purchasers to a minuscule 0.82 per cent nationwide (12,670 families in 1755). The labouring and destitute poor, among whom £20 annual family income was considered subsistence level, constituted the vast bulk of the population (84 per cent). Today's more egalitarian distribution of income (and therefore access to, for example, classical concerts) is in striking contrast. [...] It is apparent from table 3 that tickets for Italian opera and oratorio were 2.5 to 4 times the cost of those for ordinary dramatic productions [...]

* Were there cheaper copycats in cheaper theaters? 

Sort of. Not really knock offs, but there was staged music going on contemporary to opera that was more geared towards the middle class. *The Beggar’s Opera* was a “ballad opera” in English (not a “proper” opera because it doesn’t have recitative) that was EXTREMELY popular in its day, which was making fun of opera conventions. It’s still popular, it even has a later “remix” called *Threepenny Opera* which gives us the jazz standard “Mack the Knife.” But doing a knock off opera seria would have kinda sucked, the main draw was the famous celebrity singers and the lavish stagecraft, not the music. Comedy was usually a better seller. 

* Aliens? 

No aliens, unless you mean “foreigners.” Opera was very much an Italian export and therefore associated in the 18th century English mind with all sorts of negative foreign things like decadence, fashion, and “buggery.” All the eunuchs involved in the music business didn’t help it’s reputation much either. ;)

This is kinda a quick and dirty overview, but it’s hard to lump all the entire NPR Classical music station together in one comment! Add to that not all opera we call operas now were considered operas back then, like *Magic Flute.* If you have a question about a particular work I can probably tell you what classes might have originally consumed it.

akyser,"First, to slightly correct the myth, at least as told by Virgil: Aeneas' son Ascanius founded Alba Longa, and then roughly ten generations later, Romulus and Remus found Rome.

Despite Heinrich Schliemann's supposed ""Death Mask of Agamemnon"", none of the characters of the Trojan War cycle have been identified as being based on real, historical people.  Roma was one town out of a number of Latin towns.  They wound up conquering the whole Latin people, including Alba Longa, and spreading out from there to the other people on the Italian peninsula.  There is no evidence of this Trojan foundation, either in modern times or in ancient.  Livy, the greatest ancient historian of the early history of Rome, tells us the whole myth of the foundation, but even he admits he just likes the story, and it probably isn't true.  However, it's really hard to do this sort of archaeology, given that they're looking for a really small town underneath what has been one of the great cities of the world for the last ~2300 years.

However, the Greeks *did* come to Italy to found colonies.  They founded cities all over the Mediterranean, but there was such a concentration in southern Italy that it was known as Megale Hellas, Magna Graecia- Great Greece.  Ancient Greece may have started within the modern political borders of what we know as Greece, but the cities of southern Italy and western Turkey (Troy, Philadelphia, Ephesus) could make claims to be as impressive as Athens, Sparta, Corinth, or Thebes. Naples, as a city name, doesn't sound Greek anymore. But the adjectival form shows its roots better: Neapolitan, nea (new) polis (city).  There was also Tarentum on the southern coast and Syracuse on Sicily, to name a few of the major ones.  But this colonization of southern Italy happened around 8-700 BC, several hundred years after the probable dates of the Trojan War, after the Greeks went into a ""dark age"" without writing and then got it back again, adapting the Phoenician alphabet.  There are a couple places in southern Italy that still speak (a very different dialect of) Greek, though it's debatable if that really had its origins in Great Greece or in Byzantine times.

These large Greek city states so close to Rome during its foundational period are probably why the gods map so closely, but have different names.  The early Latin religion appears to have been animistic, and largely based on contracts with these spirits.  If you didn't get what you wanted from the gods, you must have broken the contract in some way.  The god or spirit of motherhood, for example, was Juno, and all of Hera's stories and traits were mapped on to the name Juno.  ~~But there was no overarching sky god to be in charge of everything.  So they adopted Zeus whole, only adding ""father"" after the name.  Zeus-pater -&gt; Jupiter.~~ See koine_lingua's correction below!

So the Greeks did come to Italy to found cities, but it almost certainly wasn't Rome, and it was centuries too late to be Aeneas or anyone else from the Trojan War, if they existed at all.",null,4,cdnftcr,1rhtyy,askhistorians,top_week,23

Snickerdoodled,"Crime and Punishment in Eighteenth Century England by Frank McLynn has a chapter on women that addresses this.  In short, for capital crimes other than murder, women were reprieved from execution much more than men. Also, women were more likely to have charges lowered and  less likely to be sent for transportation than men for non capital larcenies. 


McLynn's explanation is that women were generally perceived to be less dangerous to the community/authority/social order, and the deterring effect of the death penalty didn't work so much for women, as ""the hanging of a women was more likely to excite pity for the victim than reinforce confidence in ""law and order""""

Also the concept of coverture might relate to your topic. Since a *feme covert*'s legal standing was eclipsed by her husband's, a married women who committed crimes with their husband were assumed to be acting at their husband's behest. On the flip side of this, wives who killed their husbands were not guilty of murder but petit treason, which was a more serious offense and was punished with burning.

Interestingly, The rates of execution for people indicted for willful murder were the same for men and women, about 1/5. Women charged with homicide were more likely to be accused of murder as opposed to manslaughter than men, which may relate to the higher chance of a women's murder victim being an intimate rather than a stranger.",null,0,cdnpxpt,1rhum8,askhistorians,top_week,3
Forgotten_Password_,"Now is my big chance! Well historically, Costa Rica always prided itself on having ""More teachers than soldiers"". The war itself, lasting during the year of 1948, pitted Jose Figueres (with the support of old coffee elites) against the Teodoro Picado Michalski regime, who was the successor of the former president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. In between all of this was a radical thinker by the name of Manuel Mora Valverde, whose marxist beliefs blended into the local economic and social situation of Costa Rica into something he coined as ""criollo Comunismo"" or ""Tico Comunismo"".


Valverde's Popular Vanguard Party supported both Calderón and Michalski's government and in doing so, had some political influence when it came to social and labour policies. In fact, many of Costa Rica's current social policies, such as social security, go back to Valverde's political advocacy. However, his leftist ideology and clear influence made him unpopular with the coffee growing elite, who controlled the biggest bank in the country at the time. They saw the reforms of both regimes as detrimental to their own political power by promoting unorthodox reforms. Enter Jose Figueres, a somewhat questionable character who was kicked out of Costa Rica in 1942 because he created ""a possible threat to national security"". However, by the end of WW2 and the rise of the Cold War, Figueres realized the support he could gain by becoming an Anti-Communist, fighting the Calderon-Communist political alliance.




Eventually, by 1948, Figueres trained an army and launched his insurrection amid an election crisis when Calderon's party annulled the presidential election results (With the support of the Congress). The fighting eventually led to a potential final stand off in San Jose, between what was left of an already small Costa Rica army, combined with political supporters of Calderon (PVP militia and Vanguardista militia), and Figueres rebel army. 


However, the fight for San Jose didn't end in bloodshed and instead, political negotiations occurred with a set of treaties/pacts. Among which included the Pact of Ochomogo (Conserving social reforms, labour laws, and maintaining the legality of unions) and the Pact of the Mexican Embassy, explicitly stating the end to conflict. 



Now, the constitution of 1948. It must be noted that Costa Rica already had a small army to begin with since it began to decline in the 1900s. The last major battle that utilized the armed forces occurred during the war against William Walker in the 1850s, which eventually led to the famous story of Juan Santamaría, burning a barricade amid the second battle of Rivas. Basically, when the constitution disbanded the army as an institution, what was left of it had already been disbanded amid the civil war by the War Minister in order to prevent the victors from installing themselves as a military junta.

Generally, the most fruitful analyses attempts to see Rome within the context of an Iron Age climate of political multiplicity and loose vertical bonds within a community (basically, the elites would not feel themselves particularly tied to lower orders in a community). This allows us to structure a series of useful comparisons to better understood societies, such as Archaic Greece, certain Central Asian groups and even Medieval Europe, although that carries a series of complications.

Nrussg,"edit: after looking at /u/idjet and /u/qed1 's responses I wanted to modify this comment, I put the edit at the front so people see this before reading the passage and retained the wording of the original post to maintain the record. But, I was a bit hasty in writing this and didn't pay close attention to the period being specifically asked about. My response should be viewed as a later evolution of the evolution of the system described by the two others, rather than an argument against what they said (as it was originally intended.) 

/u/qed1 's answer is slightly misleading regarding how the inquisition actually functioned. While part of the function of the ""Spanish Inquisition,"" which was actually two separate branches of a larger system, did have a mandate to convert and later expel Jews and Muslims in the Iberian peninsula. However, this was only one facet of what inquisitional courts did (this makes more sense when you look at the other larger inquisitional courts in Venice and Rome, which didn't have the same religious diversity as Iberia.) In truth, inquisitional courts were just courts that handled religious issues at the allowance of the secular power in the region. They're strength and mandate were variable, for example, in the Kingdom of Castille (central Spain basically) the inquisition did not handle cases of sodomy, while in Aragon (think Barcelona) the inquisition did handle cases of sodomy. 
Going over what specific cases were handled by the inquisition would be too much, but Christians were prosecuted.

Now for the why. Inquisitional judicial systems were based off a different, divergent idea of how courts should work. We are generally use to the broadly English derived legal system (huge simplification, but this is the type of court with defendants, witness, prosecutors, etc.) Inquisitional justice was based on confession as the primary way for establishing if the accused was guilty, and confession at times necessitated torture. In truth, threat of torture was way more common than actual torture (they'd kind of just show them the devices as an implicit threat) but at times torture was used (the rack, thumb screws, and leg screws were most common along with water torture, anything else was rarely or never used.)

Torture as part of inquisitional cases is well documented, sense the inquisition took fantastic notes and their trials serve as great (if biased) primary sources. (They also liked to spy on people in their cells and write it down, seriously useful.)

XenophonTheAthenian,"Oh boy oh boy, naughty words. I think I'll share one of the nasty phrases I know, and it's one of the tamer ones. We find in Aristophanes' *Birds* the phrase ""He's gone to the crows."" That's an idiomatic expression that's difficult to translate into English. What's usually said is that ""Go to the crows"" means more or less the same thing as modern English ""Go to hell."" But it's not *really* that good a translation. ""Go to the crows"" doesn't have a meaning *quite* as strong as ""Go f\*\*k yourself,"" but it's not a very nice thing to say. To go to the crows implies death, and not just death, but that your body will be lying out in the fields for the crows to feast on. Maybe that's not a big deal to hear these days (although there still is the phrase ""Go die in a hole,"" even though its meaning has been pretty significantly blunted) but in the ancient world that's on *nasty* thing to say to someone. It means that not only do you wish the end of his existence, but by expressing that wish you're actually *cursing* him. Plus, you're cursing him with a death without proper burial and funerary rites, doomed to be the food of the carrion birds, cursing his soul to torment forever (since the Greeks, like pretty much everyone else, believed that lack of proper funerary rites led to various forms of netherworld unhappiness). Not a nice thing to wish for someone.

With curses in mind, let's also recall some of the Athenian curse tablets. Curses are a frequent feature of tragedy, and in Greece curses more or less take the form of an invocation of the god or an oath to the god that takes a negative form. So instead of invoking the god for the purpose of blessing you or allowing an action to happen, you're asking him to harm somebody else. The curses were written on lead tablets and read aloud. These curse tablets aren't insults *per se*, but a lot of them say some *very* nasty things about the victims of the curse and ask the god to do some pretty evil things to them. A lot of these have never been published or translated, but they ask the god to destroy people's livers and lungs and other organs, to inflict them with poxes, to chill their minds and spirits, to make them deaf, mute, and blind, to go die in various ways (including many tablets that have been buried under houses or just underground with the inscription, ""Here I have buried so-and-so, etc."" Sounds an awful lot like ""Go die in a hole you S.O.B.""). 

In a similar light we see that many of the graffiti inscriptions at Pompeii are pretty insulting. They rarely actually insult people with swears or anything like that, but they frequently point out very embarrassing things or make fun of people for certain things. So we find that there's a famous graffito that says (in polite terms) ""Lesbianus, you defecate here and write 'Hello everyone!'"" A similar graffito on a different building actually writes a curse out: ""To the person defecating here: Beware this curse. If you look down at this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy."" There are a lot of things about taking dumps in Pompeii, and the Romans were big fans of making fun of defecation (rather like the Greeks, who seem to have found farts and penis jokes extremely funny). We also get ones that say things like, ""Secundus screws boys"" and ""Phileros is a eunich!"" and funny things like that (just as a side note, my favorite graffito at Pompeii of those that have been published so far reads ""A person who buggers a fire burns his penis.""

I first came to know this word from Charles Burney, who translated [a letter written by Metastasio, who was quoting Caffarelli who called a guy that right before challenging him to a duel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1g4bp9/tuesday_trivia_reading_other_peoples_mail/cagoeak) Now, if you actually go look at Metastasio’s original letter in the original Italian, Caffarelli called that composer something *much ruder* than coxcomb, he called him “cazzo,” which you can still shout with gusto on the streets of Italy, and probably could be translated to “cock” or “dick” in British or American English, respectively. So Burney censored history a bit when he translated that letter! There’s no way he didn’t know the full impact of that word, having spent loads of time in Italy, he had to clean Caffarelli up for publishing by putting the insult down as the rather limp “coxcomb” in English. But you can’t scrub the swearwords out of Caffarelli’s magnificent mouth for long, haHA! I have put them back. 

* BLUESTOCKING: I love this word! A bluestocking was an over-educated and frumpy woman, as the term was used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It comes from blue wool stockings being a practical, hardy choice of legwear over more fashionable options like black silk. It was also the name of a women’s intellectual club in the late 1700s with such notable members as Ava Lovelace and Fanny Burney (daughter of my friend above Charles Burney!) It’s also the name of a [modern gender studies magazine.](http://bluestockingsmag.com/)

I had this silly dream in college of founding a new women’s literary society called “The Bluestockings” and we could all sit around in our sweatpants or something and lament the lack of women’s inclusion in computer science.

ScipioAsina,"Hello all! I've been pretty quiet here recently (drowning in school and work), but I thought I'd share a Sumerian insult I came across in my research. B. R. Foster comments: 

&gt; In Sumerian school debates... the interlocutors plied each other with elaborately artificed insults about each other's genealogy, appearance, and level of education, presumably with an eye to raising a laugh in the gallery. An example begins, **""He is spawn of a dog, seed of a wolf, stench of a mongoose, a helpless hyena's whelp, a carapaced fox, an addlepated mountain monkey whose reasoning is nonsensical.""** The parents of a Sumerian scholar who is failing in school invite his teacher for dinner. After a fine repast and a handsome present, the teacher discourses warmly on the youngster's talents and prospects. (""Humor and Wit in the Ancient Near East,"" in *Civilizations of the Ancient Near East* 4, ed. J. M. Sasson [1995], 2464)

I suppose someone today could still find this offensive, though much of the context would be lost. The same chapter also contains a curious political quip, which seems potentially insulting:

&gt; An Amorite nobleman allows himself a political joke in writing to the queen of Qatara, a city in northern Syria. Acknowledging her dispatch of a shipment of small fish, such as her own husband, the king of Qatara, esteems, he writes, ""Just as your husband Aqba-khammu has learned to appreciate 'little fish' when in Qatara and Karana [two small kingdoms], I myself have always had a liking for the 'big fish' in Shubat-Enlil, Ekallatum, Mari, and Babylon [capitals of major kingdoms].

yodatsracist,"Contemporary English lacks a [T-V distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction), that is, we just have one pronoun for the second person, formal and informal (and plural and singular for that matter).  While French has *tu* (informal singular) and *vous* (forma plural and singular; informal plural), German has *du* (informal singular), *ihr* (informal plural), and *Sie* (formal, singular and plural), Turkish has *sen* (informal singular) and *siz* (formal singular and plural; informal plural), etc.  English has just ""you"" for the whole kit and caboodle.  English obviously *used to* have an singular, informal pronoun: thou (as an object: thee, possessive before a constant: thy, possessive before a vowel: thine).  When the King James Version of the Bible says ""thou"", it is not being more formal but more *in*formal.  For example, the commandment ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" is ""Tu ne commettras point d'adultère"" in French.  The ""thou"" just became calcified, and as we forgot what it meant, some people began to assume it was more formal as it only appeared in the context of formal, liturgical language. (Also, isn't it kind of freaky that the commandments are in the singular?  You, yes, *you* shalt not commit adultery)

So how does that relate to insulting people?  If you've learned a foreign language that has a T-V distinction, you've realized that it is way easier to be rude in those languages.  I've made an ass of myself many times in Turkish by using ""sen"" for a boss, state employee, or old person when I should use ""siz"" (people are momentarily offended, but give me a pass as a foreigner), or using ""siz"" when I should use ""sen"" (""Yodats, you're so formal!  Chill out."").  In French and German, there are even verbs for speaking in the formal and familiar with someone.  You can *[vouvoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vouvoyer)* or *[siezen](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/siezen#German)* someone if you're being formal or polite, and you can *[tutoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tutoyer#French)* or [*duzen*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duzen) them if you're being informal... or condescending.

In English, the verb equivalent is ""to thou (someone)"".  This is where it gets awesome.  During the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, it is widely alleged that Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, declared his utter contempt for Raleigh by saying:

    I thou thee, thou traitor!

Riagu,"The Norse had rather creative insults concerning masculinity or the lack thereof. As relayed by the [Viking Answer Lady](http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/gayvik.shtml):

&gt; For a man who could not have children (whether due to impotence, sterility, age, etc.) homosexual relations may have been acceptable. One slang term for such a man seems to have been *kottrinn inn blauði*, or ""soft cat"" as reported in *Stúfs þáttr*, an epilogue to *Laxdæla saga*, in a conversation between the Norwegian king Haraldr *harðráði* and Stúfr, the son of Þórðr *kottr* (Þórðr the Cat): puzzled by the unusual nickname, Haraldr asks Stúfr whether his father Þórðr was *kottrinn inn hvati eða inn blauði*, ""the hard or the soft cat."" Stúfr declines to answer despite the implied insult, but the king admits that his question was foolish because ""the person who is soft (*blauðr*) could not be a father"" (Jochens 76).

It thus follows the time-honed tradition of using implied sexual submission as an insult. I personally think it's rather cute.

The_Alaskan,"This is pretty mild, but there's the Alutiiq word *Cip’ausngasqaq* - which literally translates to ""smart aleck.""

[Here's a bit of detail from the Alutiiq Museum](http://alutiiqmuseum.org/language-studies/the-word-of-the-week.html):

&gt;Among Alutiiqs, behaving like a big shot can be dangerous. Boasting is not only bad manners, it can poison your luck. A boastful hunter may offend the animals his family depends on and cause them to avoid his arrows. In the case of a bear, boasting can cause the animal to become enraged. A braggart can bring starvation on his family or get himself killed.

&gt;Despite warnings about boastful behavior, Alutiiq stories feature the raucous, boastful Raven, an obnoxious bird that does great deeds. In these stories, Raven lives in Alutiiq communities and can speak in Alutiiq, but he is arrogant, dirty, and impolite to his Elders. Yet despite his poor behavior, Raven is smart and keeps his promises, and he ends up succeeding where others fail.

&gt;In one legend, Raven lives with his elderly grandmother at the edge of a large village. Here, he is so disliked that he must live off refuse from the beach. One harsh winter, when hunting was impossible, the villagers began to starve. Raven, who was always able to scavenge enough food for himself and his grandmother, asked the village chief what he would give him if he were able to bring the chief food. The chief offered Raven his oldest daughter in marriage. Pleased with the offer, Raven ordered his grandmother to clean their house and pecked her until she complied. Then he scavenged a bundle of dried fish and won the chief's daughter. But the Raven smelled so bad that the girl refused to stay with him and went home to her father. 

&gt;The next winter, famine struck the community again. Raven sent his grandmother to the home of another young woman and offered her food to marry him. She agreed, and despite the Raven’s stench, she stayed in his home. Raven then captured a giant whale and brought it to the starving village to share with all those who had treated him poorly. They gorged themselves on blubber, eating so much that they soon died. Only Raven, his grandmother, and his faithful wife lived.

AnOldHope,"We all know that religious conferences are all about being pious, right? So how about a (pious) death threat on the floor of a religious conference?

As Poterfield has documented, doubt, after the fervor of the Revolution wore off, was pervasive in the antebellum period of the US. Religious groups moved from prophetic statements to considerably more conservative position. Methodist views on slavery was one of those positions that we can trace the genealogy from a *respectively* liberal position to a more conservative one. 

Welsey, the founder of Methodism, had originally been an outspoken proponent of antislavery. His 1774 pamphlet, *Thoughts Upon Slavery*, was reprinted a number of times, [including in the US.](http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/wesley/wesley.html) In the pamphlet, Wesley argues that black folks should be immediately manumitted. 

&gt;O, whatever it costs, put a stop to [slavery’s] cry before it be too late; instantly, at any price, were it the half of your goods, deliver thyself from blood guiltiness! Thy hands, they bed, they furniture; thy house, thy lands, are at present stained with blood.

&gt;Arise, and help these that have no helper, whose blood is spilt upon the ground like water! Are not these also the work of thine own hands, the purchase of thy Son's blood? Stir them up to cry unto thee in the land of their captivity; and let their complaint come up before thee; let it enter into thy ears! Make even those that lead them away captive to pity them, and turn their captivity as the rivers in the south. O burst thou all their chains in sunder; more especially the chains of their sins! Thou Saviour of all, make them free, that they may be free indeed!

Wesley would even go on to write Wilberforce, the British abolitionist, a letter in support. Nevertheless, questions should arise about Wesley and how important antislavery was to his cause. We only have one extant reference, in Wesley's journal, to him giving an antislavery speech. In fact, Wesley's whole system of theology was about the gradual removal of sin while working towards perfection. Wesley's system lends itself more to gradual emancipation, but emancipation nonetheless. Yet, American Methodism would change its view.

One can track the continuous walking back of the antislavery rhetoric through the *Book of Discipline* (BOD), which outlines the polity of the Methodist church. While Wesley called for immediate release, the first BOD  for the US (1784) allowed, under the section ""What Methods can we take to  extirpate Slavery,"" for slaveowners to become members. However, the BOD does make a caveat: slaveowners, ""upon notice,"" were to gradually emancipate their slaves; certain regions of the country were probably more apt than others to give (a quick) notice. Additionally, there was a method to their emancipation: ""And every Slave under the age of Twenty, [will be manumitted] as soon as they arrive at the Age of Twenty-five at farthest.” In 1838, Georgia Methodists would argue ""[i]t is the sense of the Georgia Annual Conference that slavery, as it exists in the United States, is not a moral evil,” and no rules concerning manumission were needed for slaveholding members. American Methodism was far afield of Wesley's original call for manumission.

But I promised you a death threat! And a death threat you shall have.

In 1836, at General Conference (a quadrennial gathering of the Methodists, like comic con but not as cool, to decide issues of polity) there was a particularly acrimonious debate. Rev. Orange Scott, an abolitionist from New York, had just implored the church to embrace abolitionism. Speaking against Scott was Rev. Dr. Andrew Smith. Smith hailed from Virginia. 

Smith denounced modern abolitionism as folly, and claimed that modern abolitionism makes slaveholders into criminals against God; it makes slaveholders unchristian. Scott rose to argue that, if Smith was referring to him, then Smith had misrepresented Scott's position. Smith tells Scott ""I have no more to do with that brother, than if he did not exist."" Smith hits his point home: ""I wish to God, he were in Heaven,"" and while his words were not recorded perfectly, Smith added with fire something along the lines of wishing all abolitionists in heaven right now. In other words, and this is a point Lucius C. Matlack makes in his retelling of the events, that Smith had wished all abolitionists dead.

Just a few years later, in 1843, Scott would lead an exodus from the Methodist Episcopal Church. He, along with Matlack, would found the Methodist Wesleyan Church, a small group of Methodist abolitionists. Scott presaged the coming split. The next year, the center could not hold, and the Methodist Episcopal Church split along regional lines, north and south.",null,0,cdnqb93,1rhwm4,askhistorians,top_week,4

Naugrith,"I love the idea of flyting - which was the ritual exchange of insults in what was the ancient equivilent of Rap Battles. The insults were delivered in verse, and were very imaginative. Sometimes the insults were a battle in themselves, sometimes the precursor to armed duels. You see it in the Illiad, but there are famous examples in Northern Europe, of Loki turning up to a party to insult all the gods, or the famous Scottish example of The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie in the 16th century where two poets take turns insulting each other.

XenophonTheAthenian,"Oh boy oh boy, naughty words. I think I'll share one of the nasty phrases I know, and it's one of the tamer ones. We find in Aristophanes' *Birds* the phrase ""He's gone to the crows."" That's an idiomatic expression that's difficult to translate into English. What's usually said is that ""Go to the crows"" means more or less the same thing as modern English ""Go to hell."" But it's not *really* that good a translation. ""Go to the crows"" doesn't have a meaning *quite* as strong as ""Go f\*\*k yourself,"" but it's not a very nice thing to say. To go to the crows implies death, and not just death, but that your body will be lying out in the fields for the crows to feast on. Maybe that's not a big deal to hear these days (although there still is the phrase ""Go die in a hole,"" even though its meaning has been pretty significantly blunted) but in the ancient world that's on *nasty* thing to say to someone. It means that not only do you wish the end of his existence, but by expressing that wish you're actually *cursing* him. Plus, you're cursing him with a death without proper burial and funerary rites, doomed to be the food of the carrion birds, cursing his soul to torment forever (since the Greeks, like pretty much everyone else, believed that lack of proper funerary rites led to various forms of netherworld unhappiness). Not a nice thing to wish for someone.

With curses in mind, let's also recall some of the Athenian curse tablets. Curses are a frequent feature of tragedy, and in Greece curses more or less take the form of an invocation of the god or an oath to the god that takes a negative form. So instead of invoking the god for the purpose of blessing you or allowing an action to happen, you're asking him to harm somebody else. The curses were written on lead tablets and read aloud. These curse tablets aren't insults *per se*, but a lot of them say some *very* nasty things about the victims of the curse and ask the god to do some pretty evil things to them. A lot of these have never been published or translated, but they ask the god to destroy people's livers and lungs and other organs, to inflict them with poxes, to chill their minds and spirits, to make them deaf, mute, and blind, to go die in various ways (including many tablets that have been buried under houses or just underground with the inscription, ""Here I have buried so-and-so, etc."" Sounds an awful lot like ""Go die in a hole you S.O.B.""). 

In a similar light we see that many of the graffiti inscriptions at Pompeii are pretty insulting. They rarely actually insult people with swears or anything like that, but they frequently point out very embarrassing things or make fun of people for certain things. So we find that there's a famous graffito that says (in polite terms) ""Lesbianus, you defecate here and write 'Hello everyone!'"" A similar graffito on a different building actually writes a curse out: ""To the person defecating here: Beware this curse. If you look down at this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy."" There are a lot of things about taking dumps in Pompeii, and the Romans were big fans of making fun of defecation (rather like the Greeks, who seem to have found farts and penis jokes extremely funny). We also get ones that say things like, ""Secundus screws boys"" and ""Phileros is a eunich!"" and funny things like that (just as a side note, my favorite graffito at Pompeii of those that have been published so far reads ""A person who buggers a fire burns his penis.""

So Burney censored history a bit when he translated that letter! There’s no way he didn’t know the full impact of that word, having spent loads of time in Italy, he had to clean Caffarelli up for publishing by putting the insult down as the rather limp “coxcomb” in English.

ScipioAsina,"Hello all! I've been pretty quiet here recently (drowning in school and work), but I thought I'd share a Sumerian insult I came across in my research. B. R. Foster comments: 

&gt; In Sumerian school debates... the interlocutors plied each other with elaborately artificed insults about each other's genealogy, appearance, and level of education, presumably with an eye to raising a laugh in the gallery. An example begins, **""He is spawn of a dog, seed of a wolf, stench of a mongoose, a helpless hyena's whelp, a carapaced fox, an addlepated mountain monkey whose reasoning is nonsensical.""** The parents of a Sumerian scholar who is failing in school invite his teacher for dinner. After a fine repast and a handsome present, the teacher discourses warmly on the youngster's talents and prospects. (""Humor and Wit in the Ancient Near East,"" in *Civilizations of the Ancient Near East* 4, ed. J. M. Sasson [1995], 2464)

I suppose someone today could still find this offensive, though much of the context would be lost. The same chapter also contains a curious political quip, which seems potentially insulting:

&gt; An Amorite nobleman allows himself a political joke in writing to the queen of Qatara, a city in northern Syria. Acknowledging her dispatch of a shipment of small fish, such as her own husband, the king of Qatara, esteems, he writes, ""Just as your husband Aqba-khammu has learned to appreciate 'little fish' when in Qatara and Karana [two small kingdoms], I myself have always had a liking for the 'big fish' in Shubat-Enlil, Ekallatum, Mari, and Babylon [capitals of major kingdoms]. Since there are no big fish around (where you are), you send me little ones, but who would eat them?"" (2467)

yodatsracist,"Contemporary English lacks a [T-V distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction), that is, we just have one pronoun for the second person, formal and informal (and plural and singular for that matter).  While French has *tu* (informal singular) and *vous* (forma plural and singular; informal plural), German has *du* (informal singular), *ihr* (informal plural), and *Sie* (formal, singular and plural), Turkish has *sen* (informal singular) and *siz* (formal singular and plural; informal plural), etc.  English has just ""you"" for the whole kit and caboodle.  English obviously *used to* have an singular, informal pronoun: thou (as an object: thee, possessive before a constant: thy, possessive before a vowel: thine).  When the King James Version of the Bible says ""thou"", it is not being more formal but more *in*formal.  For example, the commandment ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" is ""Tu ne commettras point d'adultère"" in French.  The ""thou"" just became calcified, and as we forgot what it meant, some people began to assume it was more formal as it only appeared in the context of formal, liturgical language. (Also, isn't it kind of freaky that the commandments are in the singular?  You, yes, *you* shalt not commit adultery)

So how does that relate to insulting people?  If you've learned a foreign language that has a T-V distinction, you've realized that it is way easier to be rude in those languages.  I've made an ass of myself many times in Turkish by using ""sen"" for a boss, state employee, or old person when I should use ""siz"" (people are momentarily offended, but give me a pass as a foreigner), or using ""siz"" when I should use ""sen"" (""Yodats, you're so formal!  Chill out."").  In French and German, there are even verbs for speaking in the formal and familiar with someone.  You can *[vouvoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vouvoyer)* or *[siezen](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/siezen#German)* someone if you're being formal or polite, and you can *[tutoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tutoyer#French)* or [*duzen*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duzen) them if you're being informal... or condescending.

In English, the verb equivalent is ""to thou (someone)"".  This is where it gets awesome.  During the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, it is widely alleged that Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, declared his utter contempt for Raleigh by saying:

Riagu,"The Norse had rather creative insults concerning masculinity or the lack thereof. As relayed by the [Viking Answer Lady](http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/gayvik.shtml):

&gt; For a man who could not have children (whether due to impotence, sterility, age, etc.) homosexual relations may have been acceptable. One slang term for such a man seems to have been *kottrinn inn blauði*, or ""soft cat"" as reported in *Stúfs þáttr*, an epilogue to *Laxdæla saga*, in a conversation between the Norwegian king Haraldr *harðráði* and Stúfr, the son of Þórðr *kottr* (Þórðr the Cat): puzzled by the unusual nickname, Haraldr asks Stúfr whether his father Þórðr was *kottrinn inn hvati eða inn blauði*, ""the hard or the soft cat."" Stúfr declines to answer despite the implied insult, but the king admits that his question was foolish because ""the person who is soft (*blauðr*) could not be a father"" (Jochens 76).

It thus follows the time-honed tradition of using implied sexual submission as an insult. I personally think it's rather cute.

The_Alaskan,"This is pretty mild, but there's the Alutiiq word *Cip’ausngasqaq* - which literally translates to ""smart aleck.""

[Here's a bit of detail from the Alutiiq Museum](http://alutiiqmuseum.org/language-studies/the-word-of-the-week.html):

&gt;Among Alutiiqs, behaving like a big shot can be dangerous. Boasting is not only bad manners, it can poison your luck. A boastful hunter may offend the animals his family depends on and cause them to avoid his arrows. In the case of a bear, boasting can cause the animal to become enraged. A braggart can bring starvation on his family or get himself killed.

&gt;Despite warnings about boastful behavior, Alutiiq stories feature the raucous, boastful Raven, an obnoxious bird that does great deeds. In these stories, Raven lives in Alutiiq communities and can speak in Alutiiq, but he is arrogant, dirty, and impolite to his Elders. Yet despite his poor behavior, Raven is smart and keeps his promises, and he ends up succeeding where others fail.

&gt;In one legend, Raven lives with his elderly grandmother at the edge of a large village. Here, he is so disliked that he must live off refuse from the beach. One harsh winter, when hunting was impossible, the villagers began to starve. Raven, who was always able to scavenge enough food for himself and his grandmother, asked the village chief what he would give him if he were able to bring the chief food. The chief offered Raven his oldest daughter in marriage. Pleased with the offer, Raven ordered his grandmother to clean their house and pecked her until she complied. Then he scavenged a bundle of dried fish and won the chief's daughter. But the Raven smelled so bad that the girl refused to stay with him and went home to her father. 

&gt;The next winter, famine struck the community again. Raven sent his grandmother to the home of another young woman and offered her food to marry him. She agreed, and despite the Raven’s stench, she stayed in his home. Raven then captured a giant whale and brought it to the starving village to share with all those who had treated him poorly. They gorged themselves on blubber, eating so much that they soon died. Only Raven, his grandmother, and his faithful wife lived.

AnOldHope,"We all know that religious conferences are all about being pious, right? So how about a (pious) death threat on the floor of a religious conference?

As Poterfield has documented, doubt, after the fervor of the Revolution wore off, was pervasive in the antebellum period of the US. Religious groups moved from prophetic statements to considerably more conservative position. Methodist views on slavery was one of those positions that we can trace the genealogy from a *respectively* liberal position to a more conservative one. 

Welsey, the founder of Methodism, had originally been an outspoken proponent of antislavery. His 1774 pamphlet, *Thoughts Upon Slavery*, was reprinted a number of times, [including in the US.](http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/wesley/wesley.html) In the pamphlet, Wesley argues that black folks should be immediately manumitted. 

&gt;O, whatever it costs, put a stop to [slavery’s] cry before it be too late; instantly, at any price, were it the half of your goods, deliver thyself from blood guiltiness! Thy hands, they bed, they furniture; thy house, thy lands, are at present stained with blood.

&gt;Arise, and help these that have no helper, whose blood is spilt upon the ground like water! Are not these also the work of thine own hands, the purchase of thy Son's blood? Stir them up to cry unto thee in the land of their captivity; and let their complaint come up before thee; let it enter into thy ears! Make even those that lead them away captive to pity them, and turn their captivity as the rivers in the south. O burst thou all their chains in sunder; more especially the chains of their sins! Thou Saviour of all, make them free, that they may be free indeed!

Wesley would even go on to write Wilberforce, the British abolitionist, a letter in support. Nevertheless, questions should arise about Wesley and how important antislavery was to his cause. We only have one extant reference, in Wesley's journal, to him giving an antislavery speech. In fact, Wesley's whole system of theology was about the gradual removal of sin while working towards perfection. Wesley's system lends itself more to gradual emancipation, but emancipation nonetheless. Yet, American Methodism would change its view.

One can track the continuous walking back of the antislavery rhetoric through the *Book of Discipline* (BOD), which outlines the polity of the Methodist church. While Wesley called for immediate release, the first BOD  for the US (1784) allowed, under the section ""What Methods can we take to  extirpate Slavery,"" for slaveowners to become members. However, the BOD does make a caveat: slaveowners, ""upon notice,"" were to gradually emancipate their slaves; certain regions of the country were probably more apt than others to give (a quick) notice. Additionally, there was a method to their emancipation: ""And every Slave under the age of Twenty, [will be manumitted] as soon as they arrive at the Age of Twenty-five at farthest.” In 1838, Georgia Methodists would argue ""[i]t is the sense of the Georgia Annual Conference that slavery, as it exists in the United States, is not a moral evil,” and no rules concerning manumission were needed for slaveholding members. American Methodism was far afield of Wesley's original call for manumission.

But I promised you a death threat! And a death threat you shall have.

In 1836, at General Conference (a quadrennial gathering of the Methodists, like comic con but not as cool, to decide issues of polity) there was a particularly acrimonious debate. Rev. Orange Scott, an abolitionist from New York, had just implored the church to embrace abolitionism. Speaking against Scott was Rev. Dr. Andrew Smith. Smith hailed from Virginia. 

Smith denounced modern abolitionism as folly, and claimed that modern abolitionism makes slaveholders into criminals against God; it makes slaveholders unchristian. Scott rose to argue that, if Smith was referring to him, then Smith had misrepresented Scott's position. Smith tells Scott ""I have no more to do with that brother, than if he did not exist."" Smith hits his point home: ""I wish to God, he were in Heaven,"" and while his words were not recorded perfectly, Smith added with fire something along the lines of wishing all abolitionists in heaven right now. In other words, and this is a point Lucius C. Matlack makes in his retelling of the events, that Smith had wished all abolitionists dead.

Just a few years later, in 1843, Scott would lead an exodus from the Methodist Episcopal Church. He, along with Matlack, would found the Methodist Wesleyan Church, a small group of Methodist abolitionists. Scott presaged the coming split. The next year, the center could not hold, and the Methodist Episcopal Church split along regional lines, north and south.",null,0,cdnqb93,1rhwm4,askhistorians,top_week,4

Naugrith,"I love the idea of flyting - which was the ritual exchange of insults in what was the ancient equivilent of Rap Battles. The insults were delivered in verse, and were very imaginative. Sometimes the insults were a battle in themselves, sometimes the precursor to armed duels. You see it in the Illiad, but there are famous examples in Northern Europe, of Loki turning up to a party to insult all the gods, or the famous Scottish example of The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie in the 16th century where two poets take turns insulting each other. An example of the flyting is as follows from Dunbar’s first harangue of Kennedie:

""Muttoun dryver, girnall river, gadswyver—

myrmecologist,"In understanding the tumultuous last days of the British Empire in India it becomes convenient to focus on specific personalities. The cult of Gandhi or Jinnah, the tact of Patel, the dynamism of Mountbatten --- such epithets may have some validity, but they are largely unable to help us consider the events leading to the break up of the Indian subcontinent.

The anti-colonial struggle was, at least at the height of Gandhian nationalism, primarily a political struggle. Jinnah's positioning for greater minority rights was not too illogical in such an environment. Ambedkar, too, was struggling to garner political representation for the backward castes. We have to thus be cognizant of the fact that the reach of the Congress, while expansive and entrenched, could not be totally representative of the whole of British India. There were far too many factions with many diverse demands that jostled for space in the anti-colonial movement of the 20th century British India.

The demands of the All India Muslim League (Muslim League in short) were largely couched in the language of electoral politics. The League's fundamental demand was for a more equitable presence in the quasi-representative measures that had been initiated by the British Government, particularly in the 1930s. The League purported to represent all Muslims in the subcontinent. But such a claim (just like Congress's claims of all-encompassing representation) was limited and extremely provincial. The League had a massive presence in Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) and a fair hold of Punjab. It's presence in the United Provinces too was sizable. Yet, it could not contend with the organizational might of the Indian National Congress. As such, the bargaining tools at the League's disposal were limited. And this is crucial --- most of the demands that Jinnah presented were *strategies of negotiation*. The demands were meant to garner a few crucial benefits for the Muslims. While there was legitimate concern amongst the Muslim community (and not just among those who identified with the Muslim League) about the extent to which their rights would be safeguarded or violated under a Hindu majority regime, 
there was no concerted effort to channelize those demands to the idea of a separate Muslim nation. 

As late as 1946, with the Cabinet Mission Plan about to be bludgeoned under the weight of contestations, the League had no idea what exactly it meant through its recurrent threats for a separate Pakistan. Jinnah too was a product of the nationalist politics which birthed Tilak, Gandhi et al. His faith in representative politics was steadfast, and there is not much in his actions for us to consider him directly responsible for the Partition. 

By 1946, in fact, Jinnah's hold over the Muslim League had considerably weakened. The absence of a definitive idea of what exactly it meant to want a separate Muslim nation is suggestive of the inchoate nature of the idea. Jinnah was the League's ideologue and he seemed to regard the two-nation idea as a mere tool to ensure the safety of the Muslims and better representation in administration. The ground reality, however, seemed more brutally in favor of the two-nation theory. The 1946 Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta seemed to, ironically, legitimize the idea of an unbridgeable divide between the two communities. As the historian Ayesha Jalal contends, there is enough evidence for us to doubt this hypothesis. What is more likely is that other divisive factors, like the divide between the zamindars and laborers, the animosity between traders and merchants and of course the presence of various Muslim petty gangs seeking to profit from the chaos, magnified the Hindu-Muslim divide of the riots. The Congress, safe in its hold over the government formed by the Cabinet Mission plan, quite likely overestimated the extent to which the League commanded power at the ground level. The majority opinion among many in the League too favored a break once it became clear that the Congress was less inclined to negotiate with them. Jinnah, one could argue, was stuck between an uncompromising Congress, a hesitant British Government and an impatient set of followers. Converting the two-nation idea into a veritable reality seemed the only way to break the deadlock.

Jinnah, thus, is to be blamed if we understand history from the lens of nationalist Indian historiography. He could be blamed for highlighting the societal fault lines of the Indian nationalist imagination. Jinnah could be blamed for stoking the fires of Hindu-Muslim animosity. Jinnah could be held accountable for the hundreds who were killed on the streets of Calcutta, or for the many millions who were butchered on both sides of Punjab. Jinnah could be blamed giving birth to Pakistan, for its illegitimate child of Kashmir, for making the subcontinent a nuclear war zone. The Quaid-i-Azam could be held responsible for all this. 

But if we do so, not only do we judge the man unfairly, we also accord him an influence much higher than what he wielded (For if he was indeed responsible for all the ills of the Indian subcontinent, he had to be man of immense influence, right?). Jinnah could be *blamed* for India's partition to the extent that we consider the demand for a separate Muslim state of Pakistan illegitimate. ",null,0,cdnv2wc,1rhz3e,askhistorians,top_week,4

In Plymouth Governor [William Bradford's description](http://books.google.com/books?id=tnMa1-t128gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Of+Plymouth+Plantation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=es6UUoqnKu-1sATZr4GgBg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%5BFirst%20Thanksgiving%5D&amp;f=false) of the summer bounty and the ""small harvest"" that preceded the Thanksgiving, he mentions several foods that had been added to their winter stores. Fish such as ""cod and bass"" had been caught and preserved in the summer. ""Indian corn"" had been harvested. The fowl you mentioned were one or more varieties of waterfowl that had recently migrated into the area on their way south. However, Bradford does mention other wild animals being hunted, notably turkey and deer. Speaking of turkey specifically he says ""they took many"" because they were abundant in the area.

&gt; **What did the natives bring, if anything?**

Edward Winslow's account (see the footnote of the previous link) is more specific about what prompted the Thanksgiving and how the Wampanoag became involved. 

Just after the harvest, Bradford had sent out four men to hunt the waterfowl coming into the region and they had killed enough to feed the colony for a week. The successful harvest and hunt prompted the festivities, during the course of which, the colonists fired off some celebratory gunfire.

The Wampanoag heard the gunfire and thought that there was trouble in the colony. Perhaps the colonists were under attack, or perhaps they had launched an assault of their own. Either way, it warranted investigation. Massasoit Ousamequin, better known merely as Massasoit though that's his title rather than his name, led 90 men to colony to find out what was going on. When they realized the colonists were just having a feast, they quickly hunted five deer, made a gift of them, and joined the festivities for three days.

**EDIT**

I found one other source I was looking for, [a letter by William Hilton](http://books.google.com/books?id=uMUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=At+our+arrival+in+New+Plymouth+,+in+New+England,+we+found+all+our+friends+and++planters+in+good+health,+though+they+were+left+sick+and+weak,+with+very+small++means;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftqUUvTbLafKsASZ9IDoDg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=At%20our%20arrival%20in%20New%20Plymouth%20%2C%20in%20New%20England%2C%20we%20found%20all%20our%20friends%20and%20%20planters%20in%20good%20health%2C%20though%20they%20were%20left%20sick%20and%20weak%2C%20with%20very%20small%20%20means%3B&amp;f=false) written in November 1621.

Anyhow, Hilton's letter, while not make specific references to the Thanksgiving, does mention several wild plants that would have been on the menu. These include walnuts, chestnuts, plums, gooseberries, and strawberries. He also mentions several species of fowl that could have been hunted: turkeys (as mentioned earlier), partridge, quail, and [passenger] pigeons. He goes on to boast about the bounty of the region, because this letter is intended to encourage others to move to the colony from England.

I should also note here that since Hilton is writing this in November, it's likely *after* the Thanksgiving. We don't know the date on which it occurred, but based on the context (recent harvest and bird migrations), it was probably in late September or October, rather than late November as we currently celebrate it.

Battle of Lexington (April 19, 1775), 174 Irish were present.

Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775), 698 Irish were present.

A prominent American, Joseph Galloway, also an English Tory, on Oct. 27, 1779, told the English House of Commons that one-half of Washington's Continental Army was Irish.

k1990,"Okay, so this answer is primarily to do with the chronology and strategic progress of the war, as an attempt to explain why there aren't really many examples of Allied and Soviet soldiers interacting. Links are generally to Wikipedia articles to provide a top-level overview, as I'm at work and don't have time to dig out better sources right now. So here goes:

The primary reason for the scarcity of accounts is simply that the US/Commonwealth and Soviet ground forces spent the vast majority of the war fighting on entirely different fronts, thousands of miles apart:

- the USSR didn't enter the war against Germany until [June 1941](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_barbarossa), and was preoccupied with the challenge of pushing a German invasion back through southern Russia and the Caucasus;
- by that point (ie. after [the Dunkirk evacuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation) in May/June 1940 and [the fall of France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_France) in late June 1940) the non-Soviet Allies are not engaged in ground combat in mainland Europe again until [the invasion of Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Italy) in September 1943);
- the non-Soviet Allied ground war from 1940-43 is focused primarily in north Africa ([the Western Desert Campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_Campaign)) against Germany and Italy and [against Japan in the Far East](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_war);
- the [entire Soviet ground war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_\(World_War_II\)) is a push towards Germany from Russia through the Caucasus, the Baltic states and Eastern Europe and parts of Scandinavia, so the US/Commonwealth forces and the Soviets are divided by pretty much the entire continent of Europe for the most of the war;
- in the Far East, the USSR did not declare war on Japan until [9 August 1945](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War_\(1945\)), so played almost no role in the Pacific War.

All of that strategic chronology is why the main examples of interactions between Soviet and non-Soviet Allied ground forces during the war come from 1945, when they essentially meet halfway after invading Germany from opposite sides (see [Elbe Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe_Day) for a brief overview).

The wild card, which I don't know enough about to speak of (but which someone else will hopefully discuss) is [the joint Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in the autumn of 1941](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran), to lock down the Persian oil-fields and secure a key east/west supply corridor.

At the macro/geopolitical and economic levels, and in the naval war in the Atlantic, there's a lot of very, very interesting interplay between the US, UK and USSR, but at a ground-based tactical/strategic level there just isn't very much fighting side-by-side. ",null,5,cdnh9he,1ri35i,askhistorians,top_week,13
Acritas,"There were several areas of interactions - mostly lend-lease operations.

In 1941:

UK and USSR troops took control of Iran, advancing from south and north respectively. Afghanistan was also controlled by allied troops. 

Prior to 1945, areas of contact were limited by lend-lease supply routes:

* Arctic supply routes 

* Persian corridor 

* Pacific Route

* Alaska-Siberia Air Route

In 1945

* direct contacts between fronline troops were quite common. 

Let me describe in details:

Arctic supply routes (PQ/QP convoys from Scotland to Murmansk, after 1942 - JW/RA; also aerial route) were dangerous. There were several instances when allied forces fought together to protect convoys against Luftwaffe and submarine attacks. Yes, interactions were quite friendly, although incidents and misunderstandings did happen. For example, the losses of  convoy [PQ-17](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_PQ_17) could be attributed to decision to scatter convoy (blame UK) and to unencrypted radio message about convoy (blame USSR).

Iranian corridor was quite safe. Since each ally controlled a separate part of Iran (North was USSR-controlled and South was US and British-controlled), interaction happened mostly at checkpoints and between lend-lease operators (e.g. soviet pilots, flying lend-lease planes)

For Pacific naval route there were several incidents when US submarines mistakenly fired torpedoes at USSR cargo ships. In total, 6 USSR ships were sank by US Navy and 1 by Japanese. And that was the safest naval route.

1945 encounters when unexpected and uncoordinated sometimes led to friendly-fire instances, but such incidents didn't give rise to any significant unfriendliness. And when coordinated, it usually was quite festive - see [Elbe day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe_Day). 

As an example of friendly fire, Ivan Kozhedub was attacked by a pair of american P-51s and had to shoot them down after they kept attacking . Later it turns out that they mistook his plane for FW-190 (Kozhedub flew La-7).

 A lot  of what we know today about Greece comes to us via the Romans. Things like Art and Literature and accounts of historical events are of fascination to the Romans. They would have been aware intimately of the myths and the real histories often collecting Greek memorabilia as antiques or as family heirlooms. 

They endeared themselves to The greeks somewhat and tried to make themselves more like them, even claiming they had descended from the original inhabitants of Troy. 

The histories of Greece will have been studied also by people such as Virgil and Cicero and heck even the Generals with regards to warfare. There is reference to these myths and events in Roman writing.

I'll post it here now and edit in a TL;DR when I'm done reading it.

Edit: as promised, TL;DR.

First off, we know that the original symbol for 50 was not L, but a three-pointed V, like a trident.  And we know that D was a D with a line through it (kind of like Ð).  And there are several early versions of M, including a circle with an X through it.  This will be important later.

There are many, many, many theories proposed over the years, some valid, and some not.  The one this guy is proposing involves set symbols for 1, 10, 100, and 1000, with 5, 50, and 500 representing those symbols cut in half.  

5: V is the top half of X.  

50: The original symbol for 100 (attested in Etruscan inscriptions) was an X with a line down the middle, which when cut in half becomes the trident thing, eventually simplified to an L.  

100: The X with a line down the middle was simplified to something like this: )|( Which ultimately became a C.

500: And the circle with an X through it, representing 1000, forms a Ð when cut in half, which became D.

1000:  The circle with an X lasted a good long time, and it wasn't until later that an M for *mille* became the convention.  (C definitely does not stand for *centum*, by the way, because the Etruscans used it first.)",null,1,cdnk753,1ri4qy,askhistorians,top_week,7

epursimuove,"It's debatable. 

The viewpoint you're mentioning here - that the Muslim conquests were the defining break with the classical world, not the fall of Rome - has become quite popular over the past few decades. Peter Brown is probably the best known proponent. Certainly Brown's ideas have been a needed corrective to some old cliches. 476 - the date when the last nominal Western Emperor was deposed - wasn't particularly important, as it was merely the continuation of a pattern of barbarian co-opting of imperial institutions that had been taking place for the better part of a century. And the popular notion that the Dark Ages were an era of total ignorance is nonsense. 

But personally, I'd side with Peter Heather and others in saying that , while Brown's ideas are insightful, they go too far in minimizing the upheaval that happened in Western Europe. 

Trade, population, literacy and the production of books, and large-scale construction all declined massively in the late fifth and sixth centuries. The change wasn't instantaneous and it wasn't uniform  (Britain was the most affected, Spain the least so; as late as the 630s Isidore of Seville was basically a old-school Roman intellectual), but it was drastic.  In the 3rd century an aristocrat could travel from Scotland to Mesopotamia without ever leaving a common cultural system, but two centuries later that unity was gone. 

I've only been talking about the West. In the East, where the Eastern Empire (Byzantium) endured largely intact, Brown's thesis is more persuasive. ",null,0,cdo0q7u,1ri640,askhistorians,top_week,1

TheVitruvianDan,"The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England saw William of Orange overthrow the Catholic King James II and establish himself as William III. Hobbes was referenced quite a bit in discussions following James II's fleeing of the country.

The two broad political groups the Tories and Whigs tried to legally justify the overthrow of the king. The Tories (who tended to believe in Divine Right of Kings) maintained that by fleeing England James had, in effect, abdicated (he had left the throne vacant). Importantly for our purposes though, the Whigs began referencing Hobbes and Locke and others who espoused the idea of the social contract. They maintained that James II had broken his contract with the people through his attempts to destroy the Anglican Church (long story) and various other examples of his poor rule (mostly through ignoring Parliament and therefore the people). This then came to a close when the Convention Parliament declared James to have abdicated and listed all his failings as king and pronounced William and Mary (James' daughter) as King and Queen. This was later formalised as the Bill of Right. William, for his part, undertook to uphold the Protestant religion as King and to work with Parliament.

idjet,"Before answering this question I've reviewed the chapter to refresh my memory. It is very dramatic with multiple players speaking, like an episode of Law and Order.

We are very fortunate to have transcripts of actual inquisitions of this same time period and so we could go through a comparative analysis. But this would be fruitless: Umberto Eco needed to serve a story before anything. He made the choice to treat a session of inquiry, an *inquisito*, more like a trial for his dramatic effect. 

*Inquisitos* were not trials during the medieval period: they were question and answer between inquisitor and subject, mostly a dialogue that was lead by inquisitor. We have no evidence that there was neither some broad audience nor multiple subjects for these sessions: a lot of the transcripts have marginalia notations like 'ask so-and-so follow up question' and other manuscript indicators that suggest if there were other subjects in the room they might have eventually said *something* that would be recorded. So we gather the *inquisito* was inquisitor(s), scribes/notaries, perhaps noble(s) as secular witness to proceedings, perhaps Bishops, monks or other clergy watching and listening. Certainly we read stirring conversations: stunning displays of logic and argument; but not high theatrics.

Umberto Eco modeled his Bernardo Gui after the real Gui. Here is an example from Gui's own manual about dealing with subjects who attempted to double-speak or use the inquisitor's own language against him:

&gt;When one of them has been seized and is brought up for examination, he comes as if without a qualm, as if conscious of no wrongdoing on his part, and as if he felt entirely safe. When asked if he knows why he has been arrested, he replies 
quite calmly and with a smile, ""Sir, I should be glad to learn the reason from you."" When he is questioned about the faith which he holds and believes, he replies, ""I believe all that a good Christian should believe."" Pressed as to what he means by 'a good Christian', he answers, ""One who believes as the Holy Church teaches us to believe and hold."" When asked what he calls the Holy Church, he replies, ""Sir, what you say and believe to be the Holy Church."" If he is told, ""I believe the Holy Church to be the Roman Church, over which presides our lord pope and other prelates subordinate to him,"" then he responds, ""That I do believe,"" meaning that he believes that I believe this. [*Practica officii Inquisitionis heretice pravitatis* (Conduct of the 
Inquisition into Heretical Wickedness)], c1323]

Eco is a medievalist, a trained historian and philologist, and so his work would be accurate - he likes to put his medievalist knowledge on display in The Name of the Rose. His portrayal of Gui matches with what we know of him: smart, clever and a rigid, determined, dogmatic Catholic.

The_Turk2,"Hitler was known for having a very loose management structure, much unlike Stalin in this regard. Hitler was bad with scheduled meetings, was sporadic, and left a lot of the actual governing work to his administration, and trusted Nazi officials. He gave the government direction, and government followed. He was always open to new ideas, and innovations in military technology and tactics. He gave his generals a surprising amount of autonomy compared to the French (case and point de Gaulle with the use of armour) and Stalin (pre-1942/3 about*...). 

Needless to say this had many benefits for the German military, and some downsides, such as Goering pushing to allow his aircraft to bomb and ""finish"" off the French/British at Dunkirk which he failed to do, rather than letting the army move in and crush them. You have to remember that Hitler was largely disliked by the Prussian military aristocracy that had been led by Hindenburg before his death. To make up for this, among other things, he gave a lot of autonomy to his generals, and as most military books were being written in German throughout the 1930's, he had a wealth of knowledge to choose from. 

This changed for Hitler on the Eastern Front, as the war against Stalin in Southern Russia began to stall (as Moscow was about to fall), he decided to take full command of all military operations in Operation Barborossa, in a mad attempt to secure the entire south, and the Baku oil wells, which failed spectacularly. Very famously he denied Guderian the chance to seize Moscow, but instead turn southwards. This allowed Stalin time to regroup, and push back against the Germans and her allies. 

At the same time might I add on the Eastern Front, Stalin began to relax his grip on the military, and allowed his generals, most importantly Zhukov to have a greater say in the running of the war, and battle plans. 

*Stalin gave in eventually, and decided to trust his generals, especially Zhukov. Can't pinpoint a date I'm afraid. 

TL;DR: How much autonomy a leader gives to his gifted generals, and its for sure a fine balance, can change a lot the outcome of a war. Foolish decisions for personal glory, usually end in vain defeat. Even Stalin had to swallow his pride, to allow Zhukov command. ",null,9,cdnrex8,1ribha,askhistorians,top_week,25
OiBoi,"You may want to consider tweaking your question just a bit, and replacing ""tactician"" with ""strategist."" In the modern military use of the word, tactics refer to troop engagements, battles or parts of battles. I'm assuming you mean more the ""big picture"" or the Operational and Strategic tiers.

There is some level of disagreement among historians about Hitler's ""brilliance,"" was he just lucky, or was there actually some genius behind his moves? That being said, I'm just going to outright support the former notion with my response until someone more knowledgeable shows up. 

Overall, Hitler made bold gambles at critical times which often paid off for him. His decision to march into the Rhineland, for example, seems like keen calculation in hindsight, but at the time Hitler could not have been assuredly confident that the French would yield so easily. Similar successful gambles that paid off were the annexation/occupation of Austria and the handling of the Sudetenland (first getting the Sudetenland at the negotiating table, and then essentially taking the rest of the country by force afterwards). People have a tendency to look at men who took big gambles, and won, as having genius (Caesar at the Rubicon, for example). When you consider the successes of some of Hitler's gambles, it's easy to understand where the myth of his genius comes from.

But not all of Hitler's gambles were successful; the failed Putsch in Munich and the invasion of Poland come to mind. The latter one ties in nicely with your question of advisers, as it was Ribbentrop (Germany's then foreign minister) who played a role in convincing Hitler that France and England would again try appeasement. Instead, WWII was started in earnest. 

The notion of Germany's success in WWII being largely due to the competence of the men who advised Hitler, or carried out operations under his general orders has some merit. German’s quick victory over France was largely due to the result of plans made by the German General Staff (primarily the Manstein Plan) in combination with successful implementation of Maneuver Warfare, aka “Blitzkrieg” (not unlike a doctrine practiced by the modern US Marine Corps).  The presence of a frontline commander of Erwin Rommel’s caliber should also be worth noting.

This brings us to the Battle/Miracle of Dunkirk.  By the end of May 1940, Several German tank divisions had roughly 350,000 allied troops trapped near the port of Dunkirk. But on May 22nd, a halt order was given to the encroaching Germans. Ultimately, the Germans gave the British an additional 4 to5 days to organize a mass withdrawal of some 300,000 men.  William Shirer stipulates in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, that Hitler gave this order under the advice of Hermann Göring, who wanted an opportunity for the fledgling Luftwaffe to annihilate the British and gain prestige.  It would later be revealed that the order to halt was initially given by Von Rundstedt, the German Commander, and was confirmed hours later by Hitler. However, even if Shirer’s point is ignored,  the mere fact that Hitler allowed for this delay and the escape of so many British forces, essentially keeping Britain in the war, is IMO at the very least strong anecdotal evidence that Hitler did not possess the military genius often misattributed to him.

Obviously, there are mitigating circumstances with Dunkirk, in particular the mechanical state of the German Panzers and whether or not the evacuation on that scale could have been reasonably foreseen.

I’m dead tired, so I’m going to stop here. My sources are primarily military history courses I’ve taken as a Military Strategic Studies major, and Shirer’s “Rise…” (I’m well aware of the faults people have pointed out in his work, but I don’t think his adherence to the Sonder Weg-theory much affects this question). Lastly, when referring to a “military genius” I’m using the term as defined Clausewitz.

vonadler,"I'll recap my [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16m1n3/how_was_hitlers_military_acumen/c7xa3a6) on Hitler's tactical and strategic acumen.

Hitler was not a great general, far from it.

His good sides;

1. He was prepared to side-step seniority and adapt a good and innovative plan when it was required. See for example Manstein's Fall Sißelschnitt plan for the invasion of France.

2. He was a risk-taker and would bet hard on small chances and narrow margins. Especially early war this paid off quite a bit. He bet that the French would take more than two months to assemble a serious offensive to relieve Poland, and defended the west with a motley collection of second and third line divisions that lacked much of their equipment. The campaign in Norway was also a prime example of this.

However, this is where his good abilities stop.

His bad sides;

1. He was unable to organise the high command and the war in a unified way, instead encouraging infighting between the OKH (Oberkommande des Heeres, High Command of the Armies) and the OKW (Oberkommande der Wehrmacht, High Command of the Armed Forces) and intriguing between officers for command, his attention and the spotlight, which gave them more resources. he had this fault when it came to politics as well, and encouraged infighting to ensure that noone fought him for the supreme position.

2. He was unable to take criticism, feedback or in any way take the blame for any failure. That way he would not learn and would not improve as a general. In the long run, it also meant that he appointed yes-men and commanders with political skill rather than skilled generals to conduct the war. All others were simply removed.

3. He was unable to see skill in defeat. Some German generals did miracles, kept their armies together and delayed the enemy and caused him massive casualties, but were eventually driven back - Hitler saw this as a defeat and would remove the general.

4. He was unable to keep himself from the details, losing overall focus and oversight. He would often study things in extreme detail and berate generals for not knowing where their battalions were exactly (which was the duty of the regimental or divisional commander, not the army commander) or industrial owners for not knowing details of armament. Generals soon had to spend hours reading up on the exact positions of individual small units under their command before a briefing with Hitler, time better spent on other things. Hitler would also place battalions and move them around, with no regard for the knowledge on the ground (the strength and readiness of the battalion, the local terrain, line of sight and enemy dispositions etc).

5. He believed in fixed defence and placed troops like they had been placed early ww1 - with all firepower to the front, preferably in fixed positions, to blunt an enemy attack directly. This is an amateur's view of war (as much firepower as possible) and in reality a flexible defence (with small outposts up front and most of the firepower further back) with a large reserve will allow you to blunt an enemy attack late ww1 or in ww2 much better. Line thinking, which goes back to the first village pallisade all through warfare until early ww1 was obselete - you needed to think along the lines of hedgehogs, outposts and large fields rather than lines, and Hitler could and would not.

6. He placed much too much focus on morale. Ordering that veteran tank crews that had been defeated should not get new tanks first, as they would be demoralised, so they should go to newly trained crews with high morale instead. In large area warfare, from ww1 and onward, morale was fed by food, sleep and getting arms and ammunition needed. Then the men used their training and fought for their comrades rather than consider any defeat or grandiose statements or ""signals sent"" by high command. Hitler believed in these grandiose gestures and morale and was heavily mired in late 19th century romanticist ideas of morale, nationalism and a national will. He firmly believed his ""not a step back"" order during the 1941-42 winter Soviet counterattacks saved the German army and that it was Napoleon's order to retreat that had doomed the French invasion of Russia. Most likely, if the Germans had used flexible defence, they would have lost less men and caused the Soviets massive casualties during the winter fighting.

Hitler was disregarded as a General by the German officer corps. He had not gone through officer school, he had not been a cadet, he had not been promoted to a staff position and done staff work, and he had not played any kriegsspiel (realistic board games the Germans used to play through potential battles at all levels).

I use a 4-rule guide to a general.

**Organisation.** Can the general organise troops so they fight welland the civil society to provide him with more troops, supplies and other things needed to fight. Can he keep himself involved only at a level above and a level below his own, to have focus on what he needs to do? Does he understand logistics?

Hitler was a lousy organiser. He inherited a strong officer corps and a good military tradition, and a fantastically organised army, but did nothing to improve it. Indeed, when it resisted his attempts at controlling it, he expanded his bodyguard (Waffen SS) to a full army, and that army was exceptionally crappy except for 3-4 divisions mid-war. He got involved at too much detail, concerned himself about 'signals' sent and much more.

**Tactics.** Can the general win battles under different circumstances, against differing and sometimes superior opponents? Can the general delay superior opponents and keep his forces together under dire circumstances? Can the general handle a guerilla insurgency as well as a line battle?

Hitler used amateur military tactics and early ww1 thinking, and refused to learn. He was a lousy tactician.

**Strategy.** Can the general see the big picture, can he use his victories to knock out enemies of the war, can he follow up on successes and not go headlong into pursuits where he will be stranded? Can he get allies and improve his positions without fighting? Does he have an understanding on how to undermine the enemy ability to fight?

Here I would actually give Hitler something. He was good at this. He knew the need for strategic terrain, knew the need for allies and knew the importance of raw materials. However, he lacked the planning for a long war, which brings him down from an excellent grade.

**Politics.** Can the general keep in position despite others trying to remove him? Can he get allies, can he work with those allies? Can he secure resources from himself, work with his seniors, juniors and equals? Can he drum warring tribes together against a common foe? Can he build a legacy that lasts? Can he appoint the right men to the right place and promote competent people?

Here Hitler fails again. He was unable to take criticism and removed anyone who opposed his ideas, filling the OKW with yes-sayers. He got into power and remained there, but that is also all he managed to do in this area. His legacy is destroyed and mere mentioning of it is an insult.

So, 1 good, 3 failures. Not a very good general, I say. If I would place Hitler anywhere, it would be as a Staff Major at an Army Command.",null,0,cdo0re0,1ribha,askhistorians,top_week,9

falafel1066,"Interesting question, complicated answer. A little history on both men could probably help illuminate the answer.

Let's talk Malcolm X first. Born into urban poverty, son of Garveyites, ex-convict, member of the Nation of Islam until the last year of his life when he converted to Sunni Islam, Malcolm Little (as he was born), had a deep hatred of racism, inequality, poverty, and the social conditions surrounding him. He lived mostly in the north, so the racism he saw was not necessarily Jim Crow, ""Separate but equal,"" but institutionalized racism through discriminatory housing practices, voting discrimination, etc. Therefore, he advocated a militant resistance to white racism and separation from whites. BUT, the Nation of Islam prohibited political engagement, so Malcolm X only preached it (until the last year of his life when he founded the pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity which worked to reach out and make connections to other similar organizations, like SNCC). The last year of his life, though, through his exile from the Nation of Islam, his conversion to Sunni Islam, and his international travels, Malcolm X's rhetoric and political advocacy turned more toward cooperation with the civil rights movement, though he advocated human rights (healthcare, housing, employment, etc) rather than just civil rights (voting, representation, etc). For more on Malcolm X, see Manning Marable's Pulitzer-prize winning biography, *Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.* 

Alright, let's talk Martin Luther King, Jr. Born into a religious family (his father was a reverend too), King promoted Christian love and non-violence as the answer to racism. Though King was critical of American politics, he ultimately believed that the road to freedom was through social organization that confronted racist civil policies, like segregation. Therefore, we have the Montgomery Bus Boycott as an example (whereas with Malcolm X, we don't only have one indication of him protesting publicly). King was willing to engage directly to bring attention to the issues. Towards the end of his life, King turned more radical, seeing how embedded racism was in the country (part of this was influenced by his travels north, where he didn't see the KKK or overt racism, but, like Malcolm X, became aware of institutionalized racism). He started to challenge underlying issues of racism, like housing and employment- issues of human rights, not necessarily civil rights. Sound familiar? 

Historians have recently noted how at the ends of their lives, King and Malcolm X seemed to approach an understanding of the deep roots of racism, and began to challenge the traditional ways of the NAACP or the NOI. Does this mean had they survived they would have agreed completely? Probably not, but identifying their late in life turns shows a remarkable similarity in ideologies. Yes, Malcolm X was a Muslim and King a Christian, but ultimately they found strength in their faith to fight the roots of racism in America. Here's what King wrote to Betty Shabaz (Malcolm X's wife) after Malcolm was assassinated:

&gt;""While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.""

So I guess I would encourage you to rethink the ""divide"" between these two men's ideologies. The history of African Americans' resistance to racism is often framed King vs. Malcolm X, non-violent vs. violent, when in reality, the truth is much more complicated (as it always is). But, if you want to look at factors that separate them, look at their personal history and religion.  For further reading:

ConanofCimmeria,"My personal favorite translation of the *Gesta Danorum* is the two-volume edition by H.E. Davidson, whom I just love unconditionally. It's a little old-fashioned but reads well and is very thorough.

You mentioned the Baltic crusades: *the* definitive book on this is imaginatively titled *The Northern Crusades* by Eric Christiansen. It's a very old-school work of history but a really great and informative read. William Urban also has a whole bunch of stuff on this, but I've not read much of his work. What little work has been done on these crusades (in English; there's a lively cottage industry on the subject in German and Russian) doesn't take anything like a national perspective, in part because they were a more or less international project, with various popes issuing papal bulls for them just as they would a crusade to the Holy Land, so settlers from Scandinavia, the German territories and in some cases even the British Isles took part.

This may be a problem you find throughout the literature, particularly because in the late Migration Age/early Middle Ages there's no such thing as a ""nation,"" so working from a national perspective is inherently anachronistic. Also, for whatever reason a great deal of our primary sources are more concerned with the west Norse (ie, Norwegians and Icelanders;) I don't really know a reason for this except that Sweden's Tre Kronor castle went up in flames in the late 17th century, destroying a large chunk of Sweden's earliest historical texts. Why there should be comparatively little to do with Denmark I'm not sure.

Sorry I couldn't give a more definitive answer. I am mostly interested in Swedish history (förlåt!) so I don't know that much about state-building in Denmark. If there's one particular aspect of Viking Age history you're interested in (eg, runes, mythology, material culture, what have you) I may be able to point you to some useful resources.

Carol_White,"Well, one way we might answer this question could be by looking at a case study. In 1791 Benjamin Banneker sent a copy of his almanac and [a letter](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h71t.html) to one Thomas Jefferson addressing the very issue you raise. Banneker said that while popular opinion held that Africans were ""scarcely capable of mental endowments,"" the perceived lack of accomplishments on the part of the Black race was actually due to environmental factors, like ""groaning captivity and cruel oppression."" Banneker sucked up to Jefferson and hoped that his intelligence and humanitarianism would persuade him to admit to racial equality.

Jefferson's [reply](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h72t.html) was as follows: ""No body wishes more than I do, to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men; and that the appearance of the want of them, is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence, both in Africa and America. I can add with truth, that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced, for raising the condition, both of their body and mind, to what it ought to be, as far as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstances, which cannot be neglected, will admit.""

How should we read this? On the one hand, it's a rather progressive statement compared to his musings in 1781 that Africans were ""in reason much inferior"" to Europeans, and that Black men were more attracted to white women in the same way that orangutans are more attracted to Black women. Yet the words were not accompanied by any sort of advocacy. The best he could do as president was hope that the physical expansion of the United States would eventually cause the extinction of slavery.

Jefferson and his fellow men of the Enlightenment were on the fence about the intellectual capacity of Africans. They didn't have all the evidence. A generation later we'll have the rise of true scientific racism and the medical ""proof"" of Black inferiority.

SplendourFalls,"I studied this in quite a lot of detail, so I'll be happy to answer.

**What was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of England?**

The political situation was tense. Following the Spanish Armada a hundred years before, England had become fanatically anti-Catholic, legislating heavily against the religion and generally subverting it until by 1688 it was a tiny minority - around 2% of the population. In the seventeenth century, your political allegiance was often pre-determined by your religion, and Catholicism was associated with absolute monarchy, whilst Protestantism became associated with parliamentary or constitutional monarchy and the rule of law (a lot of this is due to the propaganda surrounding the religious wars in Europe, and the fact that Members of Parliament were generally devout Protestants). I always like to use the analogy that 'Catholic' meant to an Englishman in 1688 what 'Socialist' meant to an American in 1960 - there was *very much* a 'Catholic scare'. So when James II, a Catholic, inherited the throne in 1685 and began *overriding* Parliament, going over their heads and using his royal powers to enact pro-Catholic policies without the consent of Parliament, things began to get ugly, and Parliament feared James was planning to implement a Catholic tyranny, an absolute monarchy of the type that had caused the Civil Wars a few decades earlier. *Even the Pope* was wary of what James II was doing and urged the king to be cautious. The tipping point comes when James II produces a son, a Catholic heir. Several high-profile figures conspire and sent a letter inviting James II's son-in-law (who would have become king had James not produced a son), the Protestant William of Orange, to take the throne with Parliament's blessing.

**How was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasion?**

James II had been allied to fellow Catholic, the King of France and archetypal absolute monarch, Louis XIV. When William is crowned king  England joins the anti-French bloc of states fighting in the [Nine Years' War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Grand_Alliance) in Europe.

**How was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasion?**

I don't know much about this I'm afraid. They had warred in the past, but James II did marry his daughter to William and they were big trading partners, and Parliament would hardly have invited someone hostile to take the throne. 

**Even if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England. Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes, England was actually conquered by The Dutch Republic?**

It would be very difficult to argue that. I certainly wouldn't recommend you make a statement like that in any academic work. It's best to see it as a coup that's was justified at the time by portraying it as a 'glorious' event. 'Conquest' certainly has far different implications and connotations that aren't suited to describing the events of 1688.

Now, this is the interesting bit. At the time, the British Isles weren't united under one crown, but were three separate kingdoms that *happened* to have been governed by a single person since 1603. 
Now, William didn't 'conquer' England in any meaningful sense, but he *certainly* had to fight for Ireland [in a war that lasted for several years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamite_war_in_Ireland) There was also no guarantee that the Scottish parliament would offer William the crown, though they eventually did in 1689, and should the Scottish parliament have refused him the crown William might well have had to conquer Scotland. 
 
At this point I should also explain a little about the term 'Glorious Revolution'. 'Revolution' only acquired its modern meaning (violent overthrow of authority) after the French Revolution of 1789, but as early as 1689 the events of 1688 were known as the 'Glorious Revolution' in England. It's because *revolution* in this context is more literal - it's a restoration in the 'coming full circle' sense. This is because those involved saw themselves as as restoring the ancient rights and liberties of Englishmen that came from Magna Carta in 1216, rights they believed James II was infringing.

I'm assuming this has answered the bit about why England didn't become 'a part of the Dutch Republic', but basically, that's easily answered by a quick look at the definition of a [personal union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union).

**How was the invasion successful with only 15,000 men?**

James II had *no support whatsoever* in England. In July 1688, before James produced his Catholic heir, the Royal Navy mutinied after a Catholic captain had Mass performed onboard his ship, and James had to pacify them in person, which emphasises the tension of the situation in England at the time. After William landed in England James was hesitant to engage the Dutch army and simply sat his troops in camp in the south-west of England, his men deserting in their thousands, having no intention of fighting for James. It was a total capitulation and the army dissolved almost without firing a shot. Interestingly enough the complete collapse of the royal army worked *against* William - he then had to spend months wrestling with Parliament for funds with which to build a new force to check the growing rebellion of James' supporters (known as Jacobites) in Scotland.

Hope this helps, hit me up if you have any more questions.

Also, a quick disclaimer: This is an incredibly Anglo-centric post and the events of the Revolution took on completely different dimensions in the other kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland, but you were specifically referring to England in your questions.",null,0,cdo27z3,1rik13,askhistorians,top_week,3
darth_nick_1990,"I'll just add my two cents:

**What was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of England?**

The British Isles had just faced the British Civil Wars/Revolution and Restoration. This period of twenty years, from 1640-1660, completely changed society within Britain. It had deep implications for the government, the monarchy and even the peasantry. James II was a Catholic king of England prior to the Glorious Revolution. There was widespread fear and disgust that he was taking influence in his rule by his Stuart ancestors as an absolute monarch. This would have undone all the ""progress"" made since 1640.

**How was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasion?**

The Glorious Revolution is largely seens as the only successful ""peaceful"" revolution. I say ""peaceful"" only in relative terms. There were some very minor military conflicts but when compared to other famous revolutions where regimes have fell or changed, there was very little blood shed. This was a very positive aspect of the Glorious Revolution and there was far less shock when compared to the earlier events of the regicide at the end of the British Civil Wars. William of Orange was generally accepted, partially due to his marriage with Mary, an English princess. This helped to legitimise their coup.

**How was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasion.**

The English and Dutch relationship was generally amiable. During the Dutch Revolts in the sixteenth century England offered help, unofficially. It was unofficial help in order not to escalate a war with the Spanish. Although the Spanish did eventually declare war on the English (think Spanish Armada) their was a concious attempt by the English to not officially escalate a war but also to help others which were politically and religiously alligned. After the coronation of William and Mary the Dutch Republic certainly became less of a priority to manage. This may be an offhand comment but it has been raised at other points in history, particularly with the coronation of James I/VI of England/Scotland. James I sought England as it was larger, wealthier and far more influential. A similar case could be made about William and Mary seeking England over the Dutch Republic.

**I read that a result of the invasion was that the dominance of world naval trade shifted from the Dutch Republic to England. How did this happen?**

I would disagree. Although the Dutch naval trade was very prosperous, so was the English. England had strong trade links to most of Europe. The addition of a further naval network simply benefited both countries. Although I am not a specialist in this area, I would imagine that this was simply a benefit to both countries, rather than an amalgamation of the two networks.

**Even if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England. Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes, England was actually conquered by The Dutch Republic? If so, why didn't England just become a part of The Dutch Republic?**

I completely disagree with this sentiment. I see it as the English parliament *allowed* William and Mary to take up the English throne. They were *invited* because: a) they had a legitimate right to the throne, b) they were protestant, c) they were malleable (compared to James II). Parliament could have raised another Civil War if they wanted to. There certainly was a similar level of distrust towards James II as there was to Charles I. Instead, they saw a different avenue they could take. I think your question relies very heavily on thinking the Dutch Republic had a superior military advantage, and that is how they succeeded.

**How was the invasion successful with only 15.000 men?**

Like the answer above, success depended upon the relationship between the English parliament and William and Mary. James II had little to no support. He could not muster a real defence. The 15,000 men were to mop up the small protest made against the Dutch and to parade down the Thames.

Hope that helps.

l_mack,"I'm speaking from a largely Canadian context - and most of the literature that I'm familiar with revolves around the mining industry - but I think that there are some parallels that can be drawn between child labour in mining and child labour in textiles. Notably, I think I can address - to an extent - your main question regarding compensation.
 

Child labour in Canadian coal mines occurred extensively during the 19th century and petered out in the early decades of the 20th century. In Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, for example, they accounted for 16% of the mining workforce in the 1880s, 10% in the 1890s, and then 9% at the turn of the century. [1] Boys in the mines generally gave their pay to their parents to dispense with - this became less common as the boys grew older, but while they were living under their parents roof it remained common to contribute substantially to the family fund. That said, even young boys could often expect an ""allowance"" to be doled out by their parents out of their earnings. Children in the pits, often working alongside an older family member, could contribute to the family economy in non-wage related ways also. For example, a boy in the mine could work alongside an older family member - allowing for the allotment of an additional coal tub that the older worker could help to fill to boost their production of coal higher than normal and ensure greater compensation. These contributions - both in terms of additional wages and on-the-site benefits, ensured that children's contributions to the family economy was often substantial. For this reason, it would be economically - as well as emotionally - devastating to lose a child to workplace injury or death. [2]

Workers' compensation plans spread unevenly. In Britain, for example, the *Employers Liability Act* was introduced in 1880 to provide some modicum of support to bereaved families. Liability acts were also passed in several Canadian provinces in the late-1890s - but these were not ""compensation"" acts, they merely placed the possibility of liability for workplace injury at the feet of employers. Workers' families would still have to take the employer to court to receive compensation. In Canada, the first actual compensation act was passed in Quebec in 1909, while Ontario and Nova Scotia followed suit in 1914 and 1915 respectively. [3] In the U.S., this type of legislation began to spread throughout the states after 1910s. [4] 

In terms of child labour, until these pieces of legislation were passed the only recourse would be for the family to take employers to court. Unfortunately, social pressures would sometimes be enacted against families who opted to go for this option. Ian McKay writes: 

&gt;Those who had not understood the tight bonds tying families to the mines easily condemned the families who sought compensation for children killed in the Explosion of 1891 [in Cumberland County] or other mining accidents, inferring sordid profiteering from petitions more likely motivated by the desire of families to survive after the loss of an important breadwinner [5]

That said, sometimes these cases did go forward; Robert McIntosh describes the 1888 legal action between collier John O'Henly and the Acadia Coal Company regarding the death of O'Henly's young son. [6]

thepineappleheaddres,"&gt; Hitler is always portrayed as a genocidal maniac; while Stalin -who killed more people- is never really looked at negatively, usually because he was the ""good guy"" and won.

There are Hitler apologists and Stalin apologists. Stalin apologists aren't a special case. 

Anyway, of all the people I know, I can't name one who has a positive view of Stalin. I've never heard him being called a 'good guy' by any colleagues.

I'm not at all for 'but mom, x group killed more people than y group!'. Human tragedy isn't a numbers game. 

Anyway, I thought post cold-war research has discredited this?

The only portion of this that has any credibility is the portion dealing with hygiene but there is a very earthly explanation for this: religious laws had a practical purpose in some instances.

Skolman,"Forgive me for the lack of citations and specific details as my materials on the topic are currently in a storage locker, but I shall attempt to give you the basic answer.

Yes, and no. By the final year of the war the south as a whole was in a state of near destitute as inflation was rampant and most of the labor force was engaged in supplying the confederate army, in manner similar to Germany and Japan in WWII. So yes, life was pretty bad as a whole. (This may just be my uninformed opinion.) But I believe there are two roots to the ""Yankee brutality/Lucifer's Legions"": first you have the major parts of states and whole cities that were pillaged by Sherman's March that were then burned to the ground as it's their citizens were still in their homes, but they're were other cities, towns, and villages across the south which suffered near the same fate; secondly you have the Prisoner of War Camps, such as the famous Andersonville, GA Prison Camp, which were filled over capacity and downright filthy and putrid places and claimed the lives of 56,000 soldiers, or approximately 12% who were sent to them (Approximately 1% died in German POW camps, and not by starvation, typhoid fever, etc.). But to simply stop there is to not pay the conditions of the confederacy the honor it is respected.

Sustaining the Confederate Army was no easy task when the majority of the Pre-1961 laborers were involved in the war themselves. The popular belief that most southerners owned slaves is a myth, rather the number is something like 1 in 10 families owned slaves and the average was 1 to 2 slaves, and that something like 1% of slave holders owned more than 200. Prior to the Civil War non-slave-holding white southerners, and even those who owned slaves, were often doing the same type of labor and living a slightly better life than that of slaves as 45% of the nation was in poverty. They were often sharecroppers and or practiced subsistence agriculture, meaning life was pretty bad. 

This life style only worsened as the war progressed when the men who didn't own plantations were drawn from their families and land to the battlefield. This often left mothers and women to try and run the entire household, so farming, even worse than their husbands often did, while simultaneously raising an average of 4+ children. 

As things worsened for the family, the confederacy as a whole suffered from what I'll term ""regional specialization"" (Correct me oh apathetic southern scholar if you would please.), that is there were distinct regions in which certain things were produced in each region, ie: cotton/rice/indigo/other stuff (if any extra was managed to be produced besides subsistence requirements) and often only those. As the War surpassed the expected end date of 1 year (may of been 6 months) these regions struggled to transition to support the needs of a nation instead of exporting it's products to the North and Europe. Combined with the Union Blockade and Egyptian/Indian Cotton providing Europe it's needs, the South had little to no economic capacity. Inflation thus grew steadily, with the help of speculators who would purchase and hold what wheat and grains were available until it raised in price even more, reaching near 5000% by 1864 after which it spurned to 9000% during the last year of the war. Yes those are thousand percent interest rates, and items such as coffee and bacon were quite literally at 9000% by the wars end. (Bacon was an important staple in 19th Century life because of it's fat content.)

Thus a vicious cycle was born: Families could often barely sustain themselves without the paternal figure of the household yet they were expected to produce sustenance for the Confederate Army. Those who did produce for the Army were then payed in sums which had no competition with the rising inflation, thus they had to try to sustain themselves all the while being worked, figuratively while sometimes literally, like a mule to the point of exhaustion and death. This cycle grew larger, faster, and more vicious each time it returned.

While the Southerners were being picked and prodded like cattle by the CSA Government, they were often at the whims of Union Armies and their smaller components. As with any war the invading Army often used the cities and towns they approached and occupied, often for months at a time, remember this was a slow war compared to modern wars. When Union supply lines were destroyed or running low they would often use what was in the house/town/city they were occupying as a their personal kitchen pantry and alcohol cellar. (Some commanders prevented this, some turned a blind eye, some instigated it.) This was a process that occurred throughout the war on both sides, but as the situation for food and supplies worsened the war also entered it's more southern phase thus putting the brunt of the Union Armies needs on families and towns which struggled themselves. I believe at one point near the end of the war, I believe it was some time near spring 1864, Generals and field commanders would instruct their soldiers to not leave anything that would be of use to the confederate war effort. This often entailed a complete destruction of grain stores, cattle, and anything such as guns and jewelry which the soldiers wanted. (I'm not informed of the nature of it, but I assume that there were instances of rape/murder among the occupied areas. 

Sherman's March is, well it's Sherman's March. There have been countless pieces written covering every aspect of it. Did Sherman sadistically burn most of his way to the sea while there were citizens inside? No. For the most part Sherman gave the towns/cities advance notice of their approach and informed the larger and strategic ones to evacuate because he was going to burn it down. I think he gave Atlanta two or three warnings and wait 3 days, but a CSA leader said not to evacuate the city was impenetrable or something similar. Georgians as a whole were told to stay put and fight, which made the situations worse upon themselves. Smaller towns and nonstrategic cities were often just pillaged as Sherman had no supply lines on the March.


An anecdote that should be noted as that both the North and the South participated in the pillaging process and the treatment of prisoners, so some of the actions taken were retaliatory; also of note is that the first phase of the war was initially fought outside the deep south, primarily border states and northern states so southerners often knew little of what occured and what the south did to the north, which was as equally disturbing.


Was southern life bad during the last year? No doubt, but as bad as some say it was? I'll let you decide.",null,2,cdnpoal,1rindw,askhistorians,top_week,11
seangt12345,"The South had a great deal of suffering because of their horrible economic conditions, which was then compounded when Sherman came through and committed ""total war,"" especially in Georgia and South Carolina. The stories of raping and pillaging had some truth to them, but they were greatly exaggerated in many cases. Sherman left many houses like the Henderson House in Dallas, GA stand along with many others. David Williams that teaches at Valdosta State University in Georgia wrote an article about women who rioted for food and supplies because inflation was so bad. The Confederate Government was also not reigning in the Planter class or speculation because those people ran the government. A judge from Paulding County named W.A. Foster wrote a county history for Paulding and according to the sources he used prices for boots, coats, and pants were into the hundreds of dollars. Meat was non-existent in markets. Bacon was $916 a pound. All in May of 1864. These prices would be absurd for us in 2013 so you can imagine what this looked like to the citizens in 1864. Now when Sherman came through he did burn and destroy a lot, and many people who had fled their homes to avoid the fighting came back to nothing heading into the winter of 1864. Citizens were suffering greatly but this was a combination of internal issues along with Sherman marching into the south.

Moving on, you'll sometimes hear that the primary offense of the Sodomites was a failure of *hospitality* - not of homosexuality. While this is absolutely a crucial part of  the narrative, *how* they violated these norms matters a great deal. The particular nature of their (attempted) violation is perhaps double transgressive: it was, of course, against *angels* – those who, in a way, are more exalted than humans...not the other way around, obviously. Also, as the other ANE laws seem to consider same-sex rape to be particularly shameful, this might have been considered to contribute to the gravity of their offense (also, in Egyptian mythology, see Set's sexual violation of Horus, where it's said that he has ""done a man's deed to him,"" shaming him).

Of course, in early Jewish interpretation, the story of Sodom is indeed clearly singled out for the attempted homosexual offense. This is evidenced in Jubilees 16.5f and Philo, *De Abr*. 133f., among other places (quotations of both these found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1g787l/sodom_and_gomorrah_went_after_other_flesh_jude_17/cahsl71)). This is also most likely the perspective taken up in the New Testament itself - the epistle of Jude reads that ""Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities. . . indulged in sexual immorality (ἐκπορνεύσασαι) and went after other flesh."" There is a strong connection with these other traditions - and I've written at some length about all this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1g787l/sodom_and_gomorrah_went_after_other_flesh_jude_17/cahsl71).

There have been allegations that the relationship of David and Jonathan was homoerotic. I'm honestly not very familiar with the issue, though there have been quite a few studies of it in recent years: Heacock 2011; Harding 2011; Williamson 2011. Ackerman 2005 was basically an entire monograph dedicated to it.

Next, we come up against Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians (specifically, 1 Corinthians 6:9). Here we have a classic ""vice list"" - or, rather, a list of types of people who engage in unrighteous acts: ""thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers,"" etc. An enormous amount of ink has been spilled on two of the named types here: in Greek, *malakoi* and *arsenokoitai* (for relevant scholarship, see Wright 1984; Petersen 1986; Wright 1987). It's perhaps easier to start with the latter first. This term, *arsenokoitai*, in fact [appears to be a Pauline neologism](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1c2yap/pauls_neologisms_in_1_cor_69_arsenokoitai_male/c9d95rg), and is composed of two elements: *arsen*, which means 'male', and *koitē*, which means 'bed' - and, together, ""bedder of men."" But this word actually connects back to the Levitical laws, mentioned earlier. The earliest Christians used the *Greek* translation of the Hebrew Bible (the Septuagint); and in the relevant laws on homosexuality, we also see these two words together (*arsenos koitēn*, Leviticus 20:13). So Paul appears to have coined this neologism based on Septuagint Leviticus. 

But of course a very long time had passed since the original writing of Leviticus, and Paul's time. Different time, different culture. One question is ['*what sort of act or configuration did Paul understand the Levitical law to signify*](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1i3wiu/pauls_terms_for_homosexual_practice_in_1/)?'.

The other term that Paul uses, *malakoi*, is also problematic. Its root, μαλακός, has a range of meanings, from ""soft"" to ""sick,"" etc. I've argued before that, with Paul's consecutive use of *arsenokoitai* and *malakoi*, he [intends to respectively refer to the passive and active male partners of a homosexual act](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1i3wiu/pauls_terms_for_homosexual_practice_in_1/). However, I think it's entirely possible that, with the ""active"" partner, Paul meant to refer to the *erastēs* - the pederast, who he viewed as engaged in an *exploitative* institution. But this was an institution that obviously had legitimacy in the Greek world. In order for the passive partner to be ethically ""culpable,"" this would obviously have to require some degree of *consent*. There's ample precedent for the criticism of this passive partner - as being sort of ""overeager"" to please - for example by Paul's Hellenistic Jewish contemporary, Philo of Alexandria.

One of the less ambiguous passages that addresses homosexuality can be found in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. Quoting from NASB:

&gt;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness. . .God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.",null,0,cdns1im,1riuwq,askhistorians,top_week,17
narwhal_,"It can be a bit tricky to understand what makes someone a historian vs a theologian, the reason being there are historical disciplines within theology. Effectively what you would call a historian of the Bible will often be titled as a professor of theology, and will often speak of themselves as such, despite having identical (if not far more intensive) training in history than those otherwise called historians. The task here, in terms of identifying history related credentials, is unfortunately obscure without looking more closely into someones background than their titles; viz. that they be in sub-fields related to Biblical Studies.

In terms of your question, the matter has less to do with a consensus by historians regarding what the Bible says about homosexuality, and far more to do with the creation of disciplines like psychology/psychiatry which, from my understanding, is where the current conception of sexuality comes from.


By current conception of sexuality I mean a somewhat bimorphic ""sexual orientation."" The Bible in it's original context, and it's interpretation until this concept emerged was unencumbered by such a notion, and the extend to which it is imposed on the text actually imparts a worse reading on today's reader than a reader would have had of the text in the Middle Ages. 

To oversimplify things a bit, historians can't really work with modern categories on this issue because it is anachronistic. To ask, historically, whether or not the Bible is for or against homosexuality is akin to asking if the Jesus was a feminist. This isn't a question that really fits into the historical study, since it requires a leap in terms of interpretation and equating of concepts unavailable to a historian ...in this case, it is actually the theologians that need to parse such things out.


A historical question, and one that's come up here not infrequently, is how the understanding of homosexuality has evolved, including through ancient/biblical times and you might find other threads which cover that.",null,0,cdnrma2,1riuwq,askhistorians,top_week,7

(There's plenty of literature out there are this regarding the evolution of thought about LGBT sexuality out there.)

Celebreth,"Alrighty, 'cause I just noticed this thread, I'm going to go ahead and do a writeup on this. I'm going to try to address all of the questions already asked in the body, so bear with me (barring the question that's outside the purview of my specialty). 

First, I'm going to confirm a simple fact. Roman soldiers were not allowed to get married. That changed depending on rank, but the rank and file were not legally allowed to get married - so there weren't any wives at home that had to get that painful letter (for the standard legionaries). However, men are men, and people are people- and the vast majority of the time a legion was just garrisoned in a province. People in that situation, naturally, develop relationships, and those relationships were tactfully ignored by the officers, who totally understood the situation these men were in. They weren't allowed to get married, but they WERE in love - the great rock and hard place argument :) The thing about being in the Legion (I'm assuming we're talking about the Principate here - that would be ca. 0-300ish CE) was that once you were in, it was a 25 year commitment. While you got great benefits, those 25 years could be hard on a man - especially when that man wanted a family. So, the natural solution? ""Civil unions."" 

Those civil unions were essentially the same as marriage, just without any of the legal entitlements that they would otherwise have- so pretty much, it was marriage. Just without the government recognition. Confusing, eh? :)

One big issue with this was that many of the women that the Romans took to wife were natives of the area they were garrisoned in, or even former slaves (The soldier would buy them and promptly free them). Those families would, of course, also go on to have children - and those children called themselves ""*in castris*"" - or ""born in  the camp."" They generally went on to join the military, just like their parents, and there's a tombstone outside the fortress of *Legio II Augusta* that commemorates a woman, her soldier son, and her husband. The monument itself was erected by her daughter. 

However...the unfortunate bit is that there are always those damn legalities. We have evidence of seven cases that deemed children born during their father's terms of service to be ""illegitimate."" Didn't matter if they were citizens or anything - if they were in the legions or *auxilia*, that child had no claim to be the heir of their father, his will, etc. Same with the wives - except the wives *also* couldn't get their dowries back (Legal wives could). 

Now, on to the husband dying! It's hard to say exactly how they were informed - however, if they were one of these quasi-wives, it would have fallen to the man's tent group (*contubernium*) - who would have known about the quasi-marriage - to let the woman know. The wives either lived right outside the fort in the *canabae*, or even in the room with the rest of the *contubernium*. A quick note here - privacy wasn't such a huge deal until recently, most especially regarding situations with large families (All in one room) or in these cases (8 men in one crowded room - it would have been relatively common for at least one to have a woman in there with him). 

I do want to stress though (regarding another question in this thread) that the legionaries still maintained strong family ties with both their quasi-wives and their ""illegitimate"" children. The vast majority of tombstones near military encampments are commemorations by the wife or ""unrelated heirs"" (coughchildrencough). We have multiple declarations by these soldiers declaring these children to be their heirs, the children are explicitly mentioned in the wills, and provided for them. As for notifying family (such as parents, siblings, etc), I have no source on that one - I can only speculate that the *contubernum* would send a letter to them as well.

---

Finally, onto one last question that was addressed - ""Could officers and commanders be married?"" The answer to that is **yes....ish.** The senatorial and equestrian officers were certainly allowed to be married. Legionary centurions were also exempt, however, we have no sources regarding the auxiliary centurions or the decurions - we can *assume* that they would also be exempt, but it's no guarantee. Their wives and children would also have accompanied them, but they (The senators and equestrians, at least - the centurions could and did) were forbidden from marrying *local* women. The senatorial and equestrian officers also spent far less time in the military - it was generally just a step in their career. 

Now, finally, on to what happened when a soldier died! One of the (many) deductions from the soldier's pay was a contribution to a ""burial fund"" that was organized per century. It wasn't much - it would only cover the costs for a basic funeral - but it was something. I'll go ahead and just quote straight from Goldsworthy for the next bit:

&gt; A funeral procession, carrying the corpse on a couch, would leave the fort or camp, for like many contemporary societies the Romans insisted that burial take place outside the settlement. Once outside, and often on a site running alongside the main road leading to the fort, the corpse would be laid on the couch on top of a funeral pyre, There it would be burnt and, once consumed by the flames the ash of both corpse and pyre gathered into a funerary urn, made sometimes of marble or metal, but most often of glass or pottery, which was then buried. Around the grave site the mourners took part in a funeral banquet.

&gt; [...] The chief mourners were a man's comrades and, as the practice of taking an unofficial wife became widespread, his family. It is doubtful that the burial club paid for more than the most rudimentary of markers for the grave, but many soldiers set aside money to pay for expensive stone monuments. Many tombstones state that they were erected by a man's heirs in accordance with his will. 

I sincerely hope that helps :) If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask them!

Seabasser,"To go a bit more specifically into what /u/TurdFergusonIII mentioned:

The New York City vowels might have been influenced by Yiddish (see work by Labov); we also see more Yiddish lexical items and syntactic forms in New York City speech than in other areas (*schlep*, *schmata*, *Enough already*, *Now this, I like*, etc.). Likewise, New Orleans has a good deal of Cajun lexical items. 

The absence of mass media wouldn't really have an effect either way- the effect of TV on people's spoken language in marginal (with some nifty exceptions, see the work of Jane Stuart Smith on the influence of Cockney accents on the speech of Glaswegian teenagers who watch a lot of ""East Enders""). 

OTH, a (relative) lack of mobility compared to today helped: we're seeing a lot of traditional accents die out in, for example, Raleigh N.C., due to a large influx of speakers from the north (this does not mean the Raleigh doesn't still have a southern accent- it still has one, just not one that sounds as distinctly ""Southern"" as the one 50 years ago). 150-200 years ago, people were more isolated, which was more conducive to the formation of distinct dialects. (If you're familiar with evolutionary biology: if you stick a species on two sides of an impassable mountain, they'll diverge, eventually. If you don't, they won't, at least, not as much.

Your point about immigrant populations is most relevant. Particular immigrant groups tend to settle in particular locations, and facets of their native languages (perhaps already varieties of English) influenced the dialects that developed in those places; e.g. Yiddish-speaking Jews in and around NYC, French-speakers in Louisiana, Germans around the Midwest and Scots-Irish in Appalachia.

All current evidence builds a picture of *Homo Sapiens* existing for ~200,000 years, transitioning from small hunter-gatherer communities and nomads to the development of agriculture, animal domestication and eventual industry. It's telling of our lack of understanding of human prehistory when we can't be 100% sure when ""modern"" humans began, and events of only a few thousand years ago have already descended into myth and legend, let alone hundreds of thousands.

If metal tools or similar were found at a site or geologic age our current explanations would say is impossible, that would require some rethinking of our timeline. But currently an overwhelming amount of evidence points to the current picture of human existence being correct.",null,27,cdnwwlh,1rj3ri,askhistorians,top_week,171
coffeeinvenice,"Not a professional historian, but a background in earth science, and it's occurred to me as an intriguing possibility as well. To put it simply:

1. As Vincenti points out, there's just no evidence.

2. It's possible that it happened, but no archaeological evidence has been found yet. With advances in archaeological techniques, this is increasingly unlikely. Even in Geology, it's been possible to demonstrate ice age events as far back as 650 million years ago.

3. To the best of my recollection, there haven't been any ""lost"" civilizations. Every civilization has passed on some elements of its culture to subsequent cultures, or evidence of its culture, whether they had cities or not. Even the Minoans and Indus Valley civilizations seem to have left some trace of their existence in Mycenaean (sp?) culture and Egyptian historical records, and in Dravidian cultures respectively.

4. Let's assume for the sake of argument that ""vanished"", pre-10,000 years BP civilizations could have developed and subsequently disappeared with all evidence gone; we'll call these ""Group A"" civilizations. Given that every civilization since the end of the last ice age (let's call these ""Group B"" civilizations) has left at least some trace of their culture in subsequent cultures, one would have to provide a plausible explanation why the Group A civilizations disappeared without a trace and the Group Bs did not. 

It's intriguing to think that the last interglacial, the Eemian, lasted from 130,000 YBP to 114,000 YBP, with a climate closely resembling the current climate. During that 16,000 year interglacial Homo Sapiens could have gone from the Neolithic to the Space Age, but there is absolutely no evidence of any civilization during that period.",null,16,cdo073k,1rj3ri,askhistorians,top_week,78
cahamarca,"This is a great question because we know so little about the distant, pre-human past.  Humans have been on the planet for such a short amount of time, only a few geological seconds, that it's quite compelling to imagine another species arose to high technology long ago, and snuffed itself out a few thousand years later only to be forgotten by the world.  

In fact I asked [this very question on AskScience last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14brvw/are_we_sure_humans_were_the_first_animal_on_earth/) and got a lively response.  From what I learned there and elsewhere since, I think we should break the question up into several questions: 

**Could another, now-vanished Earth species have developed...**

**...space-aged technology?**  No.  We would have encountered their remaining artificial satellites in orbit when we first put ours up, and found geological layers with clear evidence of nuclear testing.  Imagine if the Apollo program had encountered a 100-million-year-old lunar lander and flag when they visited the Moon!

**...modern metalworking and industrial technology?**  Again, no.  It seems perfectly certain we would have encountered some material evidence; some middens with million-year-old steel and copper wiring or something, even if it was just a few screws in ancient rock.

**...agriculture?** Maybe. Ants developed [fungus cultivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-fungus_mutualism) some sixty-five million years ago, which is arguably a form of agriculture.  In fact, when hymenoptera like bees and ants began living in colonies millions of years ago, they hit a new level of social complexity that the mammals only matched very recently through us.  Wilson and Holldobler's *The Ants* describe how this form of ""ant civilization"" allowed them to basically take over the world, displacing non-social insects to the fringes of ecosystems. 

**...symbolic, tool-building cultures like Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals?** This is within the realm of possibility, for sure.  There's no evidence, but on the time scales we're talking about here (millions and millions of years), it's not clear there ever *could* be surviving evidence.  The one fact working against such hypothetical bursts of human-like culture seems to be this: no candidates in the fossil record for a species with suitable cranial capacity to approach large-brained ""human-level"" cultural traditions.  

However, that's possibly a limitation of the fossil record.  As a matter of historical fact, an ancient cephalopod species that developed language, composed poems, went to war, and made tools would be invisible to us because they leave no skeletons.  It's compelling to think how much history we still may not know about!",null,2,cdo1yym,1rj3ri,askhistorians,top_week,51

400-Rabbits,"There's numerous problematic assumptions to your question, the first of which being that fossils, though relatively scarce, are still recovered from a wide variety of times and places to form a coherent genealogy of humanity. 

That's not really what you are asking though, is it? You want to know if anatomically modern humans (AMH) developed sedentary agricutural societies prior to the [Neolithic Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution). In that case, looking at human fossils is a moot point, what you should be looking at is palynologic and genetic evidence of the crops which would have allowed the the existence of large groups of sedentary groups, and in this the evidence is simply not there. Simply put, you may speculate that humans were neurologically complex enough to create complex agricultural societies, but the evidence of domestication of a staple crop like wheat [argues](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/311/5769/1886.short) [against](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/278/5341/1312.short) this proposition. If you are asking about the probability of ancient societies existing on the same pattern that we now call ""civilizations,"" replete with dense settlements supported by intensive agriculture, then the botanical evidence is against you.

The other problem is that while soil and burial conditions may make preservation of bones less than optimal, the preservation of tools is less bound by those rules. The archaeological record, right now, traces an evolution from simple stone choppers in Oldowan Africa up until sophisticated micro-blades in Neolithic Eurasia. For some sort of complex civilization to have existed outside this evolutionary toolset they would have had to diverge from it while also leaving not a single trace of a lithic toolkit outside of what is already known. Furthermore, they would have had to avoid leaving evidence of the work they did with those tools in the form of other shaped objects, anthropogenic landscapes, and artistic works associated with this advanced toolset.

Bones can tell a fascinating story of an individual, or even a species. Civilizations, however, leave a multitude of evidence beyond the remains of their actors. They leave evidence of the tools used to create objects, the objects themselves, the foods they ate, and the areas they manipulated to support their societies. There are multiple lines of evidence supporting the mainstream interpretation of human evolution and the development of complex sedentary societies. These lines of evidence actually militate against contrary interpretations, because such an interpretation would require extraordinary evidence contradictory with regards to tools and crops. Even structure that decay away leave evidence of their construction in the form of exploitation of land, caches of tools, and foundations/post-holes. 

So no, there is zero evidence for what you are suggesting, and multiple lines of evidence arguing against it.",null,2,cdo1vn5,1rj3ri,askhistorians,top_week,22
oglach,"There's some indication of civilisations more advanced than we expected, definitely. But there's nothing to suggest we'd ever find a highly developed civilisation like the Atlantis myth, for example. 

My own country, Ireland, for example, has deep evidence for an advanced early civilisation. Ireland is home to several structures that far predate more famous structures like the Pyramids and were built with techniques we formerly considered to be from Greco-Roman innovation. Newgrange in Meath predates any standing structure in Greece, Italy, or Egypt by around nearly a millenia, and Stonehenge by several centuries, and uses architectural styles supposedly unknown until the Greeks came around over a thousand years later. Scotland, which was likeky inhabited by a culturally similar people, also has several such monuments. 

Later Irishmen looked upon Newgrange and similar sites with wonder, by the time writing and literacy came around they were already mysterious ancient sites. There's no solid information about who built these sites or how. 

So there's that element out there. Certainly Ireland and Britain were home to advanced civilisation long before literacy was around to record them. I think that's not just plausible, it's a given. How this was all forgotten and lost and the Irish essentially devolved from that ancient civilisation to the tribal society seen by the Romans is still a mystery. 

It may also be noted in a similar vein that when the Norse went journeying around seemingly unknown places like Iceland in the middle ages, they found Irish people living there. That Iceland was not only known of to the Irish, but already explored and settled, seems to imply an older knowledge of the area. But of course that's just a theory.

henkiedepenkie,"There is a significant school of thought that posits that although anatomically modern humans emerged around 200.000 years ago, they only reached behavioral modernity around 50.000 years ago. The latter may include language, art, complex tools etc. Assuming that civilization building is only possible for modern humans, this limits the time frame for possible 'lost' civilizations considerably. 

If you further hold that agriculture is a requirement (as brought forward elsewhere in this thread), which came into its own over the last 12.000 years or so, you are further limiting the possible window. And in fact over the last 12.000 years we have evidence of many societies, so those would not be considered lost. ",null,0,cdo3rpl,1rj3ri,askhistorians,top_week,6
atomfullerene,"As for your second question, signs of human civilizations, whether now or in 1700, will be easily detectable 200,000 years from now and less easily detectable for millions or potentially billions of years after that.  We have fossils of stromatolites (sediment filled algae mats and pillars) from 3 billion years ago that are basically just funny shaped rocks.  Humans produce _lots_ of funny shaped rocks, and finding, eg, a series of cobblestones that had become buried would be a telltale sign of civilization.  So would the bizzare jumbling of plant and animal life, when species suddenly spread all over the world in the fossil record due to humans moving them around.  We've definitely made our mark, which will remain even after the last building crumbles.",null,4,cdo0ag1,1rj3ri,askhistorians,top_week,8
Spoonfeedme,"Vincenti makes some excellent points as to why it is very unlikely. There are two real reasons why that is the case. The first is the lack of artifacts. Not only tools, but structures, monuments, and more. There is some work being done to search areas that were once above sea-level that are now under water, but of course, this is difficult. What artifacts we do have suggest a progressive advancement, and our timeline really runs for tens of thousands of years. We not only have pretty good evidence about the spread of homo-sapiens (limiting our search to areas that were inhabited by them) but also a pretty good idea about the spread of tool use and technology in general.

But that's not all. We also have access to genetics to help answer this question. One to look at is our ability to continue to metabolize lactose, a development that occured in the last 10,000 years. This has been shown to increase health generally among the population who have the mutations required, so it doesn't make sense for it to have appeared than disappeared again. Another is crops. Thanks to genetic analysis, we have a pretty good idea as to when crops were domesticated (and animals as well). Without domesticated crops, you aren't going to have an advanced urban society, and without that urban society, you aren't going to have the specialization of labour that helped spur other advancements.

In short, we have no evidence that an earlier advance society existed, and lots of evidence that suggests it didn't.",null,2,cdo0db3,1rj3ri,askhistorians,top_week,5
websnarf,"I'll answer your second question first, since it is trivial and hopefully will help illuminate the rest.  In 1 million years, there will be *AMPLE* evidence of our current (ca 2013) existence, even if we were to be decimated tomorrow.  The reason is because we have spread to nearly the entire surface of the earth, and we have constructed gargantuan artificial structures (sky scrapers, dams, roads, railways, Great Wall of china, etc) that even the worst erosion would leave significant remnants of.

So it's simple, we've left a multi-million year semi-permanent mark on the surface of the earth with our activity on the planet so far.  There's some question as to exactly how many millions of years our mark would remain, but I would guess in the hundreds of millions of years range.

So working backwards now, could there have been some really advanced civilization that existed long ago that is just outside of our archaeological range?  Well, one thing we can be sure of is that we know for sure that they didn't leave significant marks lasting more than 200,000 years spread throughout the world.  So such a hidden society being as advanced as we currently are, is basically impossible.

If you read [""Guns, Germs and Steel""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel) by Jared Diamond, he explains that agriculture is dependent on many things.  But two stand out in this case: Geography and Climate.  Modern Homo sapiens are as advanced as we are today because agriculture arose simultaneously in the middle east, indus Valley, China, mesopotamia and the Andes about 11,000 years ago.  The reason is because the ice age had ended and those locations are host to pre-cereal grasses that lead to the domestication of wheat, barley, rice and corn.

In other words, if you think such a thing may have happened earlier, you need to solve the crop domestication geography problem and the ice age problem.  There was another opportunity between 100,000 and 130,000 years ago (when again, there was a warm ""interstadial"").  And indeed it was a genuine opportunity.  Fossil remains show that homo sapiens were in the Levant area of the middle east and Indus valley at this time.  When you take soil samples, you can not only find fossilized bones, but fossilized plant remains (and even [coprolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolite)).  So you can estimate plant populations.  So far, no archaeology has revealed any older agricultural societies in either of these areas (or anywhere else.)  Keep in mind that we *have* detected proto-farming societies in the Levant area between 14700 and 12800 years ago during a very brief warm period called the Bolling Aelerod interstadial.  So its not like I am presenting a fake technique that has never yielded results.

And that's it.  Prior warm periods (interstadials) predate the existence of Homo sapiens.  Of course, remember, we were all surprised to find the [Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis).  They, of course, fail to meet your criteria because they were an offshoot of Homo erectus that was not on the Homo sapien line.  But it points out that there may be remote areas on the earth that we have not visited at all, and may be hiding ancient human populations.

So that remains the only possibility.  Some hidden pocket of land which, for some reason, modern man has neglected to explore, was somehow reachable by ancient Homo sapiens, and which is host to domesticatable proto-cereal crops.  I don't think there are a lot of candidates for this, unless the place is currently under water.  So I'm going to say this possibility is extremely remote (less than 1% chance).

adimwit,"For the most part, it was the economic hardship that facilitated support for Fascistic groups. The countries that went Fascist first were countries that had immediate instability after the war. It wasn't until the Great Depression that other countries began to experiment with corporatism. But there were other reasons for Fascist support as well. For the midde class, it was an alternative to Communism which would have completely destroyed their lives. For the lower classes, it was a nationalistic form of socialism that sought to expand workers rights.

In Italy, Fascism was a cooperative class system whereas the Communists wanted to completely eliminate (violently) the upper classes. The Communists wanted a violent revolution to topple the existing system, and, early on, the Socialists supported this. By 1922, the Socialists realized that Bolshevism in Russia was a disaster and they split from the Communists. Some of these Socialists would go on to support Fascism since, as a cooperative class system, it would expand labor rights.

In Germany, unlike much of the rest of the world, the people would remain fervently militaristic and patriotic. They believed they won the war but were betrayed by divisionists. As a result, many people blamed the Weimar Republic for the Versailles Treaty and the indignity and hardship it wrought. This played into the Nazi's platform and Germans supported the group that promised to restore their honor. If you ever read about the Hitler's Putsch in Bavaria, both sides (except Hitler) did not really expect the people to rise up and join the Nazis, but they actually did. If the Nazis didn't flee so soon, they probably would have established a Nazi state in Bavaria.

[Soviet nuclear attack plans](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563692/Soviet-plan-for-WW3-nuclear-attack-unearthed.html).

In the same author's book, he describes [Buria](http://books.google.ch/books?id=lpuVTw50-88C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Petr+Lunak+soviet+plans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AiffX0MiRY&amp;sig=PSqeegeOho3Do0Q6PubPr_27vcA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=prOVUtP3EqGr0QXBnYGQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y), one of many Soviet ""exercises"" and plans for an invasion of Western Europe.

There were also specific plans for a takeover of West Berlin, notably it was to be accepted that NVA units would take heavy casualties in what was to be pretty much a frontal assault.  The main plan involved setting up 12 administrative districts in the city after it was taken. The fake city of Scholzenlust was created as a training facility to represent a ""fake"" West Berlin - [these authors argue](http://books.google.ch/books?id=DN9KJ7VvQWIC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;ots=bPtU4saBap&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=scholzenlust+nva) that Warsaw Pact forces made some pretty bad assumptions about their probability of success.

Note that this very nearly happened, pretty much by dumbshit bad luck, during the tank standoff in 1961 - a quick escalation of armor buildup at several checkpoints between East and West Berlin, the reason for which is still disputed (probably a massive misunderstanding).  Intensive diplomacy led to first a Soviet tank, then an US tank, then a Soviet tank, etc., withdrawing, in a manner in which all could save face.

Just to keep things fair, [""Operation Unthinkable""](http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/index.php/operation-unthinkable.html) was Churchill's plan for an invasion of Eastern Europe via Poland, and NATO has pretty consistently maintained training for limited offensive responses (plus a few pre-emptive strikes into Warsaw Pact territory) as part of its contingency training routine.

The fake city of Scholzenlust was created as a training facility to represent a ""fake"" West Berlin - [these authors argue](http://books.google.ch/books?id=DN9KJ7VvQWIC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;ots=bPtU4saBap&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=scholzenlust+nva) that Warsaw Pact forces made some pretty bad assumptions about their probability of success.

Note that this very nearly happened, pretty much by dumbshit bad luck, during the tank standoff in 1961 - a quick escalation of armor buildup at several checkpoints between East and West Berlin, the reason for which is still disputed (probably a massive misunderstanding).  Intensive diplomacy led to first a Soviet tank, then an US tank, then a Soviet tank, etc., withdrawing, in a manner in which all could save face.

Just to keep things fair, [""Operation Unthinkable""](http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/index.php/operation-unthinkable.html) was Churchill's plan for an invasion of Eastern Europe via Poland, and NATO has pretty consistently maintained training for limited offensive responses (plus a few pre-emptive strikes into Warsaw Pact territory) as part of its contingency training routine.

farquier,"The language, as you yourself note, is Hurrian, a non-semitic language related only to the even more obscure and poorly understood Urartian language, albeit with Babylonian loanwords pertaining to technical terms(just as English uses many Italian loanwords in its technical musical vocabulary). More broadly, the ""Sucession of Languages and Civilizations"" model is at best an attractive oversimplification, and this is a good example why. It is true that the Hurrian Hymns are not from within the ""Hurrian"" heartland in the Khabur valley and perhaps dated to after the Babylonians had conquered much of the of the Khabur valley but that does not mean there were no Hurrians or Hurrian states elsewhere. People did not just stay in the same region all the time; they moved around from place to place. In fact, even in the time period when the Hurrian Hymn was written, there were several Hurrian or predominantly Hurrian states such as Arrapha and the Mitanni empire, which were important enough to produce Hurrian-language correspondence found in the Armana archive. And the circulation of texts in many languages in various centers is quite normal; the Armana correspondence for example contains letters in Akkadian, Hittite, and Hurrian and Ugarit has produced texts in Akkadian(, Sumerian(which at this point had long since died as a spoken language but which was still an important language of literature and culture), Hurrian, and Luwian.  It is also true that they contain dedications to ""Semitic"" gods, but gods could and did circulate among multiple cultures. The Hittite pantheon is a spectacularly extreme example of this, containing pre-Hittite Anatolian gods(the Storm-god of Nerik, Indo-European gods, Hurrian god, and even various Mesopotamian gods. The later phases of the Hittite myths are so throughly influenced by Hurrian myth that Hittite myth is sometimes called Hittite-Hurrian myth In fact, it is quite possible that the semitic name Nikkal comes from the Sumerian name Ningal(such borrowings are amply recorded, most famously the fact that the hebrew word ""heikal"" comes from Sumerian É.GAL via Akkadian Ekallum).

Georgy_K_Zhukov,"There are really two questions here, one answered with fact and one opinion. The first one, I believe, is fairly obvious in its answer. Marshal Zhukov was a phenomenal military leader, and an instrumental part in Soviet victory over Germany in World War II (bet you didn't see that one coming!). 

Name a major Soviet victory during the war, and Zhukov probably had his fingers in it. Prior to the war he repulsed the Japanese at Khalkhin Gol, which played a major part in ensuring the Japanese remained neutral towards the Soviet Union. Once Germany invaded, he played key roles in the defenses of Moscow and of Leningrad. The encirclement at Stalingrad. The reaction and offensive at Kursk. Bagration. Berlin. You'd be hard pressed to find any general with such a string of victories to his name. Even in his failures, which were few, he still managed to shine, leading one of the most successful delaying actions during the initial German offensive, and his one true defeat, Operation Mars, still being fiercely debated as to whether it was intended as a diversion which took a bit to many losses, or if it was the main offensive which failed.

Point is, he totally deserved the nickname Marshal of Victory. But, that is really only half the question. It is one thing to say he was a military genius rivaled by few others. The other question though is whether he was the line between victory and defeat. Whether the Soviets only won because he was there. And no matter how much appreciation I have for the man, I don't believe that to be the case. The Soviets had other great leaders. Rokossovsky especially comes to mind, but he is only one of a number of leaders who could have filled the void left by Zhukov.

I'd hardly go so far as to say Soviet victory was always inevitable, but especially with the aid rendered by the Western Allies through Lend-Lease, the Soviet Military was a force to be reckoned with, and it is frankly hard to imagine the Germans being able to win against them, even if the leadership had gone down a peg. The Soviets certainly were stretched in their resources, especially manpower (contrary to the popular image of it being a limitless pool), but I'm not a believer in the Great Man theory, and I simply can't endorse the idea that one man was the line between victory and defeat, even if it was a man such as Zhukov.",null,1,cdnwxso,1rjbxs,askhistorians,top_week,11
Nai24,"General Georgy Zhukov is almost universally agreed upon as being the leader in the Soviet Unions defense, and eventual offensive against Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Fellow Allied Generals (and famous in their own right) Bernard Montgomery of the United Kingdom and Dwight Eisenhower both recognized Zhukov's contributions as being pivotal not only on the Eastern Front but as being a key to the eventual victory of the Allies in the war.

As a military leader, Zhukov was a crucial tactician in some of the largest and strategically important battles, both offensive and defensive, of the entire war. These include:

* General Chief of Staff during the Red Army's defense of the German invasion (Operation Barbarossa).
*Commander of the Reserve Front during the Yelnya Offensive. 
*Commanded the successful defense of Leningrad. 
*Ordered the crucial counter-offensive during the Battle of Moscow, leading to Germany's first defeat in a large scale battle involving over 1 million soldiers.

These examples are what General Zhukov was able to achieve in a single year alone, 1941. The following years, Zhukov went on to lead the Red Army in some of the largest battles ever fought in the history of warfare. This includes:

*The 1942 counteroffensive during the Battle of Stalingrad, also known as Operation Uranus.
*The 1943 breaking of the Germany siege during the Battle of Leningrad, also known as Operation Iskra. These actions, and the eventual liberation of Leningrad through the Leningrad-Novgorod Strategic Offensive led to Zhukov being made Marshal of the Soviet Union.

Zhukov went on to lead many more successful campaigns (Kiev, Vistula, Berlin to name a few). When one looks at all of his accomplishments (not only their importance to the Eastern Front, but to the war as a whole), it can be argued that General Georgy Zhukov may have been the most important, successful and/or influential military leader on the Eastern Front, if not the entire Second World War.

gingerkid1234,"Most cities with mass transit systems had some sort of addition planned, and usually provision was made in existing systems for it that was never made.  My expertise is in Boston, but other cities have done the same (New York and the now-resumed Second Avenue Subway is a famous example).

Boston's older subways were built in the early 1900s, as an effort to improve traffic by moving streetcars into tunnels, and later on to connect streetcars with rapid transit.  As the system grew, plans were made to expand the system in ways that didn't always happen.  There's the beginning of a tunnel from the Green Line to the financial district that was never used in any project.  Because building tunnels is expensive, it's usually cheaper to build in the start of an expansion even if one isn't really on the table yet.  There's the start of another tunnel in the same area to the South End, but that was once used, but is now closed.  Other examples of similar age are the start of a longer tunnel under Huntington Ave.  What's now the Green Line E branch starts in a tunnel, but moves to a median.  The tunnel was gradually lengthened.  For quite a while, the tunnel actually continued somewhat further, to make it easier to extend--the tracks were on an elevated bridge of sorts to surface level.

Later in the 20th century, planned extensions had segments built without completion.  Several of them were built only halfway.  Many of them have tracks designed to connect to the extension.  One, however, has an unused express track, which was going to provide express service to the never-built outer half of the line.  It's the Northern part of the Orange Line.

Rapid transit stations that were built and never used, or built but closed and are relics on the system, are fairly common.  They're called [ghost stations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_station).  Most of them are the second category, though--they were built, used, and closed later when expansion made them obsolete.",null,0,cdny5ng,1rjc1v,askhistorians,top_week,2

Beria went first. As g-gorilla-goriila notes Beria was promoting a political line that the more conservative members (like Molotov) of the Politburo were opposed to.

Beria's position was a bit weak - he didn't have much of a base outside the security apparatus, and that had been shaken up a bit prior to Stalin's death so its possible he didn't have all his old power any more.

Without Beria, Malenkov became vulnerable. Malenkov was targetted for promoting consumer goods production. From memory part of this attack was premised on the idea that there was a housing shortage, and hence there were more pressing concerns. Malenkov like Beria didn't have a particularly strong base in the party machinery - he had been closely tied to Stalin, then to Beria... now he had no backup. So minus Beria and Malenkov, Khrushchev was the last one left standing.

Khrushchev's power base seems to have been in the lower ranks of the party. Time and time again when challenged Khrushchev's strategy was to marshall the support of the rest of the Central Committee. He would also expand existing committees to make them more 'inclusive' (and thus diluting the power of the old guard) or he would bring in lower ranked members as observers to meetings (bit embarassing to pull a dirty trick when there are outsiders watch). This is also how Khrushchev was able to ward off the Anti-Party Group which was nominally a conservative grouping but had many people who just didn't like Khrushchev's leadership style.

Anyway, ""European culture"" is a bit difficult to apply to this period.  Going by the Kurgan model of Indo-European expansion (that is, out of Ukraine about 6,000 years ago, rather than Anatolia 10,000 years ago--David Anthony makes an excellent case using recently-available Russian archaeological studies for the former, though the latter has many adherents still), this is the general portrait of Europe at the time:

Farmers from Anatolia populate the Balkan Peninsula at this point.  They speak an Afro-Asiatic language (that is, the same family as Arabic) and have an economy centered on grain- and cow- and sheep-agriculture.  They live in large villages, often fortified, and work copper and bronze.  They have their warriors and their quarrels.  They tend to replace rather than convert to farming the local hunter-gatherers--there are likely completely different ethnolinguistic groups in North-western and Western Europe, but they will be mostly wiped out by the coming tide of farmers and herders.  The Proto-Indo-European language and culture has been born in Ukraine and has harnessed the horse to begin the establishment of a staunchly patriarchal culture centered on warrior-nobles with chariots and whose wealth is measured in herds of horses and cattle and sheep.  They will spread out into Europe and east into Asia soon--not so much in conquest as in cultural conversion, as people will join their society, hoping to strike it rich with very fruitful herds.  From this root will spring Homeric Greece and Vedic Central Asia.  

More warlike than Mesopotamia?  I'd really doubt it.  Mesopotamia is at this point is home to the world's first true Empires.  While the Indo-Europeans will give rise to a culture that overall can be described as generally warlike (in that gathering up your brother warriors into a gang and stealing your neighbor's herds is considered a rite of passage, and that warrior chiefs get buried with their weapons in the most elaborate tombs), it's really hard to say that they'd be more warlike or war-driven than, say, Sargon of Akkad.",null,0,cdnzg2t,1rjcq1,askhistorians,top_week,2

LIPCSB,"This would be more a matter for asking r/catholicism, given how much of it is rooted in theology, but the basics of Catholic sexual ethics owe a lot to the integration of Aristotelian, teleological thought on ""natural"" vs. ""unnatural"" into Catholic theology.  This became what is called ""Natural Law.""  Under this doctrine, any action taken that does not reflect God's will for the organs in question is sinful because it is going against God's intention.  It is, on the surface, a doctrine that most modern westerners would not agree with (for example, St. Thomas assembled a hierarchy of sexual sins in order of most-disordered to least-disordered--homosexuality and masturbation were just slightly less disordered than bestiality, while heterosexual incest was by his analysis of natural law much more ordered because it was more in line with the purposes of sexuality).  

So, if the purpose of a penis is to inseminate a vagina in order to cause egg fertilization, then any use of these organs for other reasons is wrong.  Masturbation is wrong because it is sexual pleasure outside what it was meant for--that is, the actual, creative sex act.  Contraceptives are wrong because they divorce the act of sexual intercourse from its creative purpose.  It's interference with God's will.  Even Natural Family Planning, if used with the intention of forever/indefinitely keeping a couple childless, is a grave sin in Church teaching.

It took a while for the general no-masturbation no-fornication no-non-standard-intercourse teachings inherited from a combination of old Jewish teaching and early Christian theology to expand to include contraceptives--but that's because easily-available contraceptives are a rather recent invention in Christendom.  

Paul was rather sexually conservative--though not excessively so by the standards of the early Church (Origen, 150 years later, would castrate himself in keeping with Christ's ""if your eye leads you to sin, pluck it out"" commandment).  He didn't quite advocate total celibacy--in his letters, he says that celibacy leads to a holier state, but advises that marriage is preferable to burning in the passions of lust.  His exact phrasing is that an unmarried man can focus on doing God's will, while a married man must focus on his wife's will--if you're burning with thoughts about women, you're not focusing on God's will anyway.  

Anyway, where Christ's words are used as the basis for this, one oft-cited passage is Mark 10, where Christ says that, in marriage, man and woman shall become one flesh.  Contraceptives, according to Church teaching, impede this--most obviously, condoms put a physical barrier in place between the fleshes, preventing them from becoming one.

RadomirPutnik,"The western borders, those with Germany and Czechoslovakia, were largely a product of the Paris Peace Conference which determined the postwar settlement after WW1. The lines were laid down to reflect, best as possible, the ethnic makeup of said territories, save for the Danzig corridor which was intended to guarantee Poland access to the sea (see Wilson's Fourteen Points.) There were disagreements with Czechoslovakia over Teschen and Germany over Upper Silesia, both of which resulted in some fighting, plebiscites, and eventual partition.

The eastern border was intended by some in the Allied camp to be the Curzon Line (roughly equivalent to the present border), but in reality it was determined by the Soviet-Polish War of 1919-21. The new Polish Republic, motivated by nationalist and anti-communist sentiment, attempted to extend its influence into areas formerly ruled by the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, roughly Lithuania, Belarus, and the Ukraine. The idea was to create a Polish-dominated federation to counter both Russia and Germany. The Soviets saw Poland as an opportunity to export their revolution into central Europe. After heavy and dramatic fighting (see the Battle of Warsaw), the border was mostly settled in its interwar position.

As for the Curzon Line, it was named after the British Foreign Minister at the time who was instrumental in promoting it as the new border. Determined by a committee of the Paris Peace Conference, it demarcated the area which was majority Polish in line with the principles of the Fourteen Points that national borders should adhere to ethnic makeup as far as possible. And yes, the Poles rejected it (not without dissent) in favor of the Greater Poland/Federation idea. There remained large Polish populations east of the line, as well as significant Polish historical claims to those areas. As such, many Poles were unwilling to hand them over to other powers (especially the Soviets) merely on principle.

rosemary85,"There's a lot of confusion about the ""reality"" or otherwise of Troy, and it stems from thinking about it back-to-front. This is the curse of Schliemann: Schliemann *wanted* everyone to think of mythical Troy first, and only then wonder whether it was ""real"". But it's completely barse ackwards. To get it right, we need to ignore Schliemann's propaganda campaign, focus on what we *know* first, and *then* work towards questions about the relationship with the myths.

So, to do it the right way round: the site in NW Turkey now known as ""Troy"" is most certainly accurately named, since it was inhabited continuously from the late 8th century BCE until ca. 1000 CE. We have many, many contemporary writers telling us about it, and heaps of Hellenistic and Roman era evidence about the city. Its most common name was *Ilion*, with *Troia* as a secondary name, but the two were always equated with one another during this time. There is no doubt whatsoever that it is the site known to the Greeks and Romans as Ilion, and there never has been.

Only *after* we've established that does it make sense to go on to ask the *secondary* questions -- and there are several secondary questions to ask. Again, it makes sense to work from the more historical questions towards the mythical stuff. So:

1. **Did Troy exist in the Late Bronze Age?** Certainly yes; the archaeological evidence from Ilion shows that there was a decent-sized Bronze Age city there, comparable to Gordion in size, which was at its height ca. 1290 BCE, and then gradually dwindled away to nothing by ca. 950 BCE.

2. **Was it called Troy in the Late Bronze Age?** Almost certainly yes -- provided we substitute the more common name, Ilion, and allow for changes to names from one language to another. There is very little doubt that Bronze Age Ilion was the site of the city that the Hittites called *Wilusa* or *Wilusiya*, which corresponds rather tidily with an early Greek form of ""Ilion"". One Hittite text hints at an association with a place called *Taruisa*, which may or may not be the Hittite name that Greek *Troia* came from. We don't know what the people of Wilusa/Ilion called themselves, because we don't know what language they spoke at that time. But northern Asia Minor was certainly dominated by Anatolian culture, not Greek, so it's going to have been an Anatolian language: perhaps Luvian, though an early form of Phrygian isn't impossible, and it might be a language that we just don't know anything about.

3. At last, the question you really want: **Is the real Ilion to be equated in any meaningful way with the mythical Troy?** Now that we've got the real stuff cleared up, the long-and-short is: it's a moot question. A few respectable experts think that the answer is likely to be ""yes""; most would say ""no"". The reasons why ""no"" is the more popular answer boil down to the complete lack of anything at all to corroborate the myths.  
  
    (The existence of a real city doesn't mean the reality of a myth; if it did, we'd have to accept the reality of Thebes as evidence that Oedipus really did kill the Sphinx, or the reality of Jerusalem as conclusive evidence that Jesus was the son of God. That way madness lies.)

Based on that last answer, your third, fourth, and fifth questions are pretty easy:

* **Achilleus and Hektor**: there's nothing to substantiate their existence. In particular, note that Hektor's name has a Greek suffix, and many other Trojans in the myths have Greek names too (Alexandros, Antenor, Euphorbos, Andromache, Astyanax, etc), pointing to the name -- and, very likely, the character -- being a Greek creation.

* **What happened to the city?** This is a straightforward historical question. See above: the Bronze Age city gradually dwindled away to nothing by 950 BCE, and it was resettled by Greeks a couple of hundred years later.

* **Where did the survivors go?** Well, we never took the step of substantiating the reality of a war; but it's the same situation as with Achilleus and Hektor -- there's nothing to substantiate a war. Wilusa/Ilion wasn't destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age, it just gradually faded away. Though there's some evidence of fire ca. 1190 BCE, that doesn't equate to evidence of a city being destroyed by enemies (we know from textual evidence that the city *was* ransacked by the Hittites a couple of hundred years before that, but there's no archaeological trace); and even if it *was* attacked by enemies, there's nothing to indicate who those enemies were. It's best to regard the violence at Troy (if violence it is) as part of a wave of destruction that afflicted many, many, many cities in Mycenaean Greece, Anatolia, Cyprus, and Ugarit at the same time. Anyway, if there's no evidence of a war, that means there isn't anything to say about survivors.

None of this diminishes the importance and cultural impact of the myth. It's believed by some experts that in the 7th-6th centuries there was a clan of Aineidai in Phrygia who claimed to be descended from the hero Aineias (Aeneas); later on the Romans claimed Aeneas as a founding figure too, just as Beneventum claimed Diomedes, Naples claimed the Sirens, and Tusculum claimed Odysseus' son Telegonos. The myth had a huge impact on historical developments, regardless of whether there was a real war or not.

khosikulu,"/u/Commustar may have a lot to add on this, especially the early urban complexes of West Africa and the Niger Valley (and inland delta), which are at least 2000 years old and possibly much older.  There are two big issues at work, and you'll see them appear in John Iliffe's *Africans: The History of a Continent* (2d ed., 2006): preservation and population.

Population, first and foremost, is something like what you suggest.  Tropical Africa tended to have fairly low population densities overall, but people did concentrate wherever good land *and* ecologically sound environments permitted.  Those places, just like elsewhere in the world, became key city sites.  Propagation of trade was another thing that might bring people together into larger concentrations than a few hundred (again, just like elsewhere), and internal trade (usually through many hands on short legs) generated other urban complexes that we find remains of.  Occasionally, as with the Nok culture, we just find their finished craftwork--but in concentrations that suggest a centralized and prosperous urban and artisanal culture.  That does open the question of how big (population, size) something must be to be a ""city""--if we apply 21st century standards, there were almost none on Earth two thousand years earlier.

That brings me to the second issue, one Iliffe deals with less: preservation (and knowledge).  There were more precolonial cities than you hear about most of the time; some we don't even know about, because the work hasn't been done to excavate them.  The vicious circle of archaeological under-attention is one part, but the other is that tropical climates are really unkind to artificial structures.  In parts of Africa without access to exposed stone, that's even more devastating.  The cities of the Mutapa Empire for example were mostly clay brick and wood, which didn't long survive the inhabitants' departure.  Even where cities do survive, what is visible is often only a tiny piece of the original settlement.  Great Zimbabwe itself probably had 20,000 people at its height (and a quarter million or so cattle), but we don't have the entire complex intact.  The out-buildings, extended town centers, and the like?  Totally gone, or just foundations.  The Great Enclosure is what we lock onto.  But it was at the heart of a vast nodal network of towns locally, as well as other zimbabwe centers (towns, or cities?), near and far.

Other cities we know more about, like Benin City and Ife, but even there the archaeology could be so much better than it is.  So there were urban centers, as well as networks of smaller town complexes, but we're still in the infancy of figuring it all out.  The fact that written records don't exist to document a lot of these centers doesn't help the perception that African urbanism didn't exist before Europeans (or Arabs/Berbers/etc) showed up to write about them.

Commustar,"hrm, looks like /u/khosikulu made some promises on my behalf....well, here goes.

   Timbuktu is the most famous of the many urban areas along the middle Niger, but there are many other examples that could be pointed to. The city in this region that is probably best understood is Djenne-Djeno, which has seen a sustained archaeological survey since the late 1970s. These surveys spurred broader interest in the subject of urbanism in the Middle Niger, and have radically altered the conventional wisdom that urban culture in the area developed through contact with Islamic trade from North Africa. Instead, we can now trace Djenne-Djeno's founding to the third century BC (or, about 1100 years earlier than we thought). The archaeolgist Roderick McIntosh is an eminent name in the study of Middle Niger urbanism, and you should certainly check out his book [Ancient Middle Niger: Urbanization and the self organizing Landscape](http://books.google.com/books?id=i72Q2e35P6kC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=urban+archaeology+niger+river&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cFuWUuiZNMyhsAS-5YHoCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) for a somewhat technical explanation of contemporary debates and theoretical models about Middle Niger urbanism.

Moving eastwards, the lake chad basin is also a hotbed for archaeological research into ancient urban settlements. The working theory had been that increased aridity and shrinkage of lake chad resulted in a process of denser settlement resulting in the Sao/Kotoko culture of city-states along the Chari river by about 500 bc. However, climate data collected within the last decade does not demonstrate this supposed trend of increased aridity. [This article](http://dierklange.com/pdf/recent_articles/Emergence_of_social_complexity.pdf) is a decent overview of recent thoughts on the matter.

Continuing eastward, we come across two urban cultures that I am frankly astonished have not been mentioned yet. The Nubian urban settlements at Meroe and Kerma have been known of since at least the 1950s, and Kerma in particular stretches back to circa 2000 bc. 

In the same boat are the sites of the Axum empire, particularly the empires namesake, the city of Axum.

While the discrimination against Italian and German-Americans wasn't as harsh, there was still significant levels of it. For example, due to paranoia about Italian fascists subverting the US government, the Italian language was banned on US radio in the early 1940s.^1 

After the US entered the war, over 600,000 Italian-Americans were made to register as enemy aliens.They were subject to restrictions on travel, employment, and such things as even owning cameras.^2 Beyond these restrictions, the FBI also raided the homes of enemy aliens, interning suspects in prisons and freezing their assets, often without any regard for their families.^3

So yes, Italian-Americans faced serious discrimination during the war. They were interned as well, though on a much smaller scale than the Japanese. Most likely, this was due to them being white Europeans, as horrible as that sounds.

TheHistoryGeek,"Hello ! First post here so I'll try to keep it simple and not go into too many details that might make my answer boring to read. The Storming of Bastille, or *la prise de la Bastille* in French, is considered as the first big intervention that the Parisians did. But just because the Storming of the Bastille occurred on the 14th of July, it doesn't mean that that's the **only** reason that the 14th of July is considered as France's Independence Day. 

Since the summer of 1789 and throughout the French provinces were created regional "" federations "" made of national guards, a reaction to the weakening of the central power. To control this spontaneous movement, The Paris Commune (the one during French Revolution), under the leadership of Lafayette, decided to establish a great national federation gathering representatives of local federations. He decided  to meet in Paris on  *July 14 *.

The ceremony was supposed to celebrate the storming of the Bastille, but also to bring a semblance of order and unity in a country in crisis. 
On that day, 14,000 federal troops arrived in Paris and therefore marched under the banner of their department, from the Bastille to  Champ de Mars.

On an esplanade for the occasion, a large mass was celebrated, after which the king Louis XVI swore to maintain "" the Constitution decided by the National Assembly"". The 400,000 Parisians present that day cheering their sovereign: the monarchy is not questioned.

Then and for nearly a century, the commemoration of July 14 was abandoned. It then reappeared in 1880, under the Third Republic. Since the regime desired to be more united and consolidated, they wanted to build a new ''national imaginary'', around republican symbols and thus the Marseillaise became the official anthem and July 14 the French National Day.

But the proposal emanating from the deputy for the Seine [Benjamin Raspail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Raspail) was not welcomed unanimously by the Assembly. Some members called into question the fact that the 14 July 1789 was a violent day and thus, not a good day to represent the national holiday. 

And so they **finally** made an agreement around the 14 July 1790.

Acritas,"Of course there were, it was called literally the same - *Гражданская Оборона* - (ГО), Grazhdanskaya Oborona (GO). In fact, the program was established in 1932, but under the name *Local Anti-Air Defense* and trained USSR citizenry against simulated air raids and airborne chemical attacks, renamed in 1961. 

Brief outline of structure (top to bottom): 

* All-Union Staff of GO: top-level office

* Per-Republic Staff of GO (e.g. Russian, Ukranian etc.)

* Oblast' (i.e. region with large city) or Autonomous Republic Staff of GO

* Local Staff of GO

There were small amount of GO troops (mostly to deal with emergency situations in places with frequent problems like flood, fire, earthquakes). 

All public places (schools included) have GO-controlled air shelters, air raid sirens and gas masks. All citizens were trained for first signs of chemical, biological and nuclear attack. 

There were tons of posters, movies, annual exercises etc. organized by GO Staff of all levels. 

Some differences: instead of *duck and cover* there was a concept of *flash to your side!* ('flash' here means visible nuclear detonation) - it could be reported relative to person's  4 sides - forward, backward, left and right. The purpose was to put your head as far away as possible from flash by orienting feet toward the flash. So if you here *flash to your right!*, you need to throw away anything in your hands, drop prone to the left side and cover head with both hands. 

Of course it was a butt of jokes:

*Q: What one supposed to do after dropping to the ground in case of nuclear flash?
A: Slowly crawl to the cemetery.* 

*Q: Why do you need to throw away your AK in case of nuclear flash? 
A:To save your hands from liquid metal droplets*

Anyway, GO program was well stoked and quite active in 60-70s, but in 80s it became unpopular and went into decline.

kwizzle,"Though since Quebec is sourrounded by English speaking places there is a lot of focus on keeping the French language ""pure"" or at least as free from English influence as possible.  So stopsigns in Quebec for example don't say ""Stop"" as they do in France, they say ""Arrêt"", in France they say ""Le weekend"", in Quebec its ""La fin de semaine"".  Spoken Quebec French does use many English words, despite ""proper French"" enforeced by the province.  Separating Quebec French and France French are of course the famous Quebe swear words that are religion based (Calisse, Esti, Tabarnak) versus the French sex/excrement based swearing (Putain, Merde).


As far as cultural similarities go, Quebec has a very independant culture from France.  For example, Hockey is the most popular sport in the province versus soccer in France.  Music tastes are usually mainstream American bands in addition to some bands from Quebec.  Food is also quite different than traditional French food.  An educated french Quebecker would likely be familiar with classic French works and the average person would know Asterix and Tin Tin.

Also the English speaking population of Quebec is around 10% and the percentage of native French speakers is about 80%.  I'm not sure how this compares to the percentages in France however.

As for politics, both Quebec and France are more left leaning than average.  Education in Quebec is cheapest in North America, though still more expensive than in most of Europe.",null,0,cdokljs,1rjus1,askhistorians,top_week,4
TFYD,"Historically, Quebec remained more strictly religious and conservative than France for a longer time. The French Revolution sought to dismantle the power of the Catholic Church in France and began the secularization of French society quite early on. Atheism was much more vocal in France in the 19th century than many other Western countries. 
Quebec, because it has always been surrounded by English speaking, Protestant cultures, put more emphasis on preserving traditional, conservative French culture, particularly Catholicism. Quebec also remained quite rural up through the early 20th century (this is why so many French Canadians immigrated to New England during this time; they could only live off the land in Quebec). 
Although Quebec changed tremendously and became much more secularized in the 1960s, this change happened later than in France, so I think one may find more traditionalism and conservatism in Quebec than in France.",null,0,cdoon4i,1rjus1,askhistorians,top_week,1
thekidwiththefro,"Prior to the probably around the late 19th century, the US and Russians were fairly close allies. They shared common enemies, France and Britain, expanded similarly, Siberia and the American west, viewed the abolishment of serfdom and slavery similarly, and were christian. In the late 1800's Americans really began to dislike the Tsars in Russia. This was most likely due to competition in Manchuria, American discovery of the Pogroms, and journalist George Kennan (Uncle of George F. Kennan) giving academic lectures on the abuses by the Tsar. Kennan, and most of America for that matter, were convinced that the Soviet people were educated, enlightened, Christians and were going to replace the Tsar with a new government modeled after the American way that was the ""shinning society"" to so many Americans.

Around this time, the American increase of American populist and socialist parties and fear of alien ideologies via immigration was on the rise. Look at [This](http://i.imgur.com/89O1Kmz.png) political cartoon depicting communism at the Grim Reaper about to destroy family values. [This](http://i.imgur.com/lNxGOS9) cartoon from the 1870's depicts communism killing the Goose that lays the Golden egg and then look at [This](http://i.imgur.com/tJWYUqZ) one from the 1920's showing essentially the same thing. From these cartoons it really easy to see how Americans were worried about the dangers of communism. American fear of socialism and communism stems from the workplace riots and strikes (i.e.Haymarket square) that were anarchy-ridden. It was American to be a good worker and not engage in anarchy like a Communist would.

When word of the revolution of 1905 hit the United States, Americans were initially excited for the [Russians](http://i.imgur.com/gn9ZO4j.png). This feeling was changed by the fear of a socialist influenced revolution [though](http://i.imgur.com/mD8uyQ4). In 1917 though, many Americans had hopes for a [democratic](http://i.imgur.com/ccNvr1D.png) Russia to prevail but to no avail as these cartoons also depict the American fear of [Communism](http://imgur.com/a/ZDEHV) following the Bolshevik rise to power in 1917.

Americans were convinced the Russians were going to become a democratic nation following their Revolution. The United States became democratic after their revolution and Americans, thanks in part to people like George Kennan, were convinced the Russians would follow suit. By the Russians adopting Communism, the policy that was so similar to the ones causing riots in late 1800's America it created the ""because we don't communism we don't like Bolshevism and because of that, we don't like the new Russian government"".

TL;DR- Americans didn't like Communism before the Russians adopted it and when the Russians did adopt it we didn't like them.

Kai_Daigoji,"&gt; New Testament is quite easy, since the gospels are named after the people that wrote them (Mark, Matthew, Luke, John). 

I'm not an expert, but I thought I'd take a swing at this small piece of your question.

Unfortunately for New Testament scholars, authorship is not as easy as simply taking the names of the traditional authors of the gospels.  For example, most of the Gospels don't name the author in their text.  The names were attached later.  And scholars now don't believe that any of the traditional authors (Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John) actually wrote the books that bear their name.

Some of the Epistles of Paul are genuine, so we can say that Paul wrote (for example) 1st Corinthians.  A couple of people believe that 1st Peter might be genuine, but for the most part scholars reject his authorship.

the prophet was commanded by God to have some of his companions write it down. the prophet would recite the Quran to his companions that were literate, and the would write it on what ever available material there was. After the prophet passed away and during Abu Baker's time there was the Ridda Wars (wars with the apostates). During that campaign many people that memorised the Quran by heart had died. the Caliph Abu Baker instructed Othman Bin Affan to gather the Quran in one book.

outhere,"I am not a historian, but I am a philosopher of religion. Here is what I learned from my studies:

The Torah and the books of the Old Testament Bible came from oral history. There was not a single author, but these books were composites of a variety of scripts, fables and traditions dating back several hundred years BCE from a variety of sources.  Scholars believe that King Solomon of Israel began compiling them around 970 BCE.  Solomon also produced many original works that became part of the Torah and Old Testament. It is likely that he employed scribes or ""historians"" to do this work, as was a common practice among kings.

The New Testament began to come together in the late first century, CE. By this time the apostles of Jesus had scattered throughout the middle eastern region and established churches. These churches were writing many texts and ascribing them to the various apostles. It would not be until the first ecumenical council in 325 that these scripts were sorted and assembled, with many rejected as false doctrine or forgeries. It is unlikely that any of the apostles were the actual authors, but rather the religious scholars of the various churches they established.

The Quran was assembled in the 7th century. Unlike the Bible, the scripts used to produce the Quran came from a close-nit group of followers of Mohamed, and was not assembled until after Mohamed's death. The contents of the Quran comes from some written manuscripts written during Mohamed's lifetime, and some written after his death. While there are parts that are attributed to specific authors, it is more likely that these people were assigned the task of memorizing ""revelations"" dictated by Mohamed and reciting them to scribes. Over time various religious scholars edited these recitations to produce a homogenous manuscript. 

So, there is very little (if anything) that we know about actual authorship of any of these holy books, and none of these writings survived without considerable editing at the hands of very many people.",null,1,cdo5z0p,1rjvwd,askhistorians,top_week,8
lucky_wood,"There's a theory about the authorship of the Torah/Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament) which, though I think it's probably somewhat discredited these days, is still interesting. This is the Documentary Hypothesis, which breaks down the books into four separate works by different authors, which were later combined. The details are quite complicated but to give you a massively, massively simplified breakdown, these authors are:

**J** - the 'Yahwist' writing c950 BCE, so called because they typically refer to God as Yahweh (or Jehovah, hence J). The J sections of the Bible typically refer to a highly anthropomorphic God- the God who walks in the Garden of Eden, or who shuts the door of the ark behind Noah. Most of the Biblical stories we are familiar with, such as the Garden of Eden, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah come from this section. A simple (simplistic?) way to think about it might be to consider these the 'mythological' sections of the Bible. 

**E** - the 'Elohist', writing c850 BCE, so called because they typically refer to God as 'Elohim' (Elohim is a generic name for deity, while Yahweh is the specific name of the Hebrew God). The Elohist sections are still narrative-focused, but God is typically a more detached presence, speaking through prophets, messengers, dreams, visions and voices rather than through direct interaction with the characters.

**D** - the 'Deuteronomist', writing c600 BCE, who unsurprisingly, is responsible for the book of Deuteronomy. This author's main focus is to demonstrate that the contemporary sufferings of the Jews during the Babylonian exile were the result of the failure to observe the Hebrew laws. So Deuteronomy focuses on religious law and the terrible consequences of failing to observe it. 

**P** - for 'Priestly author', writing around c500 BCE. This author is responsible for most of the Genealogies (X begat Y begat Z begat... etc), Leviticus, and the Creation myth (as opposed to the Garden of Eden story). P is mainly interested in ritual and laws. 

That 4-author breakdown was, as far as I know, the first real alternative to the ""Moses wrote everything"" theory. It's a theory based entirely on analysis of the text itself rather than any archeological evidence, and it's been increasingly challenged since the 1970s. One of the other posters here can probably provide more information on what's the current understanding of the authorship of the Bible.

Source: My knowledge of this comes from 'The Book of J' by David Rosenberg and Harold Bloom (cue sharp intake of breath by proper historians). It's a fantastic book - there's an English translation of those sections of the Bible attributed to J by David Rosenberg, and a long, fascinating but kind of mad introduction by Bloom. Bloom argues a) that the religious associations around the Torah/Bible have stopped us from seeing that the 'Book of J' is a superlative work of world literature that deserves to sit alongside the Iliad and the Complete Works of Shakespeare, and b) that J was a woman, based largely on the fact that 'she' writes really good female characters. I wouldn't be sure how much weight to give to that particular idea, since it seems to be based on little more than a hunch. But he provides a pretty clear overview of the whole Documentary Hypothesis and makes a really strong case for considering the 'Book of J' a remarkable, self-contained literary work, whoever actually wrote it.

crb11,"For both the Torah and the New Testament there is in most cases considerable scholarly debate on the question of who wrote each individual book, when it was written, and whether it was written in its current form or subsequently edited. A decent scholarly commentary on any book will give a summary of views, which are usually based on a combination of clues in the text, what the intended audience of the book seems to have been, writing style, and often just speculation. 

Some of the more interesting cases  - these happen to be books I looked at in my theology MA - include 2 Corinthians and Isaiah. 2 Corinthians is generally reckoned to be written by Paul, but many argue that what we have now is a composite of two, or perhaps more, letters, given a radical shift of topic between chapters 9 and 10.

Isaiah is in three distinct sections, the first (1-39) apparently speaking to the situation at the time when the prophet Isaiah described in the text was alive, the second (40-55) to the time of the exile about a century later, and the third (56-66) to a period probably not long after the return to Israel. Most, except a conversative minority, only want to attribute (most of) the first section to Isaiah himself, with the other sections being added later and the whole being edited to make it a little more coherent, but vast amounts has been written on what was edited together when.

Volsunga,"The Torah or pentateuch was a collaboration of at least four authors over several centuries of editing and censoring. This is a highly studied subject and you can get more information by looking up the ""four sources hypothesis"" (I'd link you, but I'm on mobile now). 

The rest of the old testament was written by several Jewish historians, poets, and philosophers.

The Gospels were written by several early Christian leaders, but most likely not by the apostles whose names title them. However there is still controversy over Mark on this subject. There is also a ""lost gospel"" that is usually called ""q"" which came first and influenced the four we know.

The epistles were written by Paul and several early Christian leaders. Revelations was written by a different Paul about which not much is known except it was written during or shortly after the reign of Emperor Nero. 

The Quran was dictated by Muhammad and written by some of his close followers, then compiled shortly after his death.

dmar2,"I think you've been had. Unless the Soviets developed a completely different physical model for computation that does not require transistors(which I doubt), there is absolutely no they made microprocessors with sugar instead of silicon. The key property of silicon and other semiconductors that allows them to be used for computation is that they their constructiveness is between complete conductance (metals) and non conductance (nonmetals). Their conductances are variable and can be adjusted using a variety of methods including ion implantation and the application of a voltage. Sugar does not have this property and could never be used to construct transistors. I could talk forever on how semiconductors work, but let's skip ahead to the historical evidence.

For the historical question, the evidence supports that the soviets never got very far on their own in microchip production without borrowing the innovations that were developed in the West by Intel, Texas Instruments and others. 

Here is an excerpt from the summary of a CIA [report](http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000500644.pdf) entitled ""Soviet Block Computing Direct Descendants of Western Technology"" that was published as the result of a FOIA request.

""The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe lag the West in all aspects of general purpose digital computer technology, ranging from at least five years for microcomputers.... The progress that has been achieved is, in large part, a result of acquiring Western technology, ranging from microelectronic and printed circuit board production technology to use of Wester computers for reverse-engineering.""

Edit: I also want to add that sugar as a raw material is far more expensive than silicon.

Astrogator,"&gt;Some of the accepted history about Spartan society strikes me as so strange that it comes off as exaggeration or outright invention, and none of the authors were actually Spartans.

That right here is the answer to your question already. 

The extreme claims made about their society are reflections of what we and the Spartans themselves (as well as their contemporaries) wanted to see in Sparta, not of reality. Let me cite a poem:

&gt;O maidens of honey voice so loud and clear, my limbs can carry me no more. Would O would God I were but a ceryl, such as flies fearless of heart with the halcyons over the bloom of the wave, the Spring’s own bird that is purple as the sea!

This is Alkman (Fragment 26), one of Spartas most prominent sons (there's debate about his origins), and one of the nine great poets of antiquity. He writes quite a lot about pretty girls, song, festivals and dance. Does this sound like something out of a society focused completely upon the military? Spartans liked to live a good life, too. When boiotian troops entered Lakonia in 370/69, they made rich plunder in the houses of the Spartans. Festivals (like the famous Hyakinthia, or the Karneia), where girlanded youths sang and danced in choirs and lavish meals are also part of Spartan culture.

Alkman is writing in the 7th century, just like his more militarily minded colleague Tyrtaios. It has been argued that Spartan culture declined after that time, following the conquest of Messenia, as they focused more on the military aspect, but there's material evidence to the contrary. Spartans continued to paint and sell vases (as far as Gaul), hold feasts, erect statues and so on, not to mention that quite a few of them became ultra-rich. 

&gt;The idea is that they trained from early childhood to be the biggest badasses possible, and thanks to the helot system they were free to focus entirely on warfare. Essentially 100% military focused with incredibly extreme training and honor culture. Yet if you look at their military history, it's a pretty mixed bag.

I've written a bit about the agoge and it's origins [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1qfz1b/what_was_the_significance_of_the_agoge_within/cdchl0d), the short version is that the agoge as it is idealized in modern popular culture is an invention of hellenic Sparta (4th/3rd century) long after their prime to construct a tradition. Public education was part of all Greek poleis, and even if Sparta was a bit more focused on austerity and military, it was not exceptionally so. The big advantage was their klaroi-system, giving them more time to concentrate on military training - or other aristocratic matters - while the helots worked the land.

Concerning their military effectiveness, for a few decades, they really were the supreme military force on land in all of Hellas. But as another commenter has already pointed out, military training only gets you so far. 
For one thing, Sparta was never more than a collection of four, later five villages, and had never more than probably around 10.000 full citizens (Spartiates). They subdued the whole laconic plain down to the sea and then Messenia, which is a pretty strong feat if you look at the size of the other contemporary Greek polities. But in terms of their ability to deal with losses, Sparta was like the antithesis to Rome. They could never replenish any serious losses. After the big earthquake, the Peloponnesian War and the disaster at Leuktra, there simply was no large citizen base anymore. Upwards social mobility, such that losses in the body of citizens could have been replenished, was practically nil. 

The defeat at Hysieia, like most of the battles of those times, is shrouded in mist and probably apocryphal (to give a mythical legacy to their constant conflict with the Argives). Same goes for the battle of the promachoi (that 300 vs. 300 episode). 

Then there's their spectacular successes. Lysander is a name that is, in ancient and modern perception, one of the greatest strategists of all times (his popularity has sunken with the loss of importance of classics in popular culture, but in the 19th/early 20th century you'd have heard that name uttered in the same breath as Alexander, Caesar, Scipio and Hannibal). His victory at Aigospotamoi was pretty amazing in itself. Then of course you have the strategical and tactical defeat at the Thermopylae that was turned turned into what is probably the biggest propaganda victory in the history of history. Concerning their honor culture, deceit and trickery was as much part of Spartan strategy as anything else. Lysander purportedly had this to say on the matter of deceit: 
&gt; In answer to those who blamed him because his carrying out most of his designs through deception, which they said was unworthy of Heracles, and gaining his successes by wile in no straightforward way, he said laughing that where he could not get on with the lion's skin it must be pieced out with the skin of the fox.

King Kleomenes tricked Argive warriors that had taken refuge in a grove by calling them out one by one, telling them that their ransom had been paid. Then he had them killed. When they got wise to that and refused to come out, he simply burned the whole grove. So much for honour. Tactical retreats were perfectly O.K., too, and Leonidas didn't remain at the Thermopylae because it was proscribed by some Spartan honour code or any law. 

True, their increased focus on military training gave them an advantage. But, that system was only implemented after the 6th century, and it was only an advantage in one field. There's more to warfare than training. ",null,5,cdo4lpv,1rk42q,askhistorians,top_week,52

To break it down: 

- There has been no massive European migration to China, Japan, and Korea. 

- Yes, other physical traits of other ethnic groups affected the Chinese and the Japanese. There are places in Northern and Western China where the Han Chinese mixed with neighboring groups such as Turkish and Mongolian. There are people in small communities with red hair, blonde hair, green eyes, etc. 

- Japan wasn't breached by the Mongols. The mixing in Japan happened between the Yayoi people of East-Asia and the Jomon people of maybe Siberian origin. There are also some Austronesian and other Siberian native mixture.

- Yes, the steppe people have varying degrees of 'Eurasianness' but they didn't do a massive community gathering to pass on the genes. 

- Most Mongolians have dark hair and dark colored eyes. 

So the borders are pretty blurry. ",null,1,cdo2vbq,1rk46o,askhistorians,top_week,5

typesoshee,"&gt;India had many invasions from Europe including a major one made by Alexander the Great. This then is the reason why Indians and Pakistanis from the north are quite pale.

Can you verify this?  I doubt the veracity of this.  I feel like all Iranians, most Afghans, and then some northern Indians and Pakistanis have pale skin compared to southern South Asians.  Modern Greeks do not look particularly paler than modern Iranians to me.  It seems much more plausible that northern Indians and Pakistanis have always had their shade of skin tone, or else if it got paler by invaders, it was due to invaders from modern day Iran way before Alexander.

astulfor,"To answer your question OP, modern Central Asians should not be conflated with the ancient steppe confederations. Central Asia was originally populated by Persians or other Indo-European ethnic groups like the the Tocharians. Indo-European Central Asian kingdoms like Sogdiana were centers of trade along the Silk Road. Central Asians were not assimilated into the Mongolic or Turkic ethnic groups until later in history (the process was gradual so an exact century is difficult to pinpoint, but by the 12th century Central Asia was predominantly Turkic). 

Blue eyes were traits of the Iranic ethnic groups in pre-Turkic Central Asia, but they were far less common among the steppe nomads originally from the East. And the Iranic kingdoms of Central Asia did not have the capacity or the desire (their wealth was based on lucrative Silk Road trade between China and Europe, they had no desire to disrupt it) to invade military superior Chinese dynasties to the east. 

China, however, did have an economic incentive to invade the Central Asian kingdoms to secure more of the Silk Road trade for themselves. And they did on two occasions, during the Han Dynasty and then later again in the Tang Dynasty. 

Also, Japan, being an island, was never threatened by the steppe nomads to the same degree that China and Korea were. Japan was invaded by the Mongols, but that's an exception, not a rule.",null,0,cdo34ei,1rk46o,askhistorians,top_week,1
molstern,"It was both. Of course it's hard to say definitely which played more of a part, since we can't exactly see what would have happened without one or the other, but ideals were a driving force behind many of the events during the revolution. For example, the famous women's march on Versailles is often portrayed as being only about the lack of bread, but it was triggered by the rumours of insults to the nation, the sanctity of which was one of the new ideas going around. They also demanded that the king ratify the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen. 
During the Prairial rebellion, the demands were similarly for bread and for the constitution of year II (i.e late 1793-94). 
The Bastille was stormed to procure weapons to defend against the king's forces that were thought to be gathering nearby to slaughter ""patriots"", and patriotism is of course related to nationalism. The troops were gathering as a response to the rebellion of the deputies of the third estate, who can't really be said to have been acting out of necessity since they were mostly very comfortably well off. They acted based on their ideologies, and what their ideologies told them was a good way to deal with the problems the country had.

TFYD,"For the best answer to this question, see Alexis de Tocqueville's ""The Old Regime and the Revolution,"" the classic history of the French Revolution. Tocqueville emphasizes the consistent and gradual decline of the old feudal order in the centuries leading up the French Revolution. As the clergy opened up its ranks, nobility became increasingly less reserved to old military families, and the bourgeoisie gained power, the ancient feudal structure was slowly weakened. French society became less hierarchical and socially immobile.
In the 18th century Enlightenment thinkers reflected this trend and expounded it in their political and philosophical writings. 
So yes, I believe that the intellectual ideas of the Enlightenment played a large role on the French Revolution, but I think these ideas had deep roots in the history of France before the revolution. They were best articulated by philosophers, but they were already acting upon French society, albeit unknowingly, even before the revolution. ",null,0,cdop073,1rk4fz,askhistorians,top_week,1

There were gung-ho advisors and leaders on both sides, and global security often rested on the hope of cooler heads prevailing.

  The Soviets actually had a system installed in the later Cold War era which made it easier to authorise a retaliatory strike: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-10/mf_deadhand?currentPage=all  
  
  The US president nowadays can make the sole decision, as can the British Prime Minister.

Killfile,"Since we've strayed into how the US system works too, I thought this insight from [Hacking Nuclear Command and Control](http://icnnd.org/Documents/Jason_Fritz_Hacking_NC2.pdf), a research paper done for the International Commission on Nuclear Non Proliferation and Disarmament would be helpful.

&gt;The US uses the two-man rule to achieve a higher level of security in nuclear affairs. Under this rule two authorized personnel must be present and in agreement during critical stages of nuclear command and control. The President must jointly issue a launch order with the Secretary of Defense

If you want something that'll really keep you up at night, consider this from the same paper (though evidence of Perimetr aka ""Dead Hand"" is spotty, contradictory, and largely based upon admissions by former high-ranking Soviet officials.  

&gt;Additionally, the alleged Soviet system known as Perimetr was designed to automatically launch nuclear weapons if it was unable to establish communications with Soviet leadership. This was intended as a retaliatory response in the event that nuclear weapons had decapitated Soviet leadership; however it did not account for the possibility of cyber terrorists blocking communications through computer network operations in an attempt to engage the system.

Perimetr [allegedly became operational in the 1970s](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb285/doc02_I_ch2.pdf) but essentially amounted to a dead man's switch for nuclear launch.  The Soviet command structure would activate Dead Hand as tensions mounted and then Dead Hand would require constant affirmative orders from the command structure in order to **prevent** launch.

It's difficult to find much information on the exact procedures the Soviet Union used for launch control and it becomes more difficult the further back into the Cold War we go.  Partially that's because of institutional Soviet secrecy and partially it's because there were fewer and fewer physical and electronic safeguards in place.  Launch authority doesn't mean much when possession of the weapon constitutes the only barrier to setting it off.

We know a good bit more about the late Soviet and early post-Soviet command and control structure.  Here, from [a document from the Federation of Atomic Scientists](http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/crs/91-144.htm), is a description of how launch control worked roundabouts 1991.  Note that given the complexity of revising such a system we can probably safely assume that it worked this way prior to 1991 though the names of the offices involved were different.

&gt;According to American and Russian sources, the command and control system for all strategic and tactical nuclear weapons is centered in Moscow; this central command authority would have to authorize the use of any of those weapons. The release and dissemination of nuclear weapons authorization and enabling codes begins at the top of the political and military establishments in Russia. The President of Russia and the Minister of Defense would independently generate and transmit a special code, which would be combined with a third code provided by the Chief of the Russian General Staff. This combined code would then be transmitted to the forces in the field, where it apparently would become part of the enabling codes needed to arm and launch the weapons.",null,0,cdo6pmq,1rk8cb,askhistorians,top_week,4
hughk,"In early days, there were not so many nukes so control was fairly lax. Some kind of lock was fitted to prevent unauthorised arming of the weapon. This is general across all the older nuclear powers. After some thought it was realised that these weapons remained quite vulnerable so both the US and the Soviets thought about technology to prevent unauthorised launch.

The technology was known as a [Permissive Action Link](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/060315-slides-bellovin.pdf). Wikipedia gives more of an overview [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_Action_Link). It is essentially just a locking system that requires multiple actors to authorise a launch and will prevent unauthorised launch to the point of ""deadlocking"" when multiple incorrect access attempts are made.

We have some kind of view from just before the end of the USSR when the systems were probably at their most sophisticated and had been running since 1981.

This is an excerpt from the book: ""The Soviet Nuclear Weapon Legacy"" by Marco De Andreis, published by Oxford University Press  on page 29:

&gt;The seperate codes sent by the president and defense minister travelled over a dedicated communications channel that validated and combined them, and passed them to another device that integrated the code input of the (Chief of the General Staff). Then the composite code would be sent to the [Commanders in Chief] of the forces dedicated to launch.

So three persons at the top. Note that shortly after the 91 coup attempt, apparently one person temporarily had all three codes. The commanders in chief would then be responsible for releasing the enabling keys that allowed the weapons to be armed as well as the authorisation for a launch.

Note that full permission/authorisation information was further delegated but I don't actually know how. For example, on British and US submarines, they have the ability to launch a nuclear attack without authorisation, in case high-command is destroyed. This is where the launch authority is split between multiple officers.

Interestingly, a pair of [Soviet launch keys](http://pawnstarsthegame.wikia.com/wiki/Soviet_Launch_Key) were sold on eBay. They are supposedly authenticated. Although they look simple other pictures suggest dimples in the main cylinder to engage the pins. As there are two, it suggests a two man launch system where each key has to be inserted and turned within a certain time by two seperate persons. As the keys are together, it is probable that they were kept in a safe similar to that used in a minuteman silo. However this is speculation. The same book I mentioned earlier mentions that in later Soviet times, there was a twelve digit key involved and enabling and launch authorisation were separated.

k1990,"There's a really superb book, released a few months ago called [Command &amp; Control](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Command-Control-Eric-Schlosser/dp/1846141486) by Eric Schlosser (not a historian, but an excellent investigative reporter). It's a brilliant account of the history of the US nuclear weapons programme, with the particular focus on fail-safe mechanisms and - as the title suggests - command-and-control.

From the book (can't give a precise page reference, as I'm looking at an ebook version):

&gt; Unlike the president of the United States - who predelegated the authority to use nuclear weapons not only to [SAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command) generals and Air Force fighter pilots but also to NATO officers in Europe - the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet general staff strictly retained that sort of power. Locks of various kinds were placed on Soviet weapons were placed on Soviet weapons, and the permission to unlock them came only from the top. According to Bruce Blair, a leading command-and-control expert, Soviet safeguards against unauthorised use were ""more stringent than those of any other nuclear power, including the United States.""

So control of the nuclear arsenal was reserved to two civilian officials and one military officerl who all possessed nuclear codes and launch authority: the general secretary, the minister of defence and the chief of the general staff (also per Schlosser.) This is the important difference between the US and USSR: the fact that there was no delegation of command authority in the event of a first strike. But (and it's a big but)...

&gt; The rigidly centralized command structure, however, made the Soviet Union quite vulnerable to a decapitation attack... Instead of loosening their control of nuclear weapons and shifting authority further down the chain of command, they automated the decision to use nuclear weapons. In 1974... the Soviet Union began work on the ""[Perimeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand_\(nuclear_war\))"" system - a network of sensors and computers that could launch intercontinental ballistic missiles without any human oversight. Completed in 1985, it was known as the ""dead hand"". The Soviet general staff planned to activate Perimeter if an American attack seemed imminent. The system would retaliate automatically, firing long-range missiles if it detected nuclear explosions on Russian soil.

In short, there was a deadlock between the Congress and the Muslim League on how best to negotiate the question of Muslim representation once power was transferred from the British to the natives. 

The Cabinet Mission Plan of 1945-46 did try to find a way to balance the demands of the Congress with the fears of the League. But the question of who could legitimately represent the interests of the Muslims was a stumbling block. The Mission Plan sought to group Muslim-dominated areas together (Sindh and NWP with Punjab, Assam with Bengal). This was unacceptable to the Congress. On the other hand, the Muslim League insisted that all Muslim representatives on the Cabinet would necessarily have to be chosen by them. The Congress agreeing to that would have meant accepting that they merely represented the Hindus. 

The failure of the Cabinet Mission led to a feeling within the British Government that any negotiation between the Congress and the League was impossible. As I mentioned in the earlier thread as well, the riots in Bengal magnified the League's ability (and also their inclination) to incite violence. Jinnah's hold over the League had weakened, as had Gandhi's over the Congress. Nehru and Patel, while miscalculating the League's penchant for violence, also exaggerated their own bargaining position. They thought the Congress could call the shots, with the British and with the natives. They did succeed to an extent, as independent India's *negotiations* with the various princely states proved.

The Catholic church encouraged literacy among its monastics and clergy, but did not seem to be particularly active in spreading literacy across the lay people of Europe.

Protestant churches, because they translated the Bible into local languages, instead of using Latin, and because they encouraged lay people to read the Bible themselves, did more to encourage the spread of literacy across Europe.

That influence, plus the greater availability of Books after the development of movable type and the printing press, encouraged the spread of the ability to read (which is half of literacy).

Being able to write, was slower to spread than being able to read.  As late as 1841, 33% of men in England, and 44% of women signed marriage certificates with their ""marks"" rather than with their names.

In the 16th century, Italy was at the peak of fashion and at a major trading route. The rich had access to the finest silks, velvets, damasks, cottons (a rare import!), and linens money could buy. The poor wore clothing made of linen. As for colors, you can get a good idea of dye-pallets by checking out the natural dye charts at [Dharma Trading](http://www.dharmatrading.com/dyes/natural-dyes-from-plants-and-insects.html?lnav=dyes.html) and also by looking up portraits of real people from the era. ([Web Gallery of Art](http://www.wga.hu) is a good resource for this.) It should also be noted that the strict religious folk did not wear a lot of flashy color or jewels.


As far as *what* they were wearing, it can be summed up mostly to the following: In the later half of the 16th century, men wore fitted doublets that buttoned down; sometimes these doublets had removable sleeves, and they could be adorned with pearls, lace, beads, and gems, and they could even be slashed. Under the doublets they wore white shirts with ruffs at the collar and sleeves. They also wore ""pumpkin pants"" (as I like to call them), which are puffed pants that rest as high as the thighs and as low as below the knees. They could be decorated similarly to the doublets and were often of a contrasting color. Men wore stockings that could be embroidered, and they wore both tall heeled boots, short heeled boots, heeled shoes that we would modernly call ""heels"", and flat shoes. Depended mostly on the occasion, how much money you had, and your occupation.


And now I'm out of time, but I can post more on what women wore later. Hope this helps!",null,0,cdoj92y,1rkkc6,askhistorians,top_week,3
backgrinder,"The biggest thing that feeds this is everything that has happened to the French since WW1. They got hammered by Germany in WW2. They got booted out of Algeria and Indochina after long, bloody fights against insurgents in the 50's and 60's. Like other European nations they have shrunk their military since the end of the cold war, shifting tax revenues away from the military and towards paying for their social welfare state to the point they can't really project force any more. This was made apparent during the 2011 intervention in Libya, when a NATO coalition led by France and Italy could not sustain operations in Libya without US assistance despite their close proximity to Libya. You also have France's history with NATO to consider. The French were not really known for playing ball with other NATO members, so to speak. From the French perspective this was an assertion of their independence, and national prerogative to make decisions on their own behalf and not be bound to group decisions made by other nations, but many leaders in other NATO countries considered this an excuse to shirk from the shared task of defending themselves from the threat of Soviet aggression.

 Any military historian is familiar with France's long and proud military tradition, but they have gotten a very bad rap in the last 75 years, partly because of bad luck, and partly because of lack of performance.",null,4,cdo5wc9,1rkkss,askhistorians,top_week,31
Hk37,"While the French certainly have an impressive martial history, they did not fare as well in the late 19 and 20th centuries as they did in previous eras. Beginning with the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, the French entered a century's worth of military hardship. In WWI, the Western Front was a maze of trenches not too far from the capital until the tail end of the war, and required aid from the Americans, and principally the British, historically bitter rivals with the French, to win. WWII saw the French defeated in a matter of weeks, and the government fleeing to Britain. Far from being a major military player in the war, French military contribution was limited to the French Resistance for most of the war, which, while helpful, was not a major part of the war win. In the 1960s, the French suffered defeats at the hands of the Vietnamese and Algerians, both colonial subjects of the French.

More than half of the Plymouth settlers were members of the Church of England.  The dissenters were a minority.  To the protestant descendants of the Puritans, there was much appeal to the religious independence and iconoclastic aspects.  Over the years it has also been much easier to write sermons about charity than about acquiring land.  

It also had appeal as a justification for the Manifest Destiny, especially giving support to the idea that the English settlers, eventually Americans, had special virtues that entitled them to dominate the continent.

Here are my favorites:

A Concise History of Mathematics 2nd Edition - Struik, Dirk J

History of Mathematics. Vol. 1 - General Survey of the
History of Elementary Mathematics -Smith, David Eugene


There are two books which while pretty old, 1967 and 1958 respectively, do a great job of discussing the growth and development of mathematics in several different civilizations. They mostly focus on the real players in mathematics starting at 3000BCE, that is Egypt, Mesopotamia, China and the Harappan civilization. They also don't go into heavy technical detail, so you won't need a college level education to understand it, maybe a little google-fu.

As the cities started to grow around major rivers, engineering was required for agricultural purposes which lead to the development of geometry. As cities began trading with one another algebra was required for financial reasons. Geometry and Algebra were created out of necessity, independently and simultaneously around the world. How cool is that?

Those two books will serve you well if that is what you are interested in. If you looking more for an actual textbook that ancient peoples used to study math, I would suggest ""Euclid Element's"". This book is the backbone of so many branches of modern mathematics. If Greek mathematics is interesting to you they I would suggest  

A History of Greek Mathematics,. Vol. 2 - Heath, Thomas Little

Here's my favorite bit from that book, which may pique some interest: 

Doubling the Cube - Delian Problem:
The problem appears in a Greek legend which tells how the Athenians,
suering under a plague around 430BC, sought guidance from the Oracle
at Delos as to how the Gods could be appeased and end the plague. The
Oracle advised doubling the size of the altar to the god Apollo. The
Athenians, therefore, built a new alter twice as big as the original in each
direction and, like the original, cubical in shape. However, as the Oracle,
notorious for ambiguity and double-speak in her prophecies, had advised
doubling the size, not linear dimension, the new altar was actually eight
times as big as the old one. As a result, the gods remained unappeased
and the plague continued to spread unrestricted. The craftsmen fell into
great perplexity in their eorts to discover how a solid could be made the
double of a similar solid; they, therefore, went to ask Plato about it. He
replied that the oracle meant, not that the gods wanted an altar of double
the size, but that they wished, in setting them the task, to shame the
Greeks for their neglect of mathematics and their contempt of geometry.",null,4,cdo93j6,1rknbc,askhistorians,top_week,18

Peter Schrijvers' recent research, *Liberators: The Allies and Belgian Society, 1944-1945* (Cambridge, 2009), has described some cases in which Allied soldiers were accused of and tried for rape in Belgium. He argues that sexual harassment and sexual crime were more common--perhaps unsurprisingly--in urban areas that acted as logistical hubs for centers of rest and recreation.

I was taught by [Richard Reid](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_History_of_Modern_Africa.html?id=US6RQtYwasUC&amp;redir_esc=y), and he claimed that in Africa, colonies had simply failed to become profitable enough, and were never really that profitable.

mormengil,"Britain may not have “wanted” to lose its colonies, but it did not try very hard to keep them either.

OP is quite right to say that Britain gave many colonies more and more freedoms until they effectively had independence.

Canada, for example, became a self-governing  “Dominion” in 1867, (not British Colombia or Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland, which joined later, (1871, 1873, 1949) but did not really become a totally independent nation until 1982, when the constitution was patriated to Canada.

Between 1855 and 1890, the six British colonies in Australia all became self-governing parts of the British Empire.  In 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia came into being with its own constitution, but still some powers in the hands of the British.  In 1927, the Royal and Parliamentary titles Act in Britain moved from a unified crown for the British Empire to multiple crowns worn by a shared monarch.  The Statute of Westminster Adoption Act in 1942, reduced British power over Australia further.  It was not, however, until the Australia Act of 1986 that Australia became totally independent of the British Parliament.

Britain did just give the colonies more and more freedom until they were totally independent.  Britain did not try very hard to hold on to colonies.  

Partly, Britain was increasingly proud of being a free and democratic country (as opposed to almost all of Britain’s enemies from 1800 onwards which were more totalitarian) and Britain was not hypocritical enough to really think that “democracy” and “freedom” were good for Britain, but not good for the Colonies.  (Not after the American Revolution at any rate.)

On the other hand, Britain was never prepared to create one democratic, free, and representative government over the whole Empire.  The British Parliament was perhaps too jealous of its own supreme role in governing Britain, to ever suggest Imperial institutions which might govern over all the countries in the Empire.

The more Britain made a moral and ideological commitment to “democracy”, the more it became obvious that the colonies had to move towards independence, or the Empire had to build super-national democratic institutions of some kind. 

The path chosen was to move the colonies towards independence (perhaps WWII accelerated that move
more rapidly than Britain thought optimal, but that trajectory seems to have been inevitable for some time previously).

kwgoodlet,"In 1975, Lita-Rose Betcherman examined the various fascist movements in Canada during the 1930s in a book called *The Swastika and the Maple Leaf: Fascist Movement in Canada in the Thirties* (Toronto: Fitzhenry and Whiteside, 1975). Although she did not assess the experiences of German-Canadians after 1939, Betcherman’s study shed light on the development of ethnic German attitudes toward National Socialism and how events in inter-war Europe had commensurable effects in Canada. It also vindicated certain groups of Germans in Canada while imputing to others more hard-line National Socialist principles. In this way, she effectively described the regional variations of German-Canadian communities, the degree of “Canadianization” among those communities, as well as their ideas and beliefs, which added valuable nuance to debates about predisposed German attitudes toward the impending war.

There are a couple key sources that you can use to gauge the degree to which certain groups aligned themselves with national socialist ideas. One is the *Canada Gazette*, which includes the orders-in-council from the 1930s and 1940s. These documents often outline which groups, associations, or newspapers the Canadian government *at the time* perceived as a threat. They also detail lists of ""aliens"" who were either repatriated or granted naturalization according to the Naturalization Act, and these lists are broken down alphabetically. 

A second source is the RCMP security bulletins. These are published in volumes and are usually available at most Canadian university libraries (Kealey, Gregory S. and Reginald Whitaker, *R.C.M.P. security bulletins : the Depression years*). In these sources, surprisingly little attention was given to German-Canadians and fascism compared to how much energy the RCMP directed towards communism, particularly among Italian and eastern European communities (and specifically those living in Toronto and Montreal). 

In addition to these sources, you could always go through certain German-language or Italian-language newspapers from Canada and assess the type of discourse that these papers published. Keep in mind, newspapers present another set of methodological problems--not least is the issue of representativeness. At any rate, newspapers provide anecdotes about what at least some people thought about and felt during the period.

It's worthwhile to mention that you should distinguish between how influential Canadian fascist groups were *based on the knowledge possessed at the time* versus how these movements have come to be remembered following the war. The way we construct an understanding of Canadian fascist groups has changed considerably according to subsequent generations.  ",null,0,cdochjp,1rl1qu,askhistorians,top_week,5

farquier,"I would qualify superadvancepet's answer by saying that virtually all societies have had some kind of role for the visual arts. Beyond that saying that art flourished in a period can mean one of two things. The first, and relatively boring and uncontroversial meaning, is that it was a period with relatively substantial expenditure on artistic patronage-for example, the first half of the reign of Tahmasp I of Persia, the Northern Song Dynasty, the Rome of Julius II, and so on(we could multiply examples ad nauseam). These are all periods where there was substantial money being spent on art and artists. 

The more interesting meaning is retrospective; when people say ""art flourished in X period"" they are often identifying a period with what they consider the best art and using it to define a specific set of visual canons. Probably the most famous example of this to a western audience is Giorgio Vasari, whose _Lives of the Artists_ constructs a narrative of the improvement of Western art that connects Giotto to Michelangelo to demonstrate first that the arts reached their peak with Michelangelo and Raphael and equally crucially to turn around and use that peaking as an argument for why the norms of art-making should be based on the style practiced by Michelangelo and Raphael, which forms the basis of Vasari's variety of ""mannerism"". We can see a similar kind of work in a preface to an album of Persian painting by Dust Muhammed. This account of painting, after providing various historical examples of painting, specifies that the painter Amhed Musa inagurated ""the style of painting current"" and then traces the history of painting from Amhed Musa to the painter Bihzad specifically to explain why those paintings attributed to Bihzad in the album should be regarded as the pinnacle of painting. So describing a period of art as ""flourishing"" is not a neutral act; it is rather an act of picking a period of artistic production as worth emulating.",null,0,cdorcqv,1rl2ok,askhistorians,top_week,1

Instead I'll talk about how their contemporaries, the Tarascans handled it.

Prior to the rise of the Tarascan state, each town and urban district was ruled over by a hereditary lord known as a *caracha-capacha*. Crimes within their tributary lands were handled by them. They had the authority to mobilize soldiers and administer justice once a crime was reported to them.

After the formation of the Tarascan empire much of this authority was taken out of their hands. The *caracha-capacha* were moved from their home communities to the capital, where they would attend to the king (or *Irecha*). Another official referred to in the colonial sources as a *lieutenant* (sp: ""teniente"") was appointed to administer the day-to-day affairs of town. Typically this lieutenant was a relative of the actual lord (caracha-capacha).

**Civil cases** regarding things like land disputes were handled by another appointed official known as a *sirundame*. They kept records (how exactly, we're not sure) of each district assigned to them and would handle disputes of that nature. They in turn reported to two officials in the capital. One known as the *tareta-uaxati* was in charge of administering lands assigned to the royal family and any transgressions that happened on them. The other's name is not given in the historical sources, but is described as a general administrator of property rights. Payment of taxes (or failure to) was administered by a separate bureaucracy of appointed (but semi-hereditary) officials known as *ocambecha* who were each assigned to a unit of 25 households. 

For **criminal cases**, small-scale offenses were likely still left in the hands of local lords (or more properly, their appointed lieutenants). Certain crimes, however, were handled at the state level. There was a large jail in the capital, managed by a warden who was appointed directly by the king. If somebody failed to pay tribute on time, they were reported by the local ocambecha, arrested, and thrown in jail. Peasants who left their appointed lands and worked lands that weren't assigned to them were reported by the local sirundame and thrown in jail. Soldiers found guilty of espionage or desertion were arrested by their commanders and thrown in jail. Other crimes that warranted such arrest included theft, witchcraft, medical malpractice (that is, healers that kill their patients), failure to tend to the king's fields when such work is assigned, breaking a maguey plant, or refusing to work for your master if you were a slave.

**Trials** were handled by the *irecha* (king) alone. For twenty days leading up to a large annual festival known as *Equata cónsquaro* the king would hear cases from all over the empire and issue judgments and sentences. Prisoners who had been held in the jail were taken out and brought before the king, who would hear the cases and decide whether the accused was guilty or not. Serious crimes like murder warranted a death sentence. However, even petty crimes could carry a capital offense in the case of a repeat offender. They had a kind of four-strikes law: if you committed a crime only a few times they would let you off with a light sentence. If you did it four times you were killed. The method of execution was typically a sharp blow to the back of the head from a club.

So, the effect that it had on Europe was a terrible economic event. Due to the restrictions in trade, most of the countries in the system were experiencing an economic slump due to the loss of vital British trade. So people whom traded lost income from the lack of trade. What they would do instead is participate in the black market in order to get trade items from Britain. It would affect urban populations rather than the rural populations.

I cannot say much on internal pressure but there was Pressure from Britain for nations under the system to fight Napoleon or ignore it. Notably, one of the reasons for the invasion of Russia in 1812 was due to the Russians flouting the system. 

Britain involvement in Continental diplomacy at the time is due to the need to get rid of the Continental system as it was costing much in terms of tax and trade dollars for Britain.

Domini_canes,"The sources I have read (Thomas' *The Spanish Civil War* and Beevor's *The Battle for Spain*) did not deal extensively with the mechanics of *how* the volunteers were recruited, especially for the Germans, Italians, and Russians.  The German response in particular (supplying transport planes very early in the conflict which allowed the Nationalists to airlift troops from Africa over the heads of the Republican naval vessels blocking their path) was very specific.  I find it much less likely that this was a random outpouring of goodwill from Luftwaffe transport personnel, and much more likely that it was as you described.

I cannot address the later and more substantive (in terms of equipment if not effect) volunteers on any but a survey level.  The opinion at the time (and reinforced by Beevor and Thomas) was that this was an obvious sham.  The troops and aircrew were referred to as volunteers, and this served everyone's interest.  The Germans and Italians got to support a fascist ""ally"" (the depth of that alliance is very much in doubt) and got to try out new equipment and tactics.  Since the participants were ""volunteers"" the UK and France could look the other way and not have to go to war right now.  Similarly, the USSR didn't have to become officially embroiled in the conflict.

As for the participants from France, the UK, the US, Mexico, and Ireland that all trickled into the Iberian peninsula it was much more on an ad hoc basis than was the aid from nations.  This stands to reason, given the lack of funding and organization available to them.  The Irish Brigade, a group of Irishmen who came to support the Nationalists, apparently turned volunteers away.  I haven't yet read a history of that unit, but the majority of their members arrived on a single ship.  This speaks to a good deal of organization and finances, though not on a scale of the Italians, Germans, or Russians.

There are a number of histories of individuals that served in the International Brigades.  This has not been an area that I have spent much time studying, so I cannot recommend any particular titles.  They should be widely available, though.  

I am sorry I was unable to answer you regarding the mechanics of volunteers during the conflict.

abt137,"Your point about recruiters in major cities is true for those volunteering for the Republican side, most of them with anti fascism and/or leftist ideals. Recruitment agents were set up by Unions and leftist political parties (Socialist, Communists, etc). I recall several examples where these recruiters would also arrange transportation into Spain and the associated logistics.
For the Nationalist on the other hand it would be a different business. On one hand Germany and Italy supplied regular army, navy and air force units but I can only speculate to what degree the soldiers would volunteer (presumably from the existing ranks) for the units to head towards Spain. For some reason I think army and air force would be easier to staff with volunteers than the navy where you do not call them and give them a destroyer, a far more expensive and complex asset than a machine gun or even a plane of the era. In the case of Italy you will find the so called ""Black shirts"" or Mussolini's paramilitary organization, clear candidates for volunteering (see CTV for their brief history http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpo_Truppe_Volontarie , remember that despite the term voluntary it has a lot to do with politics and terminology not being necessarily true). Germany would be a different thing too, the so called Condor Legion was effectively used to test Germany's military machinery and some of its doctrine a small scale, but their history is well documented and many books are available.

You'll notice that most of those separations are still in place today.  That's because they largely fall along the lines of very long standing political divisions like kingdoms, duchies or princedoms.  In addition people from one area can have a very hard time understanding people from another because these dialects vary dramatically--on German TV, Swiss German (Alemannic) is commonly subtitled.

As /u/Astrogator has pointed out, most of the differences are of lexical variety, though even so, those lexical differences can even differ from region to region within those large political blocks.

In my view, the most noticeable effect of the Cold War division was twofold.

1) Those dialects within the East became more sharply glossified, due to reduced freedom of movement.

Apart from the deviations in local dialects spoken on either side of the wall which can't be attributed to the partition, the main differences were lexical.

You'll notice that most of those separations are still in place today.  That's because they largely fall along the lines of very long standing political divisions like kingdoms, duchies or princedoms.  In addition people from one area can have a very hard time understanding people from another because these dialects vary dramatically--on German TV, Swiss German (Alemannic) is commonly subtitled.

As /u/Astrogator has pointed out, most of the differences are of lexical variety, though even so, those lexical differences can even differ from region to region within those large political blocks.

In my view, the most noticeable effect of the Cold War division was twofold.

1) Those dialects within the East became more sharply glossified, due to reduced freedom of movement.

2) Many Easterners moved to the West and brought their dialects with them.  This eventually strengthened a move towards the ubiquitous use of High German.

A fast dispatch ship might be sent out from HQ to deliver orders or relay them between fleets or home ports. In addition to signal flags, cannon shot was also used as a primitive code. Because of the uncertainty of encountering a ship alone on the high seas, and the fact that a captured ship was very often taken into the service of the navy that captured it, it was often difficult to discern nationality at a distance.

Some of them were Mongolian, despite being ejected out of the middle east after the fall of the Ilkhanate many Mongols were fully assimilated and stayed. The best example I think would be Babur, he falsely (though I think he believed it) claimed that he was a direct descendent of Genghis and created the Mughal empire which actually means Mongol on Turkish. A Turkish ruler having Mongol blood is not surprising but the ones that claimed to be direct descendents from Genghis Khan were only trying to validate their right to rule.

jamez042,"Turks, as an ethnic group, have existed in central asia since pretty much forever (since humans spread there I suppose). As you can imagine, they were pretty disparate, and nomads, so hard to get a historic handle on. You might be best off looking at anthropological sources to look at their origins.  

The Mongols were the tribe that united all the other Turkic tribes under Chinggis (Genghis) Khan. ""Chinggis"" is the Persian pronunciation used in a lot of sources, as opposed to the anglicanised version ""Genghis"".  
  
So a lot of people use ""The Mongol Invasions"" as shorthand for the long chain of military conquests begun by Chinggis Khan. But by the time they get very far, there are very few actual Mongols in the army. Those who were invaded were often enlisted into the army and the force grew exponentially. So its while Chinggis was in charge, its probably best to call them ""The Chinggisid invasions"".  
  
But even then, Chinggis died before all the invading was complete. So you'd also want to name them after their specific leaders, like the ""Hulaguid invasions"" in China. Some experts still just refer to everything as Mongol simply to delineate them from the Seljuks, even though its not technically correct, so do as you please.   
  
The Tatars were a Turkic group that established itself properly around the river Volga *after* the Mongol invasions, being a mix of original Turkic Volga Bulgars and invading Kipchak turks. They developed a distinct culture, then spread out again across central Asia taking their culture with them. So they were a tribe that developed a distinct ethnocultural, but still Turkic identity.

Marxism is an analytic framework based on historical materialism in economics, and therefore according to Marx, everything in the history of human society. Since 1900 Marxism as a materialist framework has been extended beyond economics per se to apply to other social sciences, to arts and literature, and other academic categories and is one of the pre-eminent models of modren analytical training.

Communism is what Marx defined as the necessary outcome or next step in social organization after capitalism collapses (either on its own or by revolution).

Spoonfeedme,"Although it is flawed in many ways, I highly recommend Iris Chang's book on the subject:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_Nanking_(book)

In general most soldiers reported just going along with what was happening. The sheer scale of the slaughter does not appear to have been something actively directed by the Japanese command, but it was certainly not discouraged. Chang's interviews with former soldiers suggest they simply don't understand why or even how they could have done such things. It was not only enlisted men who were partaking, and lower officers certainly participated (and even encouraged) the slaughter. The Kwantung Army at this point was pretty much operating independently of direction from the Home Islands. I don't know of any evidence that suggests the slaughter itself was ordered by anyone in the command structure of either the Kwangtung Army or the Japanese High Command in Tokyo.

The Rape itself is really a culmination of the policies that Army had in place in dealing with the Chinese. They became more brutal as the war wore on, and as war commonly does, the men themselves became more and more desensitized to violence. I think you can find comparables in the slaughters that occured in Berlin by the Red Army. The senior officers turned a blind eye, while the lower level officers would have actively participated, and the enlisted men had no control over themselves. Being told your enemy is inhuman for years tends to let stuff like this happen, sadly.

EDIT: One thing I'd like to remind people who might criticize Chang's book is that she killed herself over what she found.

paburon,"The ""Rape of Nanking"" was not a policy ordered from above.

However, as others have commented, officers were not strict in enforcing discipline over their men during the chaos of the battle and its aftermath.  Killing, looting, and raping were rampant.

The mass killing of Chinese POW's was also condoned.

I am afraid I don't have much time to write tonight, but here is a copy-paste from an earlier thread about the treatment of POW's and Japanese atrocities:

--

Prior to the capture of Nanking, a few incidents of atrocities by Chinese soldiers were widely circulated among the Japanese soldiers.  

However, there were some prisoners taken.  A Swiss photographer who was in Shanghai in 1937, documented [Chinese soldiers brutalizing captured Japanese](http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/).

&gt; the Chinese soldiers used a variety of torture methods on prisoners, including suspending them in wooden cages by the neck until they died of starvation. 

&gt; Some were shot, and their bodies stacked for mass burials. Others, mostly Chinese nationals accused of aiding the Japanese, were beheaded with a large sword.

The [Tungchow Mutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungchow_Mutiny) took place in 1937 as well.  Chinese soldiers who were part of an army loyal to a pro-Japanese collaborator government rebelled when ordered to fight against other Chinese.  They quickly overwhelmed the small number of Japanese soldiers and police in the area, and prisoners were not taken.

&gt; In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tōngzhōu in accordance with the Boxer Protocol of 1901 were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and some ethnic Koreans). According to contemporary sources, the majority of women were raped and brutally massacred. Female bodies were found lying on the floor with brooms inserted in their violated genitals; several severed heads of café waitresses were found lining up on a café table in a manner of atrocity exhibition; a woman had her head chopped with a machete, after which the Chinese perpetrator raped the body in a necrophilic act; the intestines was savagely taken out of the body; a child was found dead with a barbed wire nose ring pierced in the nostrils. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived and they provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. To complete their orgy, the Chinese set fire and destroyed much of the city.

The atrocities committed during the mutiny were used by the Japanese government to motivate soldiers to ""暴戻支那膺懲"" (punish atrocious China). 

That ""punishment"" would prove far more atrocious than the initial atrocities against Japanese.  Throughout the war, Japanese would kill Chinese who surrendered.  It was especially terrible after the capture of Nanking, when thousands of Chinese prisoners were lined up and shot.

AsiaExpert,"The Rape of Nanking is the historian's equivalent of a potential nuclear meltdown in a shoddy home made reactor. Even going near the topic or mentioning it in passing is dangerous territory. The topic is also a magnet for controversy and heated emotions. I usually avoid it because I usually get no where with it. I've even had my objectivity called into question because of my own ethnicity so it's kind of telling how hard it is to let cooler heads rule with this.

On to the main topic. The question of whether or not the Rape of Nanking was an operation that was carried out as orders from higher command echelons and/or possibly directly derivative of an overall policy that the Japanese Imperial military had put into place has nominally two general sides. The pro-system side and the not-system side. I will go through both sides and follow up. 

**First the common points.** Both sides agree that there was much violent excess against military and civilian victims in the taking and subsequent 'mopping up' of Nanking. Even Nanking Massacre deniers agree that this took place (as a side note, 'denier' has a connotation of refuting that the events ever took place at all, which is a misconception). Both sides roughly agree that the definition of 'policy' they are using in the context of this argument is an official, widely circulated article that states clearly the order to kill and/or attack with deadly intent or at least the strong encouragement to do so. 

Finally, possibly the most important point is that both sides cite the exact same documents, consequence of there being so few surviving known records and documents relating to the event. This means they are drawing completely opposite conclusions from the same documents. Above all else, this is a sign that we need to approach the discussion carefully. 

The **pro-system side generally asserts that there was indeed a policy that was put in place** where Chinese soldiers who were taken prisoner were either not to be considered legal prisoners of war (and consequently, following this line of thought, they could take actions as though under the pressures of combat) or, more sinister, there was an outright order to kill, punish, maim or otherwise attack any and all Chinese soldiers, whether or not they surrendered or had been taken prisoner. 

The individuals they hold responsible for this are usually Prince Asaka, who was nominally the commander of the forces that were charged with taking Nanking. The claims are generally that Prince Asaka either sent along or created himself the orders to kill Chinese prisoners and/or a general policy where killing Chinese prisoners was encouraged. Others believe General Matsui, Prince Asaka's nominal commanding officer, is responsible. Others still believe Prince Kotohito, Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army at the time, to be responsible for the original orders. 

As a secondary, some also believe that these orders were not only limited to soldiers but were worded to directly order and/or encourage IJA soldiers to intentionally include civilians in the 'kill order'. A minority also suggest there were also orders or policies where rape within Nanking was also encouraged. 

The **not-system side generally asserts instead that there was no official policy** that was enacted. That is to say, there was no over reaching policy that was promulgated through official and proper military channels from Japan to the armies in the field, namely the Central China Army Group of the Imperial Japanese expeditionary forces nor were there any orders that originated with the Army high command while in the field. 

This side suggests instead that the 'so-called orders' were either fabricated at low levels then subsequently spread sporadically through hearsay then made real by the actions of men on the ground or completely non-existent. 

Furthermore, the not-system side asserts strongly that there were no such orders that related to the intentional killing and rape of civilians whatsoever. 

The main assertion of this group is that higher ups never issued any orders to illegally kill Chinese prisoners, to kill Chinese civilians, nor to round up and rape Chinese women and that the events that occurred at Nanking was the Army falling out of control, not following orders. 

This group believes that while no orders were issued, Prince Asaka and General Matsui are highly responsible for what happened at Nanking. While it is strongly asserted that Prince Asaka never issued any orders, he also did not work towards curtailing the violence in Nanking at all. They also assert that Matsui was culpable because while he was not in the field at the time, he had the knowledge of what was going on and the power to stop it. 

**Final Conclusions on my part**

I am personally of the not-system group. 

Often there is talks of orders and missives that declared executions of POWs to not be illegal, sometimes allegedly condoned by military general staff, other times condoned by Emperor Showa Hirohito himself. I have personally not seen any of these documents and if there were any copies lying around I would be very interested in examining them myself but too often these claims are unsubstantiated. 

'Secret orders' is too little to go on and it seems to me that there was no such policy. 

There are also no documents that point to Prince Asaka, Matsui, Prince Kotohiko or the Emperor himself issuing any orders to the effect of executing prisoners, though there is a question of responsibility that I will not be arguing here. 

In the historian community, it is generally agreed that the stress and rigors of the brutal campaign in China resulted in many soldiers pouring out their resentment against the occupants of Nanking. It's entirely possible that lower echelon officers and staff ordered their men to kill civilians and prisoners, then the rumors subsequently spreading sporadically that there was 'an order to kill', a lie made real.

**The singular thing that everyone can agree on is that the events in Nanking were chaotic.** There was no effective authority, not enough policing, ineffective communication, and continuous skirmishing between remnant military forces and partisans, with civilians caught in the middle with no safe haven. This was a recipe for disaster. 

It's also important to understand that the *narrative* of the Nanking Massacre has grown to massive proportions over the years. Too often it's portrayed as the Japanese being singularly blood thirsty. The name of the event itself is politically and emotionally charged, as it is meant to be.

Chinese partisan forces were a large part of the war against Japan and many civilians would fight as guerillas, which means they were technically illegal combatants. Other soldiers would fight in plain clothes and mixed in among the civilians, another illegal act in war. There was also fighting between Chinese themselves, sometimes atrocities being committed against Japanese collaborators. 

And while there were civilian casualties that were intentional, some were definitely not and were a consequence of the difficulty of the modern war Japan was fighting, something that can be appreciated in a contemporary time of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

There were also records and witnesses of Japanese soldiers who were altruistic and sympathetic. Not every Japanese soldier partook in the excesses of the Nanking Massacre, just like how not every German soldier was a rapist in Stalingrad. 

The rigidity of the Japanese command structure as well as the propensity of Japanese officers to be extremely liberal in their application of corporal punishment means that acts of kindness would not be very likely if any such 'kill order' was given. Executions for disobeying orders in the Japanese military, or any military during the time in fact, was not uncommon. 

In conclusion, here are some scholarly articles and/or academic works on the subject for further reading. 

As a tertiary(?) note, Iris Chang's book *The Rape of Nanking* is generally not considered a reliable source, though very well read it is. As an alternative, I suggest **Honda Katsuichi's** work, listed below, which has its own problems but a much more reliable investigative work.

Well its quite hard to sell that message, and the US and many other countries responded, leading to the US trade embargo with Japan over its refusal to withdraw from China (which was stupid on the US' behalf, as they were giving the Japanese an impossible choice, with conflict becoming the only option).

You have to remember that the Japanese did not see the Yamato (Japanese) race as superior, but rather the Asian race as superior, just it had stagnated over time. Japanese said there was no difference between the Koreans, Taiwanese/Chinese, Ryukuns (Okinawans) and themselves*. There was a lot of state sponsored thinkers and intellectuals who stated that all Asians were from the same family tree, with the Japanese just having enlightened first, and now it was there mission to enlighten the rest of Asia.

Of course all of this was a justification for colonial territory, much like eugenics was to European rule in Africa or American rule in the Philippines, Hawaii, Native Americans, Cubans etc.

Spoonfeedme,"Although it is flawed in many ways, I highly recommend Iris Chang's book on the subject:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_Nanking_(book)

In general most soldiers reported just going along with what was happening. The sheer scale of the slaughter does not appear to have been something actively directed by the Japanese command, but it was certainly not discouraged. Chang's interviews with former soldiers suggest they simply don't understand why or even how they could have done such things. It was not only enlisted men who were partaking, and lower officers certainly participated (and even encouraged) the slaughter. The Kwantung Army at this point was pretty much operating independently of direction from the Home Islands. I don't know of any evidence that suggests the slaughter itself was ordered by anyone in the command structure of either the Kwangtung Army or the Japanese High Command in Tokyo.

The Rape itself is really a culmination of the policies that Army had in place in dealing with the Chinese. They became more brutal as the war wore on, and as war commonly does, the men themselves became more and more desensitized to violence. I think you can find comparables in the slaughters that occured in Berlin by the Red Army. The senior officers turned a blind eye, while the lower level officers would have actively participated, and the enlisted men had no control over themselves. Being told your enemy is inhuman for years tends to let stuff like this happen, sadly.

EDIT: One thing I'd like to remind people who might criticize Chang's book is that she killed herself over what she found. This event is really one of the worst things to happen in recorded history in my opinion, and I forgive her for some of the hyperbole and poor academic quality of parts of the book given how disturbing it was.",null,7,cdogn5x,1rlbx6,askhistorians,top_week,25
paburon,"The ""Rape of Nanking"" was not a policy ordered from above.

However, as others have commented, officers were not strict in enforcing discipline over their men during the chaos of the battle and its aftermath.  Killing, looting, and raping were rampant.

The mass killing of Chinese POW's was also condoned.

I am afraid I don't have much time to write tonight, but here is a copy-paste from an earlier thread about the treatment of POW's and Japanese atrocities:

--

Prior to the capture of Nanking, a few incidents of atrocities by Chinese soldiers were widely circulated among the Japanese soldiers.  

However, there were some prisoners taken.  A Swiss photographer who was in Shanghai in 1937, documented [Chinese soldiers brutalizing captured Japanese](http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/).

&gt; the Chinese soldiers used a variety of torture methods on prisoners, including suspending them in wooden cages by the neck until they died of starvation. 

&gt; Some were shot, and their bodies stacked for mass burials. Others, mostly Chinese nationals accused of aiding the Japanese, were beheaded with a large sword.

The [Tungchow Mutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungchow_Mutiny) took place in 1937 as well.  Chinese soldiers who were part of an army loyal to a pro-Japanese collaborator government rebelled when ordered to fight against other Chinese.  They quickly overwhelmed the small number of Japanese soldiers and police in the area, and prisoners were not taken.

&gt; In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tōngzhōu in accordance with the Boxer Protocol of 1901 were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and some ethnic Koreans). According to contemporary sources, the majority of women were raped and brutally massacred. Female bodies were found lying on the floor with brooms inserted in their violated genitals; several severed heads of café waitresses were found lining up on a café table in a manner of atrocity exhibition; a woman had her head chopped with a machete, after which the Chinese perpetrator raped the body in a necrophilic act; the intestines was savagely taken out of the body; a child was found dead with a barbed wire nose ring pierced in the nostrils. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived and they provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. To complete their orgy, the Chinese set fire and destroyed much of the city.

The atrocities committed during the mutiny were used by the Japanese government to motivate soldiers to ""暴戻支那膺懲"" (punish atrocious China). 

That ""punishment"" would prove far more atrocious than the initial atrocities against Japanese.  Throughout the war, Japanese would kill Chinese who surrendered.  It was especially terrible after the capture of Nanking, when thousands of Chinese prisoners were lined up and shot.

AsiaExpert,"The Rape of Nanking is the historian's equivalent of a potential nuclear meltdown in a shoddy home made reactor. Even going near the topic or mentioning it in passing is dangerous territory. The topic is also a magnet for controversy and heated emotions. I usually avoid it because I usually get no where with it. I've even had my objectivity called into question because of my own ethnicity so it's kind of telling how hard it is to let cooler heads rule with this.

On to the main topic. The question of whether or not the Rape of Nanking was an operation that was carried out as orders from higher command echelons and/or possibly directly derivative of an overall policy that the Japanese Imperial military had put into place has nominally two general sides. The pro-system side and the not-system side. I will go through both sides and follow up. 

**First the common points.** Both sides agree that there was much violent excess against military and civilian victims in the taking and subsequent 'mopping up' of Nanking. Even Nanking Massacre deniers agree that this took place (as a side note, 'denier' has a connotation of refuting that the events ever took place at all, which is a misconception). Both sides roughly agree that the definition of 'policy' they are using in the context of this argument is an official, widely circulated article that states clearly the order to kill and/or attack with deadly intent or at least the strong encouragement to do so. 

Finally, possibly the most important point is that both sides cite the exact same documents, consequence of there being so few surviving known records and documents relating to the event. This means they are drawing completely opposite conclusions from the same documents. Above all else, this is a sign that we need to approach the discussion carefully. 

The **pro-system side generally asserts that there was indeed a policy that was put in place** where Chinese soldiers who were taken prisoner were either not to be considered legal prisoners of war (and consequently, following this line of thought, they could take actions as though under the pressures of combat) or, more sinister, there was an outright order to kill, punish, maim or otherwise attack any and all Chinese soldiers, whether or not they surrendered or had been taken prisoner. 

The individuals they hold responsible for this are usually Prince Asaka, who was nominally the commander of the forces that were charged with taking Nanking. The claims are generally that Prince Asaka either sent along or created himself the orders to kill Chinese prisoners and/or a general policy where killing Chinese prisoners was encouraged. Others believe General Matsui, Prince Asaka's nominal commanding officer, is responsible. Others still believe Prince Kotohito, Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army at the time, to be responsible for the original orders. 

As a secondary, some also believe that these orders were not only limited to soldiers but were worded to directly order and/or encourage IJA soldiers to intentionally include civilians in the 'kill order'. A minority also suggest there were also orders or policies where rape within Nanking was also encouraged. 

The **not-system side generally asserts instead that there was no official policy** that was enacted. That is to say, there was no over reaching policy that was promulgated through official and proper military channels from Japan to the armies in the field, namely the Central China Army Group of the Imperial Japanese expeditionary forces nor were there any orders that originated with the Army high command while in the field. 

This side suggests instead that the 'so-called orders' were either fabricated at low levels then subsequently spread sporadically through hearsay then made real by the actions of men on the ground or completely non-existent. 

Furthermore, the not-system side asserts strongly that there were no such orders that related to the intentional killing and rape of civilians whatsoever. 

The main assertion of this group is that higher ups never issued any orders to illegally kill Chinese prisoners, to kill Chinese civilians, nor to round up and rape Chinese women and that the events that occurred at Nanking was the Army falling out of control, not following orders.

Daveaham_Lincoln,"Well, 1400-1500 the trade in the area was primarily between West Africa and Asia.  Traders would have been carrying cotton, silk, spices (cinnamon was a big one), and porcelain to Africa and trading for gold, ivory, iron, timber, and finished goods like textiles and furniture.  

I'd imagine that this import/export dynamic probably continued more or less unchanged up until the Portuguese period (~1500-1622), where the Portuguese became more interested in exploiting the area for its access to the spice trade, which allowed them to challenge the Venetians for dominance of the European spice market.  

In the Aglo-Dutch period (~1622+), the area seems to have been exploited as a source for spices and ""exotic"" luxury goods, like carpets, tapestries, perfumes, and the like.

In the case of England the popularisation of secular middle names (not Saints' names give at baptism) originated with the aristocracy wishing to mark prestigious maternal lineages as well as the paternal lineages that were automatically shown in the surname. It was an alternative to double-barrelling the surname. So the convention that developed was first name - mum's surname - father's surname. 

This gradually trickled through the social classes with given names replacing maternal surnames.

Spinoza42,"Obviously this depends for a considerable part on the area you're talking about.

What's important to note though is that before the Napoleonic civil registry there was no such thing as someone's official surname. People had the name or names they were baptized with, and apart from that they might have descriptors. But these weren't exactly fixed, and there wasn't a clear system of how many you should have, though more than two was extremely rare I think.

In Denmark some families had a proper family name that was passed on from generation to generation, that was not a patronymic. A father's name would then still be included. When civil registries were introduced these names, plus the patronymic of that generation, would be frozen.

The concept of a ""middle"" name seems to be particularly Anglo-Saxon to me. In many other systems people might have multiple personal names, but wouldn't conceive of them as first, middle and last, instead as ""first and second personal name"" and last name. And the personal names might also be more than two, especially in Catholic families.

As to African traditions, I know that in Ugandan cultures there are no patronymics. People typically have a religious (Christian or Muslim) name, and a traditional name of their tribe, which sort of acts as a surname. Children might inherit their parents' name, or they might not. I've met families where some children inherited the father's name, and others didn't, and it was completely unfathomable why. The clear distinction in usage that exists in the West between first and last name also didn't exist, it's perfectly normal for most Ugandans to refer to someone as ""mister George"", though I've heard some educated people correct themselves when they did this.",null,0,cdohkmk,1rld5s,askhistorians,top_week,2

It's arguable how much knowledge existed of areas south of the Sahara, although accounts of places like Wagadu (Ghana) and Kanem-Bornu existed from the 9th century forward.  (See Robinson &amp; Levtzion's book of sources for West African history on that one.)  So the knowledge may have extended south to the edge of the forest belt, but not further in any meaningful way.

mormengil,"Georgia blames opposition to slavery as the first thing they mention in their secession:

""For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.""

Mississippi also cites opposition to slavery as the first reason for secession:

""Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. ""

South Carolina first enunciates a claim that they have rights as an independent state, but the first grievance they state is about slavery:

""We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection. ""

Texas declares that the (proposed in Lincoln's platform) ban on the extension of slavery into new territories is their first reason for secession:

""The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States.""

Presumably he did this in the interest of Christian missionary work among the slaves. Many slave owners were fearful of evangelization among slaves, thinking the Bible allowed the keeping of unbelievers as slaves, but not believers. Capitein argued that baptized slaves could remain slaves.

Carol_White,"I'm going to say no, just because nothing springs to mind. Obviously there's no way to really cite this....

I'm going to assume that when you use the word ""abolition,"" this is what you mean. In terms of manumission, there were those who opposed their own personal freedom for various reasons, although not because they had a moral or political opposition to slavery as an institution. For example, if your personal freedom was to be coupled with separation from family and familiarity, you might reject it. There were cases of free black men who owned family members only because state or county laws regarding manumission or residency for free blacks made freedom practically impossible. Conditions for free blacks in the South were not much better than those for the enslaved.

A universal belief in the antebellum South was that blacks loved slavery and loved their white families. Slaves said so loudly and often. Historians have discredited these pronouncements, calling them another example of necessary subterfuge by the enslaved. Nevertheless, there were probably a few cases of true sentiment between masters and slaves. Our man of the hour Solomon Northup had nothing but good things to say about his first master in Louisiana. This is not to say that he wished to remain a slave, but in some cases, true familial relationships emerged which would persuade people to stay together in some fashion. This was not common.

Finally (and this is more pedantry than anything else), it's hard to imagine slaves being ""vocally opposed"" to anything, since they were forcibly excluded from the public sphere and their opinions carried no weight. 

Edit: /u/Spinoza42's comment makes me realize that I've overlooked the entirety of colonial American history, and the Atlantic world might hold other examples besides Capitein.

EsotericR,"I'm afraid I can only speak for African colonies, not for South American and Asian colonies which to my understanding will be very different in this regard. This is a generalization too, the specifics of certain states are very different.

So a lot of the colonization efforts in Africa were preceded by explores and (key to this questions) Missionaries. These missionaries came from all over the world (I've read journals from Americans, British, French missionaries) but were generally aiming to convert people to their denomination of Christianity. These people were very paternalistic and patronizing to the Africans but generally seemed to want to ""help"" (the degree to which they were actually helping is debatable).

https://archive.org/stream/presbyterianpion00shep#page/62/mode/2up/search/school

That's an extract from the journal of a missionary who set up a school in Luebo (in what is now the DRC). With Christianity generally came literacy. In order to read the bible and worship god, the Africans needed at least a small community of literate readers to propagate the message.

So when the Scramble for Africa proper began after the Berlin conference (1884-5) there was already a precedent for missions to Africa to attempt to convert the peoples and teach basic reading a writing skills. Most of the colonies in Africa were not settler colonies but based around extraction and acquisition of resources. So due to the colonial powers not having many boots on the ground so to speak, a native presence was required. This administrative Africans needed to be able to read and speak the language of the colonists for obvious reasons. The already fledgling missionary schooling system was integral to this, naturally these church schools were not secular in their teachings.

So fast forward to the post colonial period and the majority of Africans who were educated and in positions of power, were Africans who had gone through the church schooling system. These Africans would generally be Christians. So as the transition from colony to state began, these were the men (mostly men at this point) who were to take the reins so to speak.

That's not to say traditional religions were eliminated entirely. Many traditional religions survive to this day. There are also christian sects that combined traditional religions with Christianity. Often the gods, spirits and ancestors of the old religion would become Angels or Demons of the Christian religion. On a larger scale, African churches began to appear, as Africans became more educated, that rejected the white supremacy of European Protestantism and Catholicism. 

I apologize that I can't answer the second half of your question, but hopefully this explains why Africans did adopt European religions. Hopefully I also get across that religion was not a passive thing. Africans (from all walks of life) adapted the religions to suit their own needs. I think it would be wrong to says the populace follows the religion of their political masters.

paradoxplaza,"Well it *may* have to do with the fact that the colonial rulers of South America were Catholic vs the Protestantism that characterized British rule of North America and India. More to this point, the Phillipines which is firmly in Asia is staunchly Catholic to this day, and that is because it was ruled by the Spanish before the war agaisnt USA.

Catholic orders like the Jesuits and Franciscans made aggressive conversion campaigns in SA, and one of their main objectives was exactly that. Not to mention the fact that Spanish administrators also took their part in breaking up their old belief systems: many Catholic churches in Mexico are built directly above Mayan or Aztec temples.

Also population-wise, a large porcentage of the native South American population was wiped out by the Old World diseases and the hard conditions of labour imposed by the Europeans. As these populations dwindled they would be more ""vulnerable"" to conversion attempts.

Qhapaqocha,"Okay, to give you a quick TL;DR right off the bat, I'd argue that you're massively underselling and simplifying what happened to both the eradication of the Inca state religion when the Spanish showed up, and the conversion of the natives to Christianity.

One of the Spanish motives for conquering the New World - and much of their moral support for the endeavor - came from the papal dispensation that allowed Spain to conquer so long as the natives were brought into the fold of Christianity, as they had souls and could thus join Team Jesus (yes, the notion of New World civilians having souls was a topic of debate and discussion). In practice this was often exerted rather forcefully - for instance, conquistadors presented groups they met with the Requirement, which basically boils down to ""Join Christianity, or we have *casus belli* against you"". As was somewhat famously recounted in several chroniclers' accounts, Atahualpa, victorious Inca of a brutal fraternal civil war, was presented with a Bible and told of Christianity. Asking the man who is considered by his people to be an aspect of the Sun to up and change teams is presumptuous, wouldn't you say? It is said he threw the Bible on the ground and the conquistadors promptly sprung into action. (Always a fun story, the capture of Atahualpa - ask me again sometime and I'll expand on it.)

Another way the Spanish usurped Inca state religion was through the ""extirpation of idolatry"". Keeping, worshipping, secreting, or otherwise maintaining idols and shrines was a severe offense, and these objects and places were vigorously sought out and destroyed. The white rock Yurak-Rumi outside Vitcos (a holdout of the independent Inca state after the Rebellions) was one such *huaca*, or sacred place/object. The shrine of Chuquipalta containing it was burned to the ground - the rock is still present and Brian Bauer found evidence of the burning in excavations there. At every point the Inca pantheons, or their local analogues, maintained by the people of Andean civilization were replaced with saints and ceremonies respecting them.

The result, however, is a Christian religion completely unlike any other in the world, and markedly different from the Roman Catholicism initially presented to the people of the Andes. For example, the thunder and storms here in the Cuzco Valley of Peru is called ""San Pedro"". What does Saint Peter have to do with lightning? Well, Inti, the Sun, had an aspect known as Illapa, the Thunder. Inti got replaced more or less with the Christ figure, and Saint Peter took the place of Illapa in the pantheon.

Another example: there's a painting of a virgin at one of the sites I've worked at here. This *virgencita* garners pilgrims from the towns in the valley, and occasionally the surrounding areas - folks from the city of Cuzco occasionally even visit. The *virgencita* basically replaced the *huaca* of Andean society - a deeply-seated cosmological concept of sacred space and spirit that inhabits the earth, water and sky of our world. The Virgin is responsible for good or bad weather in the valley - if you fall into sickness it may be because you hadn't respected the Virgin or given her a *pago* offering of late. This mentality survived from well before the Inca (so far as it can be discerned) straight into the present day - save for a different name.

bitparity,"Well it's political.

It depends entirely on what you consider the most important aspects of the ""Roman Empire"" to be.  Is it hegemony?  Is it political continuity?  Is it urban continuity?  Religious continuity?  Cultural inheritance?  Language?  Religion?  Is it self-identification?

Basically all of these questions are a subset of the question, what should be the primary legitimizing agent for a polity to considered as the Roman Empire?  The answer to that question, conveniently, also decides on your choice of end date for the end of the Roman Empire.  

Why 476?  In a nutshell, political convention.  Especially with Gibbon's history, people like the symmetry of the founder and the final occupant of the imperial throne in Italy being both named Romulus, (never mind Julian Nepos who was still around til 481).  In much the same way people like the symmetry of the founder and final imperial occupant of the Byzantine Empire to both be named Constantine, (never mind David Komnenos of Trebizond, who was still around until 1461).  Either way, 476 has been in the popular imagination so long that it's a convenient marker, flawed or not.

That of course doesn't preclude arguments for alternative end dates, but like so many things in the social sciences, few positions can be argued as definitively ""right"" or ""wrong"", just ""widely considered at the time.""

If your primary consideration is translatio imperii, you can consider 1922 (End of the Ottoman Sultanate, who were also ""Caesars of Rome"" via descent from Alexios Komnenos), 1917 (End of Third Rome, Imperial Russia), or 1806 (end of the Holy Roman Empire).

If it's self-identification, you can make a case for 1453, with the demise of the Byzantine Empire.  

If it's bureaucratic structural continuity, you can make a case for 1204, with the sack of Constantinople.  

If it's classical urbanization and culture, you could go with your aforementioned Heraclius 636.  

If it's language, then Justinian's 565.

If it's classical continuity within the city of Rome itself, you can make a case for either 546, 455, or 410, which were the three most devastating sacks of late Roman history, but the Gothic War sack dealing the most permanent damage to the city.

If you make a case for religious identity, well... technically the Roman Empire (as the universal christian empire) is still around, with the Roman Catholic Church.

So in a nutshell, yes, it is a Gibbon hangover.  The choices in end date for the end of the ""Roman"" empire will be as many as the politics.  But by convenience and force of habit, 476 has stuck around.

The idea is that if you have a ""heap"" of something, say sand, and you take a grain away from it, when does it become not a heap? If you add that last grain back, does it suddently become a heap again. The same is true of the Roman empire. People can clearly argue that it was an empire after 476, or not an empire before that. A lot of that is going to depend on the individual opinions. Your idea of a heap may not be the same as my idea of a heap. 

I think the reason the 476 date is used frequently is that it is a good place to end a book, or a [podcast](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/2012/04/178-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper.html).

One great resource to read more about Japanese repatriation is in John Dower's ""Embracing Defeat.""  He goes into great detail about the poor governance of repatriation:

""In Manchuria alone, it is estimated that 179,000 Japanese civilians and 66,000 military personnel perished in the confusion and the harsh winter that followed capitulation."" - Pg. 49

In addition, lots of repatriation attempts were held off because many returnees were diseased, such as Cholera and smallpox, and medical exams and immunations needed to be carried out before they could return to Japan.

Pepys uses French and Spanish *constantly* in his diary, especially later in the diary, especially when he's talking about sexual subjects.  So it wasn't odd for an Englishman in the 1660s to know French on a casual basis.  Pepys likely would have because of his connections to the navy and thus to the more cosmopolitan aspects of late seventeenth century Europe.

But I think that less so than the *political* classes in the period, it was the *educated* classes that would have wielded languages so.  And I can use two of my other favourites, John Milton and Andrew  Marvell, to illustrate this, as they both were ""the language guy"" for important political figures at important times.

Milton, before his fame as a poet, was notorious for his work as the Protectorate's ""Secretary for Foreign Tongues"", which position had him producing all non-English materials for the highest levels of government.  His job had him reading and responding to materials from all over Europe, and responding to them in Latin as the government's official voice, usually in defense of the Regicide.

Marvell in the early 1660s (1663?  the year escapes me presently, and I can't find a quick reference) was the Secretary for the Humanities for the Earl of Carlisle's plenipotentiary embassy to Russia via Denmark and Sweden.  Carlisle was *political elite*, or on the fringes of it at least.  And he may have been illiterate.  It was Marvell's job to deal with anyone who didn't speak English.  He addressed the King of Sweden in Latin, and the Queen of Sweden in French (which may also provide some grist for your inquiry).  He dealt with Russian diplomats in a combination of Latin and Greek (and Marvell claimed that they may have sabotaged the embassy somehow by deliberately misunderstanding his Latin - modern scholars tend to sympathize with Marvell on this).

Unfortunately, Milton and Marvell aren't the most representative for day-to-day use.  Milton is sometimes said to have the largest vocabulary of anyone, ever.  He was high functioning in quite a few languages, modern and ancient.  Marvell has been called one of the most exquisite Latinists of his time.

Reedstilt,"In the autumn of 1637, a massive influenza epidemic swept through Wendake, the land of the Wendat (Hurons). It began on the southeast periphery of the nation and swept northwest toward Ossossane, the capital, on the southern shore of Georgian Bay. French Jesuit priests and the Wendat's own *arendiwane* became quite competitive in response to this epidemic, each trying use their medicinal prowess to emphasize the validity of their religion and each trying to discredit the other.  There are some examples of cooperation, such as when the *arendiwane* Tonneraouanont (somewhat reluctantly) instructed the Jesuits in the use of two medicinal roots, now unidentified.

In this religious battle, the Jesuits had few victories. They were accused of preying upon the ill and dying for quick conversions, quite accurately as Francois le Mercier admits: ""I will even add that some little innocents were baptized in their last moments, unknown to or against the wishes of their parents, under the pretext of wishing to give them some of these sweets."" Additionally, when the town of Oenrio asked the Jesuits to bring their god to their town in hopes that it would help them in this calamity, the Jesuits made a long list of demands, forbidding many aspects of their traditional culture. Oenrio had at least two *garihoua* (the French refer to this rank as captains; in English it would be sachem or chief) who rejected the Jesuits' proposal. Onaconchiaronk said, ""We have been greatly deceived. We thought God was to be satisfied with a chapel, but I see he demands much more."" Aenons gave a longer reply, but the key point is this: ""I consider that what you propose will only prove to be a stumbling block. Besides, we have our own ways of doing things, and you have yours, and all other nations have their own ways. When you speak to us about obeying and acknowledging as our master him whom you say made heaven and earth, I believe you are talking of overthrowing the country.""

Meanwhile, several *arendiwane*, led by Tehorenhaegnon, converged on Ossossane and performed the various means of traditional healing. In addition to prescribing concoctions made from medicinal plants, there were religious and social services. At the first of these religious services, a *garihoua* announced: ""Come now, see us here assembled! Listen you demons whom Tehorenhaegnon invokes, behold us about to make a feast and have a dance in your honor. Come, let the contagion cease and leave this town. If you still have a desire to eat human flesh, repair to the country of our enemies. We now associate ourselves with you, to carry the sickness to them and to ruin them.""

It's important to note here that the word ""demon"" comes from the Le Mercier's writing and was part of a very literal attempt by the Jesuits to demonize everything about the Wendat religion. The *arendiwane* themselves are often called demons. In this context, the *garihoua* was likely referring to the *oki*, a generic term for spiritual and non-human entities, equivalent to the Algonquian *manitou*. The *garihoua*'s invocation does indicate that at this time influenza was being incorporated into the *oki*'s arsenal of diseases which could be unleashed to display their displeasure.

Tehorenhaegnon and his subordinates enjoyed considerable success initially, and soon he promoted some of the lesser *arendiwane* and empowered them to continue the care of those in Ossossane, as he and some of the other most skilled *arendiwane* went out to the neighboring towns. These newly elevated *arenidwane* were instructed to send word to Arendiwane after about a week to report on their progress. This they did, reporting half their patients had recovered. Tehorenhaegnon dispatched Saossarinon, his second-in-command, back to Ossossane to help cure the remaining. Unfortunately, Saossarinon seems to have bungled this effort by requiring those who were still sick to come to a centralized place rather than going out to visiting them personally. Saossarinon's failure, according to le Mercier, caused the newly promoted *arendiwane* to renounce their office.

The disease continue through the winter, during which time it appears the *arendiwane* had exhausted their usual remedies without further success. Sondacouane replaced Saossarinon and discouraged the use of  ""French snow"", the sugar the Jesuits had been using as bribes for children. Sondacouane's stated reason for this ban was that he believed it to a poison the French used to spread the disease, while le Mercier believed the ban came because ""the Devil knows well enough how much these little sweets have already aided us in wrestling from his hands so many souls..."" 

By the end of spring, the Wendat were increasingly blaming the French for the disease. More people died as the weather improved than they did during the bitter winter and those who had recently received baptism were frequently among the dead. Additionally, the Algonquins to the east renounced the belief that the disease had been caused by their native manitou, but was instead caused by the French. Occasionally, a Frenchwoman, identified as the sister of Etienne Brule, was thought to breath the disease onto people in her attempt to avenge her brother, who had died mysteriously among the Huron in 1632. Others believe the Jesuit missionaries themselves were using their spiritual powers to spread the disease since, as mentioned earlier, they flocked to the ill and dying in hopes of winning converts. Luckily for the Jesuits, many of the *garihoua* valued their alliance with the French too much to believe this themselves. As the disease waned in the summer, tensions eased before, as the *garihoua* feared, someone acted violently upon that belief.

However, in 1639, smallpox made its first appearance among the Wendat. Some of the Wendat who lived near the Jesuit missions on the shores of Lake Ontario had gone to the French colony of Quebec, and one had come back with the disease. He died soon after returning home and, as Jerome Lalemant wrote: ""[W]ithin a few days, almost everyone in the cabin of the deceased was infected, and then the disease spread from house to house, from town to town, and eventually the entire country...""

Because the unnamed Wendat Patient Zero lived close to the Jesuits, the missionaries again were blamed for the disease. ""They observed, with some basis in reason,"" Lalemant wrote, ""that since our arrival in these lands, those who were nearest to us happened to be those most ruined by the diseases and that the towns that welcomed us now appeared utterly exterminated. [...]In a word, we were dreaded as the greatest sorcerers on earth. Wherein truly it must be acknowledged that these poor people are in some sense excusable. For it has happened very often, and has been remarked more than a hundred times, that where we were most welcome and baptized the greatest number of people was in fact where the greatest number died. Conversely, in the cabins to which we were denied entrance, though they were sometimes extremely sick, at the end of a few days one saw every person happily cured.""

At this point, even the *garihoua* were starting to disapprove of the Jesuits' presence. Popular opinion was against the missionaries, and even in the councils the *garihoua* were increasingly voting to put the missionaries to death and to renounce the alliance between Wendake and France, ""[...] with only a few elders kindly obliging us with a verdict of banishment,"" as Lalemant put it. The Jesuits were permitted to remain in a few missions on the southern fringe of Wendake, as a token of the continued alliance, and as such, they were later on the front lines of the Haudenosaunee conquest of Wendake ten years later.",null,0,cdplvg6,1rlm4x,askhistorians,top_week,3

anthropology_nerd,"Some of your assumptions about the nature of disease spread in the Americas after contact are a little off.  Mortality due to infectious disease varied from region to region.  Some areas saw high mortality mostly due to disease (Valley of Mexico, for example).  In some locations the story is a bit more nuanced with depopulation occurring due to a combination of infectious disease, warfare, the Indian slave trade, famine, territorial displacement, etc. (like in the Eastern U.S.).

I'm not an oral historian, but I do know of artistic/historical representations of epidemic disease.  Certain Northern Plains tribes (the Lakota, Kiowa, Mandan, and Dakota) kept historic records in the form of [Winter Counts](http://wintercounts.si.edu/).  Winter Counts are a pictorial history of the most important event of each year.  Put together the count tells the history of the group, and each image for each year serves as a bit of a mnemonic device for the keeper of the count to relate the historical narrative.  Images of novel diseases appear on average every 5.7 years in the combined Winter Counts, with 36 epidemics recorded between 1714 and 1919 ([Sundstrom 1997](http://www.academicroom.com/article/smallpox-used-them-references-epidemic-disease-northern-plains-winter-counts-1714-1920)).  We have at least one count (John Bear) covering 30 years before 1714, with no record of infectious disease.  We don't always know what specific disease caused the mortality event, but smallpox and/or measles shows up with regularity every generation or so.

Lever actions are more difficult to fire from a prone position or leaning on a flat surface like a bench. 

Bolt actions are more accurate over distance, partly because the action can withstand the greater bore pressure of longer range cartridges. Also, Lever action guns have a 2 piece stock which creates wobble, and require flat tipped bullets, both of which make them less accurate. 

Bolt actions are a little simpler to work on, and strip and clean, especially in the field. 

Lever actions are a little quicker to reload and get off snap shots, and some prefer them for this (some people also prefer them because they are kind of cool to shoot).

BeondTheGrave,"The Russian Revolution has its roots in the various structural problems of the Russian Empire. See, the Tsars ruled as an absolute monarch, they were the font of all political power. After the French Revolution, the idea of democracy and political freedom spread across Europe. And the 1848 revolutions across Europe further spread the idea of democracy across Europe. However, Russia took part in none of these developments. Instead, these ideas infiltrated Russia, and the people of Russia. But political change was slow in coming, the Tsar only ended the practice of serfdom (basically slavery) in 1861. By 1900 the Russian political system had changed little since 1815. But the Russian people, who had been denied even the most fundamental reforms which had happened in the rest of Europe, had become extremely radicalized. 

So in 1905 Russia went to war with Japan over control over Manchuria and northern Korea. The Tsar committed the majority of the Russian Army to the Manchurian front, where it was quickly defeated by the Japanese. At home, the Russian people felt that they had been pushed into war by the Tsar, who then led them to defeat. They seized the opportunity and launched a major strike (in 1906) which turned into bloody street battles between protesters and the army. The Tsar quickly realized that the situation was spiraling out of control, and that he did not have the army forces to suppress the revolution. While the Russo-Japanese war ended during the early days of the protests (at the Treaty of Portsmouth, thank you Teddy Roosevelt), the Army was still largely in the East, trying to navigate the inefficient Trans-Siberian Railroad. So the Tsar was persuaded that he should accept the protesters demands, and began to negotiate. What came out was an elected body of representatives called the Duma. This Duma was supposed to have some oversight over the running of the Russian government, the passing of laws, and things like that. But it was hardly representative (every adult male *could* vote, but only the nobles had any real power, their votes were weighted to have the most effect. The votes of the Bourgeoisie were weighted less. But the Peasant and workers classes' votes were so diluted that they had very little electoral power over the Duma). 

And during the process of these negotiations, the Army returned from the East in large numbers. They quickly suppressed continued protests (like in Moscow, around the Moscow Soviet. Also: the first of the Soviets were created during this period, the Petersburg Soviet) and ended any attempt to further extend the revolution. But most Russians were happy with this situation, as they got a parliament (essentially) and some kind of say in how Russia was to be run. But importantly, Tsar Nicholas II still maintained that he was the absolute autarch of Russia, and that the Duma was merely an extension of *his* power. (In the United Kingdom, for example, the King/Queen has their powers, but Parliament has its own powers which are derived from the natural sovereignty **of the people**. Essentially Parliament represents all of the people in the UK, andy by their will passes laws. In Russia, the Duma was an extension of Nicholas' personal power, it served *him*) But Nicholas was not a huge fan of this settlement. There are various debates as to what his political philosophy was. Some authors (like Richard Pipes) argue that Nicholas really believed the oath he took during his coronation, that he was promising God that he would preserve Russian autocracy. Others (like myself), would argue that Nicholas like the status of being an absolute autarch, and didnt want to throw that privilege away. But why he did what he did isnt important for this post. What is important is that Nicholas set himself to work, following the 1906 revolution, destroying the independence and power of the Russian Duma. By using secret provisions of the settlement of 1906 (I believe it was called the October Note) Nicholas was able to disband the Duma at will, call for new elections, and then in the interim rule by decree. So basically, whenever the Duma began to challenge the Tsar, he would disband it then postpone elections till he got his political agenda settled. People quickly became disillusioned with the Duma, which was essentially reduced to the status of a debate club (and a very mild one at that!)

Flash forward to 1914. The Duma had been ""defanged"", and the Tsar unilaterally supported his Serbian and French allies in attacking Germany. But like in 1905, the Russian army was severely handled by the Germans in every campaign (except the Brusilov Offensive (1916), neat stuff. The Russians invented a new kind of tactics and made some modest gains against the Germans, which is amazing considering every other battle seemed to range from a major setback to a catastrophic route. The Germans then adapted these tactics into *Hutier* Tactics, and proceeded to smash the French and British.) Now, Tsar Nicholas was very upset with his Generals. He wanted more control over the affairs of the army, in an attempt to prevent more major disasters. So he made himself the Supreme Commander of the Russian forces, and moved to the city of Mogilev, where he personally commanded the armies. This was a terrible idea, because it removed any buffer between the Tsar and direct military failure. There was no longer anybody at the top of the army that the Tsar could point to and say ""It was his fault!"", because he was that guy. So as the Russian army continued to suffer major defeats, it started to make the Tsar look incompetent, or worse. It is important to mention that even after all that had happened in 1906, and despite all the privations of World War One, the Russian people still looked up to the Tsar as a sort of father figure (more like God as a father than my dad as a father). So the common Russian generally assumed that the military defeats were somebody else's fault, not the Tsar's. While this will continue into the Revolution, the direct command of the Army severely weakened the Tsar's image as the infallible father. ",null,0,cdollj0,1rlp1g,askhistorians,top_week,4
Acritas,"&gt;the entire country of hungary erupted in an unplanned, unprecendented mass revolt
---

I see issues with almost every word in your statement:

* *unplanned* - some sort of armed rebellion was planned by leaders with military experience (Béla Király fought along germans until 1944). Yes, it didn't went according to the plan, but it's often the case with revolts. 'A certain colonel' played significant role in radicalization of peaceful demonstration. There were training camps in forest around Miscolz and austrian-hungarian border was still porous - USSR troops left Austria in 1955. CIA operatives shuttled thru the border - see [1].

* *unprecedented* - it certainly has precedents - mass riots of 1947 in Eastern Germany and demonstration in Poznan, Poland in 1956 just a day prior to violent uprising - for example. In fact, delayed USSR response to Budapest demonstration explained by attention to events in Poznan.

* *Soviet occupation* - USSR forces in Hungary were far outnumbered by hungarian army. They were organized into Osobyi Corpus (Special Corp) and consisted of 2nd and 17th Guards mechanized divisions plus 172th and 195th air divisions. Their primary objective was defense of austrian-hungarian border and they were stationed close to the border. 

* *mass revolt* - there were mass riots in several cities against hungarian regime, not a mass revolt against *soviet occupation*. Many hungarian communists (and their family members) were hung in city streets without any due process - Béla Király and Joseph Dudasz fighters were mostly responsible. **Hungarian army did not support insurgents and remained mostly passive throughout revolt**. In some places insurgents fought against each other. Heck, Gabor's girlfriend was shot in cinema Corvin (last holdout of insurgents). Pro-regime officers and workers organized militia which fought with rebels too, along with soviet soldiers. Rural areas and small towns remained mostly quiet. Here goes *entire country* of your statement.

Facts that some leaders were tainted by association with Horti regime and bloodthirstiness explain muted western response. 

For example, Gen. Pál Maléter ordered to shoot 12 rebels, implicated in mass killings - over Béla Király objections. Note that not just individual communists were executed - their family members were often killed/raped/tortured too.

&gt;Were there any attempts to liberate other Warsaw Pact countries in the aftermath of the hungarian revolt?
---

No, there wasn't - as on one hand USSR acted quickly and forcefully and on another anti-communists insurgents didn't have complete support of whole populace. 

USSR feared that Yugoslavia might intervene against USSR (Tito spat with Stalin and they call each other nasty names, tension between USSR and Yugoslavia persisted even after Stalin's death), but to Khruschev surprise, Tito supported USSR and even proposed to help.

USSR also indicated that any overt foreign support might lead to the full-scale war. Hungarian communists promised and then enacted reforms which allowed small businesses and stopped push to soviet-style economy, it stopped anti-communist trend in society. Hungary was the most 'capitalistic' country of the whole Warsaw Pact (Yugoslavia even more so, but it wasn't a Pact member). 

USSR took a lesson to allow more leeway in economies of Warsaw Pact countries. Many 'capitalistic' things were allowed in Eastern Europe that were no-no inside USSR (like small but private businesses, cash exchanges and unimpeded travel to capitalist countries). At the same time, USSR put more troops in Hungary and Czechoslovakia (came in handy later, in 1968, with much less blood) and formulated *Brezhnev' doctrine*, watching more closely all developments, as in Hungary events USSR clearly missed signals about incoming troubles.

Spinoza42,"The western powers did not respond militarily. Essentially the official position in most countries was that the Soviets were free to do as they pleased in their sphere of influence. But of course these events bolstered the idea that the West had the unique position of defending freedom. But rather than take this as a starting point for intervention, most politicians took it to showcase the difference between the two systems.

For the public opinion in the West the crushing of the Hungarian uprising was devastating to the Soviet communist cause. Leftist parties generally denounced the move. Together with Khrushchev's revelations about the evils of Stalin, this caused most leftist parties in the West to break completely with the communist parties of the Warsaw pact.

As to pro-hungarian independence movements, this was a time in which people were more organized in political parties and churches, not in movements. A lot of organizations did get involved with helping Hungarian refugees though. The Hungarian refugees of 1956 are still a known group, and few groups of foreigners are treated with as much respect as they are.

The pope aked all the catholics of the world to pray for the victory of the revolution. Several country sent blood, drugs and food to the hungarian redcross.  
  
The USA broadcasted a radio which was called Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty giving its Hungarian listeners false hope of Western military assistance. Eisenhower on oktober 31st said that the United States not looking on the new hungarian goverment as a potential ally and not gonna give military help to the hungarians. So with this, Moscow basically got the approval for the invasion.  
  
After the revolution was crushed, in 1957  Dag Hammarskjöld UN general secretary raised a special committee to investigate the hungarian events. The committe listened to 111 refugee, they examined countless of documents, newspapers, radio records, photos, films and 200 witness  written reports. Hungary (aka Moscow) didn't allowed the UN committee members into the country, and the soviet goverment didn't even bothered to respond to the written request for information. In June, 1957 the final report was presented by the committee, which has 268no. of pages. [You can check it outh here](http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf)

cdb03b,"Well Harvest festivals and feast have been a part of most cultures, particularly European cultures, for thousands of years. 

The American Thanksgiving has some window dressing involving the Pilgrims, Native Americans, and ""first thangksgiving"" but that is mostly just decoration theme and history lesson that is likely equal myth to fact.

For the most part the holiday is about getting together with friends and family, enjoying each others company and eating lots of good foods that are not commonly eaten the rest of the year. Just like all harvest feasts. We also watch parades, and American Football. Some families also have traditions of playing card games, playing music and singing, playing board games, playing outdoor games (touch football, horse shoes, washers, badminton,  kickball, catch, etc).

mormengil,"There is mythology.  There is history.  There is actual practice.  All are different.  As usual, the mythology is the most interesting.

The mythology:

In 1620 the Pilgrims traveled from England to Plymouth Plantation to establish the 2nd English colony in North America aboard the good ship ""Mayflower"".  They were unable to practice their religion in England, so they were coming to America in search of religious freedom.

They didn't have much of a clue how to be pioneers, or farmers, or survive in a wilderness (being urban types), so, many of the poor Pilgrims died in the first harsh New England Winter.  

Luckily they met a friendly Indian named Squanto, who spoke English.  He helped them make friends with the local Indians.  They taught the Pilgrims to grow North American foods, like corn, and hunt North American game, like Turkeys.  

As the second winter approached, the Pilgrims collected their harvest and were content, for they had a mighty surplus of provisions.  So they had a great feast of Thanksgiving, where they invited the Indians and spent 3 days feasting and having a great time.

Today we continue this tradition, having a feast of New World foods (Turkey, Cranberries, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, Corn, Pumpkin Pie), and giving thanks for our blessings.

That's the myth.

The History:

Oddly enough, pretty much the same as the myth!  OK, our eminent historians can nit-pick at the details, and argue about whether today's tradition truly descends in unbroken tradition from the Pilgrims, and just what they ate at the feast, and how many Indians were there.

Essentially, the Myth is the Reality (which is very cool!)

The Practice Today:

Well, oddly enough, it is a HUGE American holiday.  The busiest travel days of the year are just before and after Thanksgiving.  The airlines get all snarled up.  The airports are jammed.  Everyone goes to get together with family.  Everyone but killjoys and iconoclasts eats way too much turkey.  Lots of people watch football on TV in the afternoon.  Lots of people go shopping for Christmas present bargains on ""Black Friday"" (the Friday after Thanksgiving - which, by the way is always on the 4th Thursday in November, so it is one of those annoying holidays which moves its date around, but on the plus side, everyone gets a four day weekend).

There you go.  Thanksgiving in a nutshell.  It is such a cool holiday that the envious Canadians had to copy it (but put theirs on a different date).  It is such a good holiday that I wouldn't be surprised to see it creep into Britain sooner or later.  Come on over and enjoy it yourself some time (though you really need to get some American friends to spend it with,  It is a family holiday, not a public sort of thing).",null,0,cdoof4u,1rlt5m,askhistorians,top_week,2

itsallfolklore,"This is an excerpt from an ""Introduction to Folklore"" I am putting together. The text deals with Campbell (who I regard as Jung-lite):

In the last part of the twentieth century, Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) created a great deal of interest in mythology and folklore with a series of publications on the subject. This was followed by a 1980s television series, and the result was extremely popular with the general public, but not necessarily with all within the discipline of folklore. To a certain extent, Campbell was relying on an older approach that Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) developed. Jung was a Swiss psychologist who studied with Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) but later broke with his mentor’s teachings to form his own approach to the study of the human mind. Jung developed the idea of the collective unconscious, maintaining in almost spiritual terms that all of humanity is linked by an unconscious common denominator. Ultimately, Jung implied that certain themes are woven into the fabric of the universe. This results, according to Jung, in a shared symbolic vocabulary, which manifests in dreams, mythology, folklore, and literature.

Jungian psychology was extremely popular during the upheavals of the 1960s when people looked for mystical explanations of life to unify all existence. In spite of the faddish qualities of late twentieth-century consumption of Jungian ideas, it is easy to regard Jung as an exceptional thinker with an extraordinary background of diverse reading. Campbell borrowed heavily from Jung, presenting many of these ideas in an easily consumable package that, itself, became something of a fad during the 1980s. Campbell drew not only on Jung, but also on Otto Rank’s 1932 publication, The Myth of the Birth of the Hero.

There are clearly many good ideas in this literature, but there are problems with this approach from the point of view of folklore studies. The first is that this body of literature presents the concept of tale types in mythology and folklore as though it were a new discovery. In other words, Jung and Campbell ignore the highly developed bibliography that folklore offers. The second, more serious problem is that there is no distinction between the core of a story and its culturally-specific or narrator-specific variants and variations. The Jungian-Campbell approach treats any variant of a story as an expression of the collective unconscious, regardless of whether its particular form is the product of an individual storyteller’s idiosyncrasies or of the cultural predilections of a region made irrelevant by traveling to the next valley. This does not mean that there are no valuable insights in Jung and Campbell’s literature. There is, of course, but folklorists regard their approach as removed from their own discipline and flawed, to a certain extent.

Folklorist Alan Dundes presented a similar critique of Freudian-based psychoanalysis of folktales. In his The Study of Folklore (1965), he wrote that “the analysis is usually based upon only one version… To comparative folklorists who are accustomed to examining hundreds of versions of a folktale or folksong before arriving at even a tentative conclusion, this apparent cavalier approach to folklore goes very much against the grain. How does the analyst know, for example, whether or not the particular version he is using is typical and representative.” (107) Dundes also pointed out that often the “variant” presented by the psychological analysis is from “a children’s literature anthology, rather than directly from oral tradition.”

yodatsracist,"Remember, the Martial Race theory came to fruition not in the early part of British colonialism where the East Indian Company was actually conquering land (the two Anglo-Sikh wars were between 1846-1849; the ""Gorkha War"" was 1816-18, the Third and final Maratha War was 1817–1818, etc.).  The ""martial race"" idea was really put into practice only *after* the Rebellion of 1857 (the ""Sepoy Mutiny"").  Who were the ""martial races""?  According to Pradeep Barua's ""Inventing Race: The British and India's Marital Races"", *Historian* 58:1, 1995, pg. 110-1:

&gt;Martial races became a concern immediately after the outbreak of the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857, when the government conducted an official inquiry into the causes of the munity.  The report of the Peel Commission concluded that the British had been unaware of the true martial attributes possessed by various Indian ethnic groups.  According to the report, the mutiny had started with the Brahmins, whose high caste made them scheming and dishonest.  Such high-caste domination of the Bengal Army had interfered with the traditional Indian social structure and provoked the munity.  This simple explanation appealed to the British administrators at the time.  After all, the Gurkhas, Sikhs, Marathas, and Rajputs--once the most formidable enemies of the British--had remained loyal and accepted British supremacy.  Because these groups understood the meaning of honor, and duty, the British felt that they were India's truly martial people.

Let's just stop here and realize that one of the characteristics of a truly ""martial fighting force"" was their non-rebellion.  If you scan Wikipedia's list of [martial races](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_Race#Tribes_and_groups_designated_as_martial_classes), you'll see several that say ""later excluded for rebellion"" or something similar.  

This of course, was not a satisfactory justification:

&gt;Of the three explanations for the differences between martial and non-martial races in India--climatic theories, physical qualitites, and behavioral characteristics--physical measurement or anthropometry gained the greatest favor [...] 

&gt;Physical measurement formed a crucial element in the recruitment of the martial races.  The chief measurements taken at the recruiting centers were height and chest width.  Although RIsely's methods of measuring skull and nose were not followed, the recruiting handbooks were full of descriptions about these and other physical characteristics of the respective martial classes.

yodatsracist,"Remember, the Martial Race theory came to fruition not in the early part of British colonialism where the East Indian Company was actually conquering land (the two Anglo-Sikh wars were between 1846-1849; the ""Gorkha War"" was 1816-18, the Third and final Maratha War was 1817–1818, etc.).  The ""martial race"" idea was really put into practice only *after* the Rebellion of 1857 (the ""Sepoy Mutiny"").  Who were the ""martial races""?  According to Pradeep Barua's ""Inventing Race: The British and India's Marital Races"", *Historian* 58:1, 1995, pg. 110-1:

&gt;Martial races became a concern immediately after the outbreak of the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857, when the government conducted an official inquiry into the causes of the munity.  The report of the Peel Commission concluded that the British had been unaware of the true martial attributes possessed by various Indian ethnic groups.  According to the report, the mutiny had started with the Brahmins, whose high caste made them scheming and dishonest.  Such high-caste domination of the Bengal Army had interfered with the traditional Indian social structure and provoked the munity.  This simple explanation appealed to the British administrators at the time.  After all, the Gurkhas, Sikhs, Marathas, and Rajputs--once the most formidable enemies of the British--had remained loyal and accepted British supremacy.  Because these groups understood the meaning of honor, and duty, the British felt that they were India's truly martial people.

Let's just stop here and realize that one of the characteristics of a truly ""martial fighting force"" was their non-rebellion.  If you scan Wikipedia's list of [martial races](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_Race#Tribes_and_groups_designated_as_martial_classes), you'll see several that say ""later excluded for rebellion"" or something similar.  

This of course, was not a satisfactory justification:

&gt;Of the three explanations for the differences between martial and non-martial races in India--climatic theories, physical qualitites, and behavioral characteristics--physical measurement or anthropometry gained the greatest favor [...] 

&gt;Physical measurement formed a crucial element in the recruitment of the martial races.  The chief measurements taken at the recruiting centers were height and chest width.  Although RIsely's methods of measuring skull and nose were not followed, the recruiting handbooks were full of descriptions about these and other physical characteristics of the respective martial classes.  The officer who complied the famous handbook, *The Goorkhas*, noted with pride that their ""physique, compact and sturdy build, powerful development, keen sight, acute hearing, and hereditary education as a sportsman, eminently capacitate him for the duties of a light infantry soldier.""  Handbooks went into great detail about distinctive physical characteristics of each of the martial races.

khosikulu,"The piece you're missing is that it didn't start in the Americas.  It started on the African coast, specifically connected to Portuguese planting operations on sugar islands like São Tomé and Principe.  It was initially a matter of convenience: the supply was there, and European indentures were harder to bring down there.  Extending the system from the African coast to the Americas was a matter of proving the economy of scale--as the various companies operating in the Atlantic would do in the second quarter of the 1600s, with murderous results.

The extension of plantation economies comes from there, both in scope (across the Americas) and in types (no longer just sugar, but cotton, tobacco, etc).  The economy of trafficking in African slaves extended too, as much because of inertia as anything else, although the ""marking"" effect of institutional, race-caste slave status remained important.

I'll flesh this out a bit more later, but that's the basic extension system.  Phil Curtin's *The Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex* lays out the basic developments quite nicely, though it's now a little dated.",null,2,cdomf3q,1rm2u6,askhistorians,top_week,10
mormengil,"The British North American colonies were late entrants to the slave trade.

Slavery was a common system in many parts of the world in the 1400s.  It was perhaps most common in Muslim countries such as the Ottoman Empire, and in Sub Saharan Africa.  It also occurred in some Native American societies, in Asia, and in parts of Europe.  Slavery included many different nationalities and types of people.

Slavery was fairly uncommon in Europe in 1400, though serfs were common especially in eastern Europe.

The Portuguese, were the first Europeans to explore down the coasts of Africa, and they found that they could buy slaves there (they also bought slaves in China).  

The real impetus for the trans Atlantic slave trade, however started in the Caribbean.  The Spanish were trying to settle the Caribbean and use Native American Labor to grow crops (especially sugar).  The Native Americans, however, were dying off rapidly from the European diseases which they had no immunity to.  The Spanish, looking for a new source of labor in the Caribbean began to import African slaves.  The first African slaves arrived in Hispaniola and Cuba in the early 1500s.

For most of the entire period of the slave trade, the Caribbean and Brazil were the main destinations for slaves.  Only a small percent of the slave imports went to the British North American colonies.

Check out these maps from a lot of research on individual slaving ship voyages, to get a good picture of the Atlantic African slave trade, where the slaves came from in Africa, and where they went to in the Americas. 

http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/intro-maps.faces

The first slaves in British North America seem to have been 20 Africans brought to Jamestown by a Dutch ship in 1619 and sold as indentured servants.

It took a while for the full blown system of African slavery to consolidate in North America.  

It is thought to have been in place by 1705, with the ""Slave Codes"" becoming law in Virginia.

So, to summarize, the Portuguese ""started"" the African slave trade to Europe (though it existed within Africa and to the Middle East probably before this).  

The Atlantic slave trade took off in the Caribbean and Brazil in the early 1500s.  It came later to the British North American colonies.  At the time of the Pilgrims 1620, it was in its infancy in Virginia.  

People did not bring over slaves they had in Europe to the Americas (there may have been a handful of exceptions).  Slaves were imported directly from Africa and sold in the British North American colonies.

Keep in mind that the Carribbean islands during the 16 and 17th centuries were much more dangerous than the American colonies as far as disease is concerned, so the sheer number of slaves needed to be imported to Haiti and Trinidad due to the high mortality rate means that something like 5% of all slave trade involved the original 13 colonies.

brak60,"Oscar Brockett in the ""bible"" of theatre history survey books _A History of the Theatre_ notes this lineage: The accepted chronology: Japanese theatre begins after the reign of Prince Shotoku (573-621 CE), who had actively sought out Chinese influences. Chinese theatre begins after borrowing much from Indian music and dance forms for over 400 years, and Indian theatre begins more than 100 years after Alexander the Great invaded north India in 326BCE. So it can be argued there is an influence from Greek theatre into these forms, BUT the theatres of each were unique and distinct. 
Kabuki reached a distinct form starting around 1603 (roughly around the time that Shakespeare was writing _Othello_ and about four years after _Hamlet_) and was initially based on improvised dances by female prostitutes. In an effort to curb prostitution, women were forbidden from performing Kabuki, so the main performers became young men. Shortly thereafter, the young men were similarly tied into prostitution, so they were banned from performing. Only older men were now allowed to perform, but they were required to shave the front half of the top of their heads to make them less attractive and prevent any possibility of prostitution. This is where the tradition of the onnagata comes from of a man playing a woman in Kabuki performances comes from. (The Onnagata tradition is an interesting one, but I digress) Most of the standard Kabuki traditions were formed in about a 75 year period between 1675 and 1750. If you're looking for a good example, check out _The Love Suicides at Sonezake_ by Chikamatsu (considered *the* writer of Kabuki). Donald Keene does some good translations.

---

On a side note to u/brak60 excellent answer you may want to add Kyōgen to your list. Bunraku is a less of a theatrical performance than Kyōgen, who has evolved alongside Nō but is distinctly different from both Nō and Kabuki.

Most Kyōgen plays last for  twenty minutes are done by two to three actors on a very minimalist  stage with little to no accessories (hence close to Nō) but feature funny and light short stories where laugh from the relaxed audience is expected (hence close to the vibrant and exciting Kabuki). 

Some excellent actors are involved - even if they are less famous than the Kabuki or Nō ones. Many different branch coexists (some use masks etc) and you may see them in various festivals, they are quite easily understood and enjoyable for foreigners. Kyoto in spring and autumn has several good Kyogen display (mostly free) and one especially good in Yasaka jinja during Gion Matsuris, so opportunities to see some are plenty for foreign tourists.

ArcherTarith,"According to the Cambridge Guide To Asian Theatre: Noh was developed from the earlier sarugaku noh by Kan'ami Kiyotsugu in the 14th century.  Kan'ami combined rhythmic dance with the popular narrative songs of the time and structured his plays as ""...virtual monodramas..in which the crucial event in the life of the chief character...was remembered and re-enacted."" The Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu became a patron of noh in 1374 and noh continued to develop as a style of court entertainment. 
Kabuki emerged in the 17th century as a form of popular entertainment, as has already been described in this thread. By the early 18th century, the key elements of kabuki were in place--such as the all adult male cast and day-long multi-act plays--and Kabuki grew as a popular, urban form of theater despite official attempts to suppress it. 
Bunraku, in its current form, emerged in Osaka between 1720 and 1740. In 1724 Yoshida Bunzaburo developed the three-man puppet, allowing for an expressive puppet performance that could rival the performance of the live kabuki actors. As bunraku became popular, kabuki actors started to borrow puppet movement techniques and adaptations of puppet plays moved into the kabuki repertory. Conversely, the puppeteers studied kabuki productions and imitated kabuki actors.
TL;DR Noh developed as a kind of high class entertainment; kabuki and bunraku were popular entertainment. Kabuki and bunraku performers heavily influenced each other, and that's why kabuki and bunraku appear similar.

Starnold87,"I am going to attempt to help answer this question with three relevancies. The first is the idea set out by the Battle of Thermopylae, which illustrates in example battle pulses and the array of battle written by Herodotus. The second will be using a biography on Scipio Africanus specifically speaking about the Battle of Ilipia written by B. H. Liddell Hart. The third will not be a cited source as much as a reference to a pop culture movie in order to create a modern depiction of events, the movie being Black Hawk Down.

As many people know the basis of the Battle of Thermopylae c480BCE was between the famous 300 Spartans and the Persian army led by Xerxes, we do know however, that the Greco-army contained far greater number (300 Spartans, 500 men from Tegea, 500 men from Mantinea, 120 from orchomenus and 1000 from Arcadia, 400 from Corinth, 200 from Phlius, 80 from Mycenae, 700 from Tespia, and 400 from Thebes)1. It was at the mountain pass, specifically a rebuilt gate, that they held the Persians. The text suggests that there were battle pulses, or times where the battle raged and then fell, “The Medes charged, and in the struggle which ensued many fell…all day the battle continue; the Medes, after their rough handling, were at length withdrawn and in their place…the King’s Immortals-who advanced to attack…”2 This suggests, that at times there was full on battle with a skirmish, but then at times there was nothing. In other words there were “pulses” where battle picked up and then battle fell. Further, it can be seen further in the passage “Next day the fighting began again…”3 This would suggest that the battles ended sometime during the evening/night only to be renewed at a later date. This here would give men time to eat, relieve themselves and sleep. Further (sorry for bringing in another source) in Plutarch’s writings On Sparta, he states that Leonidas had told his men, “…to eat breakfast in the expectation that they would be having dinner in Hades.”4 While these texts do not write in plain text, “they took a break so they could have chow and rest,” it does suggest that there was relatively a time for battle and a time for sleep, eating, and rest. Further, this text would show that battles did indeed extend over a course of numerous days and was common to do so. Therefore a battle cannot be seen as one act of fighting, but rather continuous pulses or skirmishes with rest in between. This text does not clearly relate to the Roman-era, to do so, looking into the next text will better be able to paint a picture of what Roman war was like, in comparison to the Greco way of war. 

Much like the Greeks, it would seem that there were times set aside for sleeping and eating and times for fighting in the Roman-era. One of the great generals of the time Scipio Africanus (the conqueror of Africa) fought many battles against the Carthaginians, the Battle of Ilipia will be focused on for point of the question. During the Battle of Ilipia, Scipio applied many strategies but the one that stands out, is that the two armies, the one led by Scipio and the Carthaginian army would come out and meet each other on the field of battle but not fight for multiple days (there is no clear time frame).5 Scipio did this to establish strategy that will not be discussed, but it does show that this was not an unusual tactic as the Carthaginian’s were not thrown by this tactic. In one specific part of the text however, it does state that there was a time that the armies would meet one another on the field.

“He (Scipio) observed that the Carthaginians made their daily advance at a late hour, and had himself purposely waited still later, to fix this habit on his opponent’s mind. Late in the evening he sent orders through the camp that the troops should be fed and armed before daylight, and the cavalry have their horses saddled.”6

This text in itself accurately depicts that the battles would potentially be fought during different times of the day much like the Greco-Persian battle at Thermopylae. After having made his aforementioned orders, Scipio had his men attack outlying Carthaginian camps and retreat, while having his main force simply stand and face his opponents main force earlier in the day compared to before, thus making the Carthaginian army recognize their loss of breakfast.7 Again this depicts that there were times that were set aside for resting, eating, and sleeping. The fact is that Scipio was smart in changing the time he forced his opponent to appear, thus they had not been fed and were starving facing his army, while his men were well fed and prepared for battle. This would ultimately lead to his victory in that battle. The message however, stands that not only would armies fight these skirmishes, (Scipio having his men attack outlying camps, then retreat) but also would have a such times where battles did not occur. 

Finally, while not a reputable source, the movie Black Hawk Down, does depict in a way how modern military fights its wars and how they relate all the way back to the Greco-army way of fighting. In the battle the forces fight throughout the day and night. Now while they are not continually shooting or moving, sometimes being holed up at a certain position, there were points where they would fight heavily then rest or wait till the enemy made another move. This relates back to the texts as it shows that while we may not have always had an orderly time to go and eat or sleep, these “pulses” where there are skirmishes then stops in battle, do show that there does seem to be some sort of pattern that would allow individuals time to sleep, eat, or relieve themselves. 

Overall, I know that I was able to provide only one source to directly identify a Roman-era battle, but you can see over the course of thousands of years we still keep the “pulse” mentality. This would mean that there would be times where men would sleep, eat, and relieve themselves in between the calamity of battle. Feel free to look into my sources more in depth to find out more not only about these battles but others. Hope I helped answer your question to some degree!

BrownKid85,"It seems that the battles that lasted multiple days in the roman army were actually very rare. I just watched the same video and went online searching for the answer. http://www.romanarmytalk.com/17-roman-military-history-a-archaeology/266917-duration-of-ancient-battles.html 

This forum thread discusses specific battles and sources for examples on multiple day battles. 

But in general, multiple day battles involved minor skirmishes with small groups of the actual army. In fact, most were screening forces that would engage for a short time interval and then retreat. At night, forces would retreat because it was very difficult to fight large scale battles because maneuvering a large force such as the roman army would become difficult. 

The men would then retreat back to their camps which would usually be a mile or so from the front line so that enough space could be provided to allow sentries to spot the enemy advance in time to form up the army as well as maintain the army close enough to the front line to be able to engage without walking too far of a distance.

The camps they constructed, called castras, were the forward base camps for the Roman army. They would select the one appropriate to the length of time a legion would spend in it: tertia castra, quarta castra, etc., ""a camp of three days"", ""four days"", etc. would be a temporary camp that was constructed for the duration of the fighting. In fact, every soldier carried tools for digging and constructing a castra. 

Through the use of the army as a building force to build a temporary fortification, the army could build and maintain a base for the duration of a multiday battle. But again, these battles were not the norm.",null,2,cdos0cs,1rm8e9,askhistorians,top_week,18

The text suggests that there were battle pulses, or times where the battle raged and then fell, “The Medes charged, and in the struggle which ensued many fell…all day the battle continue; the Medes, after their rough handling, were at length withdrawn and in their place…the King’s Immortals-who advanced to attack…”2 This suggests, that at times there was full on battle with a skirmish, but then at times there was nothing. In other words there were “pulses” where battle picked up and then battle fell. Further, it can be seen further in the passage “Next day the fighting began again…”3 This would suggest that the battles ended sometime during the evening/night only to be renewed at a later date. This here would give men time to eat, relieve themselves and sleep. Further (sorry for bringing in another source) in Plutarch’s writings On Sparta, he states that Leonidas had told his men, “…to eat breakfast in the expectation that they would be having dinner in Hades.”4 While these texts do not write in plain text, “they took a break so they could have chow and rest,” it does suggest that there was relatively a time for battle and a time for sleep, eating, and rest. Further, this text would show that battles did indeed extend over a course of numerous days and was common to do so. Therefore a battle cannot be seen as one act of fighting, but rather continuous pulses or skirmishes with rest in between. This text does not clearly relate to the Roman-era, to do so, looking into the next text will better be able to paint a picture of what Roman war was like, in comparison to the Greco way of war. 

Much like the Greeks, it would seem that there were times set aside for sleeping and eating and times for fighting in the Roman-era. One of the great generals of the time Scipio Africanus (the conqueror of Africa) fought many battles against the Carthaginians, the Battle of Ilipia will be focused on for point of the question. During the Battle of Ilipia, Scipio applied many strategies but the one that stands out, is that the two armies, the one led by Scipio and the Carthaginian army would come out and meet each other on the field of battle but not fight for multiple days (there is no clear time frame).5 Scipio did this to establish strategy that will not be discussed, but it does show that this was not an unusual tactic as the Carthaginian’s were not thrown by this tactic. In one specific part of the text however, it does state that there was a time that the armies would meet one another on the field.

“He (Scipio) observed that the Carthaginians made their daily advance at a late hour, and had himself purposely waited still later, to fix this habit on his opponent’s mind. Late in the evening he sent orders through the camp that the troops should be fed and armed before daylight, and the cavalry have their horses saddled.”6

This text in itself accurately depicts that the battles would potentially be fought during different times of the day much like the Greco-Persian battle at Thermopylae. After having made his aforementioned orders, Scipio had his men attack outlying Carthaginian camps and retreat, while having his main force simply stand and face his opponents main force earlier in the day compared to before, thus making the Carthaginian army recognize their loss of breakfast.7 Again this depicts that there were times that were set aside for resting, eating, and sleeping. The fact is that Scipio was smart in changing the time he forced his opponent to appear, thus they had not been fed and were starving facing his army, while his men were well fed and prepared for battle. This would ultimately lead to his victory in that battle. The message however, stands that not only would armies fight these skirmishes, (Scipio having his men attack outlying camps, then retreat) but also would have a such times where battles did not occur. 

Finally, while not a reputable source, the movie Black Hawk Down, does depict in a way how modern military fights its wars and how they relate all the way back to the Greco-army way of fighting. In the battle the forces fight throughout the day and night. Now while they are not continually shooting or moving, sometimes being holed up at a certain position, there were points where they would fight heavily then rest or wait till the enemy made another move. This relates back to the texts as it shows that while we may not have always had an orderly time to go and eat or sleep, these “pulses” where there are skirmishes then stops in battle, do show that there does seem to be some sort of pattern that would allow individuals time to sleep, eat, or relieve themselves. 

Overall, I know that I was able to provide only one source to directly identify a Roman-era battle, but you can see over the course of thousands of years we still keep the “pulse” mentality. This would mean that there would be times where men would sleep, eat, and relieve themselves in between the calamity of battle. Feel free to look into my sources more in depth to find out more not only about these battles but others. Hope I helped answer your question to some degree!

BrownKid85,"It seems that the battles that lasted multiple days in the roman army were actually very rare. I just watched the same video and went online searching for the answer. http://www.romanarmytalk.com/17-roman-military-history-a-archaeology/266917-duration-of-ancient-battles.html 

This forum thread discusses specific battles and sources for examples on multiple day battles. 

But in general, multiple day battles involved minor skirmishes with small groups of the actual army. In fact, most were screening forces that would engage for a short time interval and then retreat. At night, forces would retreat because it was very difficult to fight large scale battles because maneuvering a large force such as the roman army would become difficult. 

The men would then retreat back to their camps which would usually be a mile or so from the front line so that enough space could be provided to allow sentries to spot the enemy advance in time to form up the army as well as maintain the army close enough to the front line to be able to engage without walking too far of a distance.

The camps they constructed, called castras, were the forward base camps for the Roman army. They would select the one appropriate to the length of time a legion would spend in it: tertia castra, quarta castra, etc., ""a camp of three days"", ""four days"", etc. would be a temporary camp that was constructed for the duration of the fighting. In fact, every soldier carried tools for digging and constructing a castra. 

Through the use of the army as a building force to build a temporary fortification, the army could build and maintain a base for the duration of a multiday battle. But again, these battles were not the norm.",null,2,cdos0cs,1rm8e9,askhistorians,top_week,18

Military experts, historians and philosophers keep arguing around the causes of war and the access to resources seems to be one of the most important ones (land, water, raw materials, etc).
Now many would make use of the religious factor and add it to the recipe. Imperial Spain sustained a long bitter war with Protestants in center Europe back in the 16th century; Crusades need little introduction and coming closer to our time the Crimean War in the 19th century is described as a war to protect religious interest (again may be used as an excuse not the real reason but...religion came into the picture).

Badgerfest,"*On Her their Lives Depend*, by Angela Woollacott is an excellent account of British women's roles in industry during the Great War and the socio-economic effects it had on Britain's culture and the role of women.  The book takes its name from [this recruiting poster]( http://cf067b.medialib.glogster.com/media/4d/4dfaaba1bfbcd956b6b49437e8a49b866fa6851e3d04d8a42cf9ceed31585442/her-their-lives-depend.jpg), which is one of my favourite posters from this period.

Other useful sources are *Arms and the Wizard* by R J A Adams, which discusses David Lloyd George's work at the Ministry of Munitions in 1915/6 and Dewar's *The Great Munitions Feat* which was written in 1921 as part assessment/part puff-piece about the production of weapons and munitions in Britain during the great War.

Early estimates ahead of the outbreak of war were that Britain would face widespread unemployment.  The logic went that the collapse of trade routes would affect the balance of payments and large sectors of the country's industry would suffer as a result.  There was no prediction concerning the “total war” which was to follow, everyone who mattered expected a limited conflict.  As a result British industry was caught off guard and when Field Marshal French claimed (spuriously) that the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in early 1915 had been unsuccessful because of a shortage of munitions, a state of affairs known as the “Shells Crisis” ensued.  This coincided with the collapse of the Liberal government and the establishment of a coalition; some historians have argued that the crisis was a factor in the collapse.

Either way Lloyd George was appointed Minister of Munitions of War and found himself in an utterly unenviable position – British industry was far from capable of dealing with the demands of the war, the scale of which was increasing rapidly.  Far from unemployment rising, Kitchener’s drive for volunteers and the ever present threat of conscription risked denuding industry of the manpower it needed in order to feed the war machine.  Lloyd George fought to prevent skilled workers from joining up, bringing him into direct conflict with Kitchener, and worked hard to introduce unskilled workers into factories where he faced strong opposition form Trades Union who saw it as a threat to their members.

He achieved some success with retaining skilled workers and eventually won over the Unions, but the transition to a total war economy combined with armed forces far larger than Britain had ever seen before to create a manpower crisis.  This is where women came in.  A previously untapped resource, the opportunity to bring women into the industry was seized upon by some, but opposed by many.  With one eye on a post-war world, many opponents feared the introduction of women to the workplace citing a breakdown of society if women chose work rather than motherhood.  Naturally the Trades Union feared further dilution of the workforce and thus a threat to their monopolies and there were concerns raised about women’s physical fitness for the manual work required in factories.  There can be no doubt, however, that women workers were invaluable to the war effort.

Woollacot argues that for working class women this amounted to little more than a revolution.  Empowered, trained and now with spending power these workers were never going to look back and there was a step change the progress of women’s rights because the majority of women now understood what they could achieve.  They had become an economic and political force in their own right moving on from the range of relatively small political movements which had existed before the war to achieving limited suffrage in February 1918 and allowing female MPs in November 1918.",null,0,cdowga4,1rm9yq,askhistorians,top_week,5

Humour goes through phases of being valued and reviled. Matthew Innes notes that in Thegan, Louis the Pious only smiled rather than laughed, when his fool interrupted his Easter celebration. Perhaps this was because it was unseemly for an emperor to outright laugh? At the same time Rudolf of Fulda's 'Life of Leoba' notes that Leoba was often cheerful but never went in to fits of extreme laughter. Bursts of uncontrolled emotion were seen as weak willed and unchristian.

In the 16th century, printing was in full swing, literacy rates in cities boomed, and books such as Schwanksammelungen and Volksbuecher were popular in the Holy Roman Empire, the former were often owned by the emerging middle class. These contain what are essentially small funny stories and anecdotes, usually laughing about how stupid peasants are or how raunchy a priest was.

For an idea in to the history of humour, look up Guy Halsall's 'Humour, History and Politics in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages', and Keith Cameron's 'Humour and History'.

Edit: Here's a joke from the 'Rollwagenbuechlin' by Wickram, published first in 1555. Translations my own:

**Of a mercenary and ""Lord God, protect us""**

In Switzerland, near Zurich, a mercenary went to an inn, he greeted the host, 
and the host allowed him to stay.

For supper, the landlord had presented the mercenary with a sour wine,
which turned out to be from a nauseous year;

when people drank it, they said “Lord God, protect us, as the wine is so sour!”

so that the wine of this year became known as: 'Lord God, protect us'.

Now when the mercenary sought to eat and have the sour wine, he said:

“By jove! Landlord, this wine is so sour!”

The host replied “Our wines are such that they are only good in old age.”

The mercenary said: “Host, if this wine was so old that it was on crutches, it wouldn't do it any good.”",null,0,cdp00io,1rmalf,askhistorians,top_week,8

QVCatullus,"The poetry of Catullus and other Roman poets from Vergil to Horace to Ovid are full of jokes as well; Martial, a bit later, is something of a master of the 'twist ending.' A couple of examples -- many Martial poems are funny, but a couple which stand out include one regarding a man who is actively courting a woman; Martial spends the brief poem listing all of the things that make the woman unpleasant, but finished by saying that her one positive attribute is that 'tussit' -- she had a cough. The joke being that the man was hoping she would die soon after he married her. Another Martial poem pokes fun at another person for 'never dining without a boar,' which is both expensive and far too much food to eat daily, but concludes by admitting that at least he 'has a good dinner-guest' since the host must, therefore, be a pig himself.

Perhaps the most-quoted and beautiful of Catullus's poems is carmen 5, ""Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love"" which often confuses first-time readers with a bit in the latter half about the number of kisses Catullus demands to avoid being cursed by those who envy his relationship; it seems clear to me that this is all a wittingly lame joke; Catullus showing off his bad pick-up lines -- ""hey baby, we got to kiss like three thousand three hundred times, because otherwise, uh, somebody might cast a spell on us?

TFrauline,"I have two answers for you. One is very general based on my impressions from studying history (and is mostly personal conjecture), the other quite specific to my area.

**General:** The nature of what is considered humorous changes enormously throughout different regions and time periods, but I don’t think that there has ever been a time in which “being funny” wasn’t valued in day-to-day social interactions, provided that your jokes conform to the zeitgeist of humour for that particular period, decade, year, region, social class, etc. Also keep in mind that day-to-day social interactions are not the same as pieces of art or writing, and there are plenty of instances of satires, plays, or novels being censored despite a large readership finding them funny.

**Specific:** In relation to your question about differences in social classes and whether the “upper crust” is more humourless, my own research on libertines can be illuminating. I’d like to point you to English Restoration and the court of [Charles II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England) as an example of a period in which fairly bawdy humour, stuff that we would considered unseemly today, was valued at the highest levels of society.

The typical historical narrative for this period is that after the oppressive moral Puritanism of Cromwell’s commonwealth, the reinstatement of the English monarchy brought about a period of general social liberalism that allowed for humour to become pervasive in public discourse. Regardless of how true this is, there’s no question that during the Restoration English literature and theater was obsessed with the idea of wit or witticism as being an extremely valuable trait to possess. This strong desire to demonstrate intelligence and humour in speech/writing frequently led to very risqué statements, often mingling politics and sexuality.

This carried over into the court of Charles II, composed mostly of nobles, who all aspired to win the affection of their peers and the King through displays of wit in speech, poetry, or writing. None were more successful than [John Wilmot, the 2nd Earl of Rochester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilmot,_2nd_Earl_of_Rochester), probably the most definitively libertine figure there is.

Rochester is best known today for his poetry, which was never intended for publication and usually written on a manuscript that was passed around and copied by members of the court and parliament, something I think makes him a particularly good example of the “day-to-day” humour of the nobility. While he produced excellent works using standardized poetic formats with reference to Greek classics etc. It’s his obscene works that are most notable, and also most topical to the period. They directly referenced members of the courts and their entourage with scathing satire.


It’s difficult for me to describe quite how hilarious, edgy, and crude this guy could be. In one poem he dedicates to Sue Willis, a prostitute who operated around the King’s court, he says:

*Her belly is a bag of turds*

*And her cunt a common shore.*

Occasionally he would even target the King himself and this got him exiled from court repeatedly. One of my favourite lines attacking Charles II is:

*His scepter and his prick are of a length,*

*And she may sway the one who plays with th' other.*

His life reflects his writing, despite being highly educated and showing bravery in several naval battles, he lived a debauched and hedonistic lifestyle until an early death in his thirties from venereal disease.


Rochester combined real poetic eloquence with crudity and humour in a way that enchanted and infuriated many members of the nobility and made him infamous. Both his obscene poems and his serious works show genuine brilliance and even depict fairly melancholic human truths, and there’s no question that he embodied the English Restoration's obsession with wit and witticism. Consequently I think Rochester and the court of Charles II is a really good example of humour being a “day-to-day” social function of nobility.

Keep in mind that everything I described in my general answer still applies to Rochester. Only 70 years after his death, moralists like Samuel Johnson decried Rochester as wasting his talents, being a dissolute rake, and someone not suitable to be read, and he was almost entirely ignored throughout the Victorian era. Humour seems to me a product of taste, and subject to the whim of societies that constantly shift and change. But that also means I'm confident there are many other examples of humour being similarly prized by the upper crust of those societies even while in public. The parliamentary quips of Winston Churchill and Lady Astor come to mind. I hope you get lots of responses!

My information for this post comes mostly from the David Vieth collection of Rochester’s poems, published by Yale University Press in 2002. It’s the most well-researched and thorough collection I’ve found to date.

If you want to read more about the court of Charles II, Matthew Jenkinson’s “Culture and Politics at the Court of Charles II, 1660-1685” cannot be beat. For more information on Rochester’s contemporaries the book “Libertines and Radicals in Early Modern London: Sexuality, Politics, and Literary Culture, 1630-1685” by James Grantham Turner is your best bet. Turner is the definitive scholar of libertinism and (I’d argue) Rochester.

For anyone who wants to read more about the Restoration rock-star, Rochester's poems should all be available online. I think the following verses best depict his unique blend of crudity/eloquence.

* *The Imperfect Enjoyment* – about a time he prematurely ejaculated

* *The Disabled Debauchee* – hoping he can cheer on young rakes when he’s old and gross

* *A Ramble in St. James’s Park* – account of a night in London and philosophizing on love

tactile_cacti,"In the Heian Era in Japan, it was not actually humor that the nobility displayed, but rather prose. Often, conversations would be littered with references to Chinese poetry. Sometimes, the conversation would take place almost entirely in prose, weather the prose be from the classics, or made up on the spot. Stating your opinion was seen as crass, but doing so though poetry was socially acceptable. 

In the *Genji Monogatari*, there is a scene where Genji and his two friends are discussing the merits of different types of women. Even in this possibly raunchy conversation, prose is employed. Now, the *Genji* was written by Murasaki Shikibu as a serial romance novel (of sorts), so men in private probably would have been a bit more crass, but this was the expected conversation. 

It should be noted that this was the style of the courtly elite, and not the common people. Unfortunately, not much was written about the peasant class at this time. 

In later times, such as the Tokugawa period, raunchy humor was wildly popular for the average person.

These contain what are essentially small funny stories and anecdotes, usually laughing about how stupid peasants are or how raunchy a priest was.

For an idea in to the history of humour, look up Guy Halsall's 'Humour, History and Politics in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages', and Keith Cameron's 'Humour and History'.

Edit: Here's a joke from the 'Rollwagenbuechlin' by Wickram, published first in 1555. Translations my own:

**Of a mercenary and ""Lord God, protect us""**

In Switzerland, near Zurich, a mercenary went to an inn, he greeted the host, 
and the host allowed him to stay.

For supper, the landlord had presented the mercenary with a sour wine,
which turned out to be from a nauseous year;

when people drank it, they said “Lord God, protect us, as the wine is so sour!”

so that the wine of this year became known as: 'Lord God, protect us'.

Now when the mercenary sought to eat and have the sour wine, he said:

“By jove! Landlord, this wine is so sour!”

The host replied “Our wines are such that they are only good in old age.”

The mercenary said: “Host, if this wine was so old that it was on crutches, it wouldn't do it any good.”",null,0,cdp00io,1rmalf,askhistorians,top_week,8

QVCatullus,"The poetry of Catullus and other Roman poets from Vergil to Horace to Ovid are full of jokes as well; Martial, a bit later, is something of a master of the 'twist ending.' A couple of examples -- many Martial poems are funny, but a couple which stand out include one regarding a man who is actively courting a woman; Martial spends the brief poem listing all of the things that make the woman unpleasant, but finished by saying that her one positive attribute is that 'tussit' -- she had a cough. The joke being that the man was hoping she would die soon after he married her. Another Martial poem pokes fun at another person for 'never dining without a boar,' which is both expensive and far too much food to eat daily, but concludes by admitting that at least he 'has a good dinner-guest' since the host must, therefore, be a pig himself.

Perhaps the most-quoted and beautiful of Catullus's poems is carmen 5, ""Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love"" which often confuses first-time readers with a bit in the latter half about the number of kisses Catullus demands to avoid being cursed by those who envy his relationship; it seems clear to me that this is all a wittingly lame joke; Catullus showing off his bad pick-up lines -- ""hey baby, we got to kiss like three thousand three hundred times, because otherwise, uh, somebody might cast a spell on us? I don't know, let's make out."" Many other Catullus jokes are more clear, but these obscure self-deprecating jokes are my favourites of his.",null,1,cdowfty,1rmalf,askhistorians,top_week,5
TFrauline,"I have two answers for you. One is very general based on my impressions from studying history (and is mostly personal conjecture), the other quite specific to my area.

**General:** The nature of what is considered humorous changes enormously throughout different regions and time periods, but I don’t think that there has ever been a time in which “being funny” wasn’t valued in day-to-day social interactions, provided that your jokes conform to the zeitgeist of humour for that particular period, decade, year, region, social class, etc. Also keep in mind that day-to-day social interactions are not the same as pieces of art or writing, and there are plenty of instances of satires, plays, or novels being censored despite a large readership finding them funny.

**Specific:** In relation to your question about differences in social classes and whether the “upper crust” is more humourless, my own research on libertines can be illuminating. I’d like to point you to English Restoration and the court of [Charles II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England) as an example of a period in which fairly bawdy humour, stuff that we would considered unseemly today, was valued at the highest levels of society.

The typical historical narrative for this period is that after the oppressive moral Puritanism of Cromwell’s commonwealth, the reinstatement of the English monarchy brought about a period of general social liberalism that allowed for humour to become pervasive in public discourse. Regardless of how true this is, there’s no question that during the Restoration English literature and theater was obsessed with the idea of wit or witticism as being an extremely valuable trait to possess. This strong desire to demonstrate intelligence and humour in speech/writing frequently led to very risqué statements, often mingling politics and sexuality.

This carried over into the court of Charles II, composed mostly of nobles, who all aspired to win the affection of their peers and the King through displays of wit in speech, poetry, or writing. None were more successful than [John Wilmot, the 2nd Earl of Rochester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilmot,_2nd_Earl_of_Rochester), probably the most definitively libertine figure there is.

Rochester is best known today for his poetry, which was never intended for publication and usually written on a manuscript that was passed around and copied by members of the court and parliament, something I think makes him a particularly good example of the “day-to-day” humour of the nobility. While he produced excellent works using standardized poetic formats with reference to Greek classics etc. It’s his obscene works that are most notable, and also most topical to the period. They directly referenced members of the courts and their entourage with scathing satire.


It’s difficult for me to describe quite how hilarious, edgy, and crude this guy could be. In one poem he dedicates to Sue Willis, a prostitute who operated around the King’s court, he says:

*Her belly is a bag of turds*

*And her cunt a common shore.*

Occasionally he would even target the King himself and this got him exiled from court repeatedly. One of my favourite lines attacking Charles II is:

*His scepter and his prick are of a length,*

*And she may sway the one who plays with th' other.*

His life reflects his writing, despite being highly educated and showing bravery in several naval battles, he lived a debauched and hedonistic lifestyle until an early death in his thirties from venereal disease.


Rochester combined real poetic eloquence with crudity and humour in a way that enchanted and infuriated many members of the nobility and made him infamous. Both his obscene poems and his serious works show genuine brilliance and even depict fairly melancholic human truths, and there’s no question that he embodied the English Restoration's obsession with wit and witticism. Consequently I think Rochester and the court of Charles II is a really good example of humour being a “day-to-day” social function of nobility.

Keep in mind that everything I described in my general answer still applies to Rochester. Only 70 years after his death, moralists like Samuel Johnson decried Rochester as wasting his talents, being a dissolute rake, and someone not suitable to be read, and he was almost entirely ignored throughout the Victorian era. Humour seems to me a product of taste, and subject to the whim of societies that constantly shift and change. But that also means I'm confident there are many other examples of humour being similarly prized by the upper crust of those societies even while in public. The parliamentary quips of Winston Churchill and Lady Astor come to mind. I hope you get lots of responses!

My information for this post comes mostly from the David Vieth collection of Rochester’s poems, published by Yale University Press in 2002. It’s the most well-researched and thorough collection I’ve found to date.

If you want to read more about the court of Charles II, Matthew Jenkinson’s “Culture and Politics at the Court of Charles II, 1660-1685” cannot be beat. For more information on Rochester’s contemporaries the book “Libertines and Radicals in Early Modern London: Sexuality, Politics, and Literary Culture, 1630-1685” by James Grantham Turner is your best bet. Turner is the definitive scholar of libertinism and (I’d argue) Rochester.

For anyone who wants to read more about the Restoration rock-star, Rochester's poems should all be available online. I think the following verses best depict his unique blend of crudity/eloquence.

* *The Imperfect Enjoyment* – about a time he prematurely ejaculated

* *The Disabled Debauchee* – hoping he can cheer on young rakes when he’s old and gross

* *A Ramble in St. James’s Park* – account of a night in London and philosophizing on love

* *A Satyr on Reason and Mankind* – Pokes fun at anyone who would obey reason above nature",null,0,cdp5j6n,1rmalf,askhistorians,top_week,4

tactile_cacti,"In the Heian Era in Japan, it was not actually humor that the nobility displayed, but rather prose. Often, conversations would be littered with references to Chinese poetry. Sometimes, the conversation would take place almost entirely in prose, weather the prose be from the classics, or made up on the spot. Stating your opinion was seen as crass, but doing so though poetry was socially acceptable. 

In the *Genji Monogatari*, there is a scene where Genji and his two friends are discussing the merits of different types of women. Even in this possibly raunchy conversation, prose is employed. Now, the *Genji* was written by Murasaki Shikibu as a serial romance novel (of sorts), so men in private probably would have been a bit more crass, but this was the expected conversation. 

It should be noted that this was the style of the courtly elite, and not the common people. Unfortunately, not much was written about the peasant class at this time. 

In later times, such as the Tokugawa period, raunchy humor was wildly popular for the average person. The Ukiyo-e (wood pressed art, usually depicting dream like qualities or the pleasure quarters) of the time would be just as likely to have crazy sexual scenes as a picturesque landscape.

ambhis101,"This is a difficult question to answer for sure. Older scholarship from the 19th century tends to assume that the answer is yes, but more recent studies have called that conclusion into question.

We know that the Greeks talked and wrote about human sacrifice and that it was a relatively common feature in Greek mythology. (Think of Agamemnon's sacrifice of Iphigenia, Achilles' sacrifice of Trojan captives over the grave of Patroclus, etc.) But the presence of human sacrifice in mythology, drama and literature does not necessarily mean that it existed in reality.

There are a number of archaeological sites that are often mentioned as supplying evidence of some sort of human sacrifice in Greek society. There are human bones found in Knosos, Crete, for instance, that show signs of being butchered, but this could be a sign of human sacrifice, cannibalism or maybe just a form of preparing the corpses of the dead for reburial.

There are also a number of burials where it seems likely that some of the people buried were either ritually killed as part of the funeral process or were buried alive to accompany another person into the afterlife. These cases are not all conclusive, however, and it's not clear if this would count as ""human sacrifice"" in the sense that the term is normally used.

The main modern study on the question is Dennis Hughes' *Human Sacrifice in Ancient Greece*. Hughes concludes that the archaeological evidence is not conclusive and that there is no solid historical or literary evidence of actual human sacrifice. He does not think that the appearance of sacrifice in Greek myth proves that it must have once existed.

At  the  Sipan  tomb  in the  late  1980s  and  more  recently,  at  the  El  Brujo  site,  golden  headdresses  with  the  fanged  diety  were  found  in  elite  tombs.

ironcrown9,"It's not necessarily about wanting to go to war, it's about being able to. All wise governments try to keep their military up to par with potential competitors. The US was the primary possible competitor because they and the US had conflicting interests.

In 1853, blackships (ironclads) show up at your doorstep, carrying Americans you demand access to your markets. And they will have what they want even if they have to take it. 

These same Americans visited Korea also, and when the Koreans did not comply the US ended up forcing them to open up to merchants and missionaries. 

The most powerful state you know, once the undisputed master of the region, China, has been knocked around silly. They went up against the westerners, and they ended up with port cities seized as enclaves, missionaries in the borders, opium in their cities. 

You don't want to be colonized; you want the be colonizer. You begin the processing of putting Korea into your sphere of influence; you'll officially annex it in due time. You do something similar to the occasional pacific island and carve out spheres of influence in China. 

You eventually worry that Russia will try to seize Korea from you, so you attack and declare war shortly after (something which you be infamous for). To the world, the Russo-Japanese war was the first time a European power had been completely trounced by a non-euro entity, never mind that you know you were very close to the brink. Maybe you are finally being taken seriously.

WW1 comes around, and in time you back the Allied forces. Britain and France, the big players in the region, are knocked are their back. Their influence had shrunk to the point where you could begin too be a big player. You were one of the few better off after the war. But the other...

Was the United States. They had build up a presence in the region, centered around their colony in the Philippines. They eye the resource rich regions in SE Asia, just like you. Your interests conflict in far too many ways to be comfortable for so many years. 

The Japanese were not being paranoid; they were playing politics. In order to negotiate at equal terms with someone with conflicting interests, you need a comparable military. And yet they try to deny you that (because they are likely thinking the exact same thing). Remember, conflict of interests doesn't always mean war between 2 states. There are many ways to check the influence of the other. But arguably, the treaty did make the Japanese feel as though their hand was forced. And they had a very hungry military-industrial complex. And the fact of the matter is, the last couple of times they tried violence, it worked rather well for them in the end.

Japanese rightly paranoid, didn't necessarily want to go to war with US, but had conflicting interests.

Vampire_Seraphin,"To lay the entire blame for their hardships on the communal use of property is erroneous. Among other things the Pilgrims (more properly Separatists) were plagued by harsh winters, hostile Native Americans, friendly Native Americans attempting to draw them into local politics, failure to be supplied from England, new colonists who would not work, and disease. They also suffered greatly from famine in the first few years. 

The communal system contributed to the famine according to Governor Bradford because many of the colonists chaffed at the idea of their labors going to feed others. This created a downward spiral where many colonists worked less and less so there was little food in the stores over the winter. This forced Bradford to introduce rationing more than once.

Ultimately the Separatists moved to private property because it eliminated these interpersonal quarrels somewhat (there would be more later over who got more or less land, or better or worse land). He recounts that the new system made the people at least industrious enough to feed themselves. IIRC a portion of those crops were also allocated for the upkeep of the governor and the town proper.

Here's how Governor Bradford handled the situation in his own words. 

&gt;All this whille no supply was heard of, neither knew they when they might expecte any. So they begane to thinke how they might raise as much torne as they could, and obtaine a beter crope then they had done, that they might not still thus languish in miserie. At length, after much debate of things, the Govr (with the advise of the cheefest amongest them) gave way that they should set corve every man for his owne perticuler, and in that regard trust to them selves; in all other things to goe on in the generall way as before. And so assigned to every family a parcell of land, according to the proportion of their number for that end, only for present use (but made no devission for inheritance), and ranged all boys and youth under some familie. This had very good success; for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more torne was planted then other waise would have bene by any means the Govr or any other could use, and saved him a great deall of trouble, and gave farr better contente. The women now wente willingly into the feild, and tooke their litle-ons with them to set torne, which before would aledg weaknes, and inabilitie; whom to have compelled would have bene thought great tiranie and oppression.216.

&gt;The experience that was had in this commone course and condition, tried sundrie years, and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanitie of that conceite of Platos and other.ancients, applauded by some of aater times; -that the taking away of propertie, and bringing in communitie into a comone wealth, would make them happy and $orishing; as if they were wiser then God. For this comunitie (so farr as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent, and retard much imployment that would have been to their benefite and comforte. For the yong-men that were most able and fitte for labour and servise did repine that they should spend their time and streingth to worke for other mens wives and children, with out any recompence. The strong, or man of parts, had no more in devission of victails and cloaths, then he that was weake and not able to doe a quarter the other could; this was thought injuestice. The aged and graver men to be ranked and equalised in labours, and victails, cloaths, etc., with the meaner and yonger sorte, thought it some indignite and disrespect unto them. And for mens wives to be commanded to doe servise for other men, as dresing their meate, washing their cloaths, etc., they deemd it a kind of slaverie, neither could many husbands well brooke it. Upon the poynte all being to have alike, and all to doe alike, they thought them selves in the like condition, and ove as good as another; and so, if it did not cut of those relations that God hath set amongest men, yet it did at least much diminish and take of the mutuall respects that should be preserved amongst them. And would have bene worse if they had been men of another condition. Let pone objecte this is mens corruption, and nothing to the course it selfe.

molstern,"It depends on what you mean by leadership. The legal power the king had was dependent on other people (like the parlement of Paris) actually going through with his decrees since he couldn't exactly go out and physically force people to pay more taxes on his own. So he couldn't really go against the parlement too much or they would rebel, which they did before the revolution when they refused to record his laws when they involved raising taxes on the social class the parlement belonged to in order to unfuck the economy. So the natural limits to absolute powers were a factor (without them, there would have been no estates general and in my opinion no revolution as we know it), but that's not really a problem in Louis' character, more in the system of the old regime. 

After the opening of the estates general, everything Louis did to try to steer things in his direction basically made things worse. He closes the door to the third estates' hall? They swear the tennis court oath and basically start a revolution. He orders them to calm the fuck down? Mirabeau makes epic speeches in reply, rebels keep rebelling and it's Christmas for revolutionary newspapers. He tries to use force to calm them down? The people of Paris storm the Bastille. He confesses to feeling kind of iffy about the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen, and the August decrees? The women of Paris show up to his castle and politely inform him that he now lives with them in Paris. 
So honestly, I don't think doing MORE would have been a good thing for him, if that is what you meant would be strong leadership of hypothetical Louis compared to the weak leadership of the real one. In my opinion, it might have hurried things along and he would have been hated and deposed much faster. 

He also had the problem of the old regime system of military basically fucking over the majority of the soldiers even more than the average Frenchman, by making the upper ranks of the military available only to the nobles. So when the revolution starts brewing they fuck off, tired of being ordered around by some random dude who just got the job for being rich, and early on a significant part of the army declare that they won't fire on protesters. So using more force would have been difficult. 

What he could have done was go against everything he actually wanted to do and push through laws abolishing privileges and making taxation more fair, but that would do enormous financial damage to all his friends and family, and he himself could have limited the power of the absolute monarchy. That, in my opinion, would have basically stopped the revolution, but it would have been the royalist equivalent to declaring himself a servant of Satan and peeing on the church and there was just no way Louis was going to do that. And when I say it would have stopped the revolution I mean the popular/bourgeois revolution that happened IRL, but it would have very likely triggered an aristocratic revolution that might have led to similarly unfunny results for him.

We inherit the 12-hour clock from the ancient Romans, who got it from the ancient Babylonians, who divided days and nights into 12 periods - as did the ancient Egyptians. (No, I don't know *why* they chose 12 periods instead of any other number. However, it's known that the Babylonians were very fond of numbers like 20 and 60 and 12 which were divisible by lots of smaller numbers.)

And, like most things in human history, once the idea of 12 periods became common, it just ""stuck"". Humans are very reluctant to change traditional things - especially when they're embedded in daily life, like the number of hours in a day.

For example, the French revolutionaries introduced decimal time in 1792, shortly after the French Revolution. It didn't last: Napoleon Bonaparte abolished it after he became Emperor.

The French tried to decimalise time again in 1897. It didn't last - it died quietly within a couple of years.

**Luxembourg, First World War**


Luxembourg was [invaded and occupied by Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Luxembourg_in_World_War_I) during the First World War.

Being able to move their army through Luxembourg, as well as Belgium, was a key part of the Moltke-Schlieffen Plan.  On 1st August 1914 the Germans violated Luxembourgish neutrality by using Troisvierges Station in the north of the country and taking control of the telegraph posts there.  The Luxembourgish prime minister, Paul Eyschen, telegraphed Berlin, asking what was happening.  The German State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Gottlieb von Jagow, responded that there must have been a mistake, and that Germany would respect Luxembourgish neutrality, as had been affirmed at the 1867 Second Treaty of London, providing that France did the same.

On 2nd August 1914 Germany launched its invasion of Luxembourg, crossing the Moselle (which the border between Germany and Luxembourg follows, excluding a little bit of Luxembourg near Vianden which is east of the river) at Remich and Wasserbillig, and moved on the capital, Luxembourg City.  The Luxembourg Army, consisting of 400 mostly ceremonial troops, were ordered by the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Marie-Adélaïde, not to resist the Germans.  At 17:00 a telegram was sent to the Luxembourgish prime minister in which the German government apologised for the invasion, which they said was necessary to protect German military and railway interests, and that Luxembourg would be fully compensated by the Germans for any damage.  At the end of the day a fight between German and French troops broke out at Petit-Croix, on the western border of Luxembourg.

On 3rd August a further telegram was sent, claiming the occupation to be temporary, that the rights of Luxembourgers would be respected, and that France had caused the invasion by sending 650 troops on bicycle into Luxembourg before the invasion.  This claim seems unlikely, though possible, and was denied by the government of Luxembourg.

3200 Luxembourgers had left the country before the invasion, and most of these volunteered within the French army. 2800 of these were killed in the course of the war.

During the occupation, trees were pulled down in Luxembourg City in order to improve the line of sight for using machine guns, should the Germans have needed to defend Luxembourg.  Orchards and farmland were dug up to locate bunkers and gun emplacements.  Luxembourgish workers were made to work for the German war effort.  In order to prevent trouble brewing among the local population, 'preventive arrests' of possible dissenters were made - it seems that the German secret police had been active in Luxembourg before the war.  Most of these prisoners were taken to Trier, just across the border into Germany.  Luxembourg was kept under martial law, and there were restrictions on travel, free speech/press and rationing.  The country was used by the Germans as a logistical support centre for the German army, and Crown Prince Wilhelm, who was a general in the army, had his headquarters at Luxembourg's second city, Esch-sur-Alzette.

One of the major events during the occupation was a strike by iron miners on 31st May 1917.  As a result of the British naval blockade on Germany, Luxembourg had become very important to German iron production, and contributed one-seventh of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire's pig iron.  Generalmajor Richard Karl von Tessmar put down the strike, and arrested the ringleaders, who were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.

Had Germany won the war, it has been argued that she intended to annex Luxembourg.  There is some evidence to support this.  The Septemberprogramm, a draft of German war aims, stated that Luxembourg was to become a member of the German Empire, and this has been used by historian Fritz Fischer in *Germany's Aims in the First World War* to claim that it was German policy to annex Luxembourg.  General Friedrich Bronsart von Schellendorf, Chief of General Staff of the Ottoman Army, also talked of annexing Luxembourg.  The Septemerprogramm was never official policy, however, and Bronsart von Schellendorf's statements should not be seen as representative of German policy makers' opinion.  As it is, no serious attempts were made to annex Luxembourg during occupation.

On 6th November 1918, Richard von Tessmar announced the withdrawal of German troops from Luxembourg.  After the armistice, on 18th November 1918 it was decided that General John Pershing's US Third Army would move through Luxembourg to take up their occupation of the Rhineland, which they did the following day.  The American troops were greeted by the Luxembourgers as liberators, and on 22nd November the German army completed its withdrawal from Luxembourg.


**Liechtenstein, First World War**

Officially Liechtenstein was neutral during the First World War, and did not have a standing army.  Unlike Luxembourg, its neutrality was largely respected.  Liechtenstein was closely tied to Austria-Hungary, however: since 1852 Austrian customs officials were in charge of collecting duties at border crossings; since 1872 the Vienna-Zürich train line which passed through the country had been under the control of the Imperial Austrian State Railway; since 1880 Austrian diplomats were able to represent Liechtensteiner interests abroad.  As a result, the Allies saw Liechtenstein as being so closely integrated into the Austro-Hungarian economy that it too was subjected to embargo by the Allies.  This caused hardships in Liechtenstein, and the Allies even denied the Swiss their requests to send food to the principality.  As a result, after the armistice and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Liechtenstein concluded much the same treaties (customs, consular etc.) with Switzerland in the place of Austria, and adopted the Swiss Franc, which is still the currency today.",null,4,cdowpk6,1rmydo,askhistorians,top_week,22

nofreakingusernames,"The Greek army was even more numerous than that. Estimates range from around 5,200 to 11,200 men. I also don't think you should base your assumptions on the movie 300, as it is wildly inaccurate. 

As for the battle itself, it's extremely likely that the Xerxes did just that. Archery made up a large part of ancient Persian warfare (if I'm not mistaken, Persian troops generally carried a bow), and would involve them firing volley after volley of arrows at their enemies, after which they would storm them with cavalry, of which a large part was also missile-troops.

&gt;The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.

The Greeks were equipped with heavier armor than the Persians however, wearing bronze plates and helmets, and hoplons; large wooden shields covered in a sheet of bronze. The entire idea of the phalanx formation used by Greek hoplites revolved around shielding yourself and the man to your left, and because of this, the lighter Persian bows were largely ineffective. As for guarding the archers with spear-infantry, as was the custom anyway (iirc), the Greeks would have tried to push through the lighter Persian troops and get to the archers.

&gt;Although the Persian tactic of rapidly firing vast numbers of arrows into the enemy must have been an awesome sight, the lightness of the arrows meant that they were largely ineffective against the bronze-armoured hoplites

-------------

&gt;First of all, he ordered five thousand archers to fire a barrage of arrows at the Greeks, but the bronze shields and helmets deflected the missiles, leaving no permanent damage - the missiles were fired from at least 100 yards away, according to modern day scholars.

This last one is from Wikipedia, although it's unsourced.

Unlike in the movie, the Greeks also had some fortifications at Thermopylae, which would undoubtedly also have helped them. As for just shooting at the Greeks while they slept, I think you're largely overestimating the effective range of ancient bows, and the fact that if the Persians had tried to do so, they would likely have been met in battle again. The Persians needed sleep too.

The Lord Chamberlain's Men debuted *Romeo and Juliet* at The Theatre in the Fall of 1594.  The Theatre was an octagonal, open-roofed structure with a thrust stage and columns that supported a canopy above the stage.  There were two tiers of seats that surrounded an open area intended as standing room.  We know that portions of the stage were painted, but there are no specific records as to *how* they were painted.

As for the red cloth:  We don't know exactly how the moment of Juliet's death was depicted in its first run.  I *can* tell you that these plays were showcases for the latest fashions, so Juliet's costume was probably way too expensive to risk staining with stage blood.  Using a red cloth was indeed a period-appropriate choice.  It's one of a number of old tricks for depicting a wound on stage.

IronEngineer,"I've read a book called ""Wings"" that gave a fairly detailed history of the aviation technology for the past thousand years.  One of the interesting points it brought up was that there was some evidence of human's flying mounted to kites going all the way back to BC times in China.  Namely, they would mount people to large kites and fly them up high for reconnaissance purposes.  The earliest known record of kite flying is from around 200 BC in China, when a general flew a kite over enemy territory to calculate the length of tunnel required to enter the region. Yuan Huangtou, a Chinese prince, survived by tying himself to the kite.  There was strong evidence that it was used even earlier in the form of written stories people have given of seeing flying scouts.  In 550 AD, one of the Chinese emperors even executed prisoners by having them fly an ornithopter off a cliff.  They would glide for some time until they fell to their deaths.  There were many variants of unpowered or semipowered flight devices everywhere in the world over the past thousand+ years.  

Also interesting is that there were powered flight toys I believe around 1300 AD in select European areas (there is a big ish on that century though as it has been a while since I read the book and this was a minor detail).  These were simple sticks with blades attached to them.  You would wind a string around them and pull fast.  The toy would take off and fly around a little bit before crashing to the ground.  Other toys used steam power to fly around a bit.  The key point is that these toys were very small and light weight.  However, they marked the first point that a machine could generate its own lift in excess of its weight (or a lift/weight ratio greater than 1).  

From Wikipedia:  
&gt;Italian inventor, Tito Livio Burattini, invited by the Polish King Władysław IV to his court in Warsaw, built a model aircraft with four fixed glider wings in 1647.[22] Described as ""four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'"", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself.[23] He promised that ""only the most minor injuries"" would result from landing the craft.[24] His ""Dragon Volant"" is considered ""the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century"".[25]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_aviation

The big point coming up to the 1900s though was that nobody was having any success making a machine that could fly on its own power with large weights and lifts, as to lift a person per se.  All the flight mechanisms that made the toys fly were just not scalable enough.  The little steam engines used to generate power on the small toys would never scale well enough in a power/weight ratio to work on a large scale.  

Enter the big point of the Wright Brothers.  What they did was slap an early car engine on a plane, an inline 4 I believe, work out the bicycle chain gearing in a low weight fashion, and incorporate low weight aerodynamic controls.  Essentially, they scaled up the small low weight toys in a way that no one thought possible.  This was a marvel in itself, however none of their ideas had anything novel in them with regards to the aerodynamics of manned flight.  Their work mostly regarded scaling the propulsion and mechanism systems to generate enough power while keeping the weight low.  

As more directly toward your point on paper airplanes, I would assume they would exist based simply on the available knowledge at the time period.  (I know assuming is bad form, but I just wanted to show that nothing the Wright Brothers did would have had anything to do with the paper airplane other than popularizing flight.)  Many of the efforts towards manned flight go back to Sir George Cayley.  This man set forth the guidelines for manned flight as early as 1799, including identifying the main aerodynamic forces and designing the principles of cambered wings, finding the importance of dihedral angles for stability, designing the traditional tail with horizontal and vertical surfaces, etc.  He even flew controlled gliders that established all the principles of flight later developers, like the Wright Brothers, would base their designs off of.  He even organized clubs of people to build and fly similar contraptions and further develop the science.  

When the Wright Brothers first showed their stuff to the world, the concept of controlled flight was something that had already been seen.  What hadn't been seen was the ability to perform long flights and fly indefinitely on your own power.  That was groundbreaking.  The real earth shattering occurrences weren't kitty hawk where they flew seconds, but rather when the brothers went to France and flew around a stadium of people up to an hour at a time.  

Since the history of aviation is so strongly tied to toys and other mechanations of amusement, long before thought was given to manned flight, and since all the general concepts needed for developing paper airplanes were laid out and demonstrated by 1800, I would assume there were paper airplanes during the 19th century at the latest.

There was strong evidence that it was used even earlier in the form of written stories people have given of seeing flying scouts.  In 550 AD, one of the Chinese emperors even executed prisoners by having them fly an ornithopter off a cliff.  They would glide for some time until they fell to their deaths.  There were many variants of unpowered or semipowered flight devices everywhere in the world over the past thousand+ years.  

Also interesting is that there were powered flight toys I believe around 1300 AD in select European areas (there is a big ish on that century though as it has been a while since I read the book and this was a minor detail).  These were simple sticks with blades attached to them.  You would wind a string around them and pull fast.  The toy would take off and fly around a little bit before crashing to the ground.  Other toys used steam power to fly around a bit.  The key point is that these toys were very small and light weight.  However, they marked the first point that a machine could generate its own lift in excess of its weight (or a lift/weight ratio greater than 1).  

From Wikipedia:  
&gt;Italian inventor, Tito Livio Burattini, invited by the Polish King Władysław IV to his court in Warsaw, built a model aircraft with four fixed glider wings in 1647.[22] Described as ""four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'"", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself.[23] He promised that ""only the most minor injuries"" would result from landing the craft.[24] His ""Dragon Volant"" is considered ""the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century"".[25]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_aviation

The big point coming up to the 1900s though was that nobody was having any success making a machine that could fly on its own power with large weights and lifts, as to lift a person per se.  All the flight mechanisms that made the toys fly were just not scalable enough.  The little steam engines used to generate power on the small toys would never scale well enough in a power/weight ratio to work on a large scale.  

Enter the big point of the Wright Brothers.  What they did was slap an early car engine on a plane, an inline 4 I believe, work out the bicycle chain gearing in a low weight fashion, and incorporate low weight aerodynamic controls.  Essentially, they scaled up the small low weight toys in a way that no one thought possible.  This was a marvel in itself, however none of their ideas had anything novel in them with regards to the aerodynamics of manned flight.  Their work mostly regarded scaling the propulsion and mechanism systems to generate enough power while keeping the weight low.  

As more directly toward your point on paper airplanes, I would assume they would exist based simply on the available knowledge at the time period.  (I know assuming is bad form, but I just wanted to show that nothing the Wright Brothers did would have had anything to do with the paper airplane other than popularizing flight.)  Many of the efforts towards manned flight go back to Sir George Cayley.  This man set forth the guidelines for manned flight as early as 1799, including identifying the main aerodynamic forces and designing the principles of cambered wings, finding the importance of dihedral angles for stability, designing the traditional tail with horizontal and vertical surfaces, etc.  He even flew controlled gliders that established all the principles of flight later developers, like the Wright Brothers, would base their designs off of.  He even organized clubs of people to build and fly similar contraptions and further develop the science.  

When the Wright Brothers first showed their stuff to the world, the concept of controlled flight was something that had already been seen.  What hadn't been seen was the ability to perform long flights and fly indefinitely on your own power.  That was groundbreaking.  The real earth shattering occurrences weren't kitty hawk where they flew seconds, but rather when the brothers went to France and flew around a stadium of people up to an hour at a time.  

Since the history of aviation is so strongly tied to toys and other mechanations of amusement, long before thought was given to manned flight, and since all the general concepts needed for developing paper airplanes were laid out and demonstrated by 1800, I would assume there were paper airplanes during the 19th century at the latest.

RenoXD,"During World War One, there was very much a need to preform a proper burial for dead soldiers, as these men were friends, brothers, dads and sons. For moral's sake, it was important that the men left over after a battle could see their comrades laid to rest, or at the very least have a cross placed beside them. After a battle, there was usually a period of rest where each side collected their dead from No Man's Land. In many areas, there was sort of unwritten rule that this could happen without shots being fired, as each side knew each others perils very well. As far as I know, there was never a death went by where nobody cared about it, but in some cases, a burial was impossible. Either the battlefield was overrun or the body have been buried under the mud. Sometimes, a small cross made of anything a soldier could find (sticks/wood/planks) would be placed where the body was thought to have fell or the last place they were seen as a simple memorial to them. Remember that the actions of one man may very well have saved the lives of hundreds of others, so it was definitely a big deal to show respect to every man who was killed, as these men died to save others.

When there was time and land, makeshift cemeteries were set up (and subsequently filled very quickly). Bodies were buried properly and a sermon was usually issued by a priest or religious man. Then, a wooden cross would be placed above their body and their helmet (if they had it) would be laid on top. Their name would usually be carved into or drawn on the wood as well. This definitely wasn't as common as a battlefield burial, but it did happen whenever and wherever possible. [Here](http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/flanders/images/ypres/michelin_resovoir_cem.jpg) is an example of one in Ypres. The photograph was taken just after the war. This cemetery's headstones have now been replaced with the typical white headstones we see all over France, and the name of each soldier is properly engraved. 

As to whether anybody cared about the bodies, I think the time and effort that went into burying each individual soldier and writing letters home to their families show that every soldier was not just a number lost in the mud but a name and a human being that died horribly. Every soldier deserved a proper burial for their sacrifice.",null,0,cdp6v2c,1rn99l,askhistorians,top_week,3
HallenbeckJoe,"I don't like the term ""Banana Wars"" because it throws together a wide range of events (wars, interventions, occupations, ...) in very different countries (Mexico, Haiti, Cuba, ...) over a time frame of up to 36 years (1898-1934 is the generally accepted) and reduces them to 'a war over bananas' (or, of you're less polemical than me, to the economic interests of the United States in the Caribbean). But that's just my personal opinion as the relevant historiography is using the term all the time.

The important use of ""Banana Wars"" as a concept is in demonstrating how the United States behaved as an Imperial power in the Caribbean, while it rhetorically denounced Imperialism. It shows continuities in American policies and actions that would get lost if you look at the events individually. But once you're past that and able to accept that the United States never was the innocent and disinterested power it claimed to be, ""Banana Wars"" loses its usefulness to analyze this period.

Naurgul,"I'm not sure if my comment is worthy of a top-level reply but I'll try anyway (please delete if it's not up to par). 

My understanding is that there are two main differences: First, the conception of who counts as a citizen (suffrage was extremely limited compared to modern standards. Second, [representation, to them, was an undemocratic concept that was only used in special cases and considered a concession to aristocracy](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/649986?uid=3738736&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103015177241). Most executive positions were decided by lot and only some specific positions that required a very specific skillset (generals, economists) were elected by popular vote.

I suggest watching [this extremely informative interview with philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis](http://vimeo.com/66587994#t=160) who discusses this issue in detail. I'm posting some quotes from the interview that will hopefully elucidate the issue:

&gt; Every law is voted by the Assembly, the ekklēsia, [...] and those laws were voted by the fantastic clause: ""It seemed good to the Dēmos and the Boulē"". [...] One doesn't say that it's the absolute truth, that it's God who gave the Tablets of Law. It is said: At this-here moment, the Athenians thought it good to vote this law. This means that, five or ten or twenty years later, one can change it. 

---

&gt; Among the Greeks there is no idea of representation. Once again, no one is saying that everyone can decide at any moment about everything. Either there are specialists or there are magistrates. But there are magistrates, who are not representatives in the sense that the people say: ""All power will be delegated to them for a fixed period"" as we do. They are simply emanations of the city that embody it in certain regards and for certain posts. 

&gt; Among the Moderns, the idea of representative democracy goes hand in hand with what must really be called an alienation of power, a self-expropriation of power. That is to say, the [French] population says: ""For five years, there is nothing for me to do on the political level; I have chosen 548 people who are going to take care of my business, within the Constitution's framework, with certain guarantees etc."". The result is, during those five years, the citizens aren't active, they're passive. 

---

&gt; For the Greeks, for Aristotle, for Thucidydes, when he wrote ""The Peloponnesian War"", when they spoke about the political entity we would call ""Athens"", they never spoke of ""Athens"". ""Athens"" is a geographical expression. [For instance], ""at such and such moment, Alcibiades left Athens"", but ""the Athenians that winter decided..."", ""the Lacedaemonians decided..."". That is, to say, it's the people itself that is what we call the State, which is the political power. 

&gt; Whereas in the modern political imaginary, we have never finally exited from the conception created by absolute monarchy: that there is a Power somewhere, a monster, the Leviathan, as Hobbes called it. From time to time, this monster exits its cave and demands ten thousand young men and forty thousand young girls to eat them and one hundred thousand people to kill them; it demands money and everything else. 

&gt; We can do nothing about that monster; what we can do is put around its cave some paper barricades that are called Constitutions, which limit the prerogatives of the State. 

---

&gt; The citizens of Antiquity really thought that the community, the polis, was their affair. They had a passion for that. Modern individuals -and there's the rub- don't have a passion for that. Whence, moreover, the following, quite characteristic phenomenon of the modern world: we have long periods of greater or lesser political apathy, during which common affairs are managed by professional politicians, and then we have, in paroxysmal ways, things like crises, revolutions. Because, obviously, the professionals managing the political domain have gone too far. Or what they do no longer corresponds with what society wants; society can't find normal channels to express its will, so one is therefore obliged to have a revolution, a crisis, etc.

---

&gt; Archilochus was a mercenary. A mercenary soldier and a poet. A verse from Archilochus remains where he says the following: ""I was in the battle the other day, we were going to fight, I threw away my shield to escape more quickly: Big deal! I could buy me another one at the corner store"". To say that in a society where what is prized above all else was warrior valour, to have thrown away one's shield in battle meant infamy for life, to be able to say it and be, by this very act, a poet prized in all of Greece... that's freedom. 

---

&gt; What's hubris? The Greeks are free, they create freedom, and they know at the same time that there are limits. But these limits aren't fixed. There is no Tablets of Law. Of course, there are moral rules and so on. But in other respects, no one can know in advance whether he is going too far and yet he has to know it. And when one goes too far, it's hubris, it's excess, and this hubris is punished by a sort of impersonal order of the world that always pulls back anything that tries to overstep order. [...] 

&gt; In Greece, order, measuredness are gained against reality. It is not the initial given - whence the Greeks' obsession with proverbs that may appear banal: ""nothing in excess"", ""don't exaggerate"" etc. I don't see the Swiss or the Dutch having proverbs against overdoing things because the people aren't carried away towards exaggeration. The Greek people are so obsessed by the fact that one can do too much because that's its natural tendency and because that's what it always does.

&gt; The modern Greeks, after the war of independence against the Turks, set up a State in line with the Western norm. They had to borrow from the ancient Greeks a term, ""Kratos"", which in ancient Greek doesn't mean State at all; it's not a political notion. Kratos means the fact of being the strongest. It's the brute form.

&gt; That shows, once again, the absence of the thing. There is no word to say that. There's the political community, there's ""polis"", but one cannot say ""State"" in the sense that we say it - that is to say, an instance of authority separated from the body of citizens.

Agrippa911,"Yes and no (a big no). In Athens, the only democratic state we have any information on (other states had democracies but we have no writings about their inner workings that survived).


In Athens you needed to be a citizen to have any political rights. In the mid-5th C BCE they added a clause that required you to have both parents as citizens (most states only required the father be a citizen, this was a political law though, not a genuine social change). As a non-citizen (a *metic*) you might be invited to the city to setup shop but there was almost no chance you'd ever get citizenship. You could participate in many social activities, join in the festivals, but the chance of being given citizenship was incredibly remote. As a woman, while you may be a citizen you had **no** political rights, heck you couldn't even represent yourself in court.


So right away, from our perspective - it's not democratic at all to our modern view. But here's the kicker: an ancient Athenian wouldn't consider our system democratic, they'd probably consider us slightly better off than slaves.


The thing is Athens was a participatory democracy, there was no representatives that did stuff for you. You wanted to vote on a war against Corinth? Well you walked to Athens from wherever you lived, maybe it took a couple of hours, maybe it took you all day, and you went up to the assembly and voted personally. If you didn't like a law, you could stand up and address the entire assembly and propose something different. Nowadays we fob off decisions to representatives and hope they do what we want (or promised to do years ago during the election). The downside is that those living nearer to Athens could go and vote more often than someone who lived a few days away.


When we talk about the Athens of Pericles time, the democratization went even further. They had little of the bureaucracy or administration we have today. The state would have some slaves but much of the work would be done by citizens. Athens was broken into 10 (non-geographic) tribes, each year those tribes would randomly pick out 50 citizens to serve on the council. So all together, each year you'd get 500 randomly picked citizens. For 1/10th of the year, one tribe's allotment would set the agenda for the assembly, draft laws, hear ambassadors. No minister of foreign affairs, no specialists. The 'untrained' citizens did all this. 


If this sounds insane to our modern ears, well they didn't have as messy issues to deal with. But they did have 10 *strategoi* (usually translated as generals) who could advise them. These were elected posts, almost certainly of elites, who were probably incredibly influential (Pericles was elected *strategos* repeatedly and this was how he got his agenda across). But also keep in mind that nowadays we don't have to think about our budgets in detail because we have politicians to make the decisions (and we gripe about it afterwards). In ancient Athens, you'd have to pay attention to alot of stuff because you were almost certain to end up in the council at one point of your life (unless you didn't mind getting nicknamed ""Agrippa911 the thick"" by members of your tribe).",null,0,cdp8h27,1rne56,askhistorians,top_week,7

fractalvoid,"I can't speak with specific regard to Ancient Greek democracy, but a lot of the features of what we call ""democracy"" developed much later on.
Firstly the term democracy itself is a very debatable subject so pinpointing a specific definition of one that has universal acceptance is impossible, plus there exists many varieties of democracy, and more importantly the idea of democracy is a very fluid idea and doesn't necessarily encompass solely the political and legal apparatus, a number of political theorists also associate various social, economic and cultural systems or ideals as integral to the idea to democracy.

However getting to some concrete differences and developments; firstly any introduction of democracy will cover Montesquieu's trias politica: seperation of powers, this is the ideal that any organ of state should only exercise one type of power; legislative, executive or judicial.
Another feature of a modern day democracy would be equality, this means equality under the law, regardless of nationality/religion/citizenship etc and no legally enforced class system, this of course also entails universal suffrage giving women the vote.
 
Any good modern day democracy should have a system of checks and balances within the state apparatus, quite often this viewed in light of a states constitution and specific institutions are set up to ensure this is followed. Similar to this is a system of accountability where individuals in office or the offices themselves are accountable for any breach of duty.

A more modern ideal of democracy with particular significance in Scandinavia is the idea of transparency, as in the stately process, decision making, policy making and all actions taken by any organ of the state or business operating within the state is open to the public.

The notion of Human Rights is often considered to be integrally part of Democracy or at the very least parallel to it, although the idea of human rights did exist in some rudimentary sense in ancient greece and even then mostly in philosophical discourse it wasn't the force it is today.

The rule of law is another big one too, in fact I don't think you could find a political theorist that does not equate democracy with the rule of law. Once again the basics of the idea may be traced back to Ancient Greece, but the importance of the idea and its key developments would not come to much much later. 

I write this in a bit of a rush so forgive any mistakes, and if you want me to go deeper on any points I will be happy to oblige when I get home in a few hours time.

gornthewizard,"Yes. I'm not up-to-date on some of the older material, but the main source throughout the Middle Ages was Pliny the Elder's *Natural History*, in which he describes a variety of what later were called ""monstrous races"" living in the far East and South ([see the first two sections of Book VII](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny7.html)). You can see illustrated examples in the beautiful [Psalter world map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalter_world_map), from the 13th century.

Generally, these peoples were considered to be too distant to pose any real threat to medieval Europe, but there is something of a shift in attitude from the early Middle Ages—in which they were seen as monstrous and and threatening to the traveler—to later on, when some surprisingly relativistic views emerge. The bishop of Acre in the 13th century writes:

&gt; For perhaps the cyclops, who all have one eye, marvel as much at those who have two eyes as we marvel at them, or at others with three eyes. Just as we consider the pygmies dwards, so they would just us giants, if they saw one of us among them... We do not marvel at many things in our lands that the peoples of the East, if they heard of them, either would not believe or would consider to be marvels.

This theme continues somewhat in travel narratives like Marco Polo's, or the *Travels* of John Mandeville—there's some degree of sensationalism at what are perceived as the marvels of nature, but there's also an assumption of uniformity among peoples that stands in sharp contrast to the the categories of civilization and ""savagery"" that emerge one or two centuries later with the advent of colonialism.

Sandorra,"In China, the Shanhaijing (*Classic of Mountains and Seas*) was long believed to be more of a bestiary than a mythological book, and because most species described were claimed to be in far-away lands their existence couldn't be checked and was assumed to be true. It described many human-animal hybrids, as well as some other non-human civilisations, and many more strange beasts. 

Several examples of non-human civilisations are given in the Shanhaijing. One example that came to mind for me when I read your question was a description of a species of [headless humanoid creatures](http://esoterx.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/headless_hsingtien_shanhaijing.jpg?w=500) I translated in my Classical Chinese class last year.

&gt;The Headless People inhabit the Long Sheep range, to which their ancestors were banished in the remote past for an offence against the gods. One of the said ancestors had entered into a controversy with the rulers of the heavens, and they in their anger had transformed his two breasts into eyes and his navel into a mouth, removed his head, leaving him without nose and ears, thus cutting him off from smell and sound, and banished him to the Long Sheep Mountains, where with a shield and axe, the only weapons vouchsafed to the people of the Headless Country, he and his posterity were compelled to defend themselves from their enemies and provide their subsistence. This, however, does not in the least seem to have affected their tempers, as their bodies are wreathed in perpetual smiles, except when they flourish their warlike weapons on the approach of an enemy. They are not without understanding, because, according to Chinese notions of physiology, “their bellies are full of wisdom.”

BRIStoneman,"Adam of Bremen wrote his *History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen* whilst director of the Cathedral School there in the 1060s and 1070s. Bremen was charged with converting the Danes and Swedes to the North, and in his history he describes the lands north of Uppsala as being populated by the [Cynocephali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kievskaya_psaltir_kinocefal.jpg) (dog-headed men also from Pliny's *Natural History*) although he actually confuses their characteristics with Blemmyes (men with their heads in their chest, again from Pliny). He gives writes that they are the male children of Amazons who sleep with sailors and that 'They are often seen in Russia as captives.’ 

These accounts were clearly taken seriously: in a series of correspondence from the 9th century preseved in the *Patrologia Latina*, a monk, Rimbert, who has been sent as a missionary to Sweden discusses the Cynocephali with the theologian Ratramnus of Corbie, and whether or not they could be converted. Ratramnus concludes that, since Rimbert has told him that they live in villages, farm and wear clothes, they must have 'rational minds' and futhermore, wearing clothes is a sign that they understand the concept of shame and thus could be converted to Christianity.

tobbinator,"From most descriptions and primary sources, anarchist occupied Catalonia and Aragón were actually quite functional, with productivity reportedly increasing by up to 20% as well as increases in wages as upper echelons were taken out of the equation and industries consolidated (funds could be redistributed without the high paid CEOs, etc.). Most workplaces in heavily industrialised Barcelona and the region of Catalonia were collectivised by the workers working there, with most remnants of the old upper class having gone into hiding or defected. 

In Aragón, which was primarily a rural and agricultural region, local communities often formed to redistribute the land of the larger landowners. An arrangement was made in many communities that land was to be collectivised by the agrarian workers, but if a landowner wished to exclude himself from collectivisation, they were allowed to but only on condition that they only kept land they actually worked and could only hire labour from within their own family. 

From *Homage to Catalonia*:

&gt;This was in late December 1936, less than seven months ago as I write, and yet it is a period that has already receded into enormous distance. Later events have obliterated it much more completely than they have obliterated 1935, or 1905, for that matter. I had come to Spain with some notion of writing newspaper articles, but I had joined the militia almost immediately, because at that time and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do. The Anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing. To anyone who had been there since the beginning it probably seemed even in December or January that the revolutionary period was ending; but when one came straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was something startling and overwhelming. It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags and with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Señor' or 'Don' or even 'Usted'; everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' or 'Thou', and said 'Salud!' instead of 'Buenos días'. Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a lecture from a hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There were no private motor-cars, they had all been commandeered, and the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the crowds that was the queerest thing of all. In outward appearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were no 'well-dressed' people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls or some variant of militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in this that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for...so far as one could judge the people were contented and hopeful. There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gypsies. Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine.""

Bryan Caplan, however, in [this essay](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/spain.htm) argues interestingly that Anarchist held regions still displayed a lot of statist characteristics, and presents the issue of the CNT's abuse of coercive measures to collectivise some communities and workplaces. This is again disputed by some other historians (Beevor, Kelsey) that the coercive climate was unavoidable in the wartime situation presented. 

The PCE's official party line was also similar to this. They claimed that the war came before the revolution, and used the alleged forced coercion as a reason to seize anarchist collectives and place them under Republican state control. Their actions in doing this produced a lot of tension between the PCE aligned parties and the anarchist aligned parties, which culminated into the Barcelona May Days and the end of anarchist power in Catalonia.

Reedstilt,"Let's start with the graverobbing you mentioned. In *Mourt's Relation*, written in the first years of the Plymouth colony, we have the account of the colonists digging into graves and abandoned subterranean granaries. A particularly famous case occurred when the colonists stumbled upon ""[a place like a grave](http://books.google.com/books?id=OEzGCrVmUssC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=MOurt's+Relation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=98mYUpfnJcr7oASnhIGoAQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22a%20place%20like%20a%20grave%22&amp;f=false. The size and structure of the grave was unusual and the colonists began excavating it almost immediately. In addition to finding the usual grave goods of the region (which often include corn and therefore encouraged the colonists to dig up graves when they were starving through the winter), they discovered a blond-haired man wrapped in in sail, which caused quite a bit of debate over how he came to be there.

Despite that, initial relations weren't horrible. In the spring of 1621, after the colonists managed to survive their first winter, Massasoit Ousamequin, head of the Wampanoag Confederacy, formalized a peace with the colonists provided they support him against the Narragansett to the west. It was an imperfect alliance, and as Ousamequin didn't quite trust the colonists or Tisquantum (Squanto), his primary interpreter. Ousamequin's presence at the ""first Thanksgiving"" is as likely to have resulted from his suspicions as it was from his alliance with the colonists. The colonists had fired off some celebratory gunfire, which attracted the attention of their neighbors. Ousamequin showed up with 90 armed men, to find out whether the colonists were under attack or if they had betrayed the peace.

Over the next decade, additional English colonies were established elsewhere in what has become Massachusetts and Connecticut, and the Dutch had settled to the west. Political alliances shifted as the nations of what is now southern New England secured trading rights with the two rival European powers. This went so far as to pull at least nation apart and the Dutch-allied Pequots and the English-allied Mohegans resulted from the split.  The region became increasingly volatile, and in the early 1630s, the Pequot War breaks out, which is when relations between the English colonists and the native nations takes a genocidal turn.

On Nov 27, 1637, the English and their allies (the Mohegans and the Narragansetts at this point; the Wampanoag remained neutral in this war) surrounded the last Pequot stronghold, a fortified town on the Mystic River. Having already failed to storm the town during a previous attack, the English caught it fire and shot anyone who attempted to flee, with their allies killing or capturing any one who managed to get past the English lines. The captives were divided among the English, the Narragansetts, and the Mohegans. The English sent their captives into slavery, mostly in the Caribbean. The others were adopted into the other nations (from which their descendants would declare their independence in the 20th Century). Still, the systematic destruction of the Pequots at what has become called the Mystic Massacre was a wake-up call even to the English's allies. The Europeans were playing by different rules.  A similar fate would eventually befall the Wampanoag in the 1670s with King Philip's War, named for Ousamequin's son and second successor Metacomet, who was known to the English as Philip, at the end of which almost the entirety of the surviving Wampanoag populace was sold into slavery in Bermuda.

The fate of the nations of southern New England would become a recruitment tool for Tecumseh in 1811. In his speech to the Choctaw and Chickasaw, he begins ""Where today are the Pequot? Where are the Narragansett, the Mohican, the Pocanet, and other powerful tribes of our people? They have vanished before the avarice and oppression of the white man, as snow before the summer sun."" By 'Pocanet', Tecumseh seems to be referring to the Pokanoket, the principal tribe of the Wampanoag Confederacy, to which Ousamequin and Metacomet belonged.",null,0,cdpohfa,1rnpaq,askhistorians,top_week,3

Armor needs to fit each individual person, then then need a weapon on top of the armor, both requiring upkeep. Then there is time required to train each of these weapons. Crossbows are complicated to make and delicate, longbows take a lifetime to master.

Muskets take about two weeks to become competent (I believe a spear can take anywhere between six months to two years to be skilled enough to use it in battle). By the time of the Thirty Years War, muskets became more commonplace and by 1700, most European armies were using muskets primarily.

Feudal lords commanded troops armed with thousands of locally produced long guns. When invading Korea the Japanese brought along over 150,000 firearms.  However as time moved on the samurai lead Shogunate gained firmer control of the government.  The samurai disliked guns as they could put a little trained peasant on parity with the military skill of samurai who had trained for years.  With no major external threats the samurai could return Japan to their preferred manner of honorable classic combat (thus ensuring the dominance of their class) and they did.  By 1700 guns were gone from Japan and they would not return until the middle of the 1800s.

mormengil,"The main cause of the huge declines in American Indian populations after the Columbian exchange, was the impact of recurring epidemics of European diseases to which the American Indians had no immunity.

Generally, for about 400 years after the Columbian exchange began, sparsely populated regions of the Americas suffered from recurring epidemics, and the population declined to a low point in circa 1900, after which inoculations and vaccinations began to counter epidemic diseases and many American Indiian populations began to finally rebound (populations in Canada and the USA, for example have grown more than ten times since 1900).

If the American Indian population was dense enough, the European diseases, or some of them would become endemic in the population instead of epidemic.  Once diseases became endemic, populations began to stabilize and recover.  Diseases like smallpox became endemic in Mexico, for example, sometime before 1700.

The effects of epidemic diseases on populations with no immunity could be huge.  Charles Mann, in “1491” estimates that the Wampanoag nation had 20,000 people in 1617, and only 1,000 survivors in 1619 (one year before the first European settlement in their territory at Plymouth Plantation), after an epidemic disease spread from French shipwreck survivors on Cape Cod.

Of course, populations could recover, even from 95% mortality rates like this, in time.  But the American Indian populations were hit with epidemics again and again.

For an example of how population rates struggled to recover from recurring epidemics, we can look at Iceland (where there is some better data – though still not great – about populations).  Small pox entered Iceland in 1241, killing some 20,000 people out of a total population of 70,000 (29%).  

http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp5.pdf

There were then a total of 14 other smallpox epidemics in Iceland between 1241 and 1707.  (One epidemic every 31 years).  In 1709, at the end of the 1707 epidemic, the population of Iceland was 38,000.  The population of Iceland never recovered in 468 years!  (Note:  the population of Iceland continued to decline farther, but much of this was due to the great eruption of the Laki volcano in 1783, which wiped out most of Iceland’s livestock, and the ensuing famine killed 25% of the population, making the impact of edidemics vs. the impact of natural disasters become hard to dis-entangle.)

Hays,  “Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History”, 2005, p.131  found at: http://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Epidemics+in+iceland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4V0n6fg9qc&amp;sig=xC8PHfAXNhhwrHQAG6iwCBwljt0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3qXUsrBL47NsQSt4IHIBQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Epidemics%20in%20iceland&amp;f=false

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iceland (for date and impact estimates of Laki volcano eruption.)


The population of Iceland seems to have had more genetic protection against small pox than American Indian populations.  Mortality rates in a bad epidemic in Iceland were usually below 30%.  Mortality rates in bad epidemics in American Indian populations were often above 50%.

The example of Iceland indicates  that American Indian populations exposed to recurring epidemics, would never managed to stabilize and recover.  They just kept declining.  The evidence is that most American Indian populations continued to decline until circa 1900, when the advent of immunization and vaccination programs halted the decline and a rebound began.

Where American Indian populations began to stabilize or recover earlier, it seems to have been where populations were dense enough (Mesoamerica, parts of South America) that some of the European diseases could become endemic, rather than epidemic.  Endemic diseases, even if still deadly, have a greatly reduced impact on population levels compared to recurring epidemics, because they kill children (the adults being either immune or survivors ).  High childhood mortality rates are more easily replaced by a population.

So, the reason why there are many more American Indians in Mexico and parts of South America is that these areas were more densely settled originally.  Although hit with hugely damaging epidemics, the populations in these regions remained dense enough for the European diseases (or some of them) to become endemic rather than remain recurring epidemics.  

Once diseases became endemic, even though the mortality rate could remain tragically high in children, the population had a much better chance of stabilizing and beginning to recover.  So some densely populated areas began to stabilize American Indian populations by circa 1700, while in less densely populated regions, where diseases remained as recurring epidemics, populations did not begin to stabilize until some 200 years later.

Hays,  “Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History”, 2005, p.131  found at: http://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Epidemics+in+iceland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4V0n6fg9qc&amp;sig=xC8PHfAXNhhwrHQAG6iwCBwljt0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3qXUsrBL47NsQSt4IHIBQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Epidemics%20in%20iceland&amp;f=false

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iceland (for date and impact estimates of Laki volcano eruption.)


The population of Iceland seems to have had more genetic protection against small pox than American Indian populations.  Mortality rates in a bad epidemic in Iceland were usually below 30%.  Mortality rates in bad epidemics in American Indian populations were often above 50%.

The example of Iceland indicates  that American Indian populations exposed to recurring epidemics, would never managed to stabilize and recover.  They just kept declining.  The evidence is that most American Indian populations continued to decline until circa 1900, when the advent of immunization and vaccination programs halted the decline and a rebound began.

Where American Indian populations began to stabilize or recover earlier, it seems to have been where populations were dense enough (Mesoamerica, parts of South America) that some of the European diseases could become endemic, rather than epidemic.  Endemic diseases, even if still deadly, have a greatly reduced impact on population levels compared to recurring epidemics, because they kill children (the adults being either immune or survivors ).  High childhood mortality rates are more easily replaced by a population.

So, the reason why there are many more American Indians in Mexico and parts of South America is that these areas were more densely settled originally.  Although hit with hugely damaging epidemics, the populations in these regions remained dense enough for the European diseases (or some of them) to become endemic rather than remain recurring epidemics.  

Once diseases became endemic, even though the mortality rate could remain tragically high in children, the population had a much better chance of stabilizing and beginning to recover.  So some densely populated areas began to stabilize American Indian populations by circa 1700, while in less densely populated regions, where diseases remained as recurring epidemics, populations did not begin to stabilize until some 200 years later.

mosin91,"Operating under the assumption that it is in fact a cannonball, and not something else (shot put, ball bearing, ornamental iron ball, or something else), this [link](http://www.civilwarartillery.com/shottables.htm) on Civil War artillery projectiles might help you identify it.  

Knowing the exact circumference, and weight would help, as would the presence of any other artifacts around the area.  There were a few skirmishes in Hidalgo County during the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidalgo_County,_Texas#History) but I don't know enough about the area, nor do I have the inclination to learn enough to determine if any of these known battles took place near where this ball was recovered, or if any of the military units around there even had artillery.

Given it's size, it could be from a small 3 or 4 pounder cannon, or even grape or canister shot from a larger bore.  Going out on a limb, and given the remote and non strategic location of Hidalgo County, I wouldn't be surprised if one or two small 3 or 4 pounder cannon were part of the local defense, so it's probable that the ball was used in a small cannon.  

EDIT: Here is an example of a [three pounder](http://steencannons.com/cannons/ames-3-pounder/) cannon (so named for the weight of it's solid shot projectile). As you can see it is small, and easily transportable. These and similar guns were commonly used for light artillery support of small groups. It's in no way a serious artillery piece capable of launching large balls great distance, but light artillery played an important roll, when having a cannon could often turn a skirmish or battle in your favor.

You're on a [ship](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Batavia_02.JPG) that is some 56 meters long and and ten meters wide. You're not alone of course, apart from you, there are 340 other sailors, officers, soldiers and tradesmen. If you're a soldier, you will spend most of your trip below decks. 

Your meals will consist of bread, porridge, beans and salted meat/fish. No fresh vegetables or fruit, so scurvy is an ever present threat* (though that was the case for many on land as well). Of course, the longer the journey lasts, the worse the food and water/beer will become. 

Discipline was strict and punishments severe. You could be lashed, branded, have your hand nailed to the mast with your own knife or be keelhauled. For lighter offences, like cursing, you would merely be fined.

Apart from scurvy,  drought and starvation there would also be a fine collection of tropical diseases waiting for you on your trip.

Your teacher was a bit off when he was talking about the duration of the trip BtW (assuming we're talking about a trip to Java). After a new, more southern, route had been found in the early 17th century the trip took five to six months. With a stop for reprovisioning at the cape of Good Hope.

Of all the men on your ship, about half would return to Europe. This didn't mean the other half would die on the trip. A lot would stay (and die) in the Indies (east and west) or Africa. Soldiers were needed to man forts there. Sailors  to man ships for local trade.

Of course, if your ship is the ship i linked to above, you will shipwreck off the coast of Australia and mutineers and the elements will kill almost the entire crew.

You have to remember though that conditions on land weren't exactly rosy either. Malaria might kill you on Java, but an infection from a splinter you got in your back yard might just as easily kill you at home. At least working for the East India company would earn some money for your family.

Axon350,"[A little while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ozb35/who_was_the_first_us_president_to_have_his/ccx9me5?context=3) I talked about the first photograph of a sitting US President. You can see some links in that post.

The earliest surviving photo of a president in office is of James K. Polk. There are a couple undated photos of him, so the order is unclear, but they were almost certainly taken while he was in office because he died just three months after leaving.

Those are the earliest *surviving* (in digitized form, you'd be surprised what you can find in books) photos of a sitting President. Yet there is a mysterious photo of John Tyler. Wikipedia says that Polk was the first to be photographed in office (without citation) but has in its article a photo of Tyler, purportedly taken by Anthony, Edwards, &amp; Co. A press release from March 17, 1845 in the New York Herald talks about an exhibition of pictures taken by Anthony, Edwards, &amp; Co. and mentions a portrait of 'ex-President John Tyler'. The portrait is not described and neither is the date on which it was captured. Another press release mentions the gallery on March 13, implying that it was a multi-day event. Tyler only left office on March 4. 

It is possible that a photo of Tyler was indeed taken while he was still in office. Further corroborating this is a brief blurb here at the Encyclopedia Virginia which mentions an advertisement from 1844 from Anthony, Edwards, &amp; Co. claiming to have photographed Tyler. It is as yet unclear when exactly the existing daguerreotype of Tyler was taken, though I conclude that it is certainly possible for him to have been photographed in office.

Here, on the other hand, is the largely undisputed [first photograph of any US President, John Quincy Adams.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/John_Quincy_Adams_-_copy_of_1843_Philip_Haas_Daguerreotype.jpg) ",null,2,cdpcwce,1ro73k,askhistorians,top_week,11

The long answer is, well, complicated. I don't quite like covering Russia with broad generalizations, since their society is so unique, but I think in this case it might work. Russia is a steppe country, whose borders are very long and open, making it vulnerable to the various horse tribes of the steppe. In order to counter this, Russian rulers tend to militarily expand in order to eliminate possible threats from the steppe. They also tend to consolidate and centralize power, using terror and violence when necessary. This is not so different from other European monarchs at the time, although it can be argued that the Russian methods were more thorough. And then sometimes the ruler was just plain mad, as it can be with any monarchy. Ivan the Terrible, for instance, was starting to go crazy at the time he killed his son. He didn't intentionally do it, and afterwards he  held his son in his arms, crying.

It's important to understand the situation many czars were in order to understand their actions. They were often threatened by war, rebellions, and coups. Sometimes this necessitated harsh policies. Peter and Catherine were certainly great rulers, but they ruled Russia with an iron fist. Peter brutally stamped out opposition to his western policies, and Catherine either manipulated or killed anyone who was a threat to her. Ivan the Terrible created the Oprichniki, which was the original secret police. These rulers were keenly aware of the political situation and did this not only to hold onto power, but to save their own skin. 

So now we're at Peter the Great. Peter asks his son to start preparing to become czar, while his son wants nothing to do with that. Peter had another son, but he needed to make sure that after he died that Alexei wouldn't get powerhungry and go after the throne anyway. He demands that Alexei become a monk; if he wants to be czar one day to join the army. Alexei flees from Russia to Vienna. This causes quite a stir among the nobility and Peter suspects his son of treason. He convinces his son to return on the false pretense of safety. After Alexei's return, Peter starts his inquisition, to root out all the ""traitors"" in Alexei's circle. His son is convicted then sentenced to death. He is instead tortured to death in an attempt to get more information.

Stalin's situation is also unique. He was also very concerned about the political atmosphere in Russia. He was also in the middle of a devastating war, and while it did give him some leverage among the general population, he could no longer afford to eliminate political threats in the military. Stalin's son was captured by the Germans. Hitler offered to trade him for Field Marshall Paulus, and Stalin replied ""I will not trade a Marshall for a Lieutenant."" While we can speculate on the various reasons Stalin abandoned his son, it is claimed by his daughter that Stalin believed his son deliberately surrendered, and was therefore a traitor.

OldRosieOnCornflakes,"I have a follow-up question related to armed forces headgear. 

In a few films, most obvious I can remember is The Guns of Navarone, and at HMS Belfast in London I've seen costumed forces (dummies in Belfast's case) wearing like a plain cloth cap that covers the head and shoulders over their standard uniform when 'in battle'. What is this for? It seemed to be particularly artillery operators in movies, but on Belfast I think there were some men wearing them in one of the battle computer rooms. 

Am I right in thinking it's some means of shielding the (probably expensive) uniform from smoke, exhaust fumes, dust etc when firing large weaponry?

DonaldFDraper,"When I took my senior seminar, it was a subject seminar on the Late Roman Empire. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do but I was always interested in what made a Roman a Roman, so I ended up doing a paper on Roman identity during the Late Empire.

I did it but it was terrible, the professor wouldn't let me reference Early Empire or Republican era concepts despite my constant arguments that Late Imperial Roman identity was based on the Late Republican ideals. Be careful with the professor.

So, from this, I recommend this.

*1). What is your interest in history for you?

For me, it's the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.

*2). Why are you interested in this subject?

I love the romantic aspect of the wars. LaSalle predicting his death; Oudinot's Grenadiers; Davout fighting the best of the Prussian army with his single Corp; romantic stories that are rooted mainly in fact with some embellishments. 

*3). What do you want to know about the subject that you love?

I've been interested in the French Way of War, so I've studied much on the tactics and the army construction of the French army, so a paper concept I have for my own free time is this: how did a cartridge get made and make it's way to the front lines?

*4). Can you do the research?

This is a VERY important step, are you able to research it on your own without having to go into archives that you're not allowed into yet. Do you have access to the materials that allows you to make this paper possible. My paper about cartridges is impossible for me as an undergrad but possible for someone working on a Doctoral thesis. Know your limits.

*5). Do you REALLY like your topic?

Are you willing to fight for it if push comes to shove and your ideas get shot down? Can you defend it and your analysis?

*Finally, 6). Be sure you're willing to spend the time on it.

If it's a subject that you like, make sure that you're willing to get to the nitty gritty of the subject. You may find things that you may not like or even find that you don't like the topic that you are doing. So do preliminary research into the topic long before you propose it.

vonadler,"The conquest of Anatolia was not so much a conquest as it was a migration of several semi-nomadic Turkish tribes of the Great Seljuk Empire after the Eastern Roman defeat at Manzikert 1071. While they became the majority or plurality (ie the largest group but not above 50%) of most of Anatolia, they did not completely displace the local population. There were large groups of Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Jews living in Anatolia up to the early 1920s, when both Greece and Turkey ethnically cleansed their territories in a ""population exchange"" and those Armenians and Greeks that remained in Turkey were forced to take Turkish names and speak Turkish (the Pontic Greeks were forcefully assimilated this way).

So, first of all, Anatolia was not as Turkish as you may think it was during the days of the Ottoman Empire. Secondly, the Turks moved there 300 years before Osman founded the Ottoman Empire, and thirdly, the Balkans were far more muslim than you might think, before the ethnical cleansing condicted after the Russo-Ottoman war of 1877-78 and the First Balkan War 1912-1913 and finally the Greaco-Turkish War 1919-22.

The term ""Turkish"" during the days of the Ottoman Empire was more used as a slur than anything else. Turcik people on the countryside were referred to as ""Turks"", which meant something like a simpleton or a hillbilly. The elites called themselves ""Ottomans"".

The Balkans did have large groups of ""Turks"" or various Balkan groups that had converted to muslims and were by the time considered more or less ""Turks"" despite their ethnicity being something else.

Overall, ethnicity and religion is very inter-mixed and before the age of nationalism, it could be hard to tell who was what - people identified more along the lines of the rulership (being Ottoman) or religion than they did along the lines of ethnicity.

Here are a few maps that can help explain how intermixed things were.

[Ethnic makeup of the Balkans 1861](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/RizMap19.jpg). As you can see there are large groups of Turks in the Balkans, especially in Romelia (today part of northeastern Bulgaria and southeastern Romania).

[Another map of ethnic makeup of the Balkans, from 1877](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/CarlSaxET1877.jpg). As you can see, muslims and Turks are viewed pretty much as the same, and there are large groups of them.

[An ethnic map of Anatolia from 1910](http://mediaevalmusings.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/800px-asiaminor1910.jpg). As you can see, large groups of Greeks and Armenians and some others.

About 2,5 milion muslims were forced to flee from the Caucasus and Balkans, with another ~1 million killed in the 1877-78  and the 1912-13 war ([source](http://www.ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/forced-ethnic-migration/berna-pekesen-expulsion-and-emigration-of-the-muslims-from-the-balkans)), and there still are large groups of muslims in Bulgaria.

Bottom line? Anatolia was less Turkish than you think until 1923, and the Balkans were more Turkish than you think until 1913. Still, there was a migration of Turkish tribes pre-Ottoman Empire into Anatolia that did not happen into the Balkans.

Edit: Put in Kurds as one of the groups in Anatlia, as per the remark of /u/G_Comstock",null,4,cdpglia,1rox3z,askhistorians,top_week,17
TheWinStore,"Botched intelligence and botched communication within the Kennedy administration contributed a great deal to the failure of the Bay of Pigs. Yet the catastrophe was entirely avoidable. 

Just for some essential background information: during his first few months in office, JFK was immediately confronted with the question of what to do about Cuba. In 1959, Castro had taken control of the country, and Castro wanted to free Cuba from its dependency on the U.S.—the U.S. bought 50% of Cuba’s sugar (at subsidized prices) and owned the major oil refineries, sugar plantations, and utilities. Castro wasn't a communist when he took over, but his brother Raul was and so was Che Guevara. Both pressured Castro to draw closer to the Soviets.

On November 18, 1960, about a week after his election, JFK was briefed on a CIA plan to send an invasion force of 1500 Cuban exiles to invade Cuba. President Eisenhower told JFK that the anti-Castro plan was proceeding well, and that it would be his responsibility to see it through. That advice left a big impression on JFK, who greatly respected Ike’s military background. 

* * *

So what intelligence and bureaucratic failures doomed the Bay of Pigs, and why did they develop?

**Failure #1: the Joint Chiefs.** The Joint Chiefs studied the CIA plan and correctly concluded it would fail without large-scale popular uprisings in Cuba, meaning the people of Cuba would have to rise up against the government. The Joint Chiefs also correctly concluded that there was no evidence the Cuban people would do so. 

Unfortunately, the Joint Chiefs obfuscated their conclusions. For example, they concluded that the CIA plan had a “fair” chance of success. But does fair mean good or bad? It’s very ambiguous language. What the JCs really meant was that there was a 30-70% chance of failure, which are pretty poor odds, relatively speaking. But when JFK’s advisors read the memo, they weren't aware of this probability. Additionally, all the Joint Chiefs' reservations about the plan were buried in the back of the long memo. 

**Failure #2: obsession with secrecy.** A series of meetings were called in the White House to discuss the CIA plan. One of the first issues that arose was the ""disposal problem,"" which was raised by Allen Dulles, who was still head of the CIA as a holdover from Ike’s administration. He said that if the invasion were called off, the Cuban exiles who had been training in Guatemala would come to the US and risk leaking the plan, making JFK look weak and indecisive. 

In March 1961, JFK approved the plan, provided US involvement was kept secret. He wanted the plan to be free of traces of US fingerprints. Whether this was even feasible was another question entirely. But secrecy was desirable at the time because the U.S. was still engaged in sensitive negotiations with the Soviets over Laos. JFK also wanted a more benign relationship with Latin American countries, and a U.S. invasion of Cuba would make the U.S. look bad. 

Unfortunately, JFK's desire for secrecy led to the invasion site being moved from Trinidad, Cuba to the less-exposed Bay of Pigs. This decision would have substantial consequences. As far as intelligence goes, JFK approved the plan with the assumption that even if the invasion failed, the Cuban exiles could flee to the mountains and conduct guerrilla warfare there. There was a minor snag, however—whereas the original invasion site at Trinidad was close to the mountains, the Bay of Pigs was not. It seems that no one took the time to look at a map and point this out to JFK. Oops. 

Excessive secrecy was a problem even within the process of administrative decision-making. At every meeting, for example, the CIA would hand out copies of the latest plan and then confiscate the plans at the end so that none of JFK's advisors could leave the room with them. This prevented the administration from consulting outside experts at the State Department and so forth. 

**Failure #3: erroneous assumptions.** The Bay of Pigs plan was based on numerous erroneous assumptions. For example, it was assumed that the invasion would set off an uprising in the Cuban underground against Castro. But after the air strike, Castro just rounded up all the members of the Cuban underground and chucked them into prison. The anti-Castro forces were weak, disorganized, and lacked clear leadership. No Cuban underground even existed. Another poor assumption was that US involvement could be kept a secret – clearly implausible given the extent of US involvement. And finally, there was the assumption that even a failed invasion would allow a flight to the mountains, which never occurred. 

**Failure #4: newbies.** Typically, bad intelligence can be checked by thorough, careful decision-making. However, JFK’s advisors were reluctant to speak out against the plan. The advisors were in place only 77 days, were new to each other, and were not used to blunt discussion. They were afraid to challenge the CIA on the premises of the plan, especially because the CIA was headed by Allen Dulles, who had overthrown governments in Guatemala and elsewhere. There was no real discussion where advisors were allowed to debate the issues—the administration simply deferred the plan to the CIA and so the outcome was extremely poor.

**Failure #5: bureaucratic politics.** The CIA and the Joint Chiefs were much more concerned about their own parochial interests than national interests. The CIA withheld critical information from the president (such as the known weakness of the anti-Castro underground and the low morale of the Cuban exiles when they learned US would provide direct support). The CIA also had no evidence of strong anti-Castro forces on Cuba. 

The CIA was not the only culprit. The Joint Chiefs did not effectively warn JFK that the operation was not militarily feasible. They failed to warn him that Castro’s air force had to be totally destroyed for the invasion to have any chance of success. And the Joint Chiefs did not make their other reservations known to the administration. Why? They thought if the plan started to fail, JFK would have to deploy US troops to salvage the mission, which would conveniently serve the Joint Chiefs' interests. And if the invasion did fail, they assumed the CIA would take the blame, not them.

* * *

All of these reasons contributed to the failure of the Bay of Pigs. Would a U.S.-flagged invasion have succeeded? Perhaps, but JFK would never have approved such a plan. If the intelligence had been properly handled, the correct decision would have been to take no action. 

Fortunately, JFK learned a few lessons from the Bay of Pigs. First, don’t trust the bureaucracy. Second, don’t be awed by experts. And third, encourage frank discussion and debate. JFK would draw on all of these lessons during the Cuban missile crisis—so in a way, failure in 1961 laid the groundwork for success in 1962.

mormengil,"Have a look at the small city of Uzes, in Gard in the South of France.  The center of the city is still laid out much as it was in Medieval times.  

The city has 8,000 people today.  Perhaps 5,000 in the 12th century? (6,150 in 1793)

The city was surrounded by a defensive wall (now gone and replaced by a road).  Inside the city were three great defensive towers (still there), The Tour Bermonde (the keep of the Seigneurs de Uzes - first recorded in 1080 AD, who later became Viscounts, and then Dukes), The Tour du Roi (built by the town guilds as a counter power to the Seigneurs and the Bishop - later taken over by the Kings of France), and the Tour de l'Eveche (The tower of the bishop's palace).

There was a bishop of Uzes since at least 442 AD.  There was a cathedral there in the 12th century, but it has been rebuilt twice since then, and the current one is from the 17th century.  Its ""Tour Fenestrelle"", however, has survived from the 12th century.  There are also several other churches.

In the center of town is the ""Place aux Herbes"" which is where the market was (and still is) held.

Buildings in the city are of stone, with Roman tiled roofs.  Domestic buildings are most typically three or four stories high.  They frequently have a vaulted ground floor, used for workshops or storage or shops, with living quarters on the two or three upper floors.  There were a mixture of apartment buildings, single family homes, and the city mansions of rich merchants or feudal knights from the surrounding countryside.

The main industry in the town, probably since the 12th century, was the manufacture of cloth. But it was also a center of government, church, law courts and commerce for the surrounding area.  The bishops had the right to mint coins in the 12th century, so there was a mint.  

On the outskirts of the town were several large monasteries.   The town was surrounded by the hunting preserve of the Seigneurs, and by farmlands and small villages, each with its own small castle.

The agriculture of the area, then as now, was vines, olives, sheep, fruit, vegetables and grain.

If you search for images of Uzes, you will get a pretty good idea of the nature of the medieval city.  (Though the surviving buildings generally date from the  12th century or later, rather than the 11th.)

The street pattern and building footprints inside the trace of the old walls are all the same as they would have been in Medieval times.",null,0,cdq13i4,1rp0tz,askhistorians,top_week,2
Bezant,"&gt;Just outside Athens, Pisistratus cut himself and his mules about the body, then drove into town claiming that he'd been attacked by his political enemies. The people gave him bodyguards, who followed him around armed with clubs. Pisistratus then took the Acropolis by force with the help of his new bodyguards.

This one, I don't think is particularly hard to believe.  The main point is that he overrode the traditional Athenian objections to an armed bodyguard.  Once he had, say, a handful of men the precedent was set and, as a powerful political figure, he was able to expand his guard further over time.

&gt;Pisistratus was later driven out of Athens. His plan to get back into power is described by Herodotus as “the silliest trick which history has to record.” He found a tall woman called Phye (Φύη), and dressed her up as Athena. He taught her some goddess-like moves, then rode into Athens on a chariot with her standing next to him. The Athenians fell for this ludicrous ruse, and he returned to power. Herodotus himself is incredulous about this story.

My Greek history professor suggested that, rather than being taken in by the ruse, it was never intended seriously and the Athenians just went along because they appreciated a good show.  The entire 'show' was secondary to the political context that allowed him to return and be welcomed by the citizens.  I find that a more reasonable assessment than the Athenians being complete idiots.  (for fun, if you calculate Phye's height she was about 5'7)


&gt;After being chucked out of Athens for a second time, Pisistratus gathered an army and made for the city. On the way, a soothsayer wandered by, and told him some nonsense about fish being caught in nets. Pisistratus ordered his army to advance; at that exact time, the Athenians were “having lunch” or playing some dice, or having an after-lunch snooze. So Pisistratus's army walked into Athens unopposed. 

This strikes me as the fairly common practice of random oracles and divine acts being thrown in.  The thing that makes Herodotus different from the people that wrote about 'history' before him is he incorporated human agency rather than divine.  A common feature of his work is explaining the human side and  the supposed divine side of any historical event, but what really makes it history is they basically function without the divine bits.

What we know is that during his exile he built contacts throughout the Greek world, raised a pretty big army, which he marched back to Athens with and won the battle of Pallene.

Also keep in mind, he was not just some nutter gaining power through crazy tricks.  He was an important political leader with a large base of support among the Athenians, as well as a skilled and competent ruler.  So it wasn't very absurd that he rose to power.  

As to whether people believed the more fanciful parts of the story; probably not at first, but as the time passes and the events grow more distant the authority of remaining sources gets stronger, so until more serious criticism of historiography emerged Herodotus' version was likely widely believed.",null,16,cdphf7u,1rp2ge,askhistorians,top_week,113

But one must always remember that only certain African societies took part, and only certain leaderships, under varying conditions (usually connected to other, existing political objectives).  African rulers didn't have to ""give consent,"" because the majority of people taken into slavery--and certainly the majority of fighting-age men--were captured in war or surrendered as tribute.  Under the older system, however, those people remained in the region; the export trades removed them entirely.  Except for civil war (important in Kongo) and occasionally the sale of condemned criminals, African rulers were not putting ""their"" people into the trade, but normally their enemies or other strangers.  The acquisition cost was effectively pretty low, so this was pure profit for the individual captor.

The ""getting guns"" thing was not quite as important as you suggest, in part because a number of societies had other things Europeans wanted too, and sometimes they wanted other things from Europeans.  Asante, for example, not only actually *imported* slaves on the coast, but also had gold and could buy firearms. It wasn't alone.  Arms traffic in West Africa wasn't restricted to those who engaged in slave trafficking.  (It wasn't just leaders, either; a lot of traders were pretty independent and simply gathered slaves from the major markets.  Slave-oriented states like Dahomey were late developments on the whole.)

The Atlantic trade was something of a magnitude unknown in the intra-African trade (or generally in the African experience of slavery).  Chattel slavery required a lot of people to pretend they weren't doing anything wrong; the massive expansion of the slave trade required the same.  In effect answering the question of who's at moral fault is impossible because everyone involved in the trade, from the point of capture to the final destination, was in some way responsible for the trade.  The morality of the slave trade is another matter, because of the prospect of presentism, but we can certainly recognize analytically that the machinery of the export slave trades worked helically, growing and deepening as it went, one step at a time, involving people of all sorts with a lot of different motivations across three continents and a whole ocean.  A search for particular ""blame"" is not really relevant here, and it's honestly not good history to frame a complex, 300+ year long commercial trajectory that way.

Have a look at John Thornton's *Cultural History of the Atlantic World 1250-1820* or his earlier *Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World*.  He gets at some of this in there.  One important warning, though--the agendas in play when people talk about ""the blame game"" (or the related ""numbers game"") are a mile wide, on many sides.",null,4,cdphq5f,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_week,26
mormengil,"""Moral culpability"", is a very tricky subject for historians to get into.

We really should not anachronistically reflect our own moral values, or today's moral values back into the past, and use them to judge historical people.

If we think that it is immoral to conquer other people, does that mean we should go back in history and declare that Alexander and Caesar and Muhammad and Genghis Khan were evil and ""morally culpable""?

Instead, if one of the goals of history, is to deeply understand the past and the people in it, we should try to understand how the people themselves, or their contemporaries, thought about the morality, and how they might have judged themselves or been judged AT THE TIME.

At the time of the early Atlantic slave trade in the 1500s, slavery had been a long standing institution in Africa, and the slave trade (in the Indian ocean) had been going on for a long time.  I don't think we know of any sources indicating a moral objection to the slave trade within African societies.

There was also little or no moral objection to slavery from Europeans in 1500. It wasn't until late in the 1700's that the abolitionist movement, and men like John Wesley and William Wilberforce in England, and colonists in Northern Colonies like Vermont and Massachusetts began to be a strong voice against the morality of slavery.

African rulers were certainly heavily engaged in the slave trade, but whether they or their contemporaries considered them ""morally culpable"" for this engagement seems dubious.

By the late 1700s, there were enough people in Europe (mostly England) and the Americas who thought that slavery was immoral, and were vocal enough about it, that most Europeans were aware that the subject had been opened for debate.  Whether (or when) any of this debate occurred in Africa, I don't think we know.",null,1,cdpjwy3,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_week,5
GHboy,"The moral culpability of African rulers is a loaded and subjective question whose answer depends on perspective.
It's a complex interplay of the two. European powers specifically set up forts on coastal areas to purchase slaves. However, they could not have purchased slaves without a seller.
In addition to buying slaves from 'free-lance' slave catchers, Europeans also bought slaves who were POWs and refugees from kingdoms such as the [Ashanti Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Empire).

Considering the extreme profitability of the slave trade in the Americas, it was in European interest to have Africans fighting as it supplied a steady stream of slaves. It was in the Africans interest to sell slaves as to acquire guns so as to not be enslaved by their enemies.

If an African kingdom had refused to cooperate and sell slaves, the European powers would have simply armed the competing tribe/kingdom. So the Africans had to play ball whether they wanted to or not, and some states, like the expansionary Ashanti empire, definitely wanted to play ball.

Secondly, tribes never actually sold their own people. They sold other tribes from further inland. So I'm not sure if 'consent' is even applicable. It's fairly easy to consent to you enslaving my enemy.",null,5,cdphw56,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_week,4

My answer to you specifically is that the BCE/CE system is precisely intended as a secularised alternative to BC/AD that doesn't confuse *current dates*. 1936 is still 1936, whether it has AD or CE after it. This means that switching from one to the other would not confuse anybody.

But there are others who feel much more strongly about the issue one way or the other. I have not found that this is truly standardised across history as a discipline as much as many academics believe it to be, but as I said in one of the linked-to threads there is no unifying constitution for history and any new approaches are adopted piecemeal rather than consistently.",null,3,cdpo2xk,1rp8oa,askhistorians,top_week,12

backmarkerS_E,"Yes, there were wars between Aboriginal Australians.  We have some evidence for this:

1)  The existence of wooden shields.  Shields only exist in order to block the weapons of others, and do not have utility for hunting (unlike knives and clubs), so therefore demonstrate that fighting was taking place.

2) Australian rock art dating back at least 10,000 years depicts fighting scenes using weaponry.

3) Research by anthropologists since the mid-19th century has witnessed wars between Aboriginal Australian tribes.  Not only did wars take place over hunting territory or ownership of wells, but also over the abduction of women.

These conflicts between tribes often resulted in long-running feuds, as a result of 'payback law', whereby a raid will cause retaliation from the other tribe.  These could be devastating - anthropologist T.G.H. Strelow witnessed a three year conflict that killed 20% of the population of the tribes conducting the war.

I am no anthropologist myself, so you might get a better response from  [/r/Anthropology](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology), but as far as I understand it, Aboriginal Australian tribes did not structure themselves in such a way that would result in a kings/lords/subjects relationship, and war was not fought for these reasons.  Aboriginal Australian tribes were led by the elders of the group, and they fought to defend/gain hunting land/access to water/women, not to subjugate other people.  But as I say [/r/Anthropology](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology) may know better than me.

See, the battle happens over two days, and on the first day the Union forces were thoroughly beaten by the Confederates. Grant *should* have accepted his loss and pulled his troops back, its what every other general did during the war (need I bring up panicky McClellan?). But instead he consolidated his forces and fought again on the second day, where he turned the tables and inflicted a defeat on the Confederate forces (a defeat which allowed the Union to keep all the gains it had made across the Mississippi river, I should add). This showed Grant to be a tenacious and capable commander. It didnt prove that he was a ""great"" general (that would come in 1863), but it proved he was willing to continue fighting when by all measures he was actually beaten. 

Also, its interesting to look at the battle of Shiloh in the context of the Overland Campaign. During Overland, Grant suffered major defeats at every engagement (if we use the same ruler we use for every *other* Civil War battle, which doesnt quite fit the OC Ill admit). But US Grant kept turning Lee's flank and continuing south. Whereas every general before him *had* retreated after losing to Lee, Grant just kept going. 

Thats another reason why Shiloh is so critical to US Grant.

Atlantic World Historian Ira Berlin has said something to the effect of ""To know a person is a slave is to know only their legal status."" And I stand by this from my own research in the Atlantic World. The experience of slaves cannot be so easily generalized, even within the very clear lens of British Colonial North America. Even there, a number of different crops were grown between 1500 and 1700, and slaves were subjected to different legal and social privileges that effected their socialization and cultural melding with the settler population.

As predominantly mentioned in Berlin's book, *Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America* the question of language has many factors. The most prominent of these factors is how many captured Africans spoke your same language. This would effect the actual sales pool upon reaching the Colonies. 

Beyond that, the geographic region in which you arrive, in which in time you arrive, further has a huge effect on your cultural integration. Urban slaves generally had more autonomy, and were required to socialize faster because they were usually in extremely small numbers in close quarters with settlers. 

Rural farmers could still have 1 - 10 slaves, from many diverse regions, forcing them to learn a common language (usually English). Large planters, largely in the southern states that had a year-round climate for agriculture, could have anywhere from 10 - 200 slaves (even in the Early Colonial years) and they would be less likely to develop any kind of propensity for English in the first generation. 

In other areas of the Caribbean, the native language of the slave-holding class was much less adopted because in places like Brazil, Haiti, etc. slaves were imported in such mass numbers, and less care was given to their survival. Generally speaking these areas has a much larger population of native Africans at any times. This differs from British Colonial North America in that the class of ""African Americans"" rose much sooner out of the imported population.

For more information read Ira Berlin's book. He goes into **much** more detail based on Geographic region, type of work, type of crops grown, as well as the politics of the time. It's a beautiful mix of social, political, and economic history that transcends national boundaries to give you an exhaustively thorough look into what slavery was like everywhere in British Colonial North America.

RamblinRambo,"I'd like to answer this from a personal experience point of view. Sure enough the world has changed and there are a lot of new resources out there but the main principle of learning by doing hasn't changed. I've moved countries a few times and I've never learned a language through class. I've learned it by listening, pointing, asking and picking up words as you go. And I know a good few others that have done the same.

It is important to note that for some people it takes longer and for some it takes less time. Some are just simply much more talented in picking up and understanding new languages. Exactly like some people are more skilled in maths than others, some are more skilled in athletics and so on.

If you try and are completely surrounded by a new foreign language I'd say it takes on average 1 year to learn an acceptable level to be able to speak and converse. If the language is close to another language you already know then it might take less than six months. But if we analyse it from the perspective of being completely different it takes at least a year. Once you get the basics you'll learn faster.

One universal thing I've noticed is that people understand each other very well through basic sign language. It is actually amazing.

My grandfather moved as a 16 year old boy with his brother to a country where they did not know a single word. It was back in the day when english wasn't a common denominator as it is in much of the world today. I remember a story from him on how he agreed to rent an apartment, pay rent, found a job etc. with just basic sign language.

And I'd argue that nothing has changed since early history to today if you take away classes and education. If you set out to learn a language by doing you'll go through the exact same process. I've done this myself.

Only thing we need to think of when it comes to slaves is their ability or freedom to communicate with others that spoke english. If they were heavily tied to one owner and their farm then it might have taken 3-4 years instead of one. It all ties in with exposure to the language. So I'd expect heavy correlation with exposure to the language and it will have been case specific. Also, if there were a lot of slaves that spoke a common language it might mean that some of them never learned the new language.

You may have seen him perched on some dead Tree near the River, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the Labour of the Fishing Hawk; and when that diligent Bird has at length taken a Fish, and is bearing it to his Nest for the Support of his Mate and young Ones, the Bald Eagle pursues him and takes it from him.

&gt;With all this injustice, he is never in good case but like those among men who live by sharping &amp; robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy. Besides he is a rank coward: The little King Bird not bigger than a Sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district. He is therefore by no means a proper emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America who have driven all the King birds from our country…

In all my research, I've never come across this notorious turkey vs. eagle vote. What actually seems to have happened is that, in June 1782, Congress asked  Charles Thomson, the Secretary of the Continental Congress for eight years, to design the Great Seal of the United States. He took advice from the committees within Congress and first described the seal as such:

* On a field       Chevrons composed of seven pieces on one side &amp; six on the other, joined together at the top in such wise that each of the six bears against or is supported by &amp; supports two of the opposite side the pieces of the chevrons on each side alternate red &amp; white. The shield born on the breast of an American Eagle on the wing &amp; rising proper. In the dexter talon of the Eagle an Olive branch &amp; in the sinister a bundle of Arrows. Over the head of the Eagle a Constellation of Stars surrounded with bright rays and at a little distance clouds. Motto In the bill of the Eagle a scroll with these words E pluribus unum. 
* (Source: You can find this many places, but one of them is [The History of the Seal of the United States from 1909](http://books.google.com/books?id=jUZmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=On+a+field+Chevrons+composed+of+seven+pieces+on+one+side+%26+six+on+the+other,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C87yE2byri&amp;sig=A97cKqiIxYwQfXE3bD80h2T2PwI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4NKYUrjCBceEoQTop4HADw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=On%20a%20field%20Chevrons%20composed%20of%20seven%20pieces%20on%20one%20side%20%26%20six%20on%20the%20other%2C&amp;f=false).)

The important parts for this question are the repeated use of ""eagle."" By 1782, Americans had already established the importance of the eagle to the colonies. The Magazine of American History suggests that as early as 1779 that John Adams had chosen the eagle to be America's emblem. 

* In the autumn of 1779, John Adams was sent to England to negotiate for peace. Among the eminent people whom he met was Sir John Prestwick, a baronet of the north of England, a friend of the Americans... In a discussion of the subject of the national coat of arms so long awaiting decision, Sir John suggested an escutcheon bearing thirteen perpendicular stripes, repeating the idea of the national banner. He proposed, according to the narrative cited, that in order to give it consequence it should be placed on the breast of the displayed American eagle without supporters, as emblematic of self-reliance.

While there are any number of reasons why the colonies chose the eagle, all in all, it may come down to a positive association with the bird and other already existing emblems. After all, the eagle was commonly used in Europe as a symbol in coat of arms at the time. Also - when the Society of Cincinnati formed in 1783, the eagle became its most popular symbol. According to the Society's museum website:

* Designed by Pierre L'Enfant, the first Eagles were made in Paris in 1784 by Duval and Francastel [and sent to America for the Society.]
* The museum collections include more than thirty-five examples, foremost among them the Diamond Eagle, which French naval officers commissioned for George Washington in 1784 and became the badge of office of the Society's president general. 
* (Source: [The Society of Cincinnati Archives and Museum](http://societyofthecincinnati.org/collections/museum_collections/sotc).)

It's not surprising that as soon as the eagle came into the imagery of the United States of America that it was often repeated and with great respect. The new nation was being forged out of disparate peoples and needed such symbols to reinforce their separation from England as well as unify the colonies into states.

tl;dr - *The showdown choice between turkey and eagle did not happen. Instead, the eagle appears to have emerged as the frontrunner for several great emblems before being chosen in the Great Seal and thus America. In the 1780s, the eagle was on the mind of many Americans... except Benjamin Franklin, who called it a scavenging lazy coward.*",null,10,cdpnodj,1rplq1,askhistorians,top_week,83

Thompson), but the quoted text provided by the OP clearly hints at a first-person account which rules out Edward John Thompson. Thompson Senior did, of course, have an intimate connection with Indian history and historiography having attempted the ""first and sensational bid at something like an inversion of established British Indian historiography"" with the publication of his *The Other Side of the Medal* (which looks at the War of 1857) in October 1925.

Perhaps the quote provided is an out-of-context account by British Military surgeon and historian [Arthur Saunders Thomson](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t95/thomson-arthur-saunders) who did have a spell in India in the 1840s. But even that, to be honest, seems unlikely as Thomson was dead by 1860.

Danny_Gray,"The names of the months September, October, November and December come from the Roman calendar or the calendar of Romulus.

This calendar consisted of 10 months named:

Martius (31 days)
 
Aprilis (30 days) 

Maius (31 days) 

Iunius (30 days) 

Quintilis (31 days) 

Sextilis (30 days) 

September (30 days) 

October (31 days) 

November (30 days) 

December (30 days)

You may notice more Latin number prefixes Quint and Sex (5 and 6 respectively.

So what happened to this calendar? Well first of all, it wasn't very good. There were 51 days between December and Martius which weren't assigned to any month. 

This calendar was first reformed by Numa Pompilius in around 713BC, the second of the seven traditional kings of Rome. He tinkered with the calendar somewhat. Because Romans considered odd numbers lucky, he removed a day from each month with 30 leaving 57 winter days unassigned. 

And so he created two new months Ianuarius and 
Februarius which pushed the numbered months back by 2, making their prefixes wrong. The calendar then looked like this

Ianuarius (29) 

Februarius (28)
 
Martius (31)

Aprilis (29)

Maius (31)

Iunius (29) 

Quintilis (31) 

Sextilis (29) 

September (29)  

October (31) 

November (29) 

December (29) 

This year was 355 days long and roughly coincided with the solar year however an extra month had to be added occasionally to correct for the solar year actually being 365.25 days long. This month was called  Mensis Intercalaris  and was placed in the middle of Februarius.

We're getting towards the modern calendar but we still aren't there. Next came along the Julian reform by our favourite roman Julius Caesar. He started the reform in 48BC and it was finished by his successor Augustus.

The Julian reform was a bit complicated at first, changing lengths of years so the calendar year would correlate with a solar year and renaming Quintilis and Sextilis to Iulius and Augustus after Julius and Augustus Caesar. 

This calendar was used until 1582AD when it was changed again in the Gregorian reform so that Easter would stop drifting through the year and that's the calendar widely used in the western world today.

agentdcf,"There were no state regulations regarding labor, as far as I know. However, the trade would probably have been regulated by guild structures in cities or towns of any size. Medieval London had Livery Companies for carpenters, joiners (different from carpenters because they used adhesives and not nails), bricklayers and tylers, and plumbers, among others. These guilds would have controlled things like apprenticeships and mastery, as well as prices and wages. 

I don't know anything specifically about the building trades, but I have studied the baking trade a bit, and I think we can extrapolate from one to the other. For vital elements of the urban economy, guild structures and what regulatory legislation existed served to either remove a trade from market forces entirely, or at the very least highly circumscribe its operation. Prices and wages were so arranged as to ensure a ""just price,"" preventing collusion and manipulation of the market by merchants and tradespeople while providing acceptable wages to workers. With set wages and prices, what frequently happened was that craftspeople competed in quality; whoever could build the best house or bake the best bread would have more custom and do better. I suspect, from my fairly cursory reading of medieval urban history, that being a tradesmen was not a bad gig, as things go. If you could get into a guild, you were going to do alright, as long as you were reasonably competent. If you were a casual laborer, things were going to be rough.

Guild structures also regulated quality and conduct, often with their own private courts, empowered to fine guild members and punish them publicly. For bakers, this meant ensuring the proper weight and purity of products. For builders, I would guess that quality meant ensuring stability of construction and soundness of materials. Bakers all had their own personal stamps which marked the loaves, so that any loaf's baker could be identified if some violation was found; I would guess that similar measures existed for builders, so that if a building collapsed without cause, the builder would bear at least some responsibility.

In the timeframe you're looking at there wasn't anything resembling a unifying practice. Liturgies were local, and though there are some who argue for a unifying ""shape"" of Catholic liturgy being apparent, the wording of the liturgies wasn't uniform, and it wouldn't be for quite some time. It's likely that the Arian liturgy kept a similar ""shape"" but we don't have any extant liturgies to say for sure. 

As far as monasticism goes, the idea of ordered monks didn't really exist yet, and ""cloisters"" were mostly just associations of hermits who lived in community. Nothing like the Benedictines or Augustinians. The Franciscans sort of follow this model... But I'm digressing. 

Arian monasticism was very decentralized and existed primarily in the Arabian peninsula and in Syriac speaking eastern kingdoms where it would survive (marginally) until the rise of Islam. It was a very hermetic kind of asceticism, and didn't lend itself to putting down roots and putting up buildings.
(This is from my early-monasticism professor who focused on Syriac monasticism. I can't really speak to how it worked for the Germanic tribes.) 

So they very well may have had an entirely
different liturgy, but seeing as how liturgies were especially suppressed (see how long Donatist parishes lasted after Constantine came down on them...) we don't have any details of what they included.

backgrinder,"Each unit in the US Army has an offcial TO&amp;E, or Table of Organization and Equipment established by the Army. This determines everything assigned to the unit, from men to equipment to vehicles, and breaks everything down. A division TO&amp;E will call for a certain number of battalions, each battalion has companies, each company has platoons, etc.. Depending on the tasks assigned to the division the battalions will be set up differently. An armor heavy division will have a different grouping than an Infantry division, which will have a different grouping than a support unit. 

 The TO&amp;E will call for an infantry company to have a specific number of privates, plus a specific number of sergeants and officers (and will specify specific ranks for specific jobs, when someone is promoted they automatically shift to a new job with different responsibilities). 

 The TO&amp;E will also call for a specific mix of weapons. In a WW2 infantry platoon the standard weapon is a semi automatic rifle. Each company will be assigned a set number of light and heavy machine guns, used to set up defensive positions, and crews will be assigned to carry them, tripods, ammo and either serve them with ammo during battle or protect the gunner from enemies sneaking in close enough to take out the  weapon. Large crew served weapons are generally company weapons that can be assigned to a certain platoon by need, lighter (.30 cal) machine guns are platoon weapons. Then there are the in between type weapons, like Thompson submachine guns and BAR's, and specialty weapons like bazookas. 

 Tommy guns and BAR's (Browning Automatic Rifle) are squad type weapons. A company is divided into platoons, run by Lieutenants, and platoons are broken into squads, led by non-coms. During combat the squads were often separated, each performing a different task, particularly in the US Army where the standard infantry doctrine developed by George Marshall before the war called for a unit to be divided, with one group firing directly on a target from cover while the other group attempts to flank it. A simple, easy to learn and effective maneuver, but the forces are divided so platoon weapons are only available to one group at a time. 

 A group separated from the rest of the platoon will need enough punch to hit the enemy, and may need to defend themselves from counterattack. That's where squad weapons like the BAR and Tommy gun come in. A Tommy gun is a close in weapon. It is actually a machine pistol, not an automatic rifle. It shoots a snub nosed .45 bullet that won't stay straight in midair, and it tends to buck a lot and be hard to keep pointed on target. It's great for spraying a lot of bullets in a general direction quickly while making a huge calamitous racket though. It also has a lot of stopping power. Because of this it's great for clearing buildings and fortifications. It's also good for defending against sudden attack. Bullets go everywhere, bad guys all duck, and your squad gets a couple of precious seconds to assess the new situation and deal with it. 

 The BAR is an offensive and defensive weapon. It's a big, heavy bitch to tote around, but it can be handled by one man and fired while standing and moving. It shoots a .30-06 rifle cartridge (like the crew served Browning Machine Gun), so it's more accurate than a Tommy gun, and you can attach a small bipod stand to it and fire it from a prone position. 

 Now, outside of the basics, with crew served weapons being company weapons, and hand held machine guns being owned by the platoon and assigned to individual squads, is the question of who was selected to use each weapon and why. Generally during training the biggest, strongest, toughest most aggressive guys were assigned the squad weapons. The most obvious reason is these weapons and their extra ammo are pretty heavy, and big men make better mules. Also, the more aggressive guys would be more likely to actually use them. A lot of people aren't aware but not everyone pulls the trigger in combat. Some are scared and break, some just freeze, some can't bear to kill and avoid firing at another human being. After a unit had been blooded the officers and noncoms figured out who the shooters were, and reassigned weapons based on need. After a unit had been in combat longer you had vets absorbing in new replacements, and vets would get first choice of weapons as well. Sometimes after a few engagements that big heavy bitch that was such a beast to lug around and made so much noise and attracted so much attention was a lot more attractive. Combat soldiers have a fine appreciation of the value of getting lots of ordinance on target fast, and soon realize that big noisy attention getter usually causes the bad guys to duck and cover once it has their attention instead of shooting back at you, a nice fringe benefit.

Basically, it's reasonably accurate but not perfect. Jennings does a good job covering the major aspects of Aztec culture and gives the reader a good 'feel' for what life would have been like, but many of the details are wrong. A few notable errors he makes:

1. The Aztec writing system was less flexible than Jennings makes it out to be. It could only record a few kinds of information. History? Yes. Financial records? yes. Personal correspondence? probably not.

2. The main character is way more liberal with sex than the Aztecs would have been comfortable with. 

3. The way he depicts the Tarascans ('Michoacan') is pretty much entirely wrong. Smith doesn't talk about it, but it did bother me.

4. A few of the violent details surrounding human sacrifice and the conquest have been exaggerated for dramatic effect. Human sacrifice was brutal, and so was the conquest. But Jennings kind of goes out of his way to make it gut-wrenchingly awful. For example, he describes the priests raping a sacrifice to Xipe Totec, and he describes the conquistadors feeding Indians to their dogs at Cempoala. Neither of those things happened - he added them to make it more dramatic.

When Waffen SS divisions failed to perform satisfactorily near Vienna in April 1945, Adolf Hitler ordered the units involved to remove their cuff titles as a punishment. SS-Oberstgruppenführer Sepp Dietrich was enraged, and reportedly sent his own back to Berlin in a night vase (chamber pot).

Soldiers in training were usually presented the cuff title only on completion of that training, and the award of the title was seen as a rite of passage. This rite is described in the controversial book The Forgotten Soldier.

Georgy_K_Zhukov,"France had a large army at the time, and on paper, it was possibly the best in Europe. They had the numbers and the equipment. The problem was that they didn't see the direction warfare was going. The generals were still stuck in a mentality gained in World War I. *Not*, however, the idea of static warfare, which people seem to think due to the Maginot Line, but rather the tactics of the end phase of the war, during the Hundred Days offensive.

As such, the French invested in lots of infantry tanks. Big, slow, heavy tanks that were to be distributed throughout the infantry to move with them and supply support. While they did have some quality tanks, like the SOMUA 35, they just didn't have enough of them. And even if they had more, without a serious reevaluation of their deployment, the effectiveness would be questionable at best. Most French tanks even lacked radios!

They invested in a LOT of artillery. Because they believed that it was the key to victory. But they didn't foresee the pace that World War II would be fought at. Their guns simply couldn't be wielded effectively as the battlefield changed, and also, since they lacked *mobile* artillery, they couldn't move the guns quickly enough. Many of them were of World War I vintage.

Strategically, the French were also lacking. While it is not true that the French believed the Maginot Line was going to keep them safe, and in fact the purpose of it was to force the Germans to attack to the north of the line, the French did make a grave miscalculation in where they expected the German thrust to come. Expecting a similar path as that taken during World War I, the Anglo-French force was positioned in the north-east of France, waiting for the Germans to enter the Low Countries. When they did, they moved in to Belgium swiftly to counter the Germans. But the main German attack was further south, through the Ardennes, which the French planners had assumed was to rugged for the Germans to move through quickly, and consequently, had not defended very well. This wasn't the case though. The Germans swept through, and in just over a week the Anglo-French force that had been positioned on the border - the cream of the crop - was cut off from the rest of France. The British began evacuating, and France soon had no choice but to capitulate.

And thats it in a nutshell. France had quantity, but not quality. They were well prepared for another war fought in the style of October, 1918. But what works there didn't work all that well in 1940.",null,0,cdpp6q0,1rpulu,askhistorians,top_week,11

idjet,"I think you are perhaps getting hung up on labels and definitions, and we should clarify these so that you can understand.

'*Capitalism*' is very strictly defined as an economic system in terms of how economic value is created and stored, profit is a byproduct of that. Capitalism is generally viewed as having its origins in the late medieval period when we begin to see the creation of broad markets for labour and goods through the transformation of serfdom and bartering economy to monetary economy.

It's true that there has always been something for sale, whether armour, houses and castles. However, if we look closely at what was for sale in the European medieval period, we would see the list of things bought and sold is short and very infrequently transacted. The greater portion of the economy was what we would roughly call *bartering* - this was at the rural and village level. In fact even 'taxes' were paid 'in kind', often as part of the harvest. Remember that medieval society was predominantly agricultural. Yes, someone with money could by anything - but money was relatively rare. For example there were whole regions of Southern France in year 1000 where there were no mints creating coin - ie, money. (note: bartering is used loosely here to allow a short response - some will complain).

As such, from a modern financial perspective, the financial transactions were 'stunted', they have no accumulating value. To explain: as a farmer, or as the noble who en-serfed the farmer, I could not store my wheat for several years waiting for an increase in the value of the commodity and trade it for charcoal or building limestone a year later - I had to trade it within its life or it goes mouldy. I could not speculate in value and make a profit on the difference between my production costs and my sale value when wheat supplies were low. Or, as an blacksmith I would be working directly in the castle of the lord for whom I work, but I am not paid in cash. I am fed, clothed, I have a small home or just a room in the compound. As a blacksmith I might also do some metal work for the local farmers, because they are tending the lands owned by the noble I work for. But I am not paid and neither are they. There were large towns where money might be used, but the overwhelmingly rural medieval population did not engage economically with cities in substantive cash.

So how did this economy change to capitalism?

The general idea held in economics is that the transition from feudal economics to capitalism was through the transformation of [manorial serfdom to free holding tenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism#Prehistory_of_capitalism). This is a point of argument for some, and you may see responses to this post which argue differently. But, the point is still important: this was the moment where the medieval serf-farmer no longer paid *in kind* with his crops, but he rented his land from landlord for cash and he could sell his crops at market for cash. The landlord could evict him from the land for a higher paying tenant, and the farmer could sell his crops for more to those who were willing to pay. The farmer could invest in his farm so that it was more productive. The landlord could take the cash and invest it where he likes, perhaps in speculating in other lands, or in other assets. It's labour and assets that begin to have value, not the crops themselves.

And this is where we begin to see the fundamentals of capitalism: in large scale lending, in speculation, in transforming serfdom and bartering into labour-for-wage relationships. These things did not exist at large scale until after the medieval period. 

None of this happened fast - there were many places in Europe that remained unaffected by early capitalism for several hundred years. And there were transformations in forms of capitalism such as [mercantilism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_capitalism) before we get to modern capitalism as we know it.

The essence is that economic relationships transformed into an exchange of capital, and capital is abstractly related to 'actual value'. And this completely overtook all other economic relationships from 1400 - 1800.

Canadian_Ambassador,"I just wrote an undergrad paper about the history of interest/usury and can maybe help shed some light on this. 

In Ancient Greece, Aristotle was against any form of interest. Interest is the cost of borrowing money. His reasoning was that because money had no value in itself and was a medium of exchange between two commodities, it should not be hoarded. Money by itself was not considered wealth. It was the physical goods bought that dictated how wealthy a person was. This viewpoint has been debated though as being idealistic, and not how life actually operated in ancient Greece. 

Aquinas follows in similar tradition with Aristotle, except adds the Christian charity idea to the mix. Due to the nature of money, hoarding it is bad and unnatural. You cannot have a capitalist society without leftover money to fund and invest. This was backed up by the Catholic Church. Again, this viewpoint was challenged by specific people, but the Catholic Church stood by it's stance. 

Big changes didn't start to occur until the Reformation. Both Luther, after some prodding, and Calvin, after no prodding, both accepted that interest was an acceptable risk that the lender takes over the borrower. 

Prior to the Reformation, interest was an unnatural way to create wealth by the scholastics and the Catholic Church. Now, that is for loan payments. Venture Capitalism was not frowned upon and was one of the ways that people who were looking for investment circumvented the sin of usury. 

The Romans did have some forms, but usury has always been condemned under the Old testament. I did actually ask a question related to this, but it has also yet to be answered. 

I am not a historian by any means, but I am taking a class on the History of Classical Economics. Basically, the economics of the world until Marx. The reason I don't address Rome and Roman influences is because from what I found the majority of their contributions were in law, not economics, and therefore, out of the scope of my paper. 

To answer the question though, if I was being bold and banking (ha) on the history of venture capital, probably the 13th century is when you could find the beginnings of modern capitalism. That is mostly me talking out of my ass. 

From what I read in regarding interest, I would put the timeframe at, or during, the Reformation. The backlash that the ban on usury caused the Church to lighten it's stance in the 18th century, but the Protestants had been okay with it, officially, for 200 years prior. 

The important thing to remember is that capitalism requires surplus money to invest. If you put restrictions in place stopping the borrowing process, it makes it significantly tougher to engage in capitalist procedure. 

Hope that makes sense. I am a couple beers in because I am finally done essays and slightly celebrating. Sources will be provided upon request. ",null,2,cdpqycx,1rpw94,askhistorians,top_week,4

Reedstilt,"At the time of Old World Contact, there were three major polities in Florida and several smaller ones. 

**Calusa**

The southern half of Florida was under the control of the powerful and expansive Calusa. The core Calusa region was center on Charlotte Harbor in southwest Florida, with their eponymous capital Calos currently identified as the [Mound Key site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound_Key_Archeological_State_Park), but their influence spread eastward to encompass the Mayaimi who lived around Lake Okeechobee, the Tequesta of the Keys and modern-day Miami, and the Jaega near modern-day Palm Beach. The Ais, who lived on the east coast from Cape Canaveral southward to the Jaega (who may have been part of the Ais as well) were either subjects or allies of the Calusa - the relationship is a bit unclear. Additionally, Taino refugees from Cuba (and likely from elsewhere in the Caribbean since earlier refugees had fled to Cuba first) had established communities in southern Florida under the protection of the Calusa dominion, before the Spanish arrived on the mainland. Until the Spanish negotiated a peace in 1567, the Calusa were at war with Tocobaga who lived around Tampa Bay.

The Calusa were led by three men. First was the paramount chief, called the 'cacique' by the Spanish after the Taino title for a similar political position. The Calusa word for this rank is probably *certepe*, but that's uncertain as it could refer to village chiefs as well. The paramount chief received tribute from Calusa village chiefs and from the leaders of his non-Calusa subjects. He also had several wives, one each from his non-Calusa subjects for example as well as having a ""sister-wife"" according to Spanish chroniclers, which probably meant he had one wife from his own clan, rather than literally marrying his own sister.

The other two men were the war captain who command the Calusa's military specialists and militia on behalf of the paramount chief and the chief priest who oversaw the temples, organized important rituals, and attended to the religious needs of the paramount chief's family (which he was usually part of). 

The Calusa built canals, earthworks to keep their homes above the water during floods, and large communal houses and temples. The ""king's house"" in Calos was said to be large enough that 2,000 people could comfortably gather there for councils. 

What makes the size and structure of Calusa society especially interesting is that they made no use of domesticated plants or animals, though there ancestors a few centuries earlier probably engaged in some farming. The bulk of their diet was composed of seafood, though some wild plants were gathered and they made a type of bread from [coontie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coontie), a cycad native to the Southeast. Deer were relatively rare in the region and Calusa traded their seafood with people to the north for venison and deer hides. In 1600, the Spanish reported that the Calusa (or their Tequesta subjects)  travelling to Havana to sell fish, ambergris, fruits, turtle shells, [cardinals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(bird\)), and other items. Such trade likely existed in Pre-Columbian times between south Florida and Caribbean as well.

**Timucua**

Most of northern Florida (minus the panhandle) and a large portion of southern Georgia was the realm of the Timucua. Unlike the Calusa, the Timucua were not unified into a single cohesive nation. Instead they had several powerful village and alliances of villages, which at the time of Contact were vying among themselves for dominance. 

Each village had its own chief, called *holata* or *utina* in various Timucua areas. For simplicity, I'll use *holata* here. The title of *holata* was inherited matrilineally within the White Deer Clan. Clans were ranked, and while the White Deer was at the top among the Timucua, the relative ranking of the other clans (Panther, Bear, Fish, Earth, Buzzard and Quail) differed between the Timucuan districts. 

The *holata* had several prominent subordinates. The *inija* was the most important of these, who severed as the *holata*'s spokespeson and communicated the *holata*'s orders to others and gather information for the *holata*. The *inija* was also chosen from the White Deer Clan. The *holata* was also served by two ranked *anacotimas* and the *afetema*, who seem to have been advisers chosen from the elders of the village. Women became *holata* regularly, and when they did so, their subordinates were also women. The *holata* oversaw both the secular and religious affairs of the Timucua; war, however, fell to the *irriparacusi*, the war chief (also known as the *uriutina* and possibly just *paracusi*). The *irriparacusi* had his own entourage of officials: *ibitano*, *toponole*, *bichara*, *amalachini*, and *itorimitono*, though their duties are unfortunately unknown. The *irriparacusi* likely inherited their rank as the *holata* did, but that's not certain.

Like the Calusa, the Timucua fished and harvested wild plants. But they also hunted and cultivated maize and other domesticated plants--though not to the extent of their Mississippian neighbors to the north and west. Famously, the Timucua wore [deer disguises](http://media-3.web.britannica.com/eb-media/13/70213-004-110FA638.jpg) when hunting. Unlike the Calusa, however, they were quick to adopt Spanish agricultural tools and plants.

The surplus of their hunts were trade south to the Calusa, but the most important trade routes went north and west to the Mississippians. These trade routes brought down copper, greenstone, and argillite from the mountains. The Timucua also controlled an important chert outcropping in northern Florida which was vital for the production of tools and weapons. Chief Utina and his alliance largely controlled this outcropping and the most important trade routes, which made him an enemy of other major Timucuan alliances. In the 1600s, the Timucua would become important middle-men, controlling the trade between St. Augustine and the nations of the interior.

**Apalachee**

The Apalachee were a small but powerful Mississippian chiefdom located between the Ochlockonee and Aucilla Rivers. The Timucuan-speaking Asile who lived east of the Aucilla River were subjects of the Apalachee. The Apalachee had two major towns. Ivitachuco was the dominant town in the east, while Anhayca (modern-day Tallahassee) dominated the west and served as the capital of the whole chiefdom. Historically the two towns were ruled by brothers. Later in the 1600s, political power would shift to Ivitachuco, at which time the Apalachee were at war with the Timucua (again the Spanish negotiate a peace treaty between the two).

*Nico* seems to be their word for paramount chief.  Interestingly *holata* refers to subsidiary chiefs.  The Apalachee *holatas* oversaw major towns which controlled districts and satellite towns within the larger chiefdom. The *nico* and the *holatas* were the spokespeople for their respective dominions and oversaw ceremonies within them. The Apalachee *nico* was also served by an *inija*, though his role here was to oversee the *nico's* guards, farmland, and to serve as a sort of court historian, as well as handling trivial day-to-day business of the chiefdom. The *holatas* seem to have had *inija* of their own, and the *inija* were apparently relatives of the *holatas*. Finally, the *nico* had an *atequi*, a translator whose duties extended over other areas where such language skills were important.

The land of Apalachee was an important stop on the trade routes heading west out of the Timucua regions to the Mississippians, and was famous throughout Florida for its agricultural productivity. That fame was used as bait by other Florida peoples to lure the de Soto's expedition out of their area and encourage them to keep moving onto Anhayca, where de Soto's expedition spent its first winter, living maize, beans, squash, and other plants cultivated or harvested in the region, as well its ample stores of dried venison. They grew three types of maize for different purposes: a small fast-growing maize used to quickly replenish their granaries in spring, a yellow maize used for hominy, and a white maize used for flour. They also made flour from a root known as *ache* which the Spanish said was indistinguishable from flour made from wheat in both versatility and taste. Both *ache* root and the flour made from it were important exports from the area.

Early communists believed that communism was the natural and [inevitable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) next phase of society and economics. (Some not obviously insane people continued to think that into the 1980s.) And capitalism wasn't necessarily looking too great for many people around the time of the Russian Revolution.

An authoritarian sub-phase (the ""[dictatorship of the proletariat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat)"") which would precede communist utopia had been predicted by Marx. The people who managed to get the job of, er, identifying and implementing the interests of the proletariat didn't turn out to mind too much that that authoritarian sub-phase didn't seem to be coming to an early end.

The Russians beat the Tartars with an army of 70k to 120k. Timur also had a huge army. Some modern accounts the Persian's army that lost at Thermopylae in the 70k-300k range as well (including war elephants and other stuff). Hannibal's journey to Italy started with around 100k man (he left 20k-30k in Spain as garrison tho). Supposedly the Arabs had around 110k soldiers in the siege of Constantinople in the 700's. Actually many Arab-Byzantine wars included armies in the high 100's thousands for each side according to some histories. 

So yeah, it's plausible and it's logistically possible. While not many technological improvements were made in those ages, if Xerxes, the 700's Arabs and Hannibal were able to move those kind of troops one can assume Barbarossa probably fielded something around those numbers, maybe less.

gingerkid1234,"&gt;Did Jewish people not charge interest when loaning other Jewish people money? Was interest condemned as usury? Or could Jewish people loan to non Jewish people at interest?

The answer to all those questions is ""kind of"".  Judaism prohibits lending to other Jews at interest.  It's a biblical prohibition.  However, there are several caveats, which I'll explain at the end, since they're a bit complex.

Anyway, it wasn't exactly ""condemned as usury"".  Usury just isn't a term that's part of Jewish legal thought.  There are simply sorts of loans which are prohibited by religious law--whether something is or isn't usury is irrelevant, since for Judaism it's not a meaningful category.

Judaism does permit loaning non-Jews money at interest.  The wording of the biblical prohibition explicitly doesn't include outsiders in the ban.  There are some Rabbinic cautions on doing so, since it's not so far from a prohibited thing, but it's definitely permitted.

&gt;Also, how did this affect relations between Jewish people and Catholics? The Catholic Church condemned the charging of interest, so would they have tried to stop Jewish people from charging interest?

The Catholic church itself didn't try to stop it.  Jews were seen as outside the religious prohibitions on the Catholic church, so as long as Jews followed any local secular laws, the church didn't actually ban it, even if they did attempt to discourage it.  However, this doesn't mean that relations were always good as a consequence.  It wasn't uncommon for wealthy debtors to stir up resentment at Jews, so they'd be run out of town and/or expelled by the government.  This would make the loans practically unenforceable.  It also could cause resentment--Jews were outsiders to society, who could hold a significant amount of financial power over someone.  This contributed to Jewish stereotypes for centuries.

However, it could also help Jews be welcomed in places.  Sometimes the importance of access to capital was acknowledged, and having Jews around was seen as a way to improve the economy.  This is significant reason why King Casimir of Poland admitted a large number of Jews during the Crusades, which is essentially the reason a large Jewish population existed in Eastern Europe.

[This article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans_and_interest_in_Judaism) 

Anyway, back to

&gt;Did Jewish people not charge interest when loaning other Jewish people money?

There are several exceptions to the general prohibition.  These include:

1. Loans between partnerships are generally except from biblical restrictions on loans, since the wording usually is specific that the rules are for one person lending to one other person.  This is especially important for avoiding problems with loans of all sorts during the Sabbatical year, when all loans are void.
* Loans can use some sort of legal fiction to have the same output as charging interest without actually breaking rules.
* These were generally not strenuously objected to by Judaism because the biblical prohibitions seem to be speaking about short-term loans to the poor, to support themselves.  So lending at interest in one of these permitted ways wouldn't violate the spirit of the law, so long as the letter of it was upheld (things that violate the spirit of laws are often prohibited Rabbinically).  The ability of poor people to have access to money so they don't starve is a concern in several biblical laws.  The one that comes to mind is the requirement to pay hired labor on the same day that they work, so they don't have to wait to get the money required to support themselves.

However, that doesn't mean interest-free lending didn't happen.  An important part of Jewish society historically was the ""Gemach"", short for ""gimilut chasadim"", meaning ""acts of kindness"".  These lend money to people for various purposes, without interest.  They are a legal loan that is enforceable (and generally has co-signers), it's just interest free.  This means that the loan pool can continue, though donations are required to keep it up with inflation.  In the US, these are usually called ""Hebrew Free Loan Societies"".",null,0,cdpr14l,1rq26b,askhistorians,top_week,9

There are obviously early examples besides slavery, but it really gained steam as a reaction against the federal government's use of the commerce clause to expand its power during the progressive era.

Issues that traditionally would have been state-level issues became legislated under federal law through the commerce clause, and that's what gave a new head of steam to the state's rights movement.  This shift in power away from the states really came in as a result of the progressive movement in the early 1900s, but it was as much a consequence of advancing communication technology as it was a consequence of the politics of the time.

Sovereign immunity was THE big prize. It ensured that states could retain a sense of well... Sovereignty. Individualism. Self-Rule. Keeping foreigners from mucking about in our affairs was one of the big ticket items we revolted to protect. And although the states were more or less united in this, they were still fiercely independent. 

In 1793, Chisolm, the executor of the estate of Farquar sued the state of Georgia for debts incurred during the Revolutionary War. The case was brought under Article III section 2 of the US Constitution which granted federal courts jurisdiction over disputes between a state and the citizens of another state. Georgia, disagreeing with this provision and given the Supreme Court's lack of prestige during this time period didn't even show up to the oral argument. Naturally, the Court sided with the plaintiff. 

Outrage ensued amongst the several States and shortly thereafter the 11th amendment was ratified in 1795, which served to reverse the Court's decision in Chisolm v GA. The 11th isn't absolute, but it is definitely a major victory for states. ",null,0,cdq2pd2,1rq7q0,askhistorians,top_week,1

bemonk,"A few reasons:

* In 1the 19th Century there was an ""Austroslavic"" movement to protect Slavic interests against Austrian (German) interests. Both Slovaks and Czechs (and some Yugoslavs) were in this movement together.
* At the outbreak of WWI It wasn't just Masaryk (Czech) but Slovaks like Rastislav Štefánik that were pushing for independence of a unified Czechoslovakia.
*  Czechs had a huge industrial base, while Slovaks were much more rural and agrarian. I think Slovaks realized they would be better off with the much wealthier Czechs. Also Czechs had been independent 300 years before. For Slovaks it was more like 1000 years. Slovakia just didn't have as strong of a claim for independence than they did together as Czechoslovakia.
* In the Treaty of Saint-Germain (sort of like the Versailles treaty, but for Austria-Hungary instead of Germany) when Hungary was given independence and the real union with Austria terminated. This treaty also had a certain philosophy about it to end majority rule in the former Empire. The way they did this was to break up the borders among ethnic lines. It wasn't perfect, but Polish parts were given back to Poland. German speaking parts of Hungary were added to Austria, Bukovina went to Romania, so on and so on... and Czechoslovakia became independent.
Austrians and Hungarians both had been pretty harsh at times to minorities in their countries. The Allies saw this as a way to reduce the likelihood of further ethnic strife in the region. It was also (I would argue at least) punitive to Hungary.
* The majority of Slovaks themselves wanted this. The Slovak people also were far less supportive of the idea of independence in 1993 than the government was.

TL;DR Slovakia was extremely rural, while Czech had a large industrial base. Slovakia hadn't been independent for a millennium. Hungary reduced to 50% of it's formal size on all sides (not just Slovakia) by the treaty after WWI",null,7,cdpylun,1rqafy,askhistorians,top_week,18

When the Portuguese arrived in the Indian Ocean, they found the Ottomans trying to conquer the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia, and aided the Ethiopians in restoring their kingdom.

The expansionist and colonizing period for the Ottomans began to reverse, however, after the failure of the second siege of Vienna in 1683.  They began to be pushed back by the Hapsburgs, and then the Russians.  They began to lose control of their North African colonies and withdraw from the Horn of Africa.

mormengil,"Acadia had been French until 1710 when it was conquered by Britain during Queen Anne's war.  The British were worried about the loyalty of the Acadians in subsequent wars, and finally expelled them from Acadia in 1755, when circa 7,000 Acadians were deported.  After this, there was little remaining French population or heritage in Acadia.

Many of the people who replaced the departed Acadians were from New England, and some of this population formed a sizable minority in favor of Independence from Britain during the American Revolution.  They tried and failed to take Fort Cumberland and move some or all of the Nova Scotia colony into the Revolutionary camp.

By the war of 1812, however, the demographics of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had changed.  20,000 British Empire loyalists fled the US during and after the Revolution to settle in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  This made the overwhelming majority of the population Loyalist, with no interest in joining the Americans in the War of 1812.

The other thing was that Britain had ingratiated themselves with most Quebecois after the passing of the Quebec Act in 1774.  the Quebec Act almost doubled the size of Quebec, ensured the free practice of Catholicism, and ensured that Quebec would retain its civil law code (which it still does today!).
