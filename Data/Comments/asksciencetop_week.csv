ubcokanagan,"No, you perceive smells when aromatic compounds bind neurons in your nasal passages.  The binding causes these neurons to fire which send a signal to your brain letting you know you just stepped in dog crap.  A very strong smell will innervate many neurons but it wont damage them.

If the odour is present for a long period of time, desensitization of the neurons will occur, and they will be less likely to fire in the absence of an increase in concentration of the aromatic molecules.  This is why smokers don't realize that they smell terrible all the time (well that and any damage caused by the smoke).

If the strong smell is caused by something toxic then yes it can cause damage, but I believe this would be caused by a property of the offending chemical, as opposed to it overstimulating a nerve.",null,0,cdo0u8c,1rim55,askscience,top_week,3

This would be ~chemoreceptor being overloaded with scent molecules or similarly shaped molecules at least. Anything that fits through goes through and is registered. But add oil and hey? It doesn't go through for a while. This is one reason for desensitized smell. Another is that the sensory nerve endings present to receive the signal from the sensory organelle(dendrites) fires so often that the brain starts filtering it out as useless signal, same as white noise.

freeze4111,"All odors, indeed anything that gets in your nose, damages it to a very small extent. The strength of the odor isn't necessarily the measure for its destructive capability however; mostly it is corrosive acids or things like smoke which do the real damage: look up tobacco smoking and its damage on the sense of smell to get an idea: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776624. 

Heavy odors, like blue cheese or something like that, may briefly block a number of receptors making your sense of smell not as good as what it could be, but this is very temporary (no more than a few seconds). In addition, your brain can adapt or habituate to odors, making them less noticeable (this is harder to do as the odor gets stronger). You'll probably notice this with your own perfume/deodorant throughout the day. 

Any damage done to your sense of smell is much, much easier to recover from compared to other senses because the neurons involved can turnover and regenerate (these are the only neurons that can). Some environmental experiences can make the turnover slower (as can age) but overall your sense of smell will recover from anything you throw at it. 

Something I find interesting- the neurons that take information from your sense of smell transmit that information to the brain through neurons passing a structure called the cribiform plate via little holes. If these neurons are severed, they can regenerate, but usually can't find their way through the holes again; a case of this unique quality being utterly useless!

The cathode and the anode are materials which can hold Lithium, while also allowing it to leave the structure reversibly. The electrolyte is a material which allows lithium to pass through, but not electrons.
When a lithium battery is being charged lithium ions (Li+) move from the cathode to the anode, through the electrolyte. When the Li+ reaches the anode it takes an electron from the power supply to form a (relatively) stable state. The Li is stored in the anode until a device that requires power is connected (discharging the battery). 
When a device that needs power is attached, the Li in the anode releases an electron to form Li+ which moves to the cathode. The released electrons cannot travel through the electrolyte therefore travel around the circuit, powering the device. At the cathode the Li+ recombines with an electron from the circuit.

Ive never learnt much about snow formation, but i can tell you about hail. 
In a cumulonimbus cloud, water is cooled below freezing point but it hasnt frozen, called 'supercooled' water. supercooled water will freeze when it comes into contact with something that can start the crystal growth, such as a dust particle or some frozen water. So supercooled water is blowing around in the cloud, being pushed up by updraughts and falling back down when the updraughts cant hold its weight any more. It will cycle around the cloud falling and then riding updraughts back up again, all the while it will be accumulating water (some of it supercooled liquid water, some of it water vapour) until it doesnt find an updraught strong enough to hold it in the cloud and it falls out. Because the supercooled water is liquid and doesnt necessarily freeze instantly, the stone will be wet on the outside, which means stones will stick to each other by touching and then freezing. the sticking together of stones into larger stones makes the irregular surface of the ""random chunks"".

For a tired light phenomenon to be true, it would have to:

1) Explain energy loss of photons over long distances, and match the observed redshift.

2) Not scatter photons so much as to induce blurring (since we don't observe significant blurring of distant objects).

3) Also explain the observed time dilation of distant events

4) Cause the same effect in every wavelength band, or in other words photons must ""tire"" in the same way, regardless of their frequency.

No, it would not.

You are talking about an entire class of alternative explanations of redshift, grouped under the umbrella of the ""tired light hypothesis"". The have pretty much been debunked in bulk.

You cannot have light become ""tired"" by magic. There has to be some physical mechanism for photons to lose energy. If so, the energy loss will tweak the properties of those photons a little. As a result, a series of effects would become apparent:

- images from distant objects would become a little blurred, due to the scattering of the photons via energy-sapping interactions

- distant events would be observed to take place at the same rate of time; there would be no time dilation, like in the relativistic redshift models

Other effects would also become observable, depending on the particular ""flavor"" of tired-light theory, none of which have ever been observed.

If somehting is moving toward us the light it emits doesn't seem to hit us any ""harder""(b/c light only goes c, no faster, no slower, ever) but that energy is accounted for, the light decreases its wavelength. If it is moving away then the wavelength increases which makes it appear redder.

Now when looking out into the stars hubble noticed that the further an object was the redder it appeared to be compared to what we know that objects [emission spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum) *should* look like. Now if the Universe were static then we would expect that, overall, half of all objects must be moving toward us and half be moving away and some tiny minority not moving relative to us at all. It is incredibly unlikely that, in a static universe, all objects would be moving away form us, we would ahve to be a truly uniqe body to observe that, literally the center of the universe.

However, there's a nice property in three dimensions that each plane has exactly one direction perpendicular to it, and we can define a direction/magnitude of circulation by specifying a given vector along the direction of that normal.

From this point of view the direction (in or out) is just a stand in for the direction of circulation of the plane. In some ways the plane picture is better, however most of the math you would have developed is better at using vectors and since this one to one correspondence between the two exists we can jump back and forth between the two.

Many materials (cloth, paper, cement) have a microscopic structure which provides multiple reflecting surfaces. For instance, a solid chunk of ice is mostly transparent, but snow is white. They are both made out of the same substance, but the microscopic structures in the snow flake and not in the ice provide multiple surfaces for light to reflect off of. Optical reflection takes place at the *interface* between one material and another material with different optical properties, such as at the surface separating air and ice. Creating a microscopic structure (scratching up a surface, weaving a fabric, injecting air bubbles) introduces more reflecting surfaces, so the incident light has a higher chance of getting reflected rather than transmitted. A solid, pure chunk of salt is transparent, put a pile of table salt granules is white because of all the reflecting surfaces.

Which brings us to your question. If we get rid of the microscopic structure, we can make white material clear again. Melt pure white sand down and let it harden as a solid piece of glass or quartz and it will be transparent. Melt snow flakes into a homogenous pot of water, and it becomes transparent again.

Pour water on a material with microscopic structures and the water will fill most of the cracks, scratches, pores, holes, and bubbles that used to be filled with air.

santa167,"BA in Astrophysics here.  Your question involves how galaxies and star systems are formed and why they typically stay in the same plane.  Since it seems like no one has answered yet, I'll try and help you out.  To answer, I'm going to do a little background, first on galaxies, then on stars, and then I'll explain why there should not be as much matter above and below the plane of the Milky Way and our Solar System.  

You're correct in assuming that space is infinite, but from the sound of it, you are implicitly also assuming that it is isotropic on any level.  Essentially, the reason flat diagrams are bewildering is because you're thinking of space as completely evenly spread out with stars, planets, and other matter (like Hydrogen clouds and black holes and white dwarfs, etc.) roughly taking up the same spacial distance away from one another.  Space isn't like a 3D grid, however, especially on smaller scales.  

Astronomers recognize that on a [very, very, very large scale](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Earth's_Location_in_the_Universe_(JPEG).jpg), above the scale of the local superclusters of galaxies even, the isotropy of the universe can be assumed as true.  As you can see in the picture, this is not true on the scale of our Milky Way Galaxy.  Isotropy means that no matter where you look, everything appears similar and there's no distinguishing point of reference.  In the image, we can see that matter is pretty much equally spread out only on the observable universe level.

That being said, now we should consider how galaxies form.  There are four basic different structures to galaxies: spiral, elliptical, lenticular, and irregular.  These were proposed as a sort of ""evolution"" by Edwin Hubble and called the [Hubble Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence).  First, the Hubble Sequence doesn't take into account irregular galaxies, which formed (as you can assume from there name) in a very strange way, mostly in the beginning stages of the universe where matter interactions were really hectic.  

I'm going to put irregular galaxies aside because they aren't really what we're focusing on here, but there's not much more to say about them anyway.  What's left are spiral, elliptical, and lenticular galaxies.  They have different characteristics and form in different conditions.  Long story short, your question only involved star formation and spiral galaxies so I'm going to get into that specifically.  Spoiler: there is a more equal spacing of stars and matter in elliptical galaxies because they formed from galaxies merging together and are shaped, you guessed it, like an ellipse.

Finally!  Onto the good stuff.  Star formation and [spiral galaxies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy#Origin_of_the_spiral_structure)!  Our Milky Way and Solar System.  Both are surprisingly similar actually, so let's get down to it.  First off, spiral galaxies are classified by two things, whether they have a ""bar"" in the middle of them, or not.  This is shown in the Hubble sequence as the fork separating SBa from Sa.  As you can imagine, spiral galaxies are shaped in a spiral way with a group of stars in the middle surrounding the center.  Much like a sprinkler that is shooting water and spinning for a long time, the water or arms in this case appear to be curved due to the rotation of the center.  The spinning of the center is very important and will play a part in answering your question.

Star formation will actually explain both processes so I'm going to jump out of galaxies for a minute.  Imagine a cloud of Hydrogen and other dust just floating around in space.  If the conditions are right, maybe perhaps in the spiral arm of a galaxy where lots of new stars are formed, the cloud might be heated up and have the right pressure to start clumping Hydrogen molecules together.  Obviously, we know that the more mass something has, the more gravitational pull it has.  Even you and I have a slight gravitational pull.  The Hydrogen and other dust starts clumping together at a certain point as more and more matter is pulled toward it.  As more matter is pulled in, the center of the cloud where it's being pulled starts to rotate from being hit with particles.  Fast forward to lots of matter pulled in and gravity of the matter causing immense amounts of pressure down on itself, and you have a cloud with a [protostar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar)!  

Fast forward some more.  More and more matter is being gravitationally pulled into the protostar and more matter on top means more pressure at the core from matter pushing down on it.  It also means more rotation done by the protostar.  In the cloud, matter starts to orbit around the protostar because it is too far from the protostar to be pulled in and the spinning of the protostar has caused the matter to achieve a tangential velocity creating an orbit.  Now, we're at the point of the cloud looking like a rough haze of particles around a really hot ball.  As the particles in the cloud orbit, they too clump together to form planets, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, etc.  Here's where we get to the crux of your question.  Why do the planets form on a similar ""plane"" of the star system?  The reason is actually because of the spinning protostar.  

The protostar's spin causes the particles of dust and Hydrogen in the cloud to orbit in a specific direction.  That's all well and good, so now everything is orbiting around in the same direction as the protostar is spinning.  Back to another analogy.  If you have a rubber ball and you decide you want to spin it while throwing it in the air straight up, what should happen?  If you spin it like a pizza, the rubber balls top and bottom actually sinks into the middle part because of the spinning acting upon the particles in the rest of the ball.  The top and bottom contract in to the middle plane of the ball where you spun it!  Same concept, but on a much larger scale.  Spin the protostar fast enough, and the particles in the upper and lower parts of the system (not on the same plane as the spin) want to sink down into the plane, forming a sort of CD-like shape with the protostar in the middle and everything else orbiting the same way.  

Eventually, [the star gets big enough, hot enough, and has enough pressure to start Hydrogen fusion in the core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation) when it explodes with energy and blows off a lot of the remaining dust and cloud in the system, leaving planets, comets, asteroids, and moons behind.  The planets are still orbiting the star in the same rotational way, also rotating themselves, and their moons as well.  The system looks like a CD and there is little matter above or below the CD plane because of the rotation of the star enacting a force to push and pull everything *into* the plane itself.  You can actually apply the same principal to the formation of a spiral galaxy, although the formation is a little different.  

I hope this answers your question.  Let me know if it doesn't and I'll try and clear it up a little better.  

**TL;DR:** The star/supermassive black hole in the center pushes and pulls matter as the system/spiral galaxy is forming into a disk.  It pulls the matter into the disk by spinning and applying a force into the plane that acts on the matter.  When the matter is in the disk, the rotation/force around the still spinning star/supermassive black hole doesn't allow it to leave.  That's why there's not as much stuff above and below the plane of the system/spiral galaxy.",null,33,cdnfpuh,1rhu7r,askscience,top_week,199

TraderMoes,"The reason the solar system and galaxies are depicted this way is because they largely are flat. All of the planets in our solar system are in the same plane, give or take a few degrees. Pluto isn't, it's orbit has a tilt of 20+ degrees (not sure of the exact figure off the top of my head), and that is one of the reasons it was demoted from being a planet to being merely a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of asteroids on the outskirts of the solar system. Even further than the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud, and this is actually spherical and surrounds the entire solar system. 

The reason the main solar system is essentially horizontal though (by main I mean the planets and the sun), has to do with solar system formation. The solar system formed out of a cloud of gas that condensed and heated up. As it did so, due to conservation of angular momentum the gas started to spin faster, and as it spun and gas particles collided their orbits would change, and gradually align into roughly the same plane. That's why later when the sun and planets formed out of that gas, they all occupied the same plane, and all orbit and almost all rotate in the same direction. 

I'm not certain why galaxies are flat-ish as well, that's a good question. But to answer the rest of your question, the universe is actually not infinite, although for our purposes it may as well be since we can never reach or even see the edge. But yes, there are galaxies all around us, in every direction. The galaxies themselves are relatively ""flat,"" but they can be oriented in any direction and be in any direction from us.

HappyRectangle,"Most of the planets and asteroids have been spun into the same plane by the forces of gravity and angular momentum. But not entirely -- Mercury is off by about 7 degrees, and Pluto is out of alignment by 17. 

But the ""above"" and ""below"" areas aren't completely empty. [Scattered disc objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc) are asteroids that take all kinds of orbits, are often found wildly outside of the plane, and can change their distance to the sun quite a bit as they orbit around it. 

The main problem with having such an off-kilter orbit is that sometimes, you'll come into close quarters with a large planet. While the chances of actually hitting the planet itself are very small (space is just so much bigger than the sizes of the planets), the gravitational pull of the planet will be enough to slightly alter your trajectory and put you into a different orbit. A kind of cosmic natural selection happens: if you can maintain your orbit for a billion years, that means you either have a nice, circular one, or you just happen to have a key position that never gets near a planet.

Pluto is an example of the latter. While Pluto's orbit crosses near Neptune's, it's aligned so that two Pluto orbits take exactly the same amount of time as three Nepture orbits. This ensures they will never get anywhere near each other by accident. (There are other planetoids that have this 2:3 resonance with Neptune too -- we call them *Plutinos*.)

By the way, if the dust cloud that made our solar system settled naturally, there would be much fewer scattered disc objects. The reason we have so many is because at some point a long, long, long time ago, the orbits of the outer planets [""abruptly"" shifted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model), and Neptune flew into an outer belt of asteroids, scattering them all over the place with its gravity (I put abruptly in quotes because it actually took millions of years).

GhengopelALPHA,"Since other people are focusing on the question of how the solar system is in a plane, I want to answer your hidden question about the difference between space and objects.

You seem to be confusing the term *space* as including all objects in it; the planets in their plane, the galaxy, etc. It is true that the space is (probably) infinite, but the solar system, the Milky Way, etc, are things in space, and are not including everything that is in space. A diagram of the solar system only includes the planets (which orbit in a plane) because those are the larger objects in the space between the Sun and other stars. There are plenty of comets and Kuiper Belt objects that orbit above and below this plane, but they are tiny compared to the planets. Likewise, there are the Large and Small Magellanic clouds which orbit (I think?) the Milky Way on tilted orbits, and of course, there's the Andromeda Galaxy, but each is an entirely separate object from the Milky Way.

So, to answer your deeper question, yes there is as much stuff above and below us. But nearest to the solar system, that stuff is just small ice rocks, not planets. Further out, above and below the galaxy, there are roughly equal amounts of gas and stars, but there is much, **much** less of them near the ""poles"" of the Milky Way than in its plane.

The result of condensing gas clouds are a few rings of condensed matter on a plane where the total angular momentum along 2 axes more or less added up to 0, while the angular momentum around the 3rd axis keeps stuff rotating locally around nearly parallel axes.

severoon,"I thought you might find this interesting -http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=205 - which basically explains why accretion discs are flat.

The basic idea is: if you release a bunch of particles of matter in empty space and they're all stationary relative to each other, they'll just fall directly toward the center of mass of the whole system and crunch into a sphere. But this never happens. Things are always moving around.

Now you can imagine that if everything is moving directly toward that center of mass of the whole system, they'll all just accelerate and crunch even harder. But once again, this never happens. Things in the universe that get caught up in a system never happen to be flying directly toward the center of mass of the system.

Ok, so they're coming in from all directions. If it's going fast enough, a particle won't get captured by that system, its path will bend, but it will ultimately fly on through. But if it's not going fast enough to escape and it gets trapped, then it will start a spiraling orbit toward the center of mass of the system.

Now we have a bunch of stuff randomly spiraling in toward the center of mass. This still isn't a disc though, so why do we only see discs? Shouldn't it be a big swirling spherical mass? Seems like it should...

But if you think a little more, and give this system a long, long time to settle down into a stable situation, you'll see that it isn't the case. This is because every system has a net angular momentum. In other words, from all these random things falling in, you can add up the linear momentum, and that will tell you how the system as a whole is flying through space (in a straight line). About that point, though, everything is also rotating, and that's the angular momentum.

Over time, all these different things will collide with each other and all the momentum that is moving perpendicular to the accretion disc plane will start to cancel. Furthermore, the gravitational effect of all that mass in that accretion disc plane tends to pull things into it. From there, this matter all starts to compress together into local chunks, and you get planets. You may get a bunch of matter that happens to not settle down before it gets close together and collapses into a local chunk, and you have Neptune (the planet in our system that doesn't fall in our accretion disc, or some theories say it formed and get ejected from some other place and got captured by our sun).

santa167,"BA in Astrophysics here.  Your question involves how galaxies and star systems are formed and why they typically stay in the same plane.  Since it seems like no one has answered yet, I'll try and help you out.  To answer, I'm going to do a little background, first on galaxies, then on stars, and then I'll explain why there should not be as much matter above and below the plane of the Milky Way and our Solar System.  

You're correct in assuming that space is infinite, but from the sound of it, you are implicitly also assuming that it is isotropic on any level.  Essentially, the reason flat diagrams are bewildering is because you're thinking of space as completely evenly spread out with stars, planets, and other matter (like Hydrogen clouds and black holes and white dwarfs, etc.) roughly taking up the same spacial distance away from one another.  Space isn't like a 3D grid, however, especially on smaller scales.  

Astronomers recognize that on a [very, very, very large scale](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Earth's_Location_in_the_Universe_(JPEG).jpg), above the scale of the local superclusters of galaxies even, the isotropy of the universe can be assumed as true.  As you can see in the picture, this is not true on the scale of our Milky Way Galaxy.  Isotropy means that no matter where you look, everything appears similar and there's no distinguishing point of reference.  In the image, we can see that matter is pretty much equally spread out only on the observable universe level.

That being said, now we should consider how galaxies form.  There are four basic different structures to galaxies: spiral, elliptical, lenticular, and irregular.  These were proposed as a sort of ""evolution"" by Edwin Hubble and called the [Hubble Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence).  First, the Hubble Sequence doesn't take into account irregular galaxies, which formed (as you can assume from there name) in a very strange way, mostly in the beginning stages of the universe where matter interactions were really hectic.  

I'm going to put irregular galaxies aside because they aren't really what we're focusing on here, but there's not much more to say about them anyway.  What's left are spiral, elliptical, and lenticular galaxies.  They have different characteristics and form in different conditions.  Long story short, your question only involved star formation and spiral galaxies so I'm going to get into that specifically.  Spoiler: there is a more equal spacing of stars and matter in elliptical galaxies because they formed from galaxies merging together and are shaped, you guessed it, like an ellipse.

Finally!  Onto the good stuff.  Star formation and [spiral galaxies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy#Origin_of_the_spiral_structure)!  Our Milky Way and Solar System.  Both are surprisingly similar actually, so let's get down to it.  First off, spiral galaxies are classified by two things, whether they have a ""bar"" in the middle of them, or not.  This is shown in the Hubble sequence as the fork separating SBa from Sa.  As you can imagine, spiral galaxies are shaped in a spiral way with a group of stars in the middle surrounding the center.  Much like a sprinkler that is shooting water and spinning for a long time, the water or arms in this case appear to be curved due to the rotation of the center.  The spinning of the center is very important and will play a part in answering your question.

Star formation will actually explain both processes so I'm going to jump out of galaxies for a minute.  Imagine a cloud of Hydrogen and other dust just floating around in space.  If the conditions are right, maybe perhaps in the spiral arm of a galaxy where lots of new stars are formed, the cloud might be heated up and have the right pressure to start clumping Hydrogen molecules together.  Obviously, we know that the more mass something has, the more gravitational pull it has.  Even you and I have a slight gravitational pull.  The Hydrogen and other dust starts clumping together at a certain point as more and more matter is pulled toward it.  As more matter is pulled in, the center of the cloud where it's being pulled starts to rotate from being hit with particles.  Fast forward to lots of matter pulled in and gravity of the matter causing immense amounts of pressure down on itself, and you have a cloud with a [protostar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar)!  

Fast forward some more.  More and more matter is being gravitationally pulled into the protostar and more matter on top means more pressure at the core from matter pushing down on it.  It also means more rotation done by the protostar.  In the cloud, matter starts to orbit around the protostar because it is too far from the protostar to be pulled in and the spinning of the protostar has caused the matter to achieve a tangential velocity creating an orbit.  Now, we're at the point of the cloud looking like a rough haze of particles around a really hot ball.  As the particles in the cloud orbit, they too clump together to form planets, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, etc.  Here's where we get to the crux of your question.  Why do the planets form on a similar ""plane"" of the star system?  The reason is actually because of the spinning protostar.  

The protostar's spin causes the particles of dust and Hydrogen in the cloud to orbit in a specific direction.  That's all well and good, so now everything is orbiting around in the same direction as the protostar is spinning.  Back to another analogy.  If you have a rubber ball and you decide you want to spin it while throwing it in the air straight up, what should happen?  If you spin it like a pizza, the rubber balls top and bottom actually sinks into the middle part because of the spinning acting upon the particles in the rest of the ball.  The top and bottom contract in to the middle plane of the ball where you spun it!  Same concept, but on a much larger scale.  Spin the protostar fast enough, and the particles in the upper and lower parts of the system (not on the same plane as the spin) want to sink down into the plane, forming a sort of CD-like shape with the protostar in the middle and everything else orbiting the same way.  

Eventually, [the star gets big enough, hot enough, and has enough pressure to start Hydrogen fusion in the core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation) when it explodes with energy and blows off a lot of the remaining dust and cloud in the system, leaving planets, comets, asteroids, and moons behind.  The planets are still orbiting the star in the same rotational way, also rotating themselves, and their moons as well.  The system looks like a CD and there is little matter above or below the CD plane because of the rotation of the star enacting a force to push and pull everything *into* the plane itself.  You can actually apply the same principal to the formation of a spiral galaxy, although the formation is a little different.  

I hope this answers your question.  Let me know if it doesn't and I'll try and clear it up a little better.  

**TL;DR:** The star/supermassive black hole in the center pushes and pulls matter as the system/spiral galaxy is forming into a disk.

TraderMoes,"The reason the solar system and galaxies are depicted this way is because they largely are flat. All of the planets in our solar system are in the same plane, give or take a few degrees. Pluto isn't, it's orbit has a tilt of 20+ degrees (not sure of the exact figure off the top of my head), and that is one of the reasons it was demoted from being a planet to being merely a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of asteroids on the outskirts of the solar system. Even further than the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud, and this is actually spherical and surrounds the entire solar system. 

The reason the main solar system is essentially horizontal though (by main I mean the planets and the sun), has to do with solar system formation. The solar system formed out of a cloud of gas that condensed and heated up. As it did so, due to conservation of angular momentum the gas started to spin faster, and as it spun and gas particles collided their orbits would change, and gradually align into roughly the same plane. That's why later when the sun and planets formed out of that gas, they all occupied the same plane, and all orbit and almost all rotate in the same direction. 

I'm not certain why galaxies are flat-ish as well, that's a good question. But to answer the rest of your question, the universe is actually not infinite, although for our purposes it may as well be since we can never reach or even see the edge. But yes, there are galaxies all around us, in every direction. The galaxies themselves are relatively ""flat,"" but they can be oriented in any direction and be in any direction from us.

HappyRectangle,"Most of the planets and asteroids have been spun into the same plane by the forces of gravity and angular momentum. But not entirely -- Mercury is off by about 7 degrees, and Pluto is out of alignment by 17. 

But the ""above"" and ""below"" areas aren't completely empty. [Scattered disc objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc) are asteroids that take all kinds of orbits, are often found wildly outside of the plane, and can change their distance to the sun quite a bit as they orbit around it. 

The main problem with having such an off-kilter orbit is that sometimes, you'll come into close quarters with a large planet. While the chances of actually hitting the planet itself are very small (space is just so much bigger than the sizes of the planets), the gravitational pull of the planet will be enough to slightly alter your trajectory and put you into a different orbit. A kind of cosmic natural selection happens: if you can maintain your orbit for a billion years, that means you either have a nice, circular one, or you just happen to have a key position that never gets near a planet.

Pluto is an example of the latter. While Pluto's orbit crosses near Neptune's, it's aligned so that two Pluto orbits take exactly the same amount of time as three Nepture orbits. This ensures they will never get anywhere near each other by accident. (There are other planetoids that have this 2:3 resonance with Neptune too -- we call them *Plutinos*.)

By the way, if the dust cloud that made our solar system settled naturally, there would be much fewer scattered disc objects. The reason we have so many is because at some point a long, long, long time ago, the orbits of the outer planets [""abruptly"" shifted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model), and Neptune flew into an outer belt of asteroids, scattering them all over the place with its gravity (I put abruptly in quotes because it actually took millions of years).

GhengopelALPHA,"Since other people are focusing on the question of how the solar system is in a plane, I want to answer your hidden question about the difference between space and objects.

You seem to be confusing the term *space* as including all objects in it; the planets in their plane, the galaxy, etc. It is true that the space is (probably) infinite, but the solar system, the Milky Way, etc, are things in space, and are not including everything that is in space. A diagram of the solar system only includes the planets (which orbit in a plane) because those are the larger objects in the space between the Sun and other stars. There are plenty of comets and Kuiper Belt objects that orbit above and below this plane, but they are tiny compared to the planets. Likewise, there are the Large and Small Magellanic clouds which orbit (I think?) the Milky Way on tilted orbits, and of course, there's the Andromeda Galaxy, but each is an entirely separate object from the Milky Way.

So, to answer your deeper question, yes there is as much stuff above and below us. But nearest to the solar system, that stuff is just small ice rocks, not planets. Further out, above and below the galaxy, there are roughly equal amounts of gas and stars, but there is much, **much** less of them near the ""poles"" of the Milky Way than in its plane.

The result of condensing gas clouds are a few rings of condensed matter on a plane where the total angular momentum along 2 axes more or less added up to 0, while the angular momentum around the 3rd axis keeps stuff rotating locally around nearly parallel axes.

severoon,"I thought you might find this interesting -http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=205 - which basically explains why accretion discs are flat.

The basic idea is: if you release a bunch of particles of matter in empty space and they're all stationary relative to each other, they'll just fall directly toward the center of mass of the whole system and crunch into a sphere. But this never happens. Things are always moving around.

Now you can imagine that if everything is moving directly toward that center of mass of the whole system, they'll all just accelerate and crunch even harder. But once again, this never happens. Things in the universe that get caught up in a system never happen to be flying directly toward the center of mass of the system.

Ok, so they're coming in from all directions. If it's going fast enough, a particle won't get captured by that system, its path will bend, but it will ultimately fly on through. But if it's not going fast enough to escape and it gets trapped, then it will start a spiraling orbit toward the center of mass of the system.

Now we have a bunch of stuff randomly spiraling in toward the center of mass. This still isn't a disc though, so why do we only see discs? Shouldn't it be a big swirling spherical mass? Seems like it should...

But if you think a little more, and give this system a long, long time to settle down into a stable situation, you'll see that it isn't the case. This is because every system has a net angular momentum. In other words, from all these random things falling in, you can add up the linear momentum, and that will tell you how the system as a whole is flying through space (in a straight line). About that point, though, everything is also rotating, and that's the angular momentum.

Over time, all these different things will collide with each other and all the momentum that is moving perpendicular to the accretion disc plane will start to cancel. Furthermore, the gravitational effect of all that mass in that accretion disc plane tends to pull things into it. From there, this matter all starts to compress together into local chunks, and you get planets. You may get a bunch of matter that happens to not settle down before it gets close together and collapses into a local chunk, and you have Neptune (the planet in our system that doesn't fall in our accretion disc, or some theories say it formed and get ejected from some other place and got captured by our sun).

Halysites,"Two reasons:

1. When a star is going through [fusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star#Formation_and_evolution), it will combine hydrogen to form heavier and heavier atoms. The basic reaction series would be: 

* hydrogen + hydrogen = helium
* helium + helium = carbon
* carbon + carbon = iron
* there will be other combinations of fusing atoms which would result in the creation of neon, silicon, etc. This is just a very simple list (I'm just a simple geologist and chemistry is not my speciality).

Once a star has burned all it's fuel to generate iron, it will undergo a supernova (or some other process, depending on it's size). Since iron was the last atom to be produced during the fusion process the star will be very rich with iron. If it's goes through a supernova it ends up ejecting most of it's material into the space around it; during this process heavier elements may form as well. So the space around it becomes enriched in a variety of elements, especially iron. This material is what will be used to form planets.

2. Planetary material begins to accrete from the rich stuff spewed out by a dying star. It is very hot and so the material is molten. As the planetoids get larger and larger, gravity becomes a stronger force. Gravity, coupled with a molten states, means that heavier elements are pulled towards the core of the planetary body quickly. Iron, being very heavy, will sink towards the core. Other heavy (metallic) elements will also sink to the core.

Viola, you have an iron-rich core for rocky planets. This process doesn't exactly apply to gas giants like Jupiter (which would be relatively depleted in iron).

Platypuskeeper,"It's a quite tangible property, the [Stern-Gerlach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment) experiment was the first more or less direct observation of particle spin. 

Spin does not imply that the particle is spinning on its own axis, but the name isn't arbitrary - in many ways it _does_ work _as if_ the particle would be spinning on its own axis. It's an intrinsic form of angular momentum. The perhaps most significant or immediate effect is that electrons get a magnetic moment, as you would have classically with a rotating charge.

Spin doesn't actually have any special relationship to entanglement, all the measurable properties about particles can become entangled. Electron spin is just a good example, because it can only take two possible values.

Anyway, the real-world consequences of spin are inestimable, because nearly all matter would behave very very differently if electrons had zero spin and didn't need to obey the Pauli principle. The only chemical bond that would exist in its current form be the simplest molecule of all, H2. Spin and the Pauli principle 'forces' electrons to occupy higher-energy states than they would otherwise, and it's always the highest-energy (valence) electrons that are doing the chemical bonding.

could_do,"Spin is angular momentum which is intrinsic to a given field, not associated with some particular extra motion. It isn't really something spinning about an axis, but the name has stuck.

Via the spin-statistics theorem of relativistic quantum theory, spin is in fact associated with the distinction between bosons (which don't obey Pauli exclusion), and fermions (which do). This distinction has unimaginably significant consequences - for example, without Pauli exclusion, matter as we think of it could not exist.

Because it is a form of angular momentum, charged particles with non-zero spin give rise to magnetic effects. Ferromagnetism is a familiar example of such.

As an aside, I should say that you might want to reconsider your claim that you have a ""pretty fair grasp of most things [in advanced particle physics]."" If you aren't familiar with spin, then I *strongly* doubt you have the mathematical background to have even a beginner's grasp of quantum field theory, without which any particle physics knowledge is largely superficial and without foundation.

Rastafak,"There are two reasons why spin is important. First spin creates a magnetic moment. Magnetism in most materials is directly caused by electron's spin. There is also whole field which studies the effect of spin in microelectronic devices called spintronics. The other reason is Pauli exclusion principle. As others have stated, this is incredibly important for bonds for example. Solids and molecules would look very differently if electrons had 0 spin. 

I can tell you a bit more about spintronics because this is what I'm doing. Spintronics studies the interplay between electron's charge and spin. In other words we study electronics in which spin plays a role. You most likely actually own a spintronics device: the magnetic sensors in HDD's are based on spintronic effects called [Giant Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_magnetoresistance) or [Tunneling Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_magnetoresistance). In these sensors, there are two magnetic layers, one of them has fixed direction of magnetic moments, while the other can rotate in external field. Due to spintronic effects, resistivity of this structure depends on the relative orientation of the two layers. If you put it in external magnetic field, the free layer will align with the field and you can then measure its orientation by passing current through the structure. 

You can also make a memory based on these effects, where 0 is represented by the case when the two layers are oriented in the same direction, while 1 is the case, when they have opposite directions.

penisgoatee,"Spin is sort of a big deal.

If it weren't for spin, we wouldn't have hard drives. Electrons can have one of two spin states (spin up or spin down). The different states react to magnetic fields differently, this gives rise to [Tunnel Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_magnetoresistance), which is used in hard drives. So, yes, spin is quite tangible.

So what *is* spin? It's intrinsic angular momentum. Angular momentum depends on how fast you're spinning relative to an axis. For the spinning earth, the outer surface has angular momentum because it is spinning relative to the poles. For an electron, well, there are no poles. There's not really even a radius. And, yet, the electron still has the same kind of angular momentum as the spinning Earth. That's why we say it is intrinsic - it's just always there. 

Spin has the effect of making it seem like an electron is a little loop of current. The electron has a charge that is ""spinning"". Little loops of current make magnetic fields and interact with them. So spin is the origin of many magnetic phenomena, like permanent magnets and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 

Why is there spin? Well, why is there charge? Why is there mass? As Feynman pointed out, ""Why?"" isn't always a productive question. We could go on a crackpot tangent about how the electron is a nebulous ball of energy which may or may not have some intrinsic rotation, but that's not experimentally verifiable or well accepted by the physics community at large.

There are ways to represent it in classical terms like the vector model ""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/vecmod.html"" however I myself don't really like this model and take spin to just exist as whatever numerical value it is in my head.

Spin is essentially the magnetic property of a particle (or collection of particles), it's made up of spin angular momentum component, and a magnetic moment component. Magnetic Moment = Gyromagnetic Ratio x Spin Angular Momentum. The spin angular momentum value is derived from quantum mechanics, and the Gyromagnetic ratio is specific for each particle/atom. As the name implies, the magnetic moment is a moment, and if you want help imagining it, think of it as the moment at which the particle/overall atom is actually spinning, and is usually the quantity used for calculations to do with how much things affect/change spin. The spin angular momentum component of this is limited quantum mechanically to a specific number of orientations, depending on the amount of nuclear particles in question. This means that the magnetic properties can have a quantised number of states for an atom, and this is proven in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. This experiment fired nuclei (of something spin 1/2 I think, so with 2 allowed spin orientations), through a magnetic field and onto a detector. Only two spots were detected, implying that the field only had nuclei of two sets of magnetic properties pass through it, with one spot above the altitude at which the nuclei were fired (horizontally) and one below (indicating a positive, and negative spin, both nuclei were displaced by the same amount but in different directions).
 If you put nuclei in a magnetic field and fire electromagnetic waves at them, their overall spin will change when certain frequencies are used. This is the basis of NMR chemistry and the frequency (Larmor frequency) that causes these transitions depends on the magnetic moment of the species in question, the Gyromagnetic ratio, and the strength if the applied magnetic field. Many complicated extra effects arise from doing NMR and it can be used to figure out the chemical structure of many chemicals, using quantitative methods, in both organic and inorganic chemistry. Even now the field is continuously being improved as the sample quantities required to carry out NMR are too high (because of sensitivity issues caused by radio waves used in NMR being of low energy; compared to waves used in other methods of spectroscopy), these low sample qualities mean that biologists studying cells always wine about not being able to NMR the little things they find etc.

Platypuskeeper,"It's a quite tangible property, the [Stern-Gerlach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment) experiment was the first more or less direct observation of particle spin. 

Spin does not imply that the particle is spinning on its own axis, but the name isn't arbitrary - in many ways it _does_ work _as if_ the particle would be spinning on its own axis. It's an intrinsic form of angular momentum. The perhaps most significant or immediate effect is that electrons get a magnetic moment, as you would have classically with a rotating charge.

Spin doesn't actually have any special relationship to entanglement, all the measurable properties about particles can become entangled. Electron spin is just a good example, because it can only take two possible values.

Anyway, the real-world consequences of spin are inestimable, because nearly all matter would behave very very differently if electrons had zero spin and didn't need to obey the Pauli principle. The only chemical bond that would exist in its current form be the simplest molecule of all, H2. Spin and the Pauli principle 'forces' electrons to occupy higher-energy states than they would otherwise, and it's always the highest-energy (valence) electrons that are doing the chemical bonding.

The proton spins are aligned and anti aligned with the large static magnetic field in the axial direction of the scanner, then RF energy and gradient B fields are used to manipulate the spin directions.

So yes, spin is very tangible, useful and by exploiting its properties leads to numerous real world applications. ",null,3,cdnfs3t,1rhpj0,askscience,top_week,14
Pilipili,"To complete what Platypuskeeper said. Magnetism arises from spin. An everyday life use is your computer memories, in which the 0s and 1s are stored in the orientation of tiny magnets, in other words in their spin orientation. If you are interested in this, look into ""Giant Magnetoresistance"". Another interesting kind of devices, that are not commercialized yet but in which there is a ton of research, is spintronics. Basically people are trying to build an analogy to electronics but with waves of spin, not by moving the electrons.

could_do,"Spin is angular momentum which is intrinsic to a given field, not associated with some particular extra motion. It isn't really something spinning about an axis, but the name has stuck.

Via the spin-statistics theorem of relativistic quantum theory, spin is in fact associated with the distinction between bosons (which don't obey Pauli exclusion), and fermions (which do). This distinction has unimaginably significant consequences - for example, without Pauli exclusion, matter as we think of it could not exist.

Because it is a form of angular momentum, charged particles with non-zero spin give rise to magnetic effects. Ferromagnetism is a familiar example of such.

As an aside, I should say that you might want to reconsider your claim that you have a ""pretty fair grasp of most things [in advanced particle physics]."" If you aren't familiar with spin, then I *strongly* doubt you have the mathematical background to have even a beginner's grasp of quantum field theory, without which any particle physics knowledge is largely superficial and without foundation. I'm not saying this to try make you feel bad, I'm saying it because you seem to think that you might have more of an understanding than you do: Physics is a mathematically formulated subject, and cannot be accurately expressed without (in some cases fairly involved) mathematics. Any non-mathematical understanding of particle physics is fundamentally misleading (hell, even the very idea of a particle falls to pieces in quantum field theory). If you have even a bit of mathematical background (e.g. basic differential equations and linear algebra), there are a few great books I can recommend if you want to try to put together a more thorough understanding.",null,2,cdngi0l,1rhpj0,askscience,top_week,10
Rastafak,"There are two reasons why spin is important. First spin creates a magnetic moment. Magnetism in most materials is directly caused by electron's spin. There is also whole field which studies the effect of spin in microelectronic devices called spintronics. The other reason is Pauli exclusion principle. As others have stated, this is incredibly important for bonds for example. Solids and molecules would look very differently if electrons had 0 spin. 

I can tell you a bit more about spintronics because this is what I'm doing. Spintronics studies the interplay between electron's charge and spin. In other words we study electronics in which spin plays a role. You most likely actually own a spintronics device: the magnetic sensors in HDD's are based on spintronic effects called [Giant Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_magnetoresistance) or [Tunneling Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_magnetoresistance). In these sensors, there are two magnetic layers, one of them has fixed direction of magnetic moments, while the other can rotate in external field. Due to spintronic effects, resistivity of this structure depends on the relative orientation of the two layers. If you put it in external magnetic field, the free layer will align with the field and you can then measure its orientation by passing current through the structure. 

You can also make a memory based on these effects, where 0 is represented by the case when the two layers are oriented in the same direction, while 1 is the case, when they have opposite directions. These memories are not very widespread but they are made commercially and there is a lot of development in that area. [Here](http://www.everspin.com/) is one company, which sells them.

Keeping this in mind, consider that your condition ""a droplet or an object"" does not place constraints on the objects, so it's even harder to make a useful statement.

Immunochemistry depends on how good your antibodies are and they may effect the interaction, but this is the quickest and likely cheapest way to set up the experiment. You could also use GFP labeling. This would require making a construct and expressing it. It would take more work, and you would have to validate that this doesn't mess up the proteins of interest, but it would allow you to address the aggregation in much more natural contexts and due to the interaction of the chromophores via FRET/polarization you would likely be able to better quantify multimerization.

xavier_505,"This is likely an issue with the way the MPEG streams are configured. Generally MPEG-2 encoding (I am not especially familiar with MPEG 4 but I would hazard a guess that it is similar, or at a very minimum has great flexibility in its configuration) uses three types of frames: I, B and P.

- I (intra) frames are full frames of data encoded similarly to JPEG (~7:1 compression). These do not reference any other frames.

- P (predicted) frames only have information describing the difference between the preceding I or P frame (lower size than I frames, ~20:1 compression).

Both I and P frames are called ""reference frames"" since the information they describe can be referenced by other frames.

- B (bidirectional) frames are encoded from interpolation of preceding/following reference frames (even smaller than P frames, ~50:1 compression).

These various frame types are typically sent in the following way:

    I B B P B B I B B P B B I P B B....

Where the distance between I/P frames (in this case it is 3) is configurable as is the distance between I frames (in this case there are 6).

Why am I telling you this!? Well, a P frame cannot be decoded without its referenced I frame, and B frames cannot be decoded without all of their referenced I/P frame. So, the longer the distances mentioned above, the greater affect a lossy channel will have. You would see the behavior you are describing in the following case:

    MPEG2 GOP structure (m=2, n=4): I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B ....

    MPEG4 GOP structure (m=4, n=16): I B B B P B B B P B B B P B B B I B B B P B B B P B B B P B B B ....

A lost I frame on the lower stream would blow away 16 frames of data, while on the upper frame only 4 frames. Similar for lost P frames.

However, there are even bigger kinds of infinity -- each of which is ""uncountable"" -- one of which describes the number of numbers between 1 and 2. As it turns out, there's no way to come up with a method to list all numbers between 1 and 2 one-by-one simply because there are way-too-fucking-many of them. Perhaps paradoxically, though, you can show that describing all the numbers between 1 and 2 is just as hard as describing those between and 1000000, so the two infinities are actually said to be the same (specifically, it's called the ""beth-one"" infinity).

Very roughly speaking, it is unclear if there is an infinity between beth-zero (countable infinity) and beth-one (the type of incountable infinity we just discussed).

medstudent22,"There are several known benefits to neonatal circumcision. 

- **It prevents penile cancer.** Squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is exceedingly rare in circumcised patients. Circumcision alone may not be the preventative measure. [Phimosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis) (the inability to retract the foreskin) can only occur in non-circumcised individuals and is associated with a higher risk of penile cancer. Phimosis, in many cases, is preventable with adequate hygiene. It should also be noted that penile cancer is extremely rare 1-2 out of 200,000 men per year. Also worthwhile to note that somewhere between 909 and 322,000 circumcisions would need to be performed in order to prevent one case of penile cancer. 

- **It reduces the risk of UTIs in early life and up to 5 years of age.** Uncircumcised males are 20x more likely to develop a UTI during the neonatal period. It should be noted that 111 circumcisions must be performed to prevent one UTI though. Some cost analyses have shown that there is still a cost benefit to performing circumcisions when just considering UTIs though.  
 

There are some claimed benefits of circumcision with varying amounts of evidence. 
 
- **It may reduce the spread of HIV** (to men, in heterosexual relationships). This is based on several large African clinical trials. It was not found to reduce the risk of transmission to women and has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission in homosexual male couples. 

- **It may reduce the transmission of HPV and herpes (HSV).** In a study of 3393 men (1684 who underwent circumcision), after two years, 7.8% of the circumcised men had HSV-2 antibodies, 10.3% of the uncircumcised group did. In the same study, 18% of the circumcised men had evidence of HPV, 27.9% of uncircumcised men did. ([Study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0802556)) It should be noted that this study was performed in Uganda. Also worthwhile to note that most individuals clear HPV spontaneously and also that a [vaccine is available](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardasil) for the most common HPV strains. Also worthwhile to note that HPV is associated with penile cancer, but more importantly cervical cancer in women.  

The reason I tried to note the conclusions which were drawn based on African studies is that the underlying prevalence of disease has an effect on the study and these results may not be considered generalizable to other populations.  

Multiple groups have issued statements on neonatal circumcision which may contain more information that may be useful to you.

Christmas_Pirate,"All right my time to shine.  First lets examine exactly how information is stored on a DVD, before we get to how much information can be stored.  As I am sure you know, information is stored by essentially burning little holes in a metallic film in the DVD (not completely accurate, but a reasonable enough description of what is going on).  As technology progressed we have been able to burn smaller and smaller holes, hence the larger storage capacities.  Additionally we have been able to burn different ""types"" of holes I.E. DVD +/- (Dual layer literally means two layers of the metallic film, so double the storage capacity per square inch of DVD), thereby allowing more data to be stored since it could be stored in 3 variations of holes, if you will, instead of two (hole and no hole).  The [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) page goes into detail about this, so I wont bother.  

Now, while we have been able to make smaller and smaller lasers, we have not been able to change the laws of physics, one of which is all wavelengths have a [diffraction limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system).  Essentially, no matter how good your lens is, you can't focus a beam of light to a point smaller than half it's wavelength, and this is the hurdle consumer products have yet to overcome.  Blueray DVDs can store more information because the laser being used to burn them is blue, which has a shorter wavelength than red or IR (the other commonly used lasers).  The cost of the respective machines has a lot to do with manufacturing of the diodes, but I digress.

Now to the meat of the question; how much data can we store on a DVD?  Well that all depends how small we can make the burns.  Recently technologies have been developed that allow us to make tiny, tiny, burns.  How tiny?  From what I've read they claimed to be able to store 1 petabyte (that's 1,024 terabytes or 1,049,000 gigabytes). [Source](https://theconversation.com/more-data-storage-heres-how-to-fit-1-000-terabytes-on-a-dvd-15306).  How did they do this?  Well you're just going to have to do a little bit of reading to find that out.

**TL;DR:** Storage is limited by the size burn we can make with a laser in a thin metallic sheet inside the DVD.  The smallest burn we've made allows us to store roughly 1,000 terabyes or 1,000,000 gigabytes, although the technology to do this hasn't been made available to consumers.  It should be shortly as it doesn't use any novel technology, just a novel way of burning with current technologies.

As stated on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD), here are your various sizes for DVD Discs - 
4.7 GB (single-sided, single-layer – common)
8.5–8.7 GB (single-sided, double-layer)
9.4 GB (double-sided, single-layer)
17.08 GB (double-sided, double-layer – rare)

The unit of measurement, however, is in **decimal metric** - which has base units of 1000. 1000 bytes = 1 kilobyte, 1000 kilobytes = 1 megabyte, 1000 megabytes = 1 gigabyte.

Computers count in **binary** and have base units of 1024. So 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte - so on an so forth.

Therefore, the capacity of a 4.7 gigabyte DVD is 4700000000 bytes in decimal. But when divided by 1024 kilobytes, 1024 megabytes, and 1024 gigabytes, the capacity is ~4.48 gigabytes. Once the disk is formatted you may lose a few more megabytes.

This same principle can be applied to the other sizes of DVD's as well as hard drives - which are sold with the same confusing capacity claims. A 1 terabyte hard drive (1000 gigabytes, 1000000 megabytes, 1000000000 kilobytes, 1000000000000 bytes) as labeled by the manufacturer. A computer will see it as the binary capacity of 976562500 kilobytes, 953674 megabytes, 931.3 gigabytes.

Once you format the hard drive disk you lose a few more kilo/megabytes, but essentially, you have 931 gigabytes.

The reason why your DVD has a capacity of 6.1 gigabytes is because it started off as a 8.5–8.7 GB (single-sided, double-layer) disc, and once the data was burned / copied to the disc - the disc was **mastered / finalized**. This process completes the disc and does not allow any more data to be written to the disc. The DVD will now report to the computer the total size of the data written to the disc.

Christmas_Pirate,"All right my time to shine.  First lets examine exactly how information is stored on a DVD, before we get to how much information can be stored.  As I am sure you know, information is stored by essentially burning little holes in a metallic film in the DVD (not completely accurate, but a reasonable enough description of what is going on).  As technology progressed we have been able to burn smaller and smaller holes, hence the larger storage capacities.  Additionally we have been able to burn different ""types"" of holes I.E. DVD +/- (Dual layer literally means two layers of the metallic film, so double the storage capacity per square inch of DVD), thereby allowing more data to be stored since it could be stored in 3 variations of holes, if you will, instead of two (hole and no hole).  The [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) page goes into detail about this, so I wont bother.  

Now, while we have been able to make smaller and smaller lasers, we have not been able to change the laws of physics, one of which is all wavelengths have a [diffraction limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system).  Essentially, no matter how good your lens is, you can't focus a beam of light to a point smaller than half it's wavelength, and this is the hurdle consumer products have yet to overcome.  Blueray DVDs can store more information because the laser being used to burn them is blue, which has a shorter wavelength than red or IR (the other commonly used lasers).  The cost of the respective machines has a lot to do with manufacturing of the diodes, but I digress.

Now to the meat of the question; how much data can we store on a DVD?  Well that all depends how small we can make the burns.  Recently technologies have been developed that allow us to make tiny, tiny, burns.  How tiny?  From what I've read they claimed to be able to store 1 petabyte (that's 1,024 terabytes or 1,049,000 gigabytes). [Source](https://theconversation.com/more-data-storage-heres-how-to-fit-1-000-terabytes-on-a-dvd-15306).  How did they do this?  Well you're just going to have to do a little bit of reading to find that out.

**TL;DR:** Storage is limited by the size burn we can make with a laser in a thin metallic sheet inside the DVD.  The smallest burn we've made allows us to store roughly 1,000 terabyes or 1,000,000 gigabytes, although the technology to do this hasn't been made available to consumers.  It should be shortly as it doesn't use any novel technology, just a novel way of burning with current technologies.

As stated on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD), here are your various sizes for DVD Discs - 
4.7 GB (single-sided, single-layer – common)
8.5–8.7 GB (single-sided, double-layer)
9.4 GB (double-sided, single-layer)
17.08 GB (double-sided, double-layer – rare)

The unit of measurement, however, is in **decimal metric** - which has base units of 1000. 1000 bytes = 1 kilobyte, 1000 kilobytes = 1 megabyte, 1000 megabytes = 1 gigabyte.

Computers count in **binary** and have base units of 1024. So 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte - so on an so forth.

Therefore, the capacity of a 4.7 gigabyte DVD is 4700000000 bytes in decimal. But when divided by 1024 kilobytes, 1024 megabytes, and 1024 gigabytes, the capacity is ~4.48 gigabytes. Once the disk is formatted you may lose a few more megabytes.

This same principle can be applied to the other sizes of DVD's as well as hard drives - which are sold with the same confusing capacity claims. A 1 terabyte hard drive (1000 gigabytes, 1000000 megabytes, 1000000000 kilobytes, 1000000000000 bytes) as labeled by the manufacturer. A computer will see it as the binary capacity of 976562500 kilobytes, 953674 megabytes, 931.3 gigabytes.

Once you format the hard drive disk you lose a few more kilo/megabytes, but essentially, you have 931 gigabytes.

The reason why your DVD has a capacity of 6.1 gigabytes is because it started off as a 8.5–8.7 GB (single-sided, double-layer) disc, and once the data was burned / copied to the disc - the disc was **mastered / finalized**. This process completes the disc and does not allow any more data to be written to the disc. The DVD will now report to the computer the total size of the data written to the disc.

ThePsuedoMonkey,"Clothes dryers function by evaporating the water in the clothes, and the rate of evaporation of a liquid is directly related to its vapor pressure.  The vapor pressure of water is an [exponential function of temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure#Boiling_point_of_water), roughly 2.5kPa at room temperature and 101kPa when it boils.  An electrical heating element in a dryer will create heat by electrical resistance, and [Ohms Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor#Power_dissipation) states that the power dissipated by a resistor is the product of its resistance and the voltage that is applied to it.

If the amount of water in the clothes were sufficiently small, this would mean that it would be more efficient to dry them at high heat in an enclosed space (do not do this, it is fire hazard).  However, [there is likely](http://www.verber.com/mark/outdoors/gear/clothing-waterabsorption.html) a significant amount of water remaining in the clothes, and based on the room temperature vapor pressure, each kilogram of water will need 44 liters of completely dry air in order to fully evaporate in (which could become a corrosion or electrical hazard when it condenses after the dryer cools).

Because of this, air is vented through the dryer to expel the water-saturated air.  This additional air that must be heated, and there is no guarantee that all of it will be water-saturated by the time it is expelled, but the act of venting air can also help promote evaporation.  The amount of energy lost due to venting is proportional to the dryers temperature and the flow rate of the air, and the amount of energy lost due to thermal radiation is also proportional to the dryers temperature difference with the ambient air due to the first law of thermodynamics.  Reducing the temperature setting would reduce both of theses losses for any given moment, though the drying period would significantly increase due to the associated drop in vapor pressure.  However, without a better understanding of the effects of ambient humidity on evaporation, or of the efficiency of the electronic components at low output I am reluctant to say for certain.",null,20,cdnb7zo,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,84
BigWiggly1,"There are a lot of factors brought up by ThePsuedoMonkey's comment, and I recommend reading through his comment as well.

I'm going to go with a bit of gut instinct and tell you **no**. I will proceed by first explaining relative humidity, followed by how the dryer is working, and finally returning to the answer of your question.

For water to evaporate, the air it's in contact with needs to be able to hold it. The air's ability to hold it is measured as it's **Relative Humidity (RH)**. As heat is added to the air, its relative humidity decreases and it can hold more water.
Additionally, the lower the RH of the air is, the more quickly the water is able to evaporate. As water vapour saturates the air, the RH goes up and it becomes more and more difficult for that volume of air to pick up more water (Imagine it's arms are full and the more full they get, the more stuff they drop each time they bend over to pick up something new. Eventually it drops water just as fast as it picks it up).

Dryers work by taking air from the outside (ambient air), raising it's temperature, and circulating it through the dryer before sending it back out through the lint screen. The dryer would work, albeit rather slowly, without heating the air. Ambient air is usually not at 100% RH, so it can still hold more water. Lets say you put your clothes in for 60 minutes. At high heat, that's enough to dry them to your liking. At no heat (tumble only), they may still feel damp. Lets rule that out as not an option, because you've got somewhere to be in an hour and your favourite pants just got out of the washer.

By heating the air, the RH of the inlet air to the dryer is lowered as it's temperature rises, giving it the ability to hold more water (I guess it has bigger arms?). This means that for every volume of air that goes through the dryer, more water comes out with it. Additionally this helps to speed up the last bits of drying, where there isn't much water left. Warmer air will also heat the clothes, giving the water some extra energy to boost themselves into the vapour state so it can be carried off. Without heat, the last bits of water are simply too cold to evaporate quickly enough.

To address the energy efficiency:

Heating requires a lot of energy. Any heating process is a fairly inefficient process. Resistor heating elements are good at what they do, but nobody ever claims for them to be efficient. Moving air on the other hand is relatively easy to do (as long as you clean your lint screen). It's much more efficient to pump a volume of fluid (air) than it is to heat that same volume.

In the first stages of drying, there is so much water on the clothes that regardless of how warm the air is, it will saturate with water. There's simply an excess of water. This may make you say ""So lets heat it even more and it'll take more out with each chunk of air right?"" Yes, you are right. *Instead though*, we know it's cheaper to move air than it is to heat it, so let's be patient and let the moving air do it's work. In fact dryers would be more efficient if they increased the air flowrate in the early stages of the drying cycle, and decreased the heating requirements.

As mentioned earlier, in the last stages of drying when there isn't much water, warmer air is able to force water out of it's little microscopic nooks and crannies by giving it more energy. At this point, air circulation isn't as important because there isn't enough water in the clothes to saturate the air that's in there anyways. Now, air circulation is only to prevent overheating that could cause a fire hazard. Still, every bit of air that gets heated and then vented too soon is a waste of energy.

So now that we've covered what is good at the early and late stages of drying, we can make general statements on what the most efficient dryer would do: Start out on low heat with high circulation, followed by a steady increase of heat until finishing while the air flowrate is decreased proportionally to the temperature, but always above a minimum flowrate to prevent overheating.

Since I don't know about any of these fancy dryers on the market, and most people are tempted to use the timed dry options rather than an auto-dry option (which uses an RH or moisture sensor to determine when to stop drying), I will say that it is most efficient to stick to the least amount of heat necessary to get your clothes to a satisfactory level of dryness, because heating is the most inefficient process in your dryer.

As a good compromise between length of cycle and heating required, **use medium heat**. I've noticed that medium heat often doesn't take noticeably longer than a high heat cycle, and does the job well enough.

Alternatively, if you're looking to be the most efficient you could dry on low and manually increase the temperature every 15 minutes or so.

If you're a dryer manufacturer and reading this, consider making the auto-dry cycle adjust airflow and temperature based on the RH leaving the dryer (based on the sensor already in the installation). ",null,2,cdne9bx,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,13
RabidRabb1t,"This all depends on what you mean by ""efficient.""  Since I can just hang my clothes up and watch them dry (although it takes some time), the application of any extra heat that I then shunt outdoors is clearly wasteful.

If by efficient, you mean in terms of the product your time waiting and cost of drying (economic efficiency), that's a slightly more interesting question.  There are two things to consider: first, that the energy required to vaporize the water in your clothes from room temperature is essentially a constant.  Secondly, the rate of energy transfer is related to the temperature difference between the air and the clothes by an exponential function.  Now, if you keep running hot air over your clothes at a constant rate, relying on the efficiency of energy transfer, we can now figure out the function form of our economic efficiency.
  
Assuming you charge an hourly rate, the opportunity cost to you is simply your rate, R, times the amount of time, time, that it takes to dry your clothes.  The cost to you on your electric bill is the time it takes to dry your clothes multiplied by your power company's rate, P, and the rate of energy usage, E.  Since resistive heating is ~100%, we're going to make the approximation that E proportional to the amount you heated your clothing up.  The only thing left is how much time it takes as a function of temperature (exponential).

So, you're left with:

cost = R * [1/[exp(E)]^2 * P * E

where time is 1/[exp(E)].

Since this function goes to zero very fast, the short answer is that yes, higher temperatures are good for your wallet.  Please note that I did leave out a massive fudge factor, namely that the amount of waste heat is also going to increase in this model since I did not actually bother to take the integral of the exponential; however, the point remains.

LWRellim,"Per [this study (see page 11)](http://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2010/data/papers/2206.pdf) a “low heat” setting is more efficient than higher heat settings. 

However, the energy usage difference is not as large as most may think -- what the ""high heat"" setting mostly achieves is apparently just a (slightly) shorter drying time -- and the additional energy expended to heat is offset by the fact that the machine itself (and thus the fan/airflow) runs for a shorter time.

The study includes the following recommendations:

&gt;**Advice to Consumers**

&gt;Consumers can dry clothes with less energy by using (in order of energy savings):    

&gt;1. Outdoor clothes lines get clothes dry using no energy and with no HVAC impacts.    
&gt;2. Indoor drying racks use no direct energy but do have an HVAC impact. The total energy impact is lower than any currently available dryer.    
&gt;3. A natural gas dryer is cheaper to operate and has lower environmental impacts than an
electric dryer.    
&gt;4. High washer spin speeds are more [energy] efficient than evaporating the water in the dryer.    
&gt;5. Drying full loads is more [energy] efficient than a larger number of partial loads.    
&gt;6. A “low heat” setting is more [energy] efficient than higher heat settings.    
&gt;7. A “less dry” setting is more [energy] efficient than “normal” or “more dry.” 

Note that I added the ""[energy]"" in there in a few points, because it is obvious from the context that is what they mean by the use of the word ""efficient"" -- which by itself is otherwise an ambiguous word (i.e. something can said to be more ""efficient"" if it gets the job done faster -- so to a consumer a machine that lets them do 5 full loads within 2 hours will be more ""efficient"" than one that only does 3 loads in the same time period.)

c8726,"I would say the high heat would be more efficient. 

Drying clothes is just a phase change from liquid to gas. The total energy required to evaporate the water would be the same regardless of the setting. The energy required would just depend on the initial temperature of the clothes, the amount of water in the clothes, the specific heat of water (4.186 kJ/kg K) and the heat of vaporization for water (2260 kJ/kg). 

Lets say we have m=5 kg of water in our clothes close to room temp, To=300K. We need to heat the water to Tb=373K, the boiling point of water at STP, since we are in an open system to the atmosphere. 
We need 4.186 kJ/KgK x m x [Tb-To]=1,527.89 KJ to raise the temp up to boiling point of water. Now we need 2260 kJ/kg x m=11,300 kJ to vaporize the water. In total, 12,827.89 kJ or 35.76 kWh of energy is needed to evaporate the water.

If you assume that the dryer for both cycles is able to heat the water to the boiling point and the  rate of heat absorption to be the same for both cycles, the only thing that matters is the duration of which the motors run to spin the drum and blower. Therefore, the high heat setting would be more efficient.

What really would save energy reducing the amount of water in your clothes. A high speed spin cycle or a centrifugal dryer thats extracts a higher percentage of the water out would save much more energy than selecting a heat setting. ",null,2,cdnev36,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,2

This additional air that must be heated, and there is no guarantee that all of it will be water-saturated by the time it is expelled, but the act of venting air can also help promote evaporation.  The amount of energy lost due to venting is proportional to the dryers temperature and the flow rate of the air, and the amount of energy lost due to thermal radiation is also proportional to the dryers temperature difference with the ambient air due to the first law of thermodynamics.  Reducing the temperature setting would reduce both of theses losses for any given moment, though the drying period would significantly increase due to the associated drop in vapor pressure.  However, without a better understanding of the effects of ambient humidity on evaporation, or of the efficiency of the electronic components at low output I am reluctant to say for certain.",null,20,cdnb7zo,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,84
BigWiggly1,"There are a lot of factors brought up by ThePsuedoMonkey's comment, and I recommend reading through his comment as well.

I'm going to go with a bit of gut instinct and tell you **no**. I will proceed by first explaining relative humidity, followed by how the dryer is working, and finally returning to the answer of your question.

For water to evaporate, the air it's in contact with needs to be able to hold it. The air's ability to hold it is measured as it's **Relative Humidity (RH)**. As heat is added to the air, its relative humidity decreases and it can hold more water.
Additionally, the lower the RH of the air is, the more quickly the water is able to evaporate. As water vapour saturates the air, the RH goes up and it becomes more and more difficult for that volume of air to pick up more water (Imagine it's arms are full and the more full they get, the more stuff they drop each time they bend over to pick up something new. Eventually it drops water just as fast as it picks it up).

Dryers work by taking air from the outside (ambient air), raising it's temperature, and circulating it through the dryer before sending it back out through the lint screen. The dryer would work, albeit rather slowly, without heating the air. Ambient air is usually not at 100% RH, so it can still hold more water. Lets say you put your clothes in for 60 minutes. At high heat, that's enough to dry them to your liking. At no heat (tumble only), they may still feel damp. Lets rule that out as not an option, because you've got somewhere to be in an hour and your favourite pants just got out of the washer.

By heating the air, the RH of the inlet air to the dryer is lowered as it's temperature rises, giving it the ability to hold more water (I guess it has bigger arms?). This means that for every volume of air that goes through the dryer, more water comes out with it. Additionally this helps to speed up the last bits of drying, where there isn't much water left. Warmer air will also heat the clothes, giving the water some extra energy to boost themselves into the vapour state so it can be carried off. Without heat, the last bits of water are simply too cold to evaporate quickly enough.

To address the energy efficiency:

Heating requires a lot of energy. Any heating process is a fairly inefficient process. Resistor heating elements are good at what they do, but nobody ever claims for them to be efficient. Moving air on the other hand is relatively easy to do (as long as you clean your lint screen). It's much more efficient to pump a volume of fluid (air) than it is to heat that same volume.

In the first stages of drying, there is so much water on the clothes that regardless of how warm the air is, it will saturate with water. There's simply an excess of water. This may make you say ""So lets heat it even more and it'll take more out with each chunk of air right?"" Yes, you are right. *Instead though*, we know it's cheaper to move air than it is to heat it, so let's be patient and let the moving air do it's work. In fact dryers would be more efficient if they increased the air flowrate in the early stages of the drying cycle, and decreased the heating requirements.

As mentioned earlier, in the last stages of drying when there isn't much water, warmer air is able to force water out of it's little microscopic nooks and crannies by giving it more energy. At this point, air circulation isn't as important because there isn't enough water in the clothes to saturate the air that's in there anyways. Now, air circulation is only to prevent overheating that could cause a fire hazard. Still, every bit of air that gets heated and then vented too soon is a waste of energy.

So now that we've covered what is good at the early and late stages of drying, we can make general statements on what the most efficient dryer would do: Start out on low heat with high circulation, followed by a steady increase of heat until finishing while the air flowrate is decreased proportionally to the temperature, but always above a minimum flowrate to prevent overheating.

Since I don't know about any of these fancy dryers on the market, and most people are tempted to use the timed dry options rather than an auto-dry option (which uses an RH or moisture sensor to determine when to stop drying), I will say that it is most efficient to stick to the least amount of heat necessary to get your clothes to a satisfactory level of dryness, because heating is the most inefficient process in your dryer.

As a good compromise between length of cycle and heating required, **use medium heat**. I've noticed that medium heat often doesn't take noticeably longer than a high heat cycle, and does the job well enough.

Alternatively, if you're looking to be the most efficient you could dry on low and manually increase the temperature every 15 minutes or so.

If you're a dryer manufacturer and reading this, consider making the auto-dry cycle adjust airflow and temperature based on the RH leaving the dryer (based on the sensor already in the installation). ",null,2,cdne9bx,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,13
RabidRabb1t,"This all depends on what you mean by ""efficient.""  Since I can just hang my clothes up and watch them dry (although it takes some time), the application of any extra heat that I then shunt outdoors is clearly wasteful.

If by efficient, you mean in terms of the product your time waiting and cost of drying (economic efficiency), that's a slightly more interesting question.  There are two things to consider: first, that the energy required to vaporize the water in your clothes from room temperature is essentially a constant.  Secondly, the rate of energy transfer is related to the temperature difference between the air and the clothes by an exponential function.  Now, if you keep running hot air over your clothes at a constant rate, relying on the efficiency of energy transfer, we can now figure out the function form of our economic efficiency.
  
Assuming you charge an hourly rate, the opportunity cost to you is simply your rate, R, times the amount of time, time, that it takes to dry your clothes.  The cost to you on your electric bill is the time it takes to dry your clothes multiplied by your power company's rate, P, and the rate of energy usage, E.  Since resistive heating is ~100%, we're going to make the approximation that E proportional to the amount you heated your clothing up.  The only thing left is how much time it takes as a function of temperature (exponential).

So, you're left with:

cost = R * [1/[exp(E)]^2 * P * E

where time is 1/[exp(E)].

Since this function goes to zero very fast, the short answer is that yes, higher temperatures are good for your wallet.  Please note that I did leave out a massive fudge factor, namely that the amount of waste heat is also going to increase in this model since I did not actually bother to take the integral of the exponential; however, the point remains.

LWRellim,"Per [this study (see page 11)](http://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2010/data/papers/2206.pdf) a “low heat” setting is more efficient than higher heat settings. 

However, the energy usage difference is not as large as most may think -- what the ""high heat"" setting mostly achieves is apparently just a (slightly) shorter drying time -- and the additional energy expended to heat is offset by the fact that the machine itself (and thus the fan/airflow) runs for a shorter time.

The study includes the following recommendations:

&gt;**Advice to Consumers**

&gt;Consumers can dry clothes with less energy by using (in order of energy savings):    

&gt;1. Outdoor clothes lines get clothes dry using no energy and with no HVAC impacts.    
&gt;2. Indoor drying racks use no direct energy but do have an HVAC impact. The total energy impact is lower than any currently available dryer.    
&gt;3. A natural gas dryer is cheaper to operate and has lower environmental impacts than an
electric dryer.    
&gt;4. High washer spin speeds are more [energy] efficient than evaporating the water in the dryer.    
&gt;5. Drying full loads is more [energy] efficient than a larger number of partial loads.    
&gt;6. A “low heat” setting is more [energy] efficient than higher heat settings.    
&gt;7. A “less dry” setting is more [energy] efficient than “normal” or “more dry.” 

Note that I added the ""[energy]"" in there in a few points, because it is obvious from the context that is what they mean by the use of the word ""efficient"" -- which by itself is otherwise an ambiguous word (i.e. something can said to be more ""efficient"" if it gets the job done faster -- so to a consumer a machine that lets them do 5 full loads within 2 hours will be more ""efficient"" than one that only does 3 loads in the same time period.)

c8726,"I would say the high heat would be more efficient. 

Drying clothes is just a phase change from liquid to gas. The total energy required to evaporate the water would be the same regardless of the setting. The energy required would just depend on the initial temperature of the clothes, the amount of water in the clothes, the specific heat of water (4.186 kJ/kg K) and the heat of vaporization for water (2260 kJ/kg). 

Lets say we have m=5 kg of water in our clothes close to room temp, To=300K. We need to heat the water to Tb=373K, the boiling point of water at STP, since we are in an open system to the atmosphere. 
We need 4.186 kJ/KgK x m x [Tb-To]=1,527.89 KJ to raise the temp up to boiling point of water. Now we need 2260 kJ/kg x m=11,300 kJ to vaporize the water. In total, 12,827.89 kJ or 35.76 kWh of energy is needed to evaporate the water.

If you assume that the dryer for both cycles is able to heat the water to the boiling point and the  rate of heat absorption to be the same for both cycles, the only thing that matters is the duration of which the motors run to spin the drum and blower. Therefore, the high heat setting would be more efficient.

What really would save energy reducing the amount of water in your clothes. A high speed spin cycle or a centrifugal dryer thats extracts a higher percentage of the water out would save much more energy than selecting a heat setting. ",null,2,cdnev36,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,2

Alright, we have a black hole of 1 Earth Mass.

&gt;Apparently it would evaporate really fast from your outside frame of reference.

Not really. The lifetime of a Schwarzschild black hole with the mass of the Earth would be about 500 trillion trillion trillion trillion years (as measured by those of us far from the event horizon for the duration).

&gt;But how could any effect pass over the event horizon to reduce the mass of the blackhole?

Nothing necessarily crosses the event horizon; rather, the curvature of spacetime near (but outside) the event horizon produces (nearly) thermal radiation that can be intercepted by those of us far from the black hole. In this process, the spacetime curvature relaxes, manifesting in a decrease in the surface area of the event horizon: the black hole shrinks.

One can, with suitable constructions, model this behavior as a tunneling process whereby particles from inside the event horizon tunnel out; this is analogous to other tunneling behavior wherein particles traverse a classically impenetrable barrier due to quantum mechanical effects.

&gt; I know that things can pass over the EH from their own reference frame - but not from an outside frame.

In fact they *can* cross into the black hole, even in a far-removed frame.

In order to melt, the ice must be raised to its melting point temperature, then given enough energy to melt into liquid. This energy needs to come from somewhere. Heat moves from hotter to colder places, so the warm air will give energy to the ice (and water) until they are the same temperature. 

There are some complications in calculating all this, however. For example, if the air is stagnant then it will get colder as it gives up energy, which means transfer to the sculpture will slow down.

lucaxx85,"You need to distingush three applications: 
1)analog signals in home setups
2)digital signals in home setups
3) live concert signals and similars...

For 1) everything works. Including coat hangers (for the power signals. You need shielding for line ones). The resistence and the impedence of such cables are such that they cannot affect in any way the final signal, which has a very low bandwidth. Only thing to be careful is to have cables large enough for the amp-speaker connection, if you have a very high power system (but I'd guess that you can still forget about this in any practical situation). 

2) Digital signals are more complicated. The bandwidth here is much higher, especially if you're also carrying video. That's why you have maximum lenghts and building them needs lots of care. Still almost any commercial cable is good if you're not trying to do something you shouldn't (e.g.: a 10 meters HDMI connection). In these case of course a 15'000 $ cable made from the finest rhodesian zinc, soldered in a full moon night by an african zoroastrian priest would work as badly as the cheapest one in the store.

3) For concerts and other applications cables can give actual problems. Still not those ""lamented"" by audiophiles. The first thing you look for in a concert cable is the *mechanical* resistance, especially of the connectors. Most of the cables break for a mechanical injury! Those things get torn everywhere. 
Then there is a problem with microphones/guitars signals. They're *extremely* weak. So they're sensitive to interferences. But, like before, those cables that claim to feature platinum in their alloy or even to have a special cristalline structure that favours the signal in a specific direction (how on earth would that work??!?!??!!) won't make *any* difference.

Dyson201,"Not exactly an Audio Engineer, but this isn't a difficult question from a signals standpoint.

Transferring signals through a medium (cable) can pose a variety of challenges that are handled in many different ways.  Without going into extreme detail lets just say that electromagnetic forces could possibly come into play, as well as capacitance to ground producing noise in the circuit, etc. etc.

Long story short, if you're replacing a 3' cable for sound, I highly doubt you'll notice a huge dip in quality between $100 cables and coat hangers.  Both are capable of transferring the signal, and while the expensive cable will transfer the signal with a much greater Signal to Noise ration (SNR), at 3' and with modern noise abatement technology, you would be hard pressed to hear a difference.

Now that being said, I wouldn't wire up your home surround system with soldered together coat hangers, as distance plays a huge factor in the quality of the transmitted signal.  Also, if you buy a cheap ass sound system, expect to hear a big difference in quality between expensive and poor cables, even at 3'.  

Finally, audio quality sound is a very low frequency, and does not travel well over distances with a good SNR.  Quality cables are the only way to increase sound quality over distances (relative term, we're talking meters here not miles).  Technology has come a long way towards discerning the signal from the noise, but any reduction in noise is a huge positive in the quality of the signal.",null,11,cdn6sul,1rgzbv,askscience,top_week,6
generalelectrix,"This is a very vague question.

For digital signals, yes this does matter.  Digital audio signals require significantly higher bandwidth and run at higher frequencies than the audio content they encode, so transmission line effects become important.  If the characteristic impedance of the cable you use to transmit a digital signal is not matched to the source and destination, you can get partial reflections or standing waves on the cable, which can definitely cause errors in the reconstructed signal at the destination.  This becomes more important with longer cables.

For analog signals, the frequency is low enough that the characteristic impedance isn't really important.  So long as the conductors you're using are low-resistance (copper is great), coat hangers should work just as well as fancy cable.  Shielding in cables is important for line-level interconnects to prevent the cables from picking up noise from the environment, though this usually isn't too big of a problem in a home environment.

The only real exception to this is for speaker cables (carrying post-amplifier level signals) for electrostatic speakers, as the load they present to the driving amplifier is largely capacative.  Then the details of the impedance of the cable driving the speaker become a bit more important.

Technically, yes. But the technical definition of temperature isn't what you think it is. More on that in a moment. 

Absolute zero is exactly the same as zero Kelvin. 

Who told you that the temperature of a black hole is absolute zero? That's certainly not correct. In fact, it's not possible for any matter to be at a temperature of exactly zero kelvin, due to the zero-point motion inherent in quantum mechanics. We can get incredibly close in a laboratory (somewhere in the range of hundreds of picoKelvin) but it's not possible to attain exactly zero kelvin. 

As for negative temperature: the colloquial understanding of temperature is something like ""temperature is the average kinetic energy of the constituent particles in a material."" That's a very useful tool for intuitively understanding things like heat capacity, but it's not the ""real"" definition. In thermodynamics, temperature is defined as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect to entropy (not sure how to format that symbolically, so I won't try). There are some kinda-convoluted, not-entirely-realistic examples of physical scenarios with negative temperature. That is, you add a bit of energy to the system, and the entropy goes down. For example, suppose you have N light switches, and each ""quanta"" of energy is represented as turning on one light switch. The entropy of a system is related to the number of configurations (microstates) that lead to the same macroscopic result, so let's say that you have N-1 switches turned on. Then the entropy is, more or less, N (since there are N ways to have N-1 switches turned on in a collection on N switches). Now you add one ""quanta"" of energy and turn on the last light switch. How many microstates are there now? Only one. There's exactly one way to have N out of N light switches turned on. Since we added a unit of energy and saw the entropy decrease, the system could be said to have ""negative temperature"" if you like. There are physical systems that come close to this analogy, but I think the ""light bulb scenario"" is easier to digest.",null,2,cdn51ib,1rgv22,askscience,top_week,9

MonadicTraversal,"&gt; Any faster or slower, closer or farther, or difference in direction of travel and the body would de-orbit, spiralling toward the planet or star it's orbiting or flinging off into outer space.

Spiral orbits don't actually exist under inverse-square forces such as gravity; you can show that the only possible orbits are circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. Spiral orbits don't exist except if there's some kind of drag force or whatever dissipating energy from the system; on an interplanetary scale drag doesn't matter.

The molecules of hot air will bounce around a lot more than the cold, and sometimes they're going to bounce up.  When they do, the less active cold air is more likely to fall into the gap than to move in another direction, and now there's nowhere for that hot air molecule to go because it will only bounce off the cold air molecule if it bounces downward again.

In FWD cars, the front wheels are doing both the steering and applying the engine torque to the road.  And RWD, the rear wheels are only applying that torque to the road.  Essentially, your fwd cars are 'pulling' while rwd are 'pushing'.  

As you drive down a straight road, you are applying longitudinal force to the road to propel you forward.  As you enter a curve in the road, you add a rotational component to your travel.  The center of mass of the vehicle has to move laterally through the curve, while the vehicle itself has to rotate about that center of mass in order to be pointed straight as you exit the curve.  With a fwd vehicle, the direction of the force applied to the road by the tires changes as you turn your steering wheel, and the back wheels will follow in that path. Fwd vehicles have a tendency to understeer.  An object in motion wants to stay in motion: the inertia of the car in the longitudinal direction makes it want to keep going straight.  The tires want to follow the path on which they are pointed.  If the lateral acceleration into the curve cannot overcome the forward inertia, the car will understeer, or take a path with a larger radius than the curve.  In a rwd vehicle, the the tendency is to oversteer, or turn at a smaller radius than the curve.  This is because the force on the road by the rear wheels is along the path of the vehicles inertia.  The front wheels will want to follow their path around the curve, but the rear wheels will want to keep going straight.  This means it is easier to rotate about the center of mass.

Merrilin,"Anything with a temperature (a.k.a. all matter) is constantly emitting **blackbody radiation**. 

You can think of temperature of an object as being proportional to how much each constituent atom vibrates. The more intense it's vibration, the hotter it is. The short of it is that this vibration causes the release of a photon, which carries with it some energy from the atom, decreasing it's temperature. More on that if I ever get home. 

It so happens that the hotter something is, the higher frequency radiation, on average, it emits. That's why a piece of metal visibly glows when you make it very hot. At room temperature it is emitting light at a range of frequencies, but almost none in the visible light range. As you make the piece of metal hotter, it's blackbody radiation in the visible light range becomes significant enough that a human eye can detect it.

thumbs55,"Excellent question.

First of all what is heat and what is temperature? Are they not the same thing?

[Heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) is a measure of thermal energy (measurable in joules like all energies), it can be a measure of the ammount of (highly disordere heat typed energy) energy moving from one body to another.

[Temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) is a measure of the hottness or coldness of a body, two bodies with the same temp will not exchange any net heat and if one body is hotter than the other then the hotter will give energy to the colder in the form of heat.

&gt;everything I can think of that has heat also has light. Stars, lightbulbs, lava, fire, hot metal,

This type of light is called [black body radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation).

&gt;Metal only emits light after it heats up past a certain temperature.

While it is true that the light becomes visible after a certain temperature is reached, the metal is actually always emitting invisible ""light"" (electromagnetic radiation) at any finite temperature due to said black body radiation.

All of space has [Cosmic microwave background radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) which gives ""empty"" space a temperature. (It is not empty of [real] particles if you include the photons giving it said temperature).

The temperature of space (away from stars and such) is around 3 kelvin, so if you have something hotter than that it in space will get colder and if you have something colder than that it will actually warm up.

The heat energy is often stored in the energy of the jiggling of molecules. But for it to move from one place to another it mainly moves in the form of photons (light) but also phonons (sound). If you engineered a particularly exotic system that only exchanged energy in phonons then this system would emit heat with no light.

Nutrenos are also an example of a form of heat (they carry energy from the sun in a manner that is not work) nutrenos are not light. But many forms of nutreno generation would also produce photons.",null,1,cdmyhyr,1rg6wj,askscience,top_week,4

therationalpi,"Basically a whistle is a resonator. You either have a Helmholtz resonator (like a beer bottle) or a standing wave resonator (like an organ pipe).

Driving the resonator is the variable airflow through the whistle. In most whistles you will have a hole with a blade shaped edge on it. When the edge is blown on, it creates turbulent airflow in the form of vortexes. These vortexes alternate from side to side in what is called a ""vortex street."" There's a good picture of that [here.](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/Acoustics/code/adpac/sample/CYLINDER_VORTEX_SHEDDING/) The alternating vortexes create a varying positive and negative acoustic pressure, setting up a wave in the resonator. The resonator, as a result, forces the frequency of the vortexes to align with the whistle's natural frequency. In this way the whistle amplifies the normally irregular vortex variations into a sound loud enough to be heard at a distance.

The reason you must blow at the correct angle is that the flow vortexes will depend greatly on how the moving air stream hits the blade. You must hit the wedge shaped part of the whistle fast enough to create unstable flow, otherwise the wave will not be generated.

PeeSherman,"First let's explain the science behind a ""note"". A note is just a name given to a particular frequency of air vibrations, which is what gives that note its tone. For example, an A in the middle of the piano in standard tuning is nothing more than a vibration at 440 Hz, meaning when that key is pressed on the piano, a hammer strikes a string that naturally vibrates 440 times a second, which makes the air around it vibrate at 440 times a second - a vibration that propagates through the air to your ear.
Using that same A as an example, on the piano 12 keys to the right, there is another ""A"", this one an octave higher. It is an octave higher because that string naturally vibrates at twice the frequency (880 Hz - 880 times a second), which vibrates the air around it at 880 Hz, which is the vibration that reaches your ear.
To summarize: an octave is a relationship between two sound frequencies (or rates of vibration) in which the relationship is 2:1. A 200 Hz tone is the octave up from a 100 Hz tone.
Interestingly, 2:1 is the simplest geometric mathematical relationship, giving us the most innately stable/consonant musical tone relationship - the octave. Deriving further, 3:2 relationship between frequencies gives us the ""perfect fifth"", the second most innately stable tone relationship. Flipping the relationship (2:3) gives us the ""perfect fourth"" which is a perfect fifth in the opposite direction. 4:3 gives us the 3rd and 6th and so on. The tritone, an extremely dissonant interval that the Catholic Church actually banned at one point in time calling it the devil's interval, has a very ugly mathematical relationship that I cannot recall at the moment.

drzowie,"It all boils down to a mathematical concept called ""Fourier transformation"".  This guy named Fourier figured out how to turn any series of values (like the pressure in air at subsequent points in time) into a collection of pitches.  That turns out to be extremely useful for many things.  

One of the cool things about Fourier transformation is that any *repeating* waveform is just the sum of several pure tones *at integer multiples of the base frequency*.  A flute makes a pure(ish) tone, but a horn making the same note sounds quite different.  The difference is that the horn sound has the main tone mixed in with overtones at integer harmonics (2x the base frequency, 3x, 4x, etc.).   It's worth repeating:  **any complex waveform (a pitch with ""timbre"") is just the sum of pure pitches at integer multiples of a base frequency!**.

So your auditory system has adapted to treat multiple frequencies separated by an integer factor as parts of the same complex tone.  That's good, since it's usually true -- if you have a bunch of random noises around you, most of them won't happen to share any integer harmonics:  two notes that are exactly an integer multiple apart are almost certainly part of the same tone.

There are some exceptions to that rule.  In particular, some devilish fellow might be playing a *chord* on a musical instrument.  Chords are auditory puns.  For example, a C major chord is middle-C, middle-E, and middle-G.  Those notes happen to have the frequency ratio 1 : 5/4 : 3/2.  Multiply all those numbers by 4 and you get the sequence 4:5:6 -- all the notes in the C chord happen to be multiples of another note with a much lower tone!  Whoah. In this case, the lower tone happens to be C two octaves down.  Your auditory system identifies the chord as part of a single complex sound at the much lower pitch -- even if that pitch doesn't actually exist in the music.

That's the basic theory of chords and pitches mixing.  The pitch scale is a *logarithmic* scale -- each step up or down the scale *multiplies* frequency by a certain amount.  Going up or down an octave multiplies or divides by 2.  The reason that notes an octave apart sound like ""the same note"" is that they are so closely harmonically related -- practically every sound around you contains a base pitch and its second harmonic.  If you listen carefully, you can also get that same ""sameness"" from a note and the fifth-interval an octave up.  A fifth interval is a ratio of 3/2 in frequency, so a fifth and an octave gives you a ratio of 3.  Since it's an integer ratio (not a fraction), the two notes (say, C-below-middle, and middle-G) have a little of the ""sameness"" that you normally associate with octaves only.  But octaves have so much of that ""same"" sound that we give notes an octave apart the same name.

Now -- why are octaves ""octaves"", and why are there exactly 12 half-steps in an octave?  That's because of something called the ""circle of fifths"", which musicians frequently mutter about (and which you can google for more information if you're not one).  The easiest way to construct a scale is by starting with a base note somewhere (say, A-440, but any frequency will do), and then constructing third harmonics of it.  Each time you go up in frequency a factor of 3, you get a nice harmony (the octave-and-a-fifth).  Then you fold the new note downward by octaves until it is within a factor of 2 of the original frequency, and start over.  If you do that 12 times you'll create 12 separate notes, and arrive *almost* back where you started -- 1.36% higher in pitch than the original note.  That's really discordant if you play it next to the original note, but if you tweak each of your derived notes ever so slightly, you can sort of smooth things out so that all the frequencies work right to form new chords with one another.  You'l find that you created exactly 12 notes and defined the half-step scale.  But you had to fudge the frequencies, because you had to sweep the discord under the sonic rug somewhere.  This is reasonable not just for aesthetic reasons but because, if you didn't know the math, you might think you'd just screwed up the tripling step a tiny bit each time.  When people say the Western scale is based on a lie, this is the lie they mean: the circle of fifths cannot work perfectly, because no matter how many times you multiply your original frequency by 3, you will never arrive at a power of 2 -- but you can fudge it if you're close enough. 

Through the ages there have been several different ""temperaments"" used, in which people tweaked the notes of the 12 tone circle of fifths in various different ways, to try to make particular chords sound particularly good -- at the expense of other chords.  These days, we use an ""equal-tempered"" scale where each half step is exactly a factor of 2^1/12 above the previous one.  If you're playing a bendable instrument (like the flute, the trombone, the violin, or the human voice) and you are a good musician, you will unconsciously tune each note slightly higher or lower depending on the chordal context of your particular note, to harmonize better with the rest of the orchestra.  You *can't* bend the notes on a piano, which is why pianos have multiple strings singing each note -- it fuzzes out the resonance of each note, so it's harder for your ears to pick out the harmonic discrepancies.  (There are *three* strings so you can't hear the slightly-detuned strings beating, as you could if there were just *two*.  The bass bridge usually has two strings per note, but by the time you get down there the resonances are so cruddy that you can't really hear the beating anyway).

The 8 primary notes (A-G) you can get by stepping *once* forward on the circle of fifths and and *once* backward, to get three notes separated by fifth intervals (for example, F-below-middle, middle-C, and middle-G).  If you create major chords for each of those three notes (and fold all those new notes into a single octave), you'll find that there are 8 unique pitches, which are the pitches of the major scale.  That's why we call it an ""octave"" - oct for 8.  Since going down a fifth (and folding into the main octave) is the same as going up a fourth interval, you can immediately see why IV,V,I and similar chord progressions are so common in Western music -- they're the very basis of our musical scale.

Incidentally, not everyone agrees on that scale.  The equal-tempered Western scale can generate harmonic sequences up to 7/8 of the original (if you play a C7 chord with the low G and two lower C's, you are playing the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and ~7 harmonics of the lowest C).  But any higher harmonics fall between the notes.  Middle-eastern and Indian music uses higher harmonics, and therefore has lots of quarter-step or smaller intervals that sound strange to our ears.  The German tradition calls that 7/8 harmonic of C by its own special name - 'H', as the next note after G, a fact Johann Sebastian Bach exploited by working his own name (BACH) into a counterpoint line in his last great composition.

Das_Mime,"&gt;I recall reading something along the lines of observing the orbit of any natural satellite of the object, but a more detailed explanation would be nice. 

If you can see a natural satellite of the object and you can reasonably assume the satellite to have much much lower mass than the planet*, then you can use mechanics to work out the host's mass. In this case I'll also assume a circular orbit, but you can also work out the mass from non-circular orbits.

The force of the planet's gravity on the moon is **F = G m*_p_* m*_m_* / r^(2)** where G is the gravitational constant, r is the orbital radius, and the m's are the masses of planet and moon. In the case of  circular motion, the force on the moon is equal to **F = m*_m_* v^(2) / r** where v is the orbital velocity of the moon. Set these forces equal to each other, and you get:

**G m*_p_* m*_m_* / r^(2) = m*_m_* v^(2) / r**

Canceling out common factors, you get

**m*_p_*  = v^(2) r / G** 

So if you know the distance of the planet and it has a moon (which for Solar System objects can be readily obtained via parallax methods), then you can directly calculate the planet's mass. 

Calculating the mass of a body without natural satellites is a bit more work. Prior to the Space Age, Venus and Mercury's masses were not well constrained, because the best way to measure mass is to measure its gravitational effect on other objects. Venus also exerts a gravitational influence on other planets such as the Earth, and so if you have sufficiently accurate position measurements of both bodies and if you know Earth's mass then you can calculate Venus's mass, but this is still not an ideal method.

Our best measurements of Venus' mass come primarily from spacecraft like the Mariners 2, 5, &amp; 10 (American) and Venera (Soviet) probes sent to Venus. [From analyzing their trajectories](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1968AJS....73R.162A)--some of them were flybys, some were orbiters (e.g. Soviet Venera 15 &amp; 16, American Magellan and ESA *Venus Express*), and some have landed on the surface--you can determine Venus' mass to a high level of accuracy, but in the end this is essentially the same method as the first-- measuring the planet's tug on nearby objects. 

Finally, you can make guesses at the composition of Venus, and since its radius is easily measured with a telescope, you can get an estimate of its mass. This is much less accurate, of course, since it depend entirely on the accuracy of your guess about the composition.

Ejb90,"Even for the simplified case of a planet-star system there are a few ways to find the mass of a planet. I'll describe a common one, [Astrometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrometry).

From observations we can usually deduce the distance of the star from earth, the ""apparent magnitude"" (how bright it is to us) and the spectral class - what types of elements it's made up of by looking at the light received.
We can also find the period of orbit of the planet around the star by several methods - the transit method is most popular, though the Doppler shift method and others are used dependent on the circumstances).
The next part is the difficult part. The velocity of the star wobbling backwards and forwards must be measured. 
The planet doesn't actually orbit a stationary star - they both orbit their combined centre of gravity, though for the star, which is much more massive, this is relatively close to its centre of gravity. Hence the star itself wobbles backwards and forwards. This speed can be measured from earth via the doppler effect - the light when the star is shifting towards us is shifted slightly up in frequency and then when it is moving away gets shifted down slightly. This can be used to calculate the speed.

From the distance and apparent magnitude we can calculate the ""absolute magnitude"" - how bright it it from a standard distance (30ly IIRC). Using these and some hefty thermodynamics/ fluid mechanics/ stellar structure knowledge (or the simplified [mass-luminosity relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93luminosity_relation) or extrapolating roughly from the [Hertzsprung-Russell diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram)) to find the mass of the star.
Also from the period of or it we can use Kepler's third law to find the radius of orbit.
Now, the speed of the body can be calculated as the distance it travels and the time it takes is known, and the speed and the mass of the star are known.
Finally these can be used with the conservation of momentum to calculate the mass of the planet.

This technique has several issues. Firstly, this only gives a lower limit, as the orbit may not be head on, so the star may be moving faster than expected. Also, some of the measurements needed aren't possible in some cases. Also, it must be noted that Kepler's laws and the mass determination of the star isn't exact. Finally the issue of having more than one body in the system. Because there are a large amount of bodies in the system, the equations aren't analytically solvable, so there is some error in the determination process.

The mass of moons we can observe is calculated much in the same way, using the planet as the main mass.
I'm not sure what you read about observing moons of planets. This certainly isn't possible with exoplanets - we're only just on the verge of being able to see the very biggest exoplanets as off this year.

hikaruzero,"It's pretty simple -- photons alone aren't the cause of attraction/repulsion.  It is the *fields themselves* that cause charged objects to attract or repel eachother.  Photons are created when charges accelerate, but if you have a bunch of stationary charges and no actual photons, those charges will still begin to accelerate and attract or repel eachother without emitting or absorbing any photons amongst themselves.

In the context of perturbative theories, this effect can be explained by saying that the vacuum is filled with virtual photons, and that the virtual photons end up exerting a force on the stationary charges.  But virtual photons are not detectable the way real photons are, and also virtual particles do not appear in non-perturbative treatments of electrodynamics, so it is something of a matter of debate whether they even exist at all (indeed in the theory of the strong force, perturbative calculations frequently end up being *wrong*).  Virtual particles can be thought of as simply a mathematical tool for calculating approximate answers -- it's best to just say it is the *fields* that cause charges to accelerate.

Now, real photons themselves are *disturbances* of the fields, and if the fields change, that will cause a change to the acceleration of a charged object, so real (detectable) photons *do* accelerate charged objects, but strictly speaking it is the field that is ""doing the work,"" the presence of photons isn't necessary for attraction and repulsion -- it's not like there have to be a bunch of photons flying around from one particle to the next in order for charged objects to accelerate (though if they are flying around and being absorbed or emitted, they will change how those charged objects are moving via transfers of momentum).

So it's the fields that do the acceleration, whether you want to interpret fields as being made up of virtual particles is something of a matter of philosophy, and not something that experiment can tell us is definitely true or false.

aziridine86,"Wikipedia is an OK place to start, but I believe that the most basic answer to the 'why' question is this:

The hydrocarbons that we get from the earth come in a huge variety from gases like methane, ethane, and propane, all the way to thick waxes and tars. 

Because of the prevalence of internal combustion engines used in cars, trucks, planes, etc., we have a much higher demand for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel than for other hydrocarbons which are heavier or lighter. 

Cracking is one way we can turn less desirable hydrocarbons like high-boiling petroleum into more desirable products such as those used in gasoline. 

If your talking specifically about using kerosene as the feed stock, then the products will contain larger amounts of small (C2-C5) products. For example, [this](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/i200024a026?journalCode=iepdaw) paper (full text not free) says that cracking of kerosene yielded significant amounts of ethene, propene, butene, and butadiene.

sparky_1966,"DNA alone can't determine what a cell does, you can think of it as storing information. That information can be turned into RNA, some of which regulates genes, proteins and a few specific reactions. The proteins handle most of the actual work.

So, in the simples example if a bacteria that can use multiple sugar types for energy is sitting in an environment that has no lactose sugar, it usually doesn't waste energy making enzymes to break it down. If suddenly lactose becomes available, a receptor protein can bind the lactose and either activate transcription of lactose digesting enzyme from the DNA, or more commonly in bacteria, change shape and fall off the DNA, allowing the gene to be expressed. As the enzymes break down all the lactose, eventually the receptor protein wont have any to bind to, and will switch shape again to turn off the gene. There are many other levels of regulation, but that's the simplest example.

As far as viruses, there are a number of different strategies they use to take over a cell. Almost never is it just a piece of naked DNA floating around, since the environment and cells are full of enzymes to destroy those fragments. Probably the easiest system to understand is a DNA virus with a protein coat. The protein coat protects the DNA, but also makes sure it gets delivered. The protein is usually shaped to bind to the bacteria or cell it infects. On binding, the proteins change shape and make a path through the cell membrane for the DNA to get in. There is energy stored in the shape of the protein and the winding of the DNA (taken from the last cell) that allows injection of the DNA without other sources of energy. Once in the cell, the DNA gets replicated and transcribed in to viral proteins and more viruses like any other DNA. That's the simple version, there are any number of different virus types, some use DNA, some RNA, some large viruses carry most of the proteins they need to begin replicating so they can shut down most of the hosts protein production, etc.  ",null,1,cdmsir9,1rfooz,askscience,top_week,1

steeeeve,"If you had a rigid bottle, a difference in pressure would build up as you travel further into the ocean. This difference in pressure will cause greater net forces on the water at the mouth of the bottle, causing it to enter the bottle more rapidly. The amount that this happens will depend on some complex fluid dynamics, as the air needs to leave the bottle as well as the water entering it. 

If the bottle were pressurized with air so that the pressure was at equilibrium between the inside and outside of the bottle at the bottom of the ocean, then only the difference in buoyancy will cause the bottle to fill, similar to the case of a few feet of water. In this case, the amount of time would be similar for both cases, though perhaps not exactly the same due to changes in the viscosity of the water and air at those pressures.

The collapse of an air-filled bottle would depend on what kind of bottle is being used. For a typical soda bottle, the bottle can be collapsed just by sucking the air out of it (say, using your lungs).

First think of it in terms of fitness (this is always a good idea when navigating through these types of organismal biology questions).

With that in mind, try to think of why these birds have all grouped together and are ""chatting"" away.

Since these behaviors (phenotype) are important to the survival of the crow species, then they must have evolved via natural selection.

The HOW part of the question:
Birds calls have evolved for millions of years acted on by natural selection. The chirps, coos and shrieks you hear everyday are a product of that. Many birds have developed a communication system that allows them to recognize individual calls within that population. Much like humans can tell the difference between each others voices. Look at it from the birds perspective. Birds have very sensitive ears and a respiratory system with many airways that allows them to make the complex calls. Try not to fall into the ""anthropomorphism trap"". A large crowd of crowing birds in the eyes of a crow is very different than in the eyes of a human. A ""noisy crowd conversation"" from a humans perspective is loud and hard to decipher what an individual is saying (i.e. sporting events, concerts, etc.). This is not the case for birds. Some birds are able to pick up on some of the slightest changes in frequency to hear exactly who is calling and what the call is about (i.e. food, mate, predators, etc.). Many birds have a critical period during development where they learn specific calls usually unique to that  population. Some bird call are even genetically ""hardwired"" and do not require learning. Not all birds are social though and communication does vary from species. 

Last point:
Calling and crowing is not the only way birds communicate. A wide range of behavioral displays are used in junction with the calls in order to send a complete message to another bird (the receiver).

Unfortunately, the specificity in these antibiotics lies in the fact that we can't administer compounds that are toxic to human cells. Many antibiotics (like methicillin) are mildly toxic to us so they must be modified. That being said, it takes years and millions of dollars to come up with solutions to these problems. 

Edit: To touch on antibiotic resistance, and this is a very simple explanation; when bacteria are exposed to sublethal doses of antibiotic, selective pressure can cause a change in their genome, in which the most advantageous traits are passed on. This leads to strains of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and these bacteria can pass their advantageous genes on to other bacteria.

Also, some bacteria are totally resistant to many antibiotics simply by their biology (ie. the drug cannot interact with it, etc.), limiting the available options to only a few drugs.

Unfortunately, because we only have these limited points of difference, antibiotic use over time tends to lend itself to the selection of bacteria that are not able to be killed by these mechanisms. As these elements become more resistant, we have more and more limited options to further address this problem. It is further compounded by the fact that antibiotics are not specific to the pathogen you are trying to treat; to eliminate one infectious pathogen you bathe all of the other bacteria in your body with the same drug. Thus you don't just drive resistance of pathogenic bacteria but also harmless bacteria in your body that, under the right circumstances, may become harmful.

Visible light just happens to be the right energy to excite the electrons bound to atomic nuclei in some molecules, such as those making up chlorine gas. These excited electrons, which have been given energy by a photon, then relax to their original energies, giving off new photons of a particular wavelength (and therefore color).

Electrons are unusual in that, due to quantum effects, they can have only certain discrete energies. This is determined by the structure and composition of the atom, and its interactions with other nearby atoms. Gasses that are not colored do not have electron excitation mechanisms of the correct energy to be excited by visible light, then give off light of a specific color.

This makes the CO calculation more relative.  For instance the average CO for a adult male is 5.6L/min (the volume of blood ejected from the heart every minute).  Now we'll introduce two people. One man is 5'2"" (157cm) 105lbs (47kg) with a BSA of 1.44m^2.  The other is 6'6"" (198cm) 285lb (129kg) with a BSA of 2.67m^2.  If we just considered CO (stroke volume x heart rate) would it make intuitive sense that if both of these individuals had a CO of 5.6L/min that would be ok for both?  No, some form of individualization is necessary.  This is obtained by taking the CO and including the BSA into the calculation.  This measurement is called the cardiac index (CI).  Clinically/practically it serves a better purpose and indicator for monitoring hemodynamic states in controlled situations.  Using the examples above the first man would have a CI of 3.89L/min/m^2 and the second man would have a CI of 2.1L/min/m^2.  Considering the normal CI ranges from 2.6-4.2L/min/m^2 the man in the second scenario is about a hairs breadth away from cardiogenic shock.

Hopefully that helps shows the significance of BSA inclusion within a certain situation.  As for whether there are better alternative parameters I am unsure.

&gt; A: True. Most recent evidence shows that whichever oral emergency contraceptive drug is taken, the risk of pregnancy is more than 3 times greater for obese women (OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.96–6.53) and 1.5 times greater for overweight women (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.75–2.95).16 Of all covariates tested, those that were shown to increase the odds of failure of the emergency contraception were higher body mass index, further unprotected intercourse, and conception probability (based on time of fertility cycle). In fact, among obese women treated with levonorgestrel, the observed pregnancy rate was 5.8%, which is slightly above the overall pregnancy rate expected in the absence of emergency contraception, suggesting that for obese women levonorgestrel-based emergency contraception may even be ineffective.

&gt;This is in line with recent reports suggesting that oral contraceptives are less effective in obese women. More effective regimens such as an IUD or ulipristal might be preferred in these women.

As the air was heated it would attempt to expand. So, the air density would be less the closer you got to the heat source.

*Heat* is thermal energy, which means particles are wiggling around (faster wiggling = higher temperature). Heat moves across a thermal gradient from higher temperatures to lower, which means that, on average, particles that are moving around quickly transfer energy to particles that they interact with which are moving more slowly. In solid objects, this has nothing to do with gravity.

*Hot air* is what rises. Or any fluid that does not have homogenous temperature (so the same thing happens in water). Just like everything else it has to do with most energetically/statistically favorable condition, but suffice it to say gravity makes the more dense fluid (colder air) end up on the bottom while the less dense fluid (warmer air) moves upward, until it ends up with air of the same density. This is specifically because of gravity.

*Heat from the sun* is not properly heat while it's traveling through space. It's electromagnetic radiation, which is not thermal energy. It's energy propagating in the form of an oscillating electromagnetic field. It becomes heat as soon as some piece of matter absorbs it.

Convection heating is basically just air blowing across a heat source like a fan behind a radiator, and isn't relevant to your question. However, radiant heat is relevant.

**Conduction, Convection,** and **Radiation**

**Conduction**: the transference of heat through the physical particles interacting with each other. e.g. electric stove tops, iron rod feeling hot when on end is in a fire, burning your hand through direct contact.

**Convection**: what a lot of people above have referred to is the affect of air becoming less dense as it gets hotter (hotter air causes the particles to move faster, increase in speed causes a decrease in density). In a gravity environment this causes the air to rise (less dense air is located farther away from the surface due to lesser gravitational forces).  

I would argue in the candle example you would still get some form of convection due to movement, decreases in pressure around the candle... it would just not follow the normal convective flow. As oxygen particles are used and surrounding air heated it could be less dense than surrounding material thus causing **diffusion** to still be a critical role in moving the air from high pressure gradients to lower (this, of course, all depends on a huge number of factors)

Finally we have **Radiation**, all particles radiate energy according to their internal temperature (in kelvins).  This is approximated by [black body curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_body.svg), this curve estimates what energy is released based on your temperature.  For example: The sun transmits most of its energy in the visible spectrum due to the very high temperature.  The earth (average temperature 288K) also radiates almost exclusively in the infrared range due to its internal temperature being much lower.

These principals apply all the time in day to day activities. IR goggles for example because we radiate a thermal temperature in the form of radiation.

If this mass is continuous throughout with a high enough density to interact, the hottest stuff will probably ""rise"" compared to the cooler matter and form a spherical gradient assuming there's enough gravity to hold it together at all.  This particulate matter will probably behave like a fluid and that combined with enough gravity for observable effects gives you at least a gas giant or quite possibly a star.  At this point, you have to deal with much more variability than temperature.

Back to the original question, consider why there is a rising effect with heat. A hotter form of the same substance is going to be lower density and then has a higher probability to diffuse upward compared to the more dense form since there's less mass per unit of volume.

JSArrakis,"Some things need to be defined here first.

1. The thing you are defining as heat is the convection of atomic excitement from the air molecules around you to the molecules that make up your skin/body.

2. Everything has gravity. There is no such thing as a zero-gravity environment. It is a misnomer and a buzz word that the media likes to propagate. There are gravitational environments that are diminished (or strengthened) based on your location of adjacency and current escape velocity in relation to the object in question. For example, when you see astronauts in space that seem to appear weightless, this is just a scientific trick that scientists devised by means of calculating the speed a person or a ship needs to be to be able to move both sideways and 'down' at a speed that allows the person/ship to fall sideways around the object. This constant freefall around the object or ""orbit"" allows the person to seem weightless. If you slowed down your sideways velocity, youd start falling toward the earth, if you increased it, youd reach an escape velocity and no longer be in orbit. If you stopped your lateral velocity entirely, youd fall like a rock. 
The same goes for the sun, and all other bodies within the solarsystem. If there was no Earth, and you suddenly stopped orbiting the sun, youd fall like a rock toward the sun. If the Earth was still there and you and the earth both stopped lateral velocity, first youd fall toward the earth, because of its closer proximity, and then the earth would fall toward the sun. 
Every piece of matter in the universe has some level of gravitational pull. If it has mass, even very very small mass, it has gravity and pulls on all the things around it. 

3. Im going to assume youre talking about 'heat' in the form of convection in gasses.

The answer: Barring there are no outside influences, both gravitational and not, and in a vacuum, the gas will form a sphere due to all of the gas molecules acting upon each other. The within the sphere, the more excited molecules (the hottest) will travel toward the surface, while the least excited molecules will sink toward the middle. 

Consequently, the friction of the molecules interacting each other in the ""core"" of the gas bubble will heat them, while the molecules that rose to the surface will see less interaction and cause them to reduce their excitement and become ""cool"" again, which will make a circular flow within the gas sphere. This same mechanic is what causes wind and high and low pressure systems in weather here on earth.

Heat 'rises' from the wire in a sort of wake (just like a boat through water) but instead this wake consists of heated air flowing through cooler air.

The reason that free convection results in hot air 'rising' is because of the density difference between hot and cool air. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so gravity pulls more on the cool air than hot air, and the hot air floats to the top of the cool air. 

In space, the gravity that pulls more on cool air would not be present, so the heat would slowly expand from the surface in all directions away from the source of heat. This obviously has practical implications in that the heat collects around the source and can cause the source to overheat. Therefore it is necessary to mechanically push the air across the source of heat in order to generate the type of air flow that would normally be present when there were gravitational forces at work.*

As the air was heated it would attempt to expand. So, the air density would be less the closer you got to the heat source.

*Heat* is thermal energy, which means particles are wiggling around (faster wiggling = higher temperature). Heat moves across a thermal gradient from higher temperatures to lower, which means that, on average, particles that are moving around quickly transfer energy to particles that they interact with which are moving more slowly. In solid objects, this has nothing to do with gravity.

*Hot air* is what rises. Or any fluid that does not have homogenous temperature (so the same thing happens in water). Just like everything else it has to do with most energetically/statistically favorable condition, but suffice it to say gravity makes the more dense fluid (colder air) end up on the bottom while the less dense fluid (warmer air) moves upward, until it ends up with air of the same density. This is specifically because of gravity.

*Heat from the sun* is not properly heat while it's traveling through space. It's electromagnetic radiation, which is not thermal energy. It's energy propagating in the form of an oscillating electromagnetic field. It becomes heat as soon as some piece of matter absorbs it.

Convection heating is basically just air blowing across a heat source like a fan behind a radiator, and isn't relevant to your question. However, radiant heat is relevant.

**Conduction, Convection,** and **Radiation**

**Conduction**: the transference of heat through the physical particles interacting with each other. e.g. electric stove tops, iron rod feeling hot when on end is in a fire, burning your hand through direct contact.

**Convection**: what a lot of people above have referred to is the affect of air becoming less dense as it gets hotter (hotter air causes the particles to move faster, increase in speed causes a decrease in density). In a gravity environment this causes the air to rise (less dense air is located farther away from the surface due to lesser gravitational forces).  

I would argue in the candle example you would still get some form of convection due to movement, decreases in pressure around the candle... it would just not follow the normal convective flow. As oxygen particles are used and surrounding air heated it could be less dense than surrounding material thus causing **diffusion** to still be a critical role in moving the air from high pressure gradients to lower (this, of course, all depends on a huge number of factors)

Finally we have **Radiation**, all particles radiate energy according to their internal temperature (in kelvins).  This is approximated by [black body curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_body.svg), this curve estimates what energy is released based on your temperature.  For example: The sun transmits most of its energy in the visible spectrum due to the very high temperature.  The earth (average temperature 288K) also radiates almost exclusively in the infrared range due to its internal temperature being much lower.

These principals apply all the time in day to day activities. IR goggles for example because we radiate a thermal temperature in the form of radiation.

If this mass is continuous throughout with a high enough density to interact, the hottest stuff will probably ""rise"" compared to the cooler matter and form a spherical gradient assuming there's enough gravity to hold it together at all.  This particulate matter will probably behave like a fluid and that combined with enough gravity for observable effects gives you at least a gas giant or quite possibly a star.  At this point, you have to deal with much more variability than temperature.

Back to the original question, consider why there is a rising effect with heat. A hotter form of the same substance is going to be lower density and then has a higher probability to diffuse upward compared to the more dense form since there's less mass per unit of volume.

Mathematically you can see this in the [Navier Stokes Equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) if you look at the momentum equation.

JSArrakis,"Some things need to be defined here first.

1. The thing you are defining as heat is the convection of atomic excitement from the air molecules around you to the molecules that make up your skin/body.

2. Everything has gravity. There is no such thing as a zero-gravity environment. It is a misnomer and a buzz word that the media likes to propagate. There are gravitational environments that are diminished (or strengthened) based on your location of adjacency and current escape velocity in relation to the object in question. For example, when you see astronauts in space that seem to appear weightless, this is just a scientific trick that scientists devised by means of calculating the speed a person or a ship needs to be to be able to move both sideways and 'down' at a speed that allows the person/ship to fall sideways around the object. This constant freefall around the object or ""orbit"" allows the person to seem weightless. If you slowed down your sideways velocity, youd start falling toward the earth, if you increased it, youd reach an escape velocity and no longer be in orbit. If you stopped your lateral velocity entirely, youd fall like a rock. 
The same goes for the sun, and all other bodies within the solarsystem. If there was no Earth, and you suddenly stopped orbiting the sun, youd fall like a rock toward the sun. If the Earth was still there and you and the earth both stopped lateral velocity, first youd fall toward the earth, because of its closer proximity, and then the earth would fall toward the sun. 
Every piece of matter in the universe has some level of gravitational pull. If it has mass, even very very small mass, it has gravity and pulls on all the things around it. 

3. Im going to assume youre talking about 'heat' in the form of convection in gasses.

The answer: Barring there are no outside influences, both gravitational and not, and in a vacuum, the gas will form a sphere due to all of the gas molecules acting upon each other. The within the sphere, the more excited molecules (the hottest) will travel toward the surface, while the least excited molecules will sink toward the middle. 

Consequently, the friction of the molecules interacting each other in the ""core"" of the gas bubble will heat them, while the molecules that rose to the surface will see less interaction and cause them to reduce their excitement and become ""cool"" again, which will make a circular flow within the gas sphere. This same mechanic is what causes wind and high and low pressure systems in weather here on earth.

callmecooper13,"No, heat would not rise. Heat 'rises' through a process called Free Convection. The classical example of free convection is a heated wire in completely still air. Heat 'rises' from the wire in a sort of wake (just like a boat through water) but instead this wake consists of heated air flowing through cooler air.

The reason that free convection results in hot air 'rising' is because of the density difference between hot and cool air. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so gravity pulls more on the cool air than hot air, and the hot air floats to the top of the cool air. 

In space, the gravity that pulls more on cool air would not be present, so the heat would slowly expand from the surface in all directions away from the source of heat. This obviously has practical implications in that the heat collects around the source and can cause the source to overheat. Therefore it is necessary to mechanically push the air across the source of heat in order to generate the type of air flow that would normally be present when there were gravitational forces at work.*

*Gravitational forces are always at work in orbit, but can be assumed negligible due to the control volume being in constant freefall/constant acceleration/due to the frame of reference

paolog,"The ""criss-cross"" distance between two points is called the Manhattan distance between the points, while the straight-line distance is called the Euclidean distance. What you're asking is whether the limit of the Manhattan distance as the grid gets finer is equal to the Euclidean distance. It's easy to show that this is not the case.

Let's take a 1 x 1 square. The Manhattan distance from one corner to the other is 2 (length of bottom edge + length of right edge, for example), while the Euclidean distance is, by Pythogoras' theorem, √2.

Now subdivide the square into a 2 x 2 grid of four squares. To get from one corner to another, we have to zigzag along four edges of the small squares, each of which is 1/2 a unit long. So the total distance is 4 x 1/2, or 2.

It's not hard to show that however we subdivide the square into smaller squares (or even rectangles), the shortest corner-to-corner distance measured along the edges of these squares will always be 2 and will never get anywhere near √2. Hence no matter how many turns we make, the Manhattan distance never equals the Euclidean distance.

So no, nothing changes as the resolution of the grid becomes finer. Furthermore, a diagonal is not imaginary - it is just different from walking along the edges.

This could give a path that stays closer to the original line overall, but has the same length because it wiggles more.

The moral of the story is that curves that stay close to each other do not have to have lengths that stay close to each other. As for real life: yes there is a difference traveled if you take a small step up, then a small step right, etc. compared to directly walking the diagonal. This is easiest to see if you have a robot or something that you can guarantee will travel at a constant speed and a timer.

A bit more: Small-ratio resonance orbits with major bodies typically have nothing in them, because over time the larger body kicks the smaller ones out of that orbit.  Think of pushing a swing, or operating a cyclotron:  you can transfer a *lot* of energy to an oscillating body just by kicking it gently in some pattern with a harmonic relationship to the oscillation.  Major bodies typically clear out their own orbits over time due to the 1:1 resonance with anything else in that orbit -- anything at, say, 0.999 AU would eventually have a near encounter with Earth, and get ejected.  That effect is why Ceres and Pluto are considered ""dwarf planets"" and not ""planets"" -- the dynamical process is part of our modern definition of a planet.  The 2:1 and 4:1 resonances with Jupiter define reasonable approximate boundaries of the asteroid belt, and there are noticeable gaps near small-integer ratios of Jupiter's period between those values.

$60 is not worth spending on a telescope. You will end up with a very low end wobble device and be disappointed.  Buy a set of binoculars first. If you decide that you aren't that into astronomy later binoculars have other uses a telescope really doesn't. Next go hang out with the local Astronomical society. Look at what they are using get to know their equipment before you make a purchase more than binoculars.
The smallest scope regularly used in our society 10 years ago was an 6"", well above the $60 price tag and the 2-3"" of the ones you mentioned.

15x70s are huge binoculars. You are going to have problems keeping them steady unless you invest in some sort of [mount for them](http://www.telescope.com/Orion-Paragon-Plus-Binocular-Mount-and-Tripod/p/5379.uts).  With those binoculars you will be able to see the moons of Jupiter, the ears on Saturn, maybe Titan if you are in a good spot, and clusters. They aren't really designed to see galaxies except the brightest ones. The standard binoculars used are 10x50s. Light enough to hold steady, or balance on a chair but powerful enough to see binocular objects (bright clusters, comets, birds). We really don't use binoculars for planetary observing not enough detail. I would recommend a set of 10x50s before the 10x70s. I have never owned nor known anyone to own such large binoculars except for special purposes like comet hunting and defiantly not without a mount.

Neither of those scopes are really worth using for more than a causal, hey that's the moon kind of use. I used a 6"" for many years around 2000 and it was the smallest scope in the group. 8"" is a standard entry level amateur scope. What matters in a telescope is aperture the size of the main lens or mirror. The larger the aperture the more light is concentrated onto your eye, the fainter an object can be seen. You want to spend your money on aperture! Magnification doesn't matter, most observing is done with relatively low magnification but the higher aperture the better.

Years later, I bought a 6 inch reflector and finally got see all the things that I couldn't with the Tasco.  I have a pair of 10x50 binoculars that I use alone or with the telescope.  When looking for something in the sky, it helps to find it with binoculars first before using the telescope.  Or, sometimes I just go look with the binoculars just because it's easy.  Also, because it's more than enough to see several galaxies, star clusters, nebulas, and Jupiters moons.

SilentCastHD,"Well, first of all, you have to differentiate subtractive color from additive color.

In the first case, all the colors give you black, in the second, all the colors give you white.

So to make that clear: If you take a flashlight, and shine it onto a white paper, you see white light. - Duh...

If you take a red marker and mark the page, you strip away ""all the light"" that isn't red and absorb it, so only the red light reflects. The dye subtracts the [wavelengths](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Rendered_Spectrum.png) that don't correspond to red.

So you transform white light to red light using the filter ""red marker dye"".
Going forward, with blue and yellow, you strip awaay more and more of the light, until no light is relected anymore, leaving you with black.

The other way around, you [add up colored light](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/RGB_illumination.jpg) to make white light.

So you shine red light onto a white wall, the reflected light is red. If you overlay it with the other colors, you'll get white again.

(This is why green looks black in ""pure red light"", since there is [no refelection of red light on green leafs](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hHcuVK0TGHg/TyVDCInAFWI/AAAAAAAAAT0/3tU3h7p1Zbw/s1600/Lights%2B1%2B-%2BOriginal.jpg))

So with that out of the way: What is grey?

Grey is the achromatic color between black and white.

So, since you get the two different colour-systems now, you see that grey in [RGB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB) displays (additive color) has to be different from the grey in a printed picture in [CMYK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model)(subtractive color)

So, as you can see [here](http://www.aksiom.net/rgb.html) at the bottom the RGB value for grey is always something where R=G=B, and the stronger the individual light gets, the more you go up to white.

LoyalSol,"There isn't really one universal answer since different materials will react differently with acids/bases, but a large majority of them dissolve because of either oxidation like in the case of metals or through catalyzed reactions (the acid/base speeds up a reaction that normally would occur slowly).

Oxidation is pretty straight forward.  The metals have electrons taken away by the acid and once that happens they form stable ions which can be freely dissolved into solution.  In catalytic reactions the acid/base comes in and binds to a functional group on a molecule (usually organic molecules) and stabilizes the molecule in a way that it can undergo further reactions.

That's an example of the forward reaction, but the reverse reaction is similar.    In large scale a organic molecules such as proteins, each peptide in the chain is linked together by an functional ground (amide group for proteins, O=C-N) and the acid/base will attack these links causes the chain to break apart.

Second, it is amorphous, which adds both strength to the vessel and well as a reduction in reactivity that can occur at the edges of crystal faces.  Hence, the amorphous nature renders the glass less reactive than it would be if it were crystalline silica.  

There are some things that are not good to store in glass, however.  Potassium hydroxide will etch away the glass, and hydrofluoric acid will do the same.  These are just two examples, but there are a number of chemicals that are not inert, with respect to glass.

drzowie,"A superadiabatic gradient is what *drives* convection -- the free energy that gets converted to mechanical flow comes from the positive difference between the gradient and the adiabatic lapse rate.  Convection will happen at *some* level with any nonzero excess in the lapse rate above the adiabatic rate, since the material is a fluid.

In practice, the actual lapse rate doesn't get driven exactly to the adiabatic rate, but it's pretty darned close.  The actual offset is driven by the balance between heat flux and (effective turbulent) viscosity in the fluid.  Since stellar plasmas aren't known for their high viscosity, and the scales are large, the offset turns out to miniscule (negligible by orders of magnitude) in nearly all cases -- so you can treat the adiabatic lapse rate as a strict limit, and be good to go.

Let's apply your example of 10^-6 superadiabaticity to the Sun.   [The convection zone spans about 6 orders of magnitude, or about 14 scale heights, in density](http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrsp-2009-2&amp;amp;page=articlese1.html).  If the lapse rate differs from adiabatic by 1 part in 10^6, that corresponds to a temperature differential factor of e^(14x2/3x1.000001) compared to e^(14x2/3) across the whole convection zone - so if you assumed the lapse rate was exactly adiabatic, but it was really 1+1x10^-6 times the adiabatic rate (and you knew the photospheric temperature exactly), your calculation of the temperature at the base of the convection zone would be off by a factor or (1+1x10^-5).

The fact that two sounds may be interchangeable is called [free variation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variation):

Pachacamac,"Actually you can't carbon date stone at all. Carbon dating needs organic materials with carbon-14 in them (an unstable isotope of carbon), so we need floral or faunal material. Burned seeds or charcoal are the best, but other organic materials can be dated. There are other dating methods that can date non-organic things and can date much older things that radiocarbon dating (which maxes out at 75,000-100,000 years), and some of these are useful to archaeologists/paleo-anthropologists, but radiocarbon dating is the most common method that archaeologists use. 

I'll mention here that there is one method, obsidian hydration dating, that can actually determine how long it's been since a piece of obsidian (volcanic glass commonly used for stone tools) was broken, which happens when the tool is being made (basically you start with a larger rock and chip away at it to shape it into what you want), but this method has a lot of problems and isn't always reliable. It's about the only way to directly date stone tools that I can think of, though.

So, we can't date the actual. How do we determine how old something like a stone tool is? We rely on one of the key assumptions in archaeology that things found together were probably made and used at roughly the same time (radiocarbon dating has an error range of 25-100 years anyway, so ""same time"" can mean same decade or same century). If you find a stone tool within a fire pit, say, then you assume that someone threw it in there during a fire, and the fire pit will have lots of organic material that we can date, So we date the pit and assume that the tool is as old as the pit. That is the most straightforward example I can think of, but the basic idea, dating by association, is how we get specific calendar dates for most of our sites. Same thing if we get a stone tool and a piece of charcoal at roughly the same depth in a site that we know has not been disturbed, you can date it by association.

Edit: just took a look at the article you linked. They've dated those tools to 280,000 years ago, not 85,000 years ago, so they would definitely not be using radiocarbon dating. I don't know what they used. The article is a bit hyperbolic but just keep in mind that, especially with those really early sites, there is a lot of room for error or unknown things complicating the picture, and a ton of room for interpretation, so the big claims that the article makes might be a bit presumptuous.

Solivaga,"There's a wide range of radiometric dating techniques, but as /u/Pachacamac points out, you can't use radiocrbon dating on inorganic materials (such as stone), and radiocarbon dating is only really accurate back to around 50k BP, and completely fails much beyond 75k BP.

The short answer is that we use context and stratigraphy to securely sequence artefacts and features - in turn this allows us to identify material as being conteporaneous.  This enables us to date other material that's from the same phase of occupation or activity as the stone tools.

Dating techniques that stretch further back than C14 include Potassium Argon, Uranium Series, Fission Track, Electron Spin Resonance, abd Obsidian Hydration.  The problem with many of these is that they date natural events (including volcanic rock formation, formation of calcium-carbonate etc.), so often we'll be using these dates natural events to constrain the archaeological materials - i.e. we know that this palaeolithic site was occupied sometime between x and y.

Platypuskeeper,"&gt; Hybridization is a generally good theory, but it doesn't explain properties like magnetism.

Valence-bond theory actually explains the paramagnetism of oxygen, if that's what you're referring to. (and has since the start, it's in Pauling's ""The nature of the chemical bond) It's a common myth though, so anyway...

You have antibonding orbitals because of symmetry. Each 'even' (symmetric) state has a corresponding 'odd' (antisymmetric) state. Now, I don't expect you to get what that means, so I'll demonstrate:

Two hydrogen atoms get close, and their atomic 1s orbitals combine to a _molecular orbital_. (The 1s orbitals are spherical and have a wave function that's like exp(-r), if you neglect constants). We assume for the sake of this example, that they form a linear 'superposition'. The combined wave function is simply the sum of the functions times some constants. 

There are only two possible combinations here: which is 1s_1 + 1s_2 and 1s_1 - 1s_2. This is because the overall phase (sign) of the function doesn't matter. so -1s_1 - 1_s2 is the same thing as 1s_1 + 1s_2. 

In the first one 1s_1 + 1s_2, where they add up, then the electron density is above zero everywhere, since the 1s orbital is exp(-1) and above zero everywhere. So there must be electron density all the way between the two nuclei. It's a _bonding_ molecular orbital.

In the second molecular orbital these two can create, 1s_1 - 1s_2, there is a spot at the exact center between the two nuclei where 1s_1 and 1s_2 are the same (because it's the same 1s orbital and the same distance r from their respective nucleus). So the total wave function there is _zero_. There's a region between the nuclei that lacks electrons! This is an _antibonding_ orbital.

[It's easier to see the thing visualized](http://www.expertsmind.com/CMSImages/2087_bonding1.png)

The antibonding MO has higher energy than the bonding one (fortunately for chemistry). A visual rationalization for this is in there's a higher curvature of the antibonding MO. After all, from one nucleus to the other it has to pass through zero. In quantum mechanics, a higher curvature of the wave function (more tightly located electrons), means higher kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy is higher when you have a 'node' like this (nodes being these areas of zero density, as with where a wave is zero). 

All this holds true whichever orbitals you combine to form your MOs. An antibonding orbital is formed for each bonding one, and the antibonding one has higher energy. 

(Note that the 'formation' here, just as with hybridization, is really just a way describing things. MOs don't suddenly form at a particular distance, it's a seamless transition from AOs to MOs)

There are equations and general rules to help predict what kind of crystal structure, density, conductivity (thermal and electrical), and phases may be present for different materials.


The first place I would start is the gold/tungsten phase diagram and find out what percentage I had of each, so I could figure out the different phases present. Next thing I would do is grind it into a powder and throw it into an X-Ray Diffractometer, and see what it makes of it. This would give me more information on it's crystal structure.


Next up would be mechanical testing. I would use a Charpy impact test a several temperatures to try and determine its glassy transition temperature, if possible. Then a good old fashion tensile test for its elastic modulus and a compression test for its bulk modulus.

Quantity of adsorbed surface carbon (also known as adventitious carbon) is proportional to the amount of time the surface has been exposed to atmospheric conditions, and thus a comparison of adventitious carbon quantity of a surface known to have been exposed in the manufacture of the instrument and the isotopically-determined age of the material is informative.

There are also ways to break down rock into a gas and estimate the age of formation. Archaeology is all about context too.

[You should probably just take a look at it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1rectr/how_do_scientistsarchaeologists_carbondate_human/cdmfnvd)

Basically, with most types of stone we can't date the stone at all (so we don't know how old it is, expect by talking to geologists who tell us that it comes from a certain formation of a certain age. But we don't typically care about that). We figure out when the tool was made by assuming that it was made, used, and discarded within a relatively short period of time (a century can be ""short"" to us because of the error ranges that all the different dating methods have, but stone tools wear out and break quickly so anything was probably used and tossed away in the same year that it was made). So because it was discarded at a site, we assume that it is as old as the site itself, and we date the tool by association; i.e. it was found with other things that we can date directly (like charcoal on younger sites, or layer of volcanic ash for sites as old as the one in this article), so we assume that it is as old as those things. So the fact that the rock itself might be 400 million years old doesn't matter; we find a tool at a site that we can date to 280,000 years ago and we assume that the tool and the site are the same age, as long as there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.

Now, I said with most stone. Obsidian is different. There's a method called obsidian hydration dating that we can actually use to date obsidian tools, which are what was found at the site in the article. When you make a stone tool you are always chipping away and breaking the surface, so when the tool is brand new it will have a fresh surface. Obsidian weathers at a known rate so you can look at the surface and determine how old it is by how much weathering is on it. This isn't a perfect method and it can't really tell us exactly how old the tool is (because there's so much variation across regions), but it can tell you that one tool is older than the other. Maybe they can get actual calendar years for Ethiopian obsidian too, I don't know (I'm not familiar with the area).",null,0,cdmfyqt,1re8mg,askscience,top_week,2
StringOfLights,"It is not so much that terrestrial mammals were big back then, it's that they're small now. Mammals [increased in size following the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction and maintained that large body size](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6008/1216.short) for nearly 30 million years years.  Then there was an [extinction at the end of the Pleistocene](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-185X.1991.tb01149.x/abstract). Most vertebrate taxa made it through this extinction, but a lot of large-bodied animals, and especially large-bodied mammals, were hit particularly hard. Some 150 genera of megafauna (defined as animals &gt;44 kg) existed 50,000 years ago; [97 of those were extinct by 10,000 years ago](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5693/70.full):

Given how geologically recent these extinctions are, it's extremely unlikely that anything would have been able to fill the gaps left by the loss of megafaunal mammals, as there appears to be a [maximum rate](http://pnas.org/content/early/2012/01/26/1120774109.abstract) that mammals can increase in size. In that sense it's completely expected that a recent extinction event would leave a gap in body size. 

Also, in all of this discussion it's worth bearing in mind that we're generally talking about terrestrial mammals. There are plenty of large marine mammals still around (for the time being), including the blue whale!

**Edit:** Forgot something! In terms of dealing with cold weather, having a larger body size actually slows heat loss because it lowers the surface area to volume ratio.

However, as is in the nature of pendulums, gravity overdoes it and the swinger ends up on the other side of equilibrium, at which point they shift their center of gravity again. And so on.

jofwu,"I'm just going to describe the process...

When swinging forward you lean back, stick your legs out, and pull on the chains. *By leaning your torso back and kicking your legs out you apply torque to your body.* This torque is balanced by pulling on the chains. Imagine trying to perform this action without holding on to or pushing off of something- you can't. Note that the chains bend where you hold them. The line of action of the tension in the chains is *behind* your center of mass. This is where the balance in torque comes from: force (tension in chains) x distance (between force's line of action and your center of mass). On the backswing, everything is the opposite. You pull your torso forward and bend your knees back in, and to balance this out you need a torque in the opposite direction. So you *push* forward on the chains, and the line of action of the chains is *in front* of your center of mass.

*Making these transitions leading up to the peak of your swing is the key.* The movements don't do anything if they aren't timed right. By performing the forward swinging motions, you add some gravitational potential energy at the top of the front of your swing. The back swinging motions add energy at the back end of the swing. *The energy gained is thanks to that little distance you create between you and the chains' line of action- putting you a little bit higher from the ground than if you had just swung freely like a pendulum.* Of course this gravitational potential energy results in more speed/momentum at the bottom. *And I think it's worth mentioning that you don't conjure this extra energy from nowhere. It comes from you body.* The gravitational potential energy you add wouldn't be possible without applying a torque to your body. 

In the end, it's not that much different from swinging on parallel bars. Rather than balancing your torque by pushing/pulling on a chain, you apply a counter torque directly to the bar you hold (with a firm grip).",null,0,cdmmc2l,1re182,askscience,top_week,2
GlowInTheDarkDonkey,"My understanding, as a (uh oh) layman, is that a person on a swing is basically taking advantage of angular momentum in the same way a figure skater tightening their limbs in a spin makes them spin faster.

A shortening of the total length of the swinging body on the upward swing means gravity is being applied to a total body that has less distance to travel (is a shorter swing-arm), and then on the downward swing the thrusting of legs outwards allows gravity to work on a longer swinging body... which again is then shortened on the upward movement.

Some of the angular momentum of the legs themselves also adds to the total forces being shifted around.

When someone is standing on a swing seat you'll notice they put all of their mass to the seat on the down-swing, and then they stand on the upswing.  This, similarly, means gravity is pulling a longer swing-arm (in terms of average mass distribution towards the outermost edge of the arm) on the downward stroke compared to the upward stroke.

The iodization of salt has had a measurable impact on iodine deficiency-related stuff since it was introduced in the 1920s. For the individual any health effects would depend on whether you get enough iodine from other sources. 

The biggest differences are really taste and texture more than anything, though.

chuck10470,"The difference between table and sea salt is the iodine. Fresh from the factory it contains 50 ppm iodine. That's all. 50 ppm. As it ages, the iodine evaporates out, losing half every 40 days.

All salt comes from the sea. Or a lake. Mined salt has precipitated out over thousands of years and built up thick beds that became buried through mountain building. Ironically, most of these mines are today quite some distance from the ocean. The Swiss city of Salzburg has several salt mines,  though it is hundreds of miles from the ocean today. 

And some of this mined salt is quite old. But whether it precipitated out at the bottom of the Tethys Sea 65 million years ago or last week in Sardinia, it's still 99.9% NaCl and 0.1% other minerals. Most of the table salt, industrial salt, road salt, animal feed salt, etc, is mined. Sea salt is precipitated out in huge evaporation ponds. It should be noted that sea salt can be iodized and become table salt, and much of it is. ""Sea salt"" is a marketing name given to un-iodized salt produced by evaporation. It supposedly has better taste, but since it's nearly impossible to determine which minerals give it a specific favor profile, maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. It depends on where it's from. The expensive $10/lb culinary salt is usually sea salt, but with additives like smoke or truffles. The various types of salt available at the grocery store differ mostly in the iodine content and the shape of the crystals. That's it.

Smoothened,"The machinery behind X-inactivation specifically targets the X chromosome as opposed to any chromosome. For example, the gene XIST is located on the X chromosome and is required for its inactivation. When this gene is expressed, its transcript, a long noncoding RNA (Xist) coats the respective chromosome, becoming involved in its silencing. A chromosome lacking XIST would not undergo inactivation. If you insert the XIST gene in an autosomal chromosome, that chromosome can then be inactivated. 

A more interesting question is how is inactivation targeted to one of the chromosomes in each cell. That question is not entirely answered, but it is believed that an autosomal gene encodes a blocking factor that prevents one X chromosomes from being inactivated. Interestingly, even when there's more than 2 X-chromosomes present, only one remains active in each cell. ",null,0,cdmbqmg,1rdsv9,askscience,top_week,5

Ejb90,"This revolves around the maximum power transfer theorem. There are two ways to look at it.
Firstly from a circuit-theory point of view, when power energy is transferred from one component to another, the maximum is transferred if they are the same resistance. Impedance is the more generalised, complex form of resistance.  This means that if they are matched in resistance (impedance) then the most power is transferred, which is most efficient.
The second way to look at isn't is from a waves point of view. At the frequencies you get in a transfer cable the currents can be modelled as electromagnetic pulses. When they reach a boundary some are reflected and some are transmitted, just like light is when it passes between air and water. When the two mediums either side of the boundary have the same ""resistance"" to the wave, more of the wave propagates through, as it's almost as if there is no boundary, so the maximum energy is transferred, as expected.",null,0,cdm4hjj,1rdd6o,askscience,top_week,8

rat_poison,"This is the distilled wisdom of my Microwave Networks experience regarding impedance.

The most important defining feature of the transmission line is its characteristic impedance. It is affected by the shape of the transmission line and materials that make it up. Generally, for a TL extending to the z direction, we can divide the whole length in small parts of length Δz. Τhose parts can be arbitrarily small: so much so that we can ignore any radiating properties within that Δz. We can therefore make a lumped-circuit equivalent of that Δz length of the tramsission line.
Movement along the length of the transmission line will mean some ohmic resistance (R) and some inductance (L). The neighboring of metal surfaces will cause capacitance (C) and the material between them will cause dielectric losses based on a conductance (G).

As the electromagnetic wave travels through the transmission line along direction of propagation J, we can generally define functions I(z) = I+(z) + I-(z) and V(z) = V+(z) + V-(z)

So current and voltage are made up of two constituents: the first (+) representing movement along the direction of propagation and the second (-) representing the part of the current and voltage that are caused by reflection and therefore are moving opposite the direction of propagation.

Characteristic Impedance is the ratio Z_0(z) = V+(z) / I+(z)

for the length of Δz I have described earlier, it is calculated as Z_0 = sqrt((R+jωL)/G+jωC)) (j = sqrt(-1))

In most cases, trasmission lines are uniform in the z direction, or they are made up of a cascade of uniform parts. Either way, for every uniform TL, the characteristic impedance is the same no matter which Δz I choose within it (as long as it's small), so that's why it's such a defining property of a TL.

We can then define another quantity, Γ(z)=V-(z)/V+(z), called the reflection coefficient. This tells us what is the ratio of reflected and forward waves. Its amplitude is 0 if there are no reflections, 1 if the reflections and the forward waves have the same energy therefore leading to standing waves not able to propagate energy, or an-inbetween state for the other values in between.

If z=l, then we have calculated that Γ_Load = (Ζ_L-Z_0)/(Ζ_L+Z_0). For a lossless transmission line, this will have constant amplitude throughout its length.

Now we want to minimize energy lost in reflections. So Γ should be 0.

If you look closely at my last equation, you'll see that this can only be true if Z_L = Z_0.

Regarding the part about the return line.

When dealing with high frequency circuits, a return line is not necessary. BUT NOT because of impedance matching. If the outer shell or the inner wire of a coaxial cable didn't exist, it wouldn't posses the geometrical properties that induce the field to operate in the desired way. There wouldn't be two points with different potentials along the direction of propagation around which the EM energy could oscillate back and forth. In fact the concepts I have just described break down. BUT there are transmission lines that don't have a return wire: these are waveguides. The wave DOES oscillate back and forth, but the points are not as strictly defined as in two-wire TL's or coaxial cables. Instead, we have modes: depending on the ratio of the wavelength and the dimensions of the waveguide, there are (possibly several) nulls and peaks at the transversal plane, that are defined by how many half-waves fit into that dimension. These nulls and peaks are now the places around which the energy fluctuates in order to propagate forward. Waveguides are the reason you should be careful when using current and voltage concepts on microwave circuits. Therefore you should just stop thinking about TLs in terms of a phase line and a return line, but a single structure which guides the waves along a direction and (maybe) causes reflections along the opposite direction.

You are probably familiar with constructive and deconstructive wave interference, where two waves on top of each other can either add or subtract based on phase. As it turns out, if you have sounds at different frequencies, or if the phase relationship varies randomly over time (as it would when you have two people yelling), then you get interference which is mostly positive. The math would be that the squares of the pressure add.

A good rule of thumb is that the sound pressure goes up by 3 dB every time you double the number of people. Likewise, if the distance to the source is much greater than the size of the source, then the loudness will drop by 6 dB for every doubling of distance. Additionally, there is also sound damping that becomes important at long distances.

patchgrabber,"Well, kelp are basically algae, so they are quite different from land plants in pretty much every way except photosynthesis. Although their holdfasts resemble, and may be a primitive form of, plant roots, kelp are fundamentally different. 

In most land plants, while very limited photosynthesis may occur in the stalk of the plant, most of its photosynthetic activity is in the leaves. Kelp, in contrast, photosynthesize in every part of the organism (although different parts have different levels of photosynthetic ability depending on age), allowing for more and making light less of a limitation than it is in land plants.

The environment the kelp lives in is also a big factor. Since it is under water, light is attenuated differently than above water. Due to the large amount of particulates, blue light is attenuated rapidly in coastal waters, and blue light is much more valuable than red light that can penetrate deeper at a higher intensity.

While there are products out there that purport to use kelp in them to make plants grow faster, I'm thinking this is only because of the nutrients, not any special property that is linked to kelp growth. I cannot think of any way at present to genetically transfer this quality to land plants; their limitations are different, their environments are different, and they are just fundamentally different organisms.

Kelp, on the other hand, creates new tissue along the entire length of its thallus (the big leaf) which is why in grows so fast.  
Another big difference is that the thallus doesn't have much, if any speciation; it is composed of more or less the same kind of cell. Higher plants, in contrast, have an internal structure of xylem, phloem, bark etc. that requires many different specialized cell types.  
Both these differences work together to prevent us from simply transplanting this ability into our crop plants.

The same thing happens with, say, spinning a ball on a string. A larger mass on a shorter string is easier to spin around than a small mass with a long string.

So, imagine that cylinders rolling down a slope as masses rotating around an axis in the center. Assuming they are the same mass, the hollow cylinder is essentially like the fat kid sitting at the very end--it takes a lot to move him. The solid cylinder is more like a few light kids distributed across the radius.",null,11,cdm74bu,1rd6yw,askscience,top_week,15
lukehashj,"If the cylinder is full of liquid, it rotates more slowly because the liquid is slipping past itself as the cylinder rotates, and some of the kinetic energy is transferred into friction. What's also interesting is that once the cylinder is at the bottom of the hill, you can stop it and the liquid inside will stay spinning. You could then place the cylinder back down and it will begin to roll again - even uphill if possible!

The higher the viscosity of the liquid, the stronger the effect.

edit: I've seen this in person with a large can of syrup. When placed on a ramp, the can looked basically ""stuck"" because it hardly moved.

tthershey,"&gt; Dr. Harper explained in her presentation that the cervical cancer risk in the U.S. is already extremely low, and that vaccinations are unlikely to have any effect upon the rate of cervical cancer in the United States.  In fact, 70% of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment in a year, and the number rises to well over 90% in two years.

While it is true that the chances of getting cervical cancer are low, the vaccine does prevent a cancer, which is amazing.   Very few cancers have the potential of being eradicated like this.  Not all strains of HPV are covered by the vaccine, and not all strains of HPV cause cancer.  So on the plus side, those scary statistics about how prevalent HPV infections are can be misleading because the actual incidence of cervical cancer is low even among those who get infected with HPV.

Anogenital warts are mostly caused by HPV 6 and 11.  This lesion is usually benign (not cancerous).  Most cervical cancer is caused by HPV 16 and 18, but there are some other, less common strains of HPV that can also cause cervical cancer.  Gardasil protects against HPV 16 and 18, which prevents 70% of cervical cancers.

&gt; All trials of the vaccines were done on children aged 15 and above, despite them currently being marketed for 9-year-olds.

Not true, here's an example: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23971122

&gt; So far, 15,037 girls have reported adverse side effects from Gardasil™ alone to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and this number only reflects parents who underwent the hurdles required for reporting adverse reactions.  At the time of writing, 44 girls are officially known to have died from these vaccines.  The reported side effects include Guillian Barré Syndrome (paralysis lasting for years, or permanently — sometimes eventually causing suffocation), lupus, seizures, blood clots, and brain inflammation.

I would have to see the source for this claim to make any specific comments, but in general I can say vaccines are tested very vigorously for their safety.  It has to be expected that some people will suffer health consequences after receiving a vaccine.  Many of these people might have suffered those consequences whether or not they had received the vaccine because they had some pre-existing conditions, and some might have rare diseases that make them more susceptible to complications.  But serious complications from the vaccine are rare.

&gt; Studies have proven “there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless.  In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer.  From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteorite.”

This is simply not true.  The vaccine has been proven to prevent HPV 16 and 18, which prevents 70% of cervical cancers.  The CDC is a reputable source for information on this: http://www.cdc.gov/STD/HPV/

Some more info:

3 key genes in HPV 16 and 18 are E2, E6, and E7.  E6 and E7, when activated, disrupt cellular defense mechanisms that kill off cells that might become cancerous.  E6 and E7 are normally repressed by E2.  HPV infects cells by integrating the viral DNA into the host cell (human) DNA.  HPV can insert itself into the human DNA in many different positions, and where it inserts itself is, as far as we know, random.  If HPV inserts itself in a way that disrupts the E2 gene, then E6 and E7 are free to disrupt the host cell's defense mechanisms, leading to cancer.

So, if you get an HPV infection, you might get a strain that doesn't cause cancer.  Or, you might get a strain that does cause cancer, but the HPV inserts itself in a way that does not result in cancer.  But you could be one of the unlucky people who gets HPV 16 or 18 that integrates in such a way that causes the cancer.  So yes, getting cervical cancer from HPV is rare, but you don't know if you are going to be one of the unlucky ones or not.",null,7,cdm2tjm,1rd56j,askscience,top_week,44

tthershey,"&gt; Dr. Harper explained in her presentation that the cervical cancer risk in the U.S. is already extremely low, and that vaccinations are unlikely to have any effect upon the rate of cervical cancer in the United States.  In fact, 70% of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment in a year, and the number rises to well over 90% in two years.

While it is true that the chances of getting cervical cancer are low, the vaccine does prevent a cancer, which is amazing.   Very few cancers have the potential of being eradicated like this.  Not all strains of HPV are covered by the vaccine, and not all strains of HPV cause cancer.  So on the plus side, those scary statistics about how prevalent HPV infections are can be misleading because the actual incidence of cervical cancer is low even among those who get infected with HPV.

Anogenital warts are mostly caused by HPV 6 and 11.  This lesion is usually benign (not cancerous).  Most cervical cancer is caused by HPV 16 and 18, but there are some other, less common strains of HPV that can also cause cervical cancer.  Gardasil protects against HPV 16 and 18, which prevents 70% of cervical cancers.

&gt; All trials of the vaccines were done on children aged 15 and above, despite them currently being marketed for 9-year-olds.

Not true, here's an example: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23971122

&gt; So far, 15,037 girls have reported adverse side effects from Gardasil™ alone to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and this number only reflects parents who underwent the hurdles required for reporting adverse reactions.  At the time of writing, 44 girls are officially known to have died from these vaccines.  The reported side effects include Guillian Barré Syndrome (paralysis lasting for years, or permanently — sometimes eventually causing suffocation), lupus, seizures, blood clots, and brain inflammation.

I would have to see the source for this claim to make any specific comments, but in general I can say vaccines are tested very vigorously for their safety.  It has to be expected that some people will suffer health consequences after receiving a vaccine.  Many of these people might have suffered those consequences whether or not they had received the vaccine because they had some pre-existing conditions, and some might have rare diseases that make them more susceptible to complications.  But serious complications from the vaccine are rare.

&gt; Studies have proven “there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless.  In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer.  From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteorite.”

This is simply not true.  The vaccine has been proven to prevent HPV 16 and 18, which prevents 70% of cervical cancers.  The CDC is a reputable source for information on this: http://www.cdc.gov/STD/HPV/

Some more info:

3 key genes in HPV 16 and 18 are E2, E6, and E7.  E6 and E7, when activated, disrupt cellular defense mechanisms that kill off cells that might become cancerous.  E6 and E7 are normally repressed by E2.  HPV infects cells by integrating the viral DNA into the host cell (human) DNA.  HPV can insert itself into the human DNA in many different positions, and where it inserts itself is, as far as we know, random.  If HPV inserts itself in a way that disrupts the E2 gene, then E6 and E7 are free to disrupt the host cell's defense mechanisms, leading to cancer.

So, if you get an HPV infection, you might get a strain that doesn't cause cancer.  Or, you might get a strain that does cause cancer, but the HPV inserts itself in a way that does not result in cancer.  But you could be one of the unlucky people who gets HPV 16 or 18 that integrates in such a way that causes the cancer.  So yes, getting cervical cancer from HPV is rare, but you don't know if you are going to be one of the unlucky ones or not.",null,7,cdm2tjm,1rd56j,askscience,top_week,44

**First up: two identical cars, each at 30 mph, in a head-on collision.** They're going to spin a bit, but we can think of it as hitting each other and coming to a complete halt. All the kinetic energy of each car (0.5 x mass x velocity^2) needs to be converted into some other form. Some of this energy will be used to crush and deform the car bodies.

The rest of the car's kinetic energy will go into sound, heat, and doing unpleasant things to your body. 

**One car at 60 mph hitting a car that is stationary but able to slide:** The moving car has a lot more kinetic energy than the two 30 mph cars combined, because kinetic energy = 0.5mv^2 as mentioned above.

redmeansTGA,"First off, let’s look at this from an ecosystems perspective. Coral reefs and coastal forests close to the impact site were probably completely annihilated. Other ecosystems; wetlands, tropical forests, woodlands, and so on would have suffered the nuclear winter, microwave summer, firestorms, tsunamis and shockwaves to varying degrees. Aside from Chemolithotrophic bacteria and archaea living in deep within the crust, nowhere on Earth would have escaped unaffected.


The deep sea, far from being safe, was significantly affected by the K/T impact. A decrease in species richness and abundance is observed. The specific mechanism of the extinction event in the deep sea, along with the rest of the oceans, remains unknown- although two hypothesis have been proposed; either 1) marine primary productivity was hit hard, and the oceans 'died' as the bottom of the food chain was taken out, or 2) rapid acidification wiped out calciferous plankton, which broke down the oceans [biological pump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_pump).  Either way, the deep oceans (including communities living in trenches) starved. 


I don’t know much about cave ecosystems from the Cretaceous, however we do know that modern caves (and K caves wouldn’t be different) receive what’s called resource subsidies- that is resources from the outside world are moved into the cave, via insects, streams or other means, and cave animals then depend on those resources. The destruction of outside ecosystems would surely adversely affect this flow of resources, and cave ecosystems probably suffered mass extinctions too. 


Remote islands probably wouldn’t have been a great place to be. To begin with, the K/T extinction caused massive tsunamis that would have devastated low lying atolls. Secondly, island ecosystems are relatively small, and generally don’t have a whole lot of redundancy so climatic change can hit them hard. Thirdly, islands don’t often stay around a long time. Many oceanic islands are doomed to sink back under the waves.


So to answer one part of your question, there were probably no pockets that survived unaffected. However, let’s look at things from a different perspective. 


The late cretaceous contained a lot of flora and fauna that we are familiar with today, as many dominate species emerged during the mid-Cretaceous. There were some notably absences, for example open savannahs and steppe dominated by the grass family (poaceae). The superabundant passerine (‘perching’) birds didn’t evolve to the early cenozoic either. Temperate deciduous forests also didn’t exist until the Earth cooled during the mid-cenozoic. But for the most part, Cretaceous landscapes would have been full of species we would recognize- social insects like bees and ants, butterflies, birds, frogs, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. The rivers and lakes would have had many modern types of fishes. The forests would been full of palm trees, cycads, tree ferns, and tropical hardwoods, with diversity of flowers and fruits. There were no large mammals, and dinosaurs (et al) still roamed around, but large animals are only a tiny proportion of species anyway. 


Looking at it from that perspective, it’s clear that large chunks of extant ecosystems bear similarities to Cretaceous ecosystems. 65 million years of evolutionary innovation has introduced new elements, of course, but successful lineages and ecosystem interactions not only survived the aftermath of K/T, but they prospered. We live in a world still dominated by Cretaceous survivors.

DorkmanScott,"VFX professional here. Greenscreen compositing is part of an overall technique called chromakey. You effectively tell the computer a color it should isolate, and it selects that very narrow wavelength of color from the image and makes it transparent. Depending on the algorithm (keyer) you're using you then have various ways to expand the range of hue/saturation/brightness the keyer will consider. 

Any color can be used, but green or blue are typically used because most of the time you're dealing with human subjects, and human skin tones are mostly red, so subtracting the screen won't tend to affect the character. Bluescreen used to be the more popular color, as it responded better to the optical extraction techniques of the pre-digital age. Green has become more prevalent since the dawn of digital, as digital sensors respond more strongly to green light, but the keying algorithms are so advanced at this point that it's really down to personal preference and/or a particular restriction -- e.g. if you have a character like Superman who wears blue, or Peter Pan who wears green, that will dictate the necessity for the opposite screen color. It's also typically easier to extract light-colored hair from bluescreen and dark colored hair from greenscreen, since there's more contrast. 

The way it USED to work in the optical days is MUCH more interesting, involving progressively filtering wavelengths of light to produce high-contrast isolations (mattes) of the screen, and a negative-image isolation of everything else, which were then used effectively as stencils on foreground and background so they could be cleanly double-exposed together without overlapping. Because this process had to go through several generations, the edges of both stencils would tend to get soft, which is why in pre-digital effects films you will see the telltale black outlines around things which have been extracted and layered over the background.

Now due to this background being such a solid colour it stands out when a subject stands in front of them (unless they are wearing green which is a big no-no as the process will not work properly). The background is then selected and an image is projected onto it. As only the background is selected and not the subject the subject appears in front of the projected image. Nothing complicated.

DorkmanScott,"VFX professional here. Greenscreen compositing is part of an overall technique called chromakey. You effectively tell the computer a color it should isolate, and it selects that very narrow wavelength of color from the image and makes it transparent. Depending on the algorithm (keyer) you're using you then have various ways to expand the range of hue/saturation/brightness the keyer will consider. 

Any color can be used, but green or blue are typically used because most of the time you're dealing with human subjects, and human skin tones are mostly red, so subtracting the screen won't tend to affect the character. Bluescreen used to be the more popular color, as it responded better to the optical extraction techniques of the pre-digital age. Green has become more prevalent since the dawn of digital, as digital sensors respond more strongly to green light, but the keying algorithms are so advanced at this point that it's really down to personal preference and/or a particular restriction -- e.g. if you have a character like Superman who wears blue, or Peter Pan who wears green, that will dictate the necessity for the opposite screen color. It's also typically easier to extract light-colored hair from bluescreen and dark colored hair from greenscreen, since there's more contrast. 

The way it USED to work in the optical days is MUCH more interesting, involving progressively filtering wavelengths of light to produce high-contrast isolations (mattes) of the screen, and a negative-image isolation of everything else, which were then used effectively as stencils on foreground and background so they could be cleanly double-exposed together without overlapping. Because this process had to go through several generations, the edges of both stencils would tend to get soft, which is why in pre-digital effects films you will see the telltale black outlines around things which have been extracted and layered over the background.

Now due to this background being such a solid colour it stands out when a subject stands in front of them (unless they are wearing green which is a big no-no as the process will not work properly). The background is then selected and an image is projected onto it. As only the background is selected and not the subject the subject appears in front of the projected image. Nothing complicated.

ofeykk,"I am going to attempt to translate, as best as I can, your problem into a mathematical question. I suspect you are making a bunch of assumptions here which I will try to make more formal.

First, with the view of simplifying as much as possible yet retaining the crux of the original problem, you can make the following assumptions (removing each would yield a slightly different problem to solve):

1. Look for curves not in 3-space but in 2-space.
2. Simplify curvature of earth to be flat — seek planar curves.
3. Simplify sun to be on this flat plane as a point.
4. Simplify yourself to be a point on the sought curve.
5. 180 degrees view is equivalent to dividing the plane by the tangent to the curve at your location (point).
6. Choose an orientation for the curve. This helps fix what it means for a point to be in your field of view or equivalently, to be in the ""correct"" half space of the tangent to the point (you) on the curve.
7. Parametrize looping around the curve to be traveling along the unit interval [0, 1] with the end points {0} and {1} identified — essentially a fancy way of saying that the end points of the interval are glued.
8. Assume that the sun is fixed relative to the time taken to loop around the curve once.
9. Finally is the curve sought smooth or not ? (A circle is a smooth curve whereas a triangle isn't one.) I believe it's easier (at least for me) to imagine smooth curves. Also, will exclude wild curves like space filling curves simply because I am not comfortable dealing with those !!

Now, the question is to find a curve that maximizes the view of the sun when you loop around once.

It appears to me that solution would depend on whether you would wish to make a further assumption about whether your plane is unbounded or not. 

If the plane is unbounded, the answer is simple — any straight line not through the point representing the sun would do.

If the domain on which the curve is sought is compact (or technically if its closure is compact) — think finite if you wish, like a square plot or a circular plot of land — then it depends on where the sun is located relative to this domain. Some examples that come off the top of my mind are as follows:

1. Circular region with the sun in the center: Take any diameter and take a tube around the diameter. This tubular region would have a boundary curve composed of two straight lines (chords of the circle) with a small part of the circular's plot's boundary (two of these actually). You can make this tubular region as small as you please and would provide you with a curve for which the sun is visible for as long as you please. (In other words, give me a number for which you wish the sun to be visible, say 99.99%, and I can give you a *width* of this tubular region for which it would be realized. Make it 99.9999999% and I'll give you a different number for the width and so on.)

2. A circle with the sun not in the center: Use the same idea as in example 1. Drop a radius from the center of the circular plot to the boundary that passes through the sun. Measure the distance, say r, from the sun to the boundary of the circle. Draw a smaller circle within the larger circular plot with radius r and centered at the sun. Repeat example 1.

3. A square with the sun at the intersection of the diagonals: Repeat example 1 with the a circle of length equal to the distance from the sun to any one of the vertices of the square.

4. A square with the sun not at the intersection of the diagonals. Easier to say that one should fall back to example 3 but rather simply draw a circle centered at the sun with a radius equal to the shortest distance from the sun to the boundary of the square.

Moreover, since wind tends to move faster the higher you move up from the ground, there is usually an effective sound speed gradient as well. In the presence of a sound speed gradient, sound waves tend to refract towards regions of lower sound speed. As a result, sounds sent out against the wind will tend to refract upwards, and sounds made with the wind will tend to refract downwards. Sounds made cross-wind will tend to refract downwind and up. And since your listeners tend to be near the ground (relatively speaking) the net effect is that sounds carry further with the wind than against it.

KerSan,"Energy is a consequence of a symmetry in the laws of physics. This is a deep point, so let me try to explain.

It is first worth explaining probably the most important concept in physics, momentum. Early on in your education, you are told that it is simply mass times velocity. This turns out not to be true generally, because momentum is really what is called the 'generator' of translations.

Consider a point particle that has a definite position in space. That position is actually an arbitrary label, since it refers to your chosen co-ordinate system rather than some actual property of the universe. You could just as easily switch co-ordinate systems by, say, moving the origin of your co-ordinates somewhere else. This action of shifting co-ordinates is called 'translation'.

Now let us suppose that the particle is moving (relative to you, the observer). No matter which co-ordinates you chose, you will notice that the position of the particle is changing over time. If you want to predict where you will see the particle next, you need to translate the last known co-ordinates of the particle by some amount. That translation is determined by the momentum of the particle. Keep in mind that the momentum is not changed when you translate your co-ordinate system. The momentum is, in a technical sense, dual to position.

What does this have to do with energy? Well, energy happens to be the generator of translations in time. This is because *energy is defined to be that quantity which remains invariant under translations in time*, much as momentum is that quantity which is invariant under translations in position. Your co-ordinates for time are just as arbitrary as your co-ordinates for position, because your choice of starting time is your choice and not some property of the universe.

Energy therefore tells you something about how quickly the properties of an object change over time. The more energy, the faster changes can happen. I could write essays explaining this further, but I don't want to lose you.

Work is the addition or subtraction of energy from a system. That energy can be added in a variety of ways, but it is common in early physics education to think in terms of force rather than energy. Energy is actually more fundamental than force, so I'll explain the force times displacement rule by first explaining force in terms of energy.

Force is the derivative of potential energy with respect to position. If you think of the potential energy of a particle as a function of the position of the particle (for instance, gravitational potential varies linearly in the height of the object), then force experience by the particle at a given position is the slope of the potential function at that position. In other words, force is the negative change in potential energy (i.e. the work) divided by displacement (in an infinitesimal sense). Multiply both sides by displacement and you have the relation work = force * displacement.

Hope that helps.",null,2,cdlzluj,1rcojz,askscience,top_week,7
miczajkj,"What is energy?

This is a very interesting question - but we we don't have an answer to this. We formulate physics in equations and stuff and there is this certain quantity that shows up in some of them and seems to be conserved under certain circumstances. 

The first kinds of energy you encounter, when you start to think about physics are the kinetic energy and the potential energy.
Assume a body at the position x that is exposed to a force F(x). Following Newton, you get the differential equation

m*x°° = F(x) 

The second derivative of the bodies displacement with respect to time times its mass is equal to the force on the particle.  
If it is possible to write the force as the derivative of a potential, namely F(x) = -V'(x) you see, that the following quantity is conserved for every solution of the mentioned equation: 

E = 1/2 mx°² + V(x) 

If you take it's derivative, you see: 
E° = m*x°*x°° + V'(x)*x° = x°*(mx°°-F(x))

So if the differential equation is fulfilled, then E' = 0 follows directly. 

You can see: because of the form of the differential equation that describes the movement, there is a certain quantity, that won't change - we call it a conserved quantity. 

If you dive deeper into the mathematical foundament of physics, you find that symmetries are responsible for the most conserved quantities. The energy for example, is only conserved, if the physical laws describing the process are time independent. 

All in all: energy is just a number. A phrase like 'pure energy' is nonsense. Energy is just a quantity, that appears in our equations. 

Work is defined as the change in energy you need to apply to a system, to move it from one state to another. In most cases this movement is a spatial movement from one place to another - then work is just the difference in potential energies, 

W = V_1 - V_2

or because V'(x) = F(x) 

W = integral F(x) dx

For forces that don't depend on position, you get 

W = F*x

Basically the reason xrays are emitted is because of the static electricity generated by separating the tape film from the surface below it. As the tape is pulled away, an electrical field is formed at the point of separation. As the roll rotates away, the film separates from the layer below it, reducing the strength of the field between the point that just separated, and the point at which it was previously touching. Meanwhile a new point has just separated from the roll, and higher strength field is formed at that point. The result is an electrical field at a gradient intensity in the wedge between the roll and film. At the point of separation, the field strength is so high electrons are ripped away from the film material. The film material was also electrically charged as part of the manufacturing process to get it to roll up smoothly.

cromonolith,"The only thing stopping this from being intuitive to you is what ""bigger"" means. 

You're used to judging the sizes of things by counting each of them and comparing the numbers. That is, if I gave you two bunches of apples, you might count and see that there are 10 apples in the first bunch and 14 in the second, and conclude that the second bunch is bigger. 

That's fine, but it's not a good way of measuring the size of infinite collections. So here's a better way of comparing the size of two collections: make a pairing between the collections, and the one that has stuff left over is bigger. 

As an example, let's say we had a huge auditorium and a huge crowd of people who want to see a show there. What's the best way to see if we have the same number of seats as people? You can count the seats and the people, but that's dumb. The smart thing to do is to tell everyone to sit down. As long as no one sits down stupidly (two people in the same chair), then you can easily check. If there are empty seats left over there are more seats than people. If there are people left standing there are more people than seats. 

What does this have to do with infinities? Well, this kind of pairing (like pairing people with seats) is a function. If no two people sit in the same seat, the function is called ""injective"" (or ""one-to-one""). If no seats are left unoccupied, the function is called ""surjective"" (or ""onto""). If a function is both injective and surjective (one person to a seat and all the seats are filled) the function is called ""bijective"". 

Bijective functions are what we use to compare the sizes of all sets, including infinite ones. Two sets are *defined* to be the same size if there exists a bijective function between them. So for example, the set of all natural numbers **N** = {1, 2, 3, 4, ....} is the same size as the set of even numbers 2**N** = {2, 4, 6, 8, ...} because, as you can check, multiplication by two is a bijective function from the former to the latter. That is, the function f where f(n) = 2n hits every even number and never sends two numbers to the same even number. 

On the other hand, you might want to compare the set of natural numbers as above to the set **R** of real numbers (the whole number line). This isn't obvious, but there's a [relatively straightforward proof](http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath371.htm) that no matter how you try, it's impossible to make a bijective function from **N** to **R**, so they can't have the same size. Since **N** is actually a subset of **R**, we say the size of **N** is smaller than the size of **R**. ",null,1,cdlzcjv,1rcjr9,askscience,top_week,18
rlee89,"There are several notions of size when it comes to infinity.  The most common is *cardinality* which in lay terms asks whether one infinity can be fit (or more formally, mapped) into another.

We would formally call this a bijection between the positive integers and the rational numbers, and it would demonstrate that the two are the same cardinality.

protocol_7,"Here's another way of thinking about it: Any natural number can be represented by a finite amount of information. (For example, you can write it down in base 2 as a finite string of 0's and 1's.)

However, a real number has an *infinite* string of digits past the decimal point, so there's no guarantee that any particular real number can be expressed using a finite amount of information. (And, in fact, most real numbers *cannot* be uniquely identified by any finite amount of information.)

So, intuitively, it's the difference between finitely many versus infinitely many ""degrees of freedom"". Since specifying a single real number can involve an infinite number of choices of digit, there are vastly more real numbers than natural numbers.

This is just a vague intuition, though. You can make it precise using [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), but that's rather technical. Instead, here's how to see very quickly that some infinite sets are larger than others — in particular, that given any set (finite or infinite), there's another set that's larger.

By definition, two sets have the same [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) (basically, size) if they can be put into [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) with each other — that is, if you can pair up elements of the sets so that each element of one set is paired up with a unique element of the other set.

**Theorem** ([Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_theorem))**.** Let S be any set, and let P(S) be the [set of all subsets of S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set). Then S and P(S) do not have the same cardinality.

*Proof.* Let f be any function from S to P(S), that is, for each element x in S, we assign a unique element f(x) in P(S). Since each f(x) is a subset of S, we can ask whether x is an element of f(x). In particular, let T be the set of all elements x of S such that x is *not* an element of f(x).

Now we can ask, is there some element y in S such that f(y) = T? Suppose there was: then we can ask whether y is an element of T. If it is, then y is an element of f(y), so by the definition of T, y is not an element of f(y) — a contradiction. If it isn't, then y is not an element of f(y), so by the definition of T, y *is* an element of f(y) — again a contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible for such an element y to exist. So no element of S is paired up with T.

Thus, *any* attempt to pair up elements of S and elements of P(S) fails, which means that S and P(S) don't have the same cardinality. ∎

But we can embed S inside P(S) by sending each element x in S to the [singleton set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_%28mathematics%29) {x}, a subset of P(S). So, in fact, S is strictly smaller than P(S).

Notice that there's no mention of whether S is finite or infinite. (If S is finite with n elements, then P(S) has 2^n elements.) So the proof is valid regardless, meaning that it's true for infinite sets, too.

For instance, if we denote the set of natural numbers by **N**, then P(**N**) is strictly bigger than **N**. (Actually, it turns out to be the same size as the set of real numbers.) And the set P(P(**N**)) is bigger than that, and so on.",null,1,cdlzsre,1rcjr9,askscience,top_week,2

Polyknikes,"Short answer: Stimulation of the vagus nerve (CN-X) which induces bradycardia.

Long answer:

I had not heard the term apneic pause before but from googling it you are referring to a cessation of breathing for at least 10 seconds, commonly referenced in relation to sleep apnea.  I didn't know the term but I do understand cardiac physiology.

In 10 seconds your oxygen saturation levels do not drop by a measurable level.  Try holding your breath while using an oxygen saturation meter and see if you can even get it to go down by 1% - it's really difficult even if you can hold your breath for several minutes.  So I don't believe it is related to lack of oxygen unless we are talking about a much longer duration apneic pause.

During normal inspiration and expiration the heart rate increases and decreases, respectively.  This is thought to be induced by changes in vagal nerve tone (activity) but the mechanism by which breathing influences vagal tone is not understood.  The vagus nerve acts to reduce heart rate by hyperpolarizing the intrinsic pacemaking cells of the heart.  

Stimulating the vagus nerve would decrease heart rate and this can be accomplished by various means including hypoventilation, hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, or vigorous inspiratory effort against a closed airway known as the Mueller's maneuver.  In the case of obstructive sleep apnea a person may be attempting to inspire but cannot due to a blockage of their airway (usually seen in obesity) which could stimulate the vagus nerve by the Mueller's maneuver mechanism.  But again, the exact mechanism by which the vagus nerve is stimulated by these pressure changes is not known, it has simply been observed indirectly.

Ruiner,"This is a cool question with a complicated answer, simply because there is no framework in which you can actually sit down and calculate an answer for this question.

The reason why know that photons travel at ""c"" is because they are massless. Well, but a photon is not really a particle in the classical sense, like a billiard ball. A photon is actually a quantized excitation of the electromagnetic field: it's like a ripple that propagates in the EM field.

When we say that a field excitation is massless, it means that if you remove all the interactions, the propagation is described by a wave equation in which the flux is conserved - this is something that you don't understand now but you will once you learn further mathematics. And once the field excitation obeys this wave equation, you can immediately derive the speed of propagation - which in this case is ""c"".

If you add a mass, then the speed of propagation chances with the energy that you put in. But what happens if you add interactions? 

The answer is this: classically, you could in principle try to compute it, and for sure the interaction would change the speed of propagation. But quantum mechanically, it's impossible to say exactly what happens ""during"" an interaction, since the framework we have for calculating processes can only give us ""perturbative"" answers, i.e.: you start with states that are non-interacting, and you treat interactions as a perturbation on top of these.

Photons are the same. The water in that case is ""the electromagnetic field"". The ""photons"" are the ripples in the water. They don't accelerate. The water itself has certain physical properties (density, etc.) that cause any of its waves to move at a specific speed.

Thalesian,"The simple answer is that it leaves the photon source and reaches its destination at the same 'time'. But let's walk through it:

Einstein said a couple of funny things with his theory of relativity. First, that E = MC2. E is energy, M is mass, and C is the speed of light. He also said that space and time were the same thing - they could be characterized as a space-time continuum. The implication of this was that if you have mass, then for you to cross a distance, you would also have to cross time. Look around you - for you to walk to a wall or a chair would require you to travel both space and time. 

But he didn't call it relativity for nothing. The concepts of distance and space are not universals. Pretend that you get in a spaceship that can travel 99.9% the speed of light. You can't go the speed of light because you have mass, and with mass comes a speed limit. But let's pretend Apple built a fancy spaceship, then Samsung made a copy called the Galaxy SS, and you get to take it for a drive. You hop in and journey for the stars, traveling 99.99% the speed of light. Your twin brother/sister stays on worth to watch over things. However, after a year you realize that you can't live without reddit because ಠ_ಠ, and turn back for Earth, again at 99.99% the speed of light. How much time has passed for you? Easy answer, 2 years. But much more time has passed on earth, hundreds to thousands of years, depending on how close to light speed you approach. Your twin brother/sister is either old, or long gone. The effect is known as Time Dilation. 

This phenomenon is weird. The faster you go relative to another person your respective perceptions of time diverge. But you can't go the speed of light because you have mass. For a photon, which is massless, the speed of light is possible. But, if time slows down for you relative to folks on Earth as you move in a spaceship, how much time passes for a massless photon? 0. In Einstein's view of physics, the speed of light is a constant, both space and time are relative experiences for particles with mass.

This is a profoundly weird view of the world. We describe light as traveling at a set velocity of 299,792,458 meters per second. We even define distances by the amount of time it takes for light to travel at this speed. Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light years from Earth, meaning light takes that long to reach your eyes. But to light, no time passes, and no distance is crossed. A photon leaves the star and enters your eye at the same time. There is no acceleration to the speed of light, it is the speed that exists when you have no mass.  

Incidentally, this is why the wavelength idea of light, while useful for mathematical predictions, is incorrect. A wavelength requires a length, and photons don't have a length anymore than they have an experience like time. You may hear about folks who have slowed lights to (almost) a stop, but all they have done is change the speed of light relative to us by adding obstacles like cooled Rubidium atoms. As photons take a long path (in our frame of reference) through multiple electron shells between atoms, it seems to take longer for them to cross a distance. But, at the end of the day, they move at the speed of light.

We can create photons, and when you see them you are destroying them in your eye. In fact, the very detector destroys the photons it measures. Strictly speaking (and if I'm wrong on this, correct me), a photon has yet to be observed before its point of annihilation. The idea of acceleration doesn't work right because that assumes there was a position of rest. Rather, think about photons as constantly in motion at the speed of light until annihilation.

A photon is generated at the point in time/space that an electron changes energy state.  When an electron has been excited by an energy source, it rises higher in the electron shells around the atom's nucleus.  At this higher energy point, an opening in a lower shell is available.  The electron falls into this lower energy shell and must in the process lose energy to stay there.  The ""pressure"" developed as the electron transfers has to be released in the form of a photon.  The number of shells the electron drops determines the total energy dumped into the photon.  The photon inherently cannot exist at anything other than the speed of light.

bloonail,"A photon can be modeled in the classical sense somewhat like a kink in the electric field that has become detached from its source as the source retreated. So a rotating electric charge can emit photons because the electric field cannot collapse back on the moving charge as the charge recedes. That portion of the field that is withheld from collapsing by relativity is released as a photon. 

However more accurately the electromagnetic field is maintained by photons. It only exists through them as a mediating particle. The field measured at any point in an electromagnetic field is measured in photons. In the situation of a static non-moving charge the photons are in a 1/r2 relationship through radio waves to their point of origin, but those photons do spread out infinitely at the speed of light from that point.

The ""kink"" idea is an unsatisfying 1930's [model](http://m.eet.com/media/1141968/82251f5.pdf) but it hints to some degree how the photon is released at the speed of light. It is by nature at the speed of light, at least in this model, because it is energy that has separated away due to kinda getting lost in space and unable to retreat back onto its charge. It is lost because the electric field is expanding at the speed of light. 

Its a weak model. Its useful mostly for showing how high energy photons are created by sudden acceleration changes. It explains antennas at a very basic level. The photons exist as a field at all times, they become higher energy photons through accelerations.

I like the notion that all photons are the same. It is really only our reference frame that changes their energy.

As for the question of whether they accelerate. Its sort of related to the permittivity and permeability of free space. These can be complex numbers or tensors, and as they compose the speed of light the speed of light varies. The speed of light in some [crystals] (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130813201436.htm) is different for different directions and all are different from what it is in free space.

However in no sense do they accelerate to light speed in the way a Mercedes might accelerate on the autobahn (*like I know).. They're at the speed of light in that medium, always. Their acceleration is more akin to their changing wavelengths. They gain energy by becoming associated with a reference frame that is different. So for example gamma rays hitting us from gamma ray bursts, in the old style classical viewpoint somewhere that gamma ray was a radio wave... emitted from something that is going very close to the speed of light relative to us.

And all the answers we get are those relating the 'in' with the 'out' states, they never tell us anything about the intermediate states of the theory - when the interaction is switched on.",null,207,cdlyfi3,1rccq1,askscience,top_week,1144
DanielSank,"/u/Ruiner's answer is great but maybe got a little bit too technical for OP's current level. I'll try to add to that great post.

Think of what happens when you dip your finger in a pool of water. You see ripples propagate outward from where you dipped your finger. Those ripples move at a certain speed, and occupy a reasonably well defined region of space.

Photons are the same. The water in that case is ""the electromagnetic field"". The ""photons"" are the ripples in the water. They don't accelerate. The water itself has certain physical properties (density, etc.) that cause any of its waves to move at a specific speed. The water waves are not a single object in the usual sense... they're displacements of something else. You should think of ""photons"" the same way.

Here's the kicker: Everything travels at the speed of light, according to the tried and true theory of special relativity. You, I and all the planes in the sky get that same energy to travel at this cosmic 'c' constant speed, but we who have mass travel in time dimension in addition to space dimension. You don't notice you're traveling at 'c' speed because 'time' passing by at near 'c' speed is a common sense and native to you since you're born. To the massless photons, they travel at 'c' speed in only space dimensions, and they don't experience time at all. Remember, space and time are just dimensions.

Thalesian,"The simple answer is that it leaves the photon source and reaches its destination at the same 'time'. But let's walk through it:

Einstein said a couple of funny things with his theory of relativity. First, that E = MC2. E is energy, M is mass, and C is the speed of light. He also said that space and time were the same thing - they could be characterized as a space-time continuum. The implication of this was that if you have mass, then for you to cross a distance, you would also have to cross time. Look around you - for you to walk to a wall or a chair would require you to travel both space and time. 

But he didn't call it relativity for nothing. The concepts of distance and space are not universals. Pretend that you get in a spaceship that can travel 99.9% the speed of light. You can't go the speed of light because you have mass, and with mass comes a speed limit. But let's pretend Apple built a fancy spaceship, then Samsung made a copy called the Galaxy SS, and you get to take it for a drive. You hop in and journey for the stars, traveling 99.99% the speed of light. Your twin brother/sister stays on worth to watch over things. However, after a year you realize that you can't live without reddit because ಠ_ಠ, and turn back for Earth, again at 99.99% the speed of light. How much time has passed for you? Easy answer, 2 years. But much more time has passed on earth, hundreds to thousands of years, depending on how close to light speed you approach. Your twin brother/sister is either old, or long gone. The effect is known as Time Dilation. 

This phenomenon is weird. The faster you go relative to another person your respective perceptions of time diverge. But you can't go the speed of light because you have mass. For a photon, which is massless, the speed of light is possible. But, if time slows down for you relative to folks on Earth as you move in a spaceship, how much time passes for a massless photon? 0. In Einstein's view of physics, the speed of light is a constant, both space and time are relative experiences for particles with mass.

This is a profoundly weird view of the world. We describe light as traveling at a set velocity of 299,792,458 meters per second. We even define distances by the amount of time it takes for light to travel at this speed. Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light years from Earth, meaning light takes that long to reach your eyes. But to light, no time passes, and no distance is crossed. A photon leaves the star and enters your eye at the same time. There is no acceleration to the speed of light, it is the speed that exists when you have no mass.  

Incidentally, this is why the wavelength idea of light, while useful for mathematical predictions, is incorrect. A wavelength requires a length, and photons don't have a length anymore than they have an experience like time. You may hear about folks who have slowed lights to (almost) a stop, but all they have done is change the speed of light relative to us by adding obstacles like cooled Rubidium atoms. As photons take a long path (in our frame of reference) through multiple electron shells between atoms, it seems to take longer for them to cross a distance. But, at the end of the day, they move at the speed of light.

We can create photons, and when you see them you are destroying them in your eye. In fact, the very detector destroys the photons it measures. Strictly speaking (and if I'm wrong on this, correct me), a photon has yet to be observed before its point of annihilation. The idea of acceleration doesn't work right because that assumes there was a position of rest. Rather, think about photons as constantly in motion at the speed of light until annihilation. Without M, there is only E = C2.

Remember than the law of conservation of mass/energy applies, it is not possible to create or destroy mass/energy. (with a bunch of caveats, mostly having to do with ""information"" going places it can't be retrieved from!)

A photon is generated at the point in time/space that an electron changes energy state.  When an electron has been excited by an energy source, it rises higher in the electron shells around the atom's nucleus.  At this higher energy point, an opening in a lower shell is available.  The electron falls into this lower energy shell and must in the process lose energy to stay there.  The ""pressure"" developed as the electron transfers has to be released in the form of a photon.  The number of shells the electron drops determines the total energy dumped into the photon.  The photon inherently cannot exist at anything other than the speed of light.  Therefore, it always travels at the speed of light.

bloonail,"A photon can be modeled in the classical sense somewhat like a kink in the electric field that has become detached from its source as the source retreated. So a rotating electric charge can emit photons because the electric field cannot collapse back on the moving charge as the charge recedes. That portion of the field that is withheld from collapsing by relativity is released as a photon. 

However more accurately the electromagnetic field is maintained by photons. It only exists through them as a mediating particle. The field measured at any point in an electromagnetic field is measured in photons. In the situation of a static non-moving charge the photons are in a 1/r2 relationship through radio waves to their point of origin, but those photons do spread out infinitely at the speed of light from that point.

The ""kink"" idea is an unsatisfying 1930's [model](http://m.eet.com/media/1141968/82251f5.pdf) but it hints to some degree how the photon is released at the speed of light. It is by nature at the speed of light, at least in this model, because it is energy that has separated away due to kinda getting lost in space and unable to retreat back onto its charge. It is lost because the electric field is expanding at the speed of light. 

Its a weak model. Its useful mostly for showing how high energy photons are created by sudden acceleration changes. It explains antennas at a very basic level. The photons exist as a field at all times, they become higher energy photons through accelerations.

I like the notion that all photons are the same. It is really only our reference frame that changes their energy.

As for the question of whether they accelerate. Its sort of related to the permittivity and permeability of free space. These can be complex numbers or tensors, and as they compose the speed of light the speed of light varies. The speed of light in some [crystals] (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130813201436.htm) is different for different directions and all are different from what it is in free space.

However in no sense do they accelerate to light speed in the way a Mercedes might accelerate on the autobahn (*like I know).. They're at the speed of light in that medium, always. Their acceleration is more akin to their changing wavelengths. They gain energy by becoming associated with a reference frame that is different. So for example gamma rays hitting us from gamma ray bursts, in the old style classical viewpoint somewhere that gamma ray was a radio wave... emitted from something that is going very close to the speed of light relative to us.

Kerosene does not have a polar end, it is in other words a potential backbone to an oil.  Considering this, it would be classified more as a **fuel** rather than an oil.

Silicone oil does contain carbons and it maintains its ""oil"" status due to the polarity of the Si-O bond.  Non-polar end being the carbon groups that are attached to it.  The design of silicones have multiple chemical uses which sets them apart from conventional oils.

JohnSmith1800,"There's sort of two features going on here, the macro and microscopic, so I'll detail them both.

The light first passes through the pupil and lens, which focus it in particular on a small patch of the retina known as the fovea. This is where the concentration of cone cells (those which detect colour) is highest. You also have a lot of rod cells (just detect light generally, more sensitive in dark settings) here, but they're more common as you move away from the fovea. Collectively rod and cone cells are photoreceptors. These photoreceptors are hooked up to bipolar cells, horizontal cells and ganglion cells, which together do some initial ""processing"" of the image before it passes down the optic nerve to the brain. Interestingly, because the horizontal, bipolar and ganglion cells are actually between the retina and the pupil, the optic nerve has to travel through the retina, which creates a blind spot in each eye, about 15degrees off-centre (which your brain lies to you to fill in).

On the microscopic level, photons travel through the eye to the retina, where some encounter either rod or cone cells. In rod cells there is a stack of ""plates"" which are coated in an enzyme called rhodopsin. When a photon is absorbed by rhodopsin, it changes conformation and can activate another protein known as transducin. Transducin is what is known as a ""G-Protein"", when activated it in turn activates another protein in turn, which then changes cGMP (a small second messenger) into 5'-cGMP. This leads to a closure of Na^+ channels. This hyperpolarises (makes more negative) the cell. Neurons only release neurotransmitter when they depolarise, so this reduces the release of neurotransmitter. I'm not familiar with the exact pathway in cone cells, it is photopsin rather than rhodopsin which absorbs the photon, but otherwise I believe it to be generally similar. This whole process actually takes quite a while, about 200ms from memory between when the photon hits and when your photoreceptor's sodium channels close. This is because of the ""protein cascade"" which occurs, it takes time. However, it does greatly increase your sensitivity to light: A single rhodopsin can activate ~500 transducins, which will in turn do ~500 cGMP's each. This will close ~100 sodium channels, stopping 10^~11 ions, and hyperpolarising the cell by almost a mV. That is to say, your eyes are actually very sensitive to light.

Intriguingly photoreceptors are actually inhibitory neurons, they release a neurotransmitter which hyperpolarises other neurons. As such, when a photon is absorbed their rate of firing decreases, which increases the firing rate of bipolar cells. The rest of the neural pathways are way over my head, but it involves ""receptor fields"" and the other accessory neurons.

Shaking electric charge produces electromagnetic waves, just as shaking objects in air produces sound waves (the physics is different but the fundamental waveness is the same).  We make electromagnetic signals by shaking electric charges.  

Every time you switch on or off a circuit, you create electromagnetic waves - so there's a lot of electromagnetic noise all around us.  To punch through that interference, devices that signal each other (like radios, or phones, or wifi units, or whatever) pick a particular frequency and shake electric charges at almost exactly that frequency.  That's like cutting through the noise of a large room full of drunk people, with a particular clear tone (say, from a flute).  You can discern the flute even though it's not any louder than the people, because all the energy is concentrated into a single tone.

Small variations in the strength or frequency of the electromagnetic signal carry the information people want to transmit.  For an old-style AM radio, the strength of the signal indicates where the speaker cone of the receiver should go.  The station gets ""louder"" and ""softer"" very rapidly to move your receiver's speaker cone around, forming sound waves.  FM radios use small changes in the pitch of the radiofrequency tone to control where the speaker cone should go.  Digital radios like wifi or modern cell phones use variants on those two strategies to communicate streams of bits.  Those bits encode the sounds and internet packets that are being transmitted.

First off sugar does not neutralize the acidity. However you are correct that sourness is based on H+ ion mediated receptors on the tongue (TRP family receptors). 


I don't believe the sugar changes our tongues ability to taste sour because sweet and sour receptors are distinct from each other so there should not be competitive inhibition of sour receptors when a substance that activates sweet receptors is present. In fact, it is possible that the low pH from the sour substance is enhancing ligand binding to sweet receptors. This is what happens when you ""Taste Trip"" with miraculin. 

My thought is that you are experiencing both tastes simultaneously and therefore your brain in an attempt to process both tastes is not pronouncing the sour taste as strongly as it would if sour was the only taste happening. 

I am looking for a source to confirm this and will update if I can find something. 

Edit: May as well add (because its a common misconception) that the classic ""taste map"" that shows different areas of the tongue to have varying densities of different kinds of taste receptors is FALSE.",null,0,cdlxpl2,1rc6y9,askscience,top_week,1
Ruiner,"I'm having trouble understanding exactly what you mean. But let me try to answer:
(First, keep in mind that if there is a liquid inside, things are a lot more complicated because of convection, which makes thermalization faster than if there was only conduction)

You start heating the bottom of the point. At this point, that surface gains heat through the source and loses heat through conduction, fine. If you leave the source on, it will at some point reach a steady state. This state is not really thermal equilibrium, but it's a state in which you have a constant flux of heat from the bottom to the top, so there is a temperature gradient. You know that you reached the steady state because the temperature of everything inside the pot is no longer increasing, but all the energy coming in is compensated by energy going out. (btw, if you're trying to boil a pot of water, you never get to see the steady state, since the average temperature keeps on increasing).

Once you turn off the source, the steady state will now be approximately thermal equilibrium. It would be thermal equilibrium of the pot was a closed system, but since it interacts, it will still have a temperature gradient - the coldest parts being those that interact the most with the outside.

A lens does not create energy, it just focuses the energy so that there is a high power density in one small region and lower power densities in surrounding regions. If the power density is high enough in the focal region, the material heats up faster than it can cool to its surroundings, and its temperature steadily rises.

abstrusey,"""Normal"" is usually defined by sampling lots of apparently healthy individuals and then using statistics to calculate an expected range into which the large majority will fall. This range is often referred to as a ""reference interval."" For aspects of physiology (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, etc.), these ranges are typically set as a standard that you read in a book and/or memorize. For test values (e.g. sodium/potassium/pH value of the blood, red blood cell count, etc.), they are often established individually by the testing facility, and they typically print that range next to the value of the sample they analyzed. 

A reference interval can be established by collecting test results from at least 50 healthy adult animals/humans. In this example, therefore, the range would only represents adults. At least 50 juveniles (and you'd have to define the age range) would have to be collected to have a new ""normal"" range determined. Two statistical analysis techniques are used, based on the distribution of the data. For normal distribution (also called gaussian distribution), there is a ""bell curve"". The data has ""variance,"" which is a representation of how widely scattered most of the animals are when compared to the average of all of them (e.g. they may all be tightly clustered near the average (low variance), or they could be very high and very low away from the average (high variance)). This variance is represented by a number called the ""standard deviation."" In gaussian and non-gaussian distributions, you can use the average ± 2 standard deviations to select for the ""middle"" 95% of the data. The lowest and highest numbers that you collected are now your range, and putting a dash between them makes it a reference interval. In vet med, we have reference intervals for most parameters for dogs, cats, horses, cattle, goats and alpacas, and many exotic species as well.

You can go after the proteins that form the nucleic acids, because those are slightly different.  And there are some antibiotics that do exactly that.  But it's rather difficult to target bacterial nucleic acids themselves specifically.

There has been some research into using artificial nucleic acids to target specific segments of a genome and basically turn it off, but I don't think they've been able to get it into a practical form that could be used in medicine quite yet.

There has, however, been success in using DNA to determine what antibiotics a particular organism is susceptible to.  Currently one of the normal steps in treating a bacterial infection is to culture and ID the organisms involved, and also to perform a susceptibility test on them, which determines the effectiveness of a number of common antibiotics.  

Traditionally this was done by exposing them to the antibiotic at certain concentrations and seeing whether or not it grows.  The new process allows us to look for the genes responsible for certain types of antibiotic resistance.

The best example of how this is useful would be for MRSA.  If a doctor suspects a MRSA infection, he would traditionally do a culture, which would take 1-3 days to tell him anything.

bohr_exciton,"Air is not completely transparent, however we perceive it as such for two reasons:

1) The various molecular and atomic species that make up the atmosphere can only absorb light at specific frequencies. If you look at the absorption spectra of the species making up thee majority of the atmosphere, such as nitrogen (N2), you will see that for most of them there will only be negligible absorption in the visible part of the spectrum. 

2) The density of air is so low that we can't perceive the minimal absorption that does take place. The best example of this is water. Water actually has a blue color, which you can see by say looking at the sea. However water only absorbs weakly in the visible, such that to observe this color light needs to pass through meters of water before we can observe its absorption. If you just look at a glass of water, it will just look transparent. Now the density of water vapor in the atmosphere is much much lower than in the glass, and therefore you can't possible see this effect in air with your bare eyes.

Finally, as for why you can see the atmosphere from space, or why the sky looks blue, the answer is that while the atmospheric gases do not significantly absorb visible light, they can scatter the light. Moreover, the major scattering mechanism is so-called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs more strongly for higher energies.

owaisofspades,"It's a bit complicated, but I can give you the general idea.

During glucose metabolism you go through glycolyis, which gives you pyruvate. Pyruvate then gets converted to acetyl CoA. Now here's where it gets tricky. If you need energy, your cells are going to send the acetyl CoA through the Citric acid cycle to make loads of ATP. If you don't need energy, the acetyl CoA gets shunted to fatty acid synthesis.

YOu have some enzymes involved that activate the acetyl CoA into malonyl CoA, and this allows you to add an acetyl CoA to it, forming a chain. After a certain number of extensions you get palmitate, which is a freefatty acid, which can then be modified to form other fats or phospholipids, or which can be esterified with a glycerol molecule to form mono-, di-, triglycerides.

This takes place in the liver. Your liver then packages the TAGs into lipid containers (chylomicrons) and then put them into the blood stream. Then lipoprotein lipase on the surface of adipocytes grabs the chylomicron and pulls the TAGs out of them.

Now for the second part of your question. fatty acids don't get converted back into glucose as far as I know, but into acetyl CoA through a process known as beta oxidation (for short and medium chains, I don't remember the long-chain degradation process ATM). The acetyl CoA is for the liver to use (it's not water soluble so can't get transported in blood). For other tissues, the liver converts the acetyl CoA from Beta oxidation into ketone boies, which are water soluble and can be transported to other organs such as the brain through the bloodstream.

Polyknikes,"I don't think anyone will have an exact answer to your question because it would depend on which cell you are talking about, how well stocked they were beginning the fasting period, and how much energy they are being asked to expend over a given amount of time.  As an alternate answer I will discuss what happens during starvation which hopefully will answer your question.

In the normal course of starvation we first burn carbohydrates which basically refers to glucose.  Glucose is stored in many cells, but particularly in the liver hepatocytes, in the form of glycogen.  The breakdown of glycogen is referred to as glycogenolysis which releases glucose into glycolysis for energy production.

After all the glycogen is used up the body begins catabolizing (burning) proteins.  Protein catabolism involves the breakdown of bodily proteins into amino acids for use in synthesizing more glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis (which takes place in the liver).

Sometime during protein catabolism your body will begin the process of lipolysis which is the breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids which can be oxidized into multiple units of Acetyl-CoA and fed into the TCA cycle for energy production, bypassing glycolysis.  High rates of fatty acid oxidation will lead to ketogenesis, or the creation of ketone bodies.  Ketone bodies are another form of high-energy molecule like glucose which can be metabolized by many tissues and are especially important for the brain during the starvation state as it has high energy demands and cannot directly metabolize fatty acids.

TLDR: During starvation your cells first use glycogen (stored glucose), then catabolize proteins into glucose, then burn fats in the form of ketone bodies.

PepperJack_delicacy,"The ""pins and needles"" feeling is referred to as **paresthesia**, which occurs when a nerve and the arteries supplying the nerve are compressed. This prevents the nerve from carrying electrical impulses that transmit the sense of touch, which you feel as ""pins and needles"". 

It's harmless when it occurs transiently (like after you fall asleep on your hand) because once the pressure is removed, blood supply to the nerve will be restored. However, there are certain chronic cases that are indicative of neurological disease or more traumatic nerve injury, which are more serious.

In the case of a blood clot, though, you are created a plug in an artery that prevents blood flow to a tissue. There is nothing you personally can do (such as switch body positions) that will remove the clot. Furthermore, in the case of a heart attack or stroke, you are preventing blood supply to the heart or brain--two of the most important organs in the body, which absolutely need blood for you to survive.

You may know, that there are three generations of quarks and leptons, while our universe consists mostly from the first generation (up- and down-quarks + electrons and electron-neutrinos). But there are certain natural processes, that produce particles from higher generation, for example the cosmic radiation in the earth's athmosphere. 
The electron equivalent in the second generation is the muon - and if you construct muon-atoms your question gets important!

Like the others already mentioned, 'orbiting' electrons (or muons) don't really orbit the nukleus: their position gets described by a probability density; those densities are the absolute squares of the particles wave function. 
If you calculate those wave functions you find, that the probability density of the ground state has it's maximum at the classical Bohr radius, that can be calculated by using a semi-classical force approach (for muonic hydrogenium): 

Let the Coulomb-Force (ℏαc/r^2) equal the centripetal force (p²/mr). Also keep in mind the the uncertainty principle: pr ~ ℏ. It follows:

ℏαc/r^2 = ℏ^2 /mr^3 
r = ℏ/αmc

Now, because the mass of the muon is 200 times bigger than the mass of the electron, therefore it's Bohr Radius is 200 times smaller and if you also consider the finite circumference of the proton it is possible, that the muon may have finite probability to be found inside of the nukleus, especially if you talk about heavier nuklei. 

The main consequence is a displacement of the energy niveaus. This fact was used, to find the much used formula

r = 1.2 fm * A^(1/3) 

for the radius of the nukleus depending on the Mass number. 

Another consequence is the increased probability of decays like the K-capture, where a muon from the K-shell reacts with a proton:

invariance,"No. It is simply inconclusive, because there exist series which diverge and series which converge for which the ratio test gives 1. For the series a_n = 1/n, the sum diverges. For the series a_n = 1/n^2, the sum converges.

The ratios are not 1 in magnitude, except in the limit. Note also that both ratios converge to 1 from below. A refined version of the ratio test will tell you that if |a_{n+1}/a_n| &gt;= 1 for sufficiently large n (so the ratios converge to 1 from above), the series will diverge. The proof for this follows from what you have already said. So in fact, the only inconclusive case is if the limit of the ratios converges to 1 from below.

So the short answer is that if the limit of the ratios converges to 1 from below, the test is inconclusive because there are examples which converge and examples which diverge. ",null,1,cdlud5b,1rawis,askscience,top_week,6
iCookBaconShirtless,"The issue is not which direction that the limit is approached, as you conjecture.  While approaching 1 from above assures divergence, approaching from below does not assure convergence.  A simple example is the harmonic series.

They key to understanding the ratio test is to more precisely understand this statement that you made:  

&gt; I understand what happens when the limit is smaller than 1 (every element of the series is smaller than the previous by a factor L, hence the series tend to stabilize and converge).

The fact that every element of the sequence is smaller than the previous by a factor of L (at least in an asymptotic sense) implies that the sequence converges to zero **exponentially fast**.  Basically, it looks like a geometric series at large n.  This exponential convergence of terms is enough to ensure that the series converges, but it's strictly stronger than what is needed.  Plenty of series have terms that converge more slowly than exponentially, but still converge as a series.  Any p-series with p&gt;1 for example (e.g., 1/n^2 ).

tl;dr Ratio test determines exponential convergence of terms, which is more than is needed for convergence of series.",null,0,cdlv91r,1rawis,askscience,top_week,4
wgunther,"In order to understand the ratio test you have to understand the proof. The proof is if the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n goes to L&lt;1 then eventually the of consecutive terms is less than 1-epsilon for some small but positive epsilon, and therefore, the series is smaller than the geometric series a(1-epsilon)^n for some suitable a. Thus it converges by direct comparison. 

If L&gt;1 then you can do the same thing but with 1+epsilon. 

The problem is this proof doesn't work if L=1. The ratio test will only work when the sequence of the summand of the series converges *faster* than something geometric whose series converges or *slower* than something geometric whose series diverges. In the case when L=1, one can not compare the series to a geometric series that converges or diverges. ",null,0,cdmmc8x,1rawis,askscience,top_week,2
onyablock,"People can become immunocompromised through various ways including pregnancy, viral infection, steroid treatment etc. etc.

The reason it is important when considering vaccinations is that being immunocompromised can increase your risk of obtaining the infection to which you're being immunized against (if the vaccine is 'live' virus) or being vaccinated can be pointless as no immunity will actually be gained from the vaccine.

The effects of an immune deficiency on vaccines varies greatly depending on the vaccine and its application regiment. For example it could be recommended that you receive multiple booster shoots or don't receive the vaccine at all if you are immunocompromised. 

In the case of the flu shot, obtaining the killed-virus vaccine won't allow you to actually contract the flu, however the chances of you generating good and long lasting immunity to the flu is reduced if you are immunocompromised. Obtaining the 'live' attenuated vaccine would not be recommended for immunocompromised patients as there is potential for infection, hence why the box is there.

Inactivated or component vaccines won't put immunosuppressed patients at risk, but the patients might not gain much protection from the vaccine.  This is because immunosuppressed patient's won't be able to generate antibodies to help fight off future infections.

Immunosuppressed patients most certainly need to get vaccinated because they are at greater risk for getting serious complications from infections.  It's important for health care providers to know a patient's immune state in order to deliver the right kind of vaccine.",null,0,cdlk7wj,1rawff,askscience,top_week,3
Chandley54,"There're three reasons why you need to be immunocompetent when vaccinated. 

1. It is rare nowadays for a vaccination to be live &amp; pose a direct threat, some of them may revert to being harmful, for example attenuated vaccines commonly have a harmful gene removed before they are given to the host so they can be dealt with by the immune system without any significant risk. In some cases the process may not be perfect and so some live unattenuated virus may get into the vaccines, so although in theory the virus should not be able to establish itself and replicate, it sometimes can and is therefore much more hazardous to immunocompromised patients. The same is true for killed virus vaccines - in theory all of the virus should be dead, but whatever process they use to kill the virus (e.g. exposure to UV light) may be ineffective, so again, live virus may end up being present in the vaccine and lead to an active viral infection.
2. If a patient is immunocompromised, there is a possibility that the body will not be able to respond effectively and generate the necessary memory lymphocytes for the vaccine to be effective. This would mean that should the person then encounter a live version of the virus, the vaccine would not have provided them with any protection at all as the memory cells were not generated at the initial vaccination. so are not available to respond.
3. Although the vaccine you received was killed, the form you filled out was probably written by some legal team at some point in history when they were using a different type of vaccine, so they're basically just covering their own backs, and if may be expensive for them to change the documentation.

I would imagine it is likely a combination of the above 3 reasons!

For a second, forget that the Earth and Moon are orbiting, and picture the Earth falling straight down towards a stationary Moon. At the very start of our thought-experiment, the Earth is also stationary and its oceans are equally spread out across the entire surface.

The Earth then begins to accelerate towards the Moon, as is begins to fall. The ocean nearest the Moon experiences the greatest acceleration, because it is closer and therefore is exposed to the greatest force. Likewise, the ocean furthest from the Moon experiences the lowest acceleration for opposite reasons. The Earth itself, of course, experiences an average acceleration.

So! The Moon-side ocean begins to move away from the surface of the Earth, as it is accelerating faster than everything else, creating the bulge that is easiest to understand. The ocean on the other side, however, gets ""left behind"" because it is accelerating slower than the Earth. Essentially, the Earth is moving away from it, which creates the opposing bulge on the far side from the Moon.

That is how it works in our thought-experiment, but exactly the same thing happens in orbit because the Earth and Moon are essentially falling towards each other, and are constantly accelerating because of the constant change in direction.

redmeansTGA,"I'm only going to discuss the fungi, because you've asked a really complicated, fascinating question that touches on a lot of different fields. 

Firstly, a quick note on fungi. Most people think of fungi as things like mushrooms and bracket fungi- which belong to a phylum called the Basidiomycota. The other major group of fungi most people are aware of are the Ascomycota, which includes molds like aspergillus, the yeasts (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and a weird assortment of other things you might recognize from the forest floor. 

The fungi also contain a bunch of other, less familiar things as well, such as  the [microsporidia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia) and [Chytridiomycota](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycota). Some of these are really fascinating, and truly push the envelope when it comes to eukaryote biology. 

The oldest described fungi is a filamentous microfossil called Tappania , which was dated to 1,430Ma (Butterfield, 2005). This unicellular fungi likely lived in shallow water (Butterfield, 2005). The oldest ascomycete has been dated from 400mya, and interestingly was found in association with an early lycopod plant (Taylor, et al., 1999). More modern fossilized fungi have been found from the Cretaceous, which resemble yeasts.

 Aside from this, there is scant fossil evidence- fungi don't have hard parts that readily fossilize. Using molecular clocks is another way to measure the age of a taxon. Berbee et al.,(2010) did this and found an estimate date of divergence between the fungi and animals around ~1,600Ma. Molecular clocks have dated the origin of the hemiascomycetous yeasts to around ~100Ma, which was probably due to co-evolution between fermenting yeasts and fruiting plants (Piškur, et al., 2006). 

The fungi are a part of a large group of eukaryotes called the Opisthokonts, which includes the animals, as well as a couple of smaller groups of unicellular organisms. The opisthokonts, and their relatives (part of a larger group of eukaryotes called the Unikonts) diverged from the rest of the eukaryotes a *very* long time ago, and possibly represent the earliest divergence (Stechmann &amp; Cavalier-Smith, 2003). The lifestyle, morphology and genome architecture of these earliest eukaryotes is a contentious, though fascinating subject that I don't have time to go into. 

Plants evolution is just as fascinating. Very briefly, the earliest plants entered the land around ~500 million years ago. Probably around the same time as the earliest fungi came onto land. Plants and fungi likely co-evolved very early on- the earliest ascomycota fungi was found together with a lycopod plant. Ever since, plants and fungi have been doing interesting things together (and earlier, remembering lichens). 

Anyway, to sum up, fungi as a traditional kingdom are much older than plants, being perhaps some 1.6 billion years old. Plants date back perhaps 1 billion years (older if you count some related algae that I didn't discuss). Recognizably modern groups of both fungi and plants didn't arise until much later, however.

ColdWaterEnthusiast,"Good question. It is almost pointless to try and find out whether the Sahara is growing or shrinking, because of the sheer size of the desert (as well as demarcating what exactly constitutes 'desert'). In the late 90s to mid 2000s, the thought was that the Sahara desert was expanding southwards by a certain extent each year. This was of course somewhat exaggerated. On the other hand, so is the perception that the deserts are 'in retreat' as these articles seem to imply.

The thing is, between the late 70s to late 80s, there was a significantly dry period in the Sahel region (the transition zone between the Sahara and the savanna) which exacerbated the effects of desertification, leading to the perception in the 1990s-2000s that the desert was indeed expanding. However, over the last 15-20 years in terms of precipitation, the region has been in a comparatively very wet period. Relative to the significant drought the area previously experienced, it may seem that the deserts are in 'retreat' but arguably that is essentially what is expected in terms of how vegetation has responded (it gets a bit more complicated because some of the previous mesic vegetation has been replaced by xeric vegetation in certain areas so while it is greener, it is not quite the same)

PepperJack_delicacy,"Smoking cigarettes essentially speeds up the aging process of the skin, which leads to wrinkles. The main reason this happens is because **nicotine** is a **vasoconstrictor**, meaning that it narrows the blood vessels that supply the skin. When you impair blood flow, it has a harder time getting oxygen and absorbing nutrients such as **Vitamin A**, which normally keeps the skin hydrated and protects it from oxidative damage. Furthermore, it will have a harder time repairing wounds and synthesizing a protein called **collagen**, which keeps the structure of the skin intact.

For H^4 , the difference between that and H^3 is about ten times the mass of an electron. The energy benefit for H4 decaying is over 100 times greater than for H3 decaying.  Decay rates are related to the energy difference between mother and daughter states. Bigger energy difference, faster decay.

rupert1920,"Disclaimer: I'm not an expert in protein folding, and would love to be educated more on the matter.

Check out [Levinthal's paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levinthal's_paradox), which states that the sheer degrees of freedom a protein has makes it highly unlikely to spontaneously fold into the energetically stable conformation. Which means that there must be other effects - other than thermal sampling - that ""guide"" the protein into the proper conformation. This could be chaperones, or stable intermediates.",null,1,cdl9son,1raob3,askscience,top_week,5
Osymandius,"As /u/rupert1920 has said, Levinthal's paradox states that it would take longer than the age of the universe for a polypeptide of 100 residues to fold into the correct configuration by ""trying"" all phi/psi angles. Anfinsen et al (Anfinsen, CB et al (1961) ProcNatAcadSci 47, 1309-1314) showed that primary structure directly determines tertiary fold, therefore trying all the possible angles is not required - as was evident by proteins folding on a biological time scale and life existing to begin with!

Your question, therefore, is a very good one: if primary structure does determine tertiary structure, why bother with chaperones?

Ken Dill answers this nicely in an excellent review [here](http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v4/n1/abs/nsb0197-10.html). He encourages you not to think of protein folding pathways, rather protein folding tunnels where there exist multiple routes to the most stable configuration (i.e. the lowest energy). Through these multiple routes can exist ""energy traps"" - local energetic minima which require energy input to overcome such that the polypeptide can reach the final fold. This is where chaperones come in. You can sort of think of them as proteins which recognise improper folds - say extensive hydrophobic stretches facing the surface of a protein - pull them apart and say ""try folding again"". This is why we don't get trapped in an infinite loop: who folds the chaperones? The chaperones aren't specific to any one protein, rather they recognise common folding mistakes.

Sand becomes silt and then becomes clay.  Clay has interesting properties owing to its crystalline structure.  If you poured some of each of those differentiated silicates into water, the sand would settle out first, followed by the clay.  The middle group, silt, would actually stay in suspension for longer.

The reason for this is charged surfaces.  The silicate materials form in sheets.  The sheet as a whole tend to have a charge, especially as components of the repeating structure are often displaced by differently charged metal ions.  Consequently, the tiny fragments of sheets tend to stick together due to opposing charges.  

Ordinarily, the charges are too weak between larger particles.  The surface area to mass ratio isn't favorable.  As the surface area ratio shifts, surface charge starts to be more significant, whether as an aggregate, or a solution.  Additionally, as the material is ground down, the rate of disintegration slows down exponentially.  You would think this was odd or inverted, given that surface area ratio seems to approach infinity as particle size becomes vanishingly small.

SirJohannvonRocktown,"Assuming the particles that make up the substance are sphere, the short answer is it depends on the mass, volume, and number of particles in the substance. 

So how do you determine if it's valid to disregard the discrete particles that make up the fluid and model a substance as if it's infinitely divisible? 

This is referred to as the **continuum approximation** and there are mathematical ways to determine if it's a valid assumption.

The whole idea behind this is that we can average the random thermal motion of the molecules if the number of molecules are large and close enough. There's a lot that goes into this, but here's the gist.

If we have a fluid and we take a small enough volume of that fluid (say ⌂V_l for lower bound), we'll notice that at that volume of the substance, the statistical average or any property is meaningless because there is an insufficient number of particles contained in that substance at any given time. see: 

http://pillars.che.pitt.edu/files/course_10/figures/density_oscillate.gif

similarly, there is an upper bound (⌂V_u) due to non trivial spatial variation in the fluid properties. In other words, the density will increase non-linearly.

Assuming ⌂V_l &lt;&lt; ⌂V_u, we can define the continuum limit of the mass density at a point in a fluid is defined as,

rho = lim (as ⌂V -&gt; ⌂V_l) [⌂m/⌂V_l]

This is a good place to say that the density of a fluid can also be modeled as

rho = m*n

were m is the mass of the molecule and n is the number of molecules for a given volume.

The interesting thing here is that it's pretty much meaningless until you look at it's geometric context. Are these particles inside of a pipe, flowing past a wing, or doing something else?

The reason this is important is because fluids might or might not behave differently when a property or two are changed. For example, it might be turbulent or laminar. It might be very efficient on imparting and transferring energy to it's surroundings, or it might act as a damping mechanism. 

This is getting way too long, so I'll just try to finish up here.

Since we can't know how a particles behaves at all times and under all conditions, we have to determine whether the statistical mean is significant or not.

As far as the part about being non-reactive to CMV (cytomegalovirus), that simply means that you do not have antibodies to the virus.  This means that you have not been exposed to CMV before.  It doesn't mean that your blood ""type"" is non-reactive; we don't speak in terms of blood *types* being reactive or non-reactive to a virus.


As far as your O(-) status, I'm afraid she gave you some misinformation.  That does not mean that your blood is ""good"" for newborns.  It doesn't mean it is ""bad,"" either.  The (+) or (-), as you probably know, is referring to the presence or absence of Rh factor, which is a protein on the outside of red blood cells (you are either Rh+ or Rh-).  You DON'T have it.  Therefore, if your blood was exposed to blood that DID have it, your immune system could form antibodies against it, because it is recognized as something that is ""foreign"" to your body.


The importance of this would be if you would become impregnated by a male who is Rh(+).  In that case, the baby might inherit the gene from the father and also be Rh(+).  Therefore, if your blood (which is Rh-) was exposed to the baby's blood, whether during birth or some event during the pregnancy where bleeding occurred, your immune system could recognize the Rh factor on the baby's red blood cells and form antibodies, which would allow for an immune response at sometime in the future.  Your first baby would be just fine (the immune response takes too long that first time for it to put that baby in danger), but any babies you have after that are also Rh+ would be at risk of your immune system attacking their red blood cells, something we call [hemolytic disease of the newborn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythroblastosis_fetalis). 


There is good news, though!  We have developed something called Rhogam, which can prevent all this!  It's an injection that basically suppresses the mother's immune response to the Rh factor.  We can give it to pregnant women during their pregnancy and prevent the bad stuff that might have happened otherwise.  Science is great, isn't it?

CMV non-reactive as previously stated means you haven't been exposed to CMV.

See more information [here](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cmv/DS00938/DSECTION=symptoms).

As for O-, again as stated previously you lack the Rh factor that can cause an immune response in a recipient of a blood transfusion.  Your blood isn't just 'good for babies' (that's the CMV- part) you are actually known as the universal donor.  Your blood can be given to anyone regardless of blood type because you not only lack the Rh factor, but you also won't react with A or B blood because you being O lack those antigens as well.  Therefore your blood can be given to anyone A, B, AB or O without a life threatening reaction from their body.  In an emergency O- is given to a patient when there isn't time to check their blood type or until cross matched blood is available.

A positive CMV-IgM test would mean you have a current CMV infection. A positive CMV-IgG test would mean that you had been infected some time in the past. What's important is that if you have been infected some time in the past, you still have some level of the virus in your body; a negative CMV-IgM test doesn't mean that you are entirely free of the virus.

bohr_exciton,"That's actually a tricky question. The most direct explanation is that ice is slippery because it behaves as being wet, i.e. that there is liquid water between the bulk of the ice and an object gliding on the surface. However, what causes ice to be wet with respect to objects moving on it is still under debate. There was a Physics Today [article](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/58/12/10.1063/1.2169444) that came out a few years ago that neatly describes possible explanations. To briefly summarize them, they are as follows:

1) Pressure melting. Due to the fact that ice (at least the common form) is less dense than water, applying pressure reduces the melting point of the ice. To apply this example to say a skater, the idea is that a skate bay locally increase the pressure to a sufficient extent that the ice can melt, making it slippery locally and the water then refreezes after the skate passes. This is the most common explanation that has been invoked historically, but the problem is that it's not clear whether this additional pressure can be enough to melt the ice.

2) Frictional heating. When objects move across a surface there is (virtually) always some friction which results in local heating. Again, this heat may be enough to melt the ice.  This explanation, however, can't really explain why ice is slippery even for stationary objects immediately before moving. 

3) Ice may be intrinsically wet. In describing solids, we often tend to ignore surfaces to a first approximation, because this simplifies the description, but surfaces can behave very differently from the bulk. In the case of ice, it's been speculated that the different local environment of the first few layers of water molecules may result in this molecules being less strongly bound to the bulk than is the case for molecules within the body of this crystal. Because of this, these surface layers may behave as being liquid, which would then cause the ice to be slippery under all circumstances. ",null,0,cdl7ngd,1ra493,askscience,top_week,8

Their shape depends on the stabilizing interactions between positive and negative charges on the amino acids, on hydrophobic interactions, and on hydrogen bonding. A strong acid increases the concentration of hydrogen ions and thus affects the protonation/deprotonation status of the side chains on the amino acids. The correct folding of the protein will be interrupted if a group that is normally deprotonated at physiological pH is changed to being protonated, thus resulting in the change in appearance.

SidusObscurus,"For this question, you have to compare an inverse function, as defined by convention, with the solutions to an equation involving a function that is not one-to-one (invertible).

In order to define a function, you need exactly one output for each input. For possible multivalued functions, we select one solution completely by convention (sqrt function, inverse trig functions, and many others).

Solving x^2 = -1 has two answers, +i and -i, both imaginary.
Solving x^3 = -1 has three answers, e^(i*pi/3), -1 = e^(i*pi/3 +2*pi/3), and e^(i*pi/3 +4*pi/3).

To define the inverse functions of these equations, we can only pick one of these answers, so we pick one answer entirely based on mathematical convention and general agreement. Typically we pick the real number solutions first if we can (ex. cube root), positive part solutions after this if we can (ex. sqrt), and if it is still multivalued pick the solution set that intersects 0 if we can (ex. inverse trig functions). This defines the inverse functions x^(1/2) and x^(1/3). If we cannot do any of those, it's less clear what we pick, and mathematicians will usually explicitly state the solution branch they are using for their math, so no one is confused.

What about x^(2.5)? Once you have defined all the integer rational roots and powers, the standard convention is to interpret x^(5/2) as either of the two equal expressions,
sqrt(x^5) = sqrt(x)^5.
There is no ambiguity in these expressions. We could also solve
x^(2/5) = -1, which would have multiple solutions. Our solutions would be
e^(i*pi/2.5 + 2*pi*k/2.5) for each integer k.
See [Roots of Unity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity) and [Euler's Identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_Identity) for more information. In this case, we would only have 5 total solutions, due to the 5th root.

That provides a standardized interface between the hardware and the operating system, which is why you can load Windows on any Brand-X motherboard. OS/X has the same concept, though of course Apple only officially supports certain motherboards.

How much power it uses would be dependent on the motherboard design, but if it uses electronic starting, then it uses some small amount of power to monitor the button. I believe all modern motherboards do it this way. In the relatively distant past, they used to use a mechanical on-off switch, but there were a lot of advantages to electronic power on/off, so that became standard.

Whether you can use a different key, etc, is whether that feature is programmed into the BIOS. Here is a page that describes typical BIOS settings:

BIOS settings are usually accessed by pressing a special key when you start up the machine, but before it starts loading the operating system. I've typically seen the DEL key, the F2 key and the F8 key. I don't know how Apple does it. If it works like how Apple does other things, then they picked some arbitrary key that no one else uses. :)

Daegs,"no one says it ""must"" be. 

There are 4 forces: strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity.

The first 3 are all very similar, and in fact the weak / electromagnetic have been joined into a single force, the electro-weak. It *seems* that the strong also fits in very well mathematically, and it is expected in the coming years / decades that we could actually integrate all 3 (strong, weak, electric) into a single force. This is called ""Grand Unification"":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory

So the problem is asking why are 3 out of 4 of the forces so similar to the point where they can actually be shown to be the same underlying force, while gravity is such an oddball and so much weaker. 

One *possible* explanation is that all 4 of the forces are equal in strength, and could be unified into a single force, while gravity is special because it ""leaks"" its force to an unseen dimension. This would allow it, in theory, to be unified with the other 3 forces.

There are other explanations, including that gravity is an emergent property of our universe (such as holographic universe theory) rather than a fundamental force.

Or, it could simply be that gravity is fundamentally different from the other 3 forces, which would just be troubling for physicist.

Farnswirth,"Heat engines require a heat differential to function, by definition.  

However, what /u/JimmyGroove said was correct as well, and is merely another way of stating the first law, which is:  The change in total internal energy in a system (in this case an engine) is equal to the heat in, minus the heat out, minus the work done by the engine.  This is one of the most fundamental principles of thermodynamics, [the first law.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics)

For instance, you could have a very energetic system with no heat differential (eg. a cold car with a full tank of gasoline).  In this case, the heat inside the system (the car) would be at thermal equilibrium with the outside air because you haven't started the engine yet.  In this case, there would be no heat differential in the beginning.  The net reaction for the car as a system would be a conversion of internal energy (the chemical energy of the gasoline) into work.  *It's all a question of how you define your system.*  

So to answer your question - a heat engine requires a heat differential, by definition, because that's how a heat engine works.  But depending on how you define your ""engine"" (thermodynamic system) - you don't necessarily need a heat differential- for work to be produced.  But the energy must come from somewhere, and it must have somewhere to go.

Edit: Another good example of a system that does not require a heat differential to do work is a fuel cell, which directly converts chemical energy into electrical energy with no heat differential.

[A relevant paper on this topic](http://www.nature.com/news/sickle-cell-mystery-solved-1.9342)

Basically plasmodium, after infecting a red blood cell as part of its life cycle, hijacks RBC actin (a naturally occurring cell-strucure protein), to help it transport a protein of its own (adherin) to the RBC surface to make it stick to surfaces and other RBCs, which helps the plasmodium.

For sickle cell individuals, the mutant RBC actin can polymerize into long, stiff ""rods"" that distort the shape of the RBC and make it ""clog"" in capillaries. 

However, the plasmodium cannot effectively ""hijack"" the mutant RBC actin, which is the source of sickle-cell mediated malaria resistance.

Sickle cell homozygotes have mostly sickle-cell RBCs, which causes the clinical symptoms of sickle cell anemia.

Sickle cell heterozygotes have a mixture of sickle cell and non-sickle cell RBCs (which is not quite 50/50, as oxymoron 1629 explained), meaning they retain the malaria resistance while avoiding the worst of the anemia.",null,2,cdkuzei,1r8w0j,askscience,top_week,5

Technology  improvements and wiser land/water/air use could raise that maximum number, but it will stabilize again at the higher number unless additional resources are introduced into the food and energy production  system from other planets. 

This upper limit on population on earth is why space exploration is so critical to to the future of humanity.   Lets also hope China is smart enough not to launch a population  boom by lifting their one child policy amidst their current economic expansion, lest we reach that upper limit faster than technology can solve the problems that would cause.",null,1,cdl73zt,1r8tbm,askscience,top_week,2
TheMuslinCrow,"Each species has a population threshold for the environment it's in, known as the carrying capacity (K). This is determined by species requirements, as well as the environmental constraints on these requirements (food, space, etc). When a species population goes above this level, there's usually a setback in the form of disease or famine, and the resultant deaths bring the population back near the carrying capacity.

In the case of humans, we are able to artificially increase the size of our K through technology, medicine, urban planning and such. However, this planet has finite resources and space. So what is the carrying capacity for humans on Earth? We really won't know until we reach it. Some places such, as Japan and parts of Europe, seem to be nearing their K for their respective environments.

therationalpi,"I feel like you haven't gotten a satisfying answer yet, so I'm gonna try my hand at this.

To start, let's imagine what the air is like at rest. All of the air particles are bouncing around randomly, but *for the most part* they are all bouncing around at equilibrium. All of the air particles are where they want to be.

Now, let's say I blow on the air. I'm introducing a slug of fast moving air, with a good deal of kinetic energy. That air has not found it's equilibrium point, so it's going to carry forward. In the process, the air is slamming against the air around it that was formerly at equilibrium, imparting kinetic energy, and carrying it forward. A moment after the air first comes in, you now have a larger slug of slower moving air all trying to find an equilibrium position. The process then repeats, with more and more air going slower and slower. Eventually, the air stops and finds its place.

Now let's look at sound. For sound, you have the same transfer of kinetic energy when the molecules slam into eachother. The big difference is that after they slam into the next group, they *bounce back* and end up right where they started.

As a result of going back to the old equilibrium position, none (or at least very little) of the kinetic energy ends up permanently stored in potential energy. When you blow, part of the energy goes towards moving the next cluster of air molecules, and part of it goes towards choosing a new equilibrium position. For a sound wave, pretty much all of the energy is able to keep moving forward. Look at the first figure on [this page](http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/waves/wavemotion.html), paying careful attention to how the red dot isn't really going anywhere.

robged,"Before I answer the question, I need to describe a speakers construction: an electromagnetic coil produces magnetic fields when electricity is applied. A rare earth magnet attached to a flexible cone moves in response to this magnetic field. The flexible cone compresses air generating sound. Bass is low frequency sound which is generally between 32 Hz at 512 Hz. The overall range of human hearing is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. 

Speakers are less efficient at producing low frequency sounds than high frequency sounds, as during the low frequency cycle, air has time to equalibriate. To get around this inefficiency, it is possible to build the speaker larger and having it travel farther. Fortunately, it only needs to vibrate at lower frequency than high frequency speakers, so this is possible. Also, note that not only can high frequency speakers be smaller, but they also *must* be smaller and have less travel, because if they were as big as bass speakers the high amplitude combined with high travel would rip them apart.

Now, knowing that, it becomes clear why there is such a thing as a crossover circuit in good quality speakers. A crossover circuit is a low-pass filter before the bass speaker, and a high-pass filter before the treble, such that the small high frequency speaker doesn't get the large amplitude bass signals which will cause it to rip, and the low frequency speaker doesn't get the high frequency signals which will make a distorted sound as it is too large to respond to the high frequency signals.

Sound quality is *defined* as the ability of a system to produce an even response across all frequencies, at high volume, without distortion. If you like more bass, on a good system, you can always use an equalizer to add more bass without distortion.

EDIT: The energy of sound waves is independent of frequency (I get confused with light) so I had to delete a sentence.

StringOfLights,"Crocodylians, which include alligators and crocodiles, are not dinosaurs. They are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, however (because birds *are* theropod dinosaurs).

Dinosauria is a group that was originally defined by anatomist [Richard Owen](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/biographies/richard-owen/) based on a few described taxa, including [*Iguanodon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguanodon) and [*Megalosaurus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalosaurus). There are a few more technical ways to define the group, but no matter what it falls out being comprised of two smaller groups: [Ornithischia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithischia) and [Saurischia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurischia), although these groups were not recognized at the time. Ornithischia includes dinosaurs like *Triceratops*, *Iguanodon*, and ankylosaurs. Saurischia includes sauropods and theropods.

Crocodylians, dinosaurs, and a couple other groups (including pterosaurs) are [archosaurs](http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/what-are-archosaurs/) (side note: people often refer to pterosaurs as dinosaurs, but they're actually not). 

To get more at the heart of your question: Crocodylians are widely perceived as these unchanging, prehistoric animals. They're really not. Crown-group crocodylians (that is, the group consisting of the common ancestor of all living species and all of the descendents of that ancestor) first show up in the Late Cretaceous, around 84 million years ago. This actually isn't a terribly long time ago, and it overlaps with the non-avian dinosaurs for about 20 million years. For reference, the [oldest known placental mammal](http://www.livescience.com/15734-oldest-placental-mammal.html) is 160 million years old. 

It is true that crocodylians do have relatives that extended back much further, because archosaurs started to diversify in the Triassic some 250 million years ago, but the crocs you see today are highly derived, not long-forgotten vestiges of the Mesozoic. It's true that some have had a fairly stable body plan, but it's also a body plan that has cropped up multiple times in vertebrate evolution, including in [temnospondyl amphibians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prionosuchus) some 270 million years ago. In a lot of these cases it has evolved independently.

The major radiation of archosaurs that includes modern crocodylians is known as Pseudosuchia, and it [first shows up about 250 million years ago](http://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=3194824_pone.0025693.g012&amp;req=4). These early [relatives of crocs](http://web.missouri.edu/~hollidayca/Croc_epipterygoid/Fig%202.jpg) looked more like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperosuchus) (in that cladogram Crurotarsi = Pseudosuchia). Nothing like a modern croc. 

Even as we move up the tree towards Crocodylia, early crocodyliforms looked like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protosuchus). These were fairly gracile, terrestrial animals. Again, a similar croc body plan pops up in a few lineages, like in the [phytosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytosaur), which are likely a basal pseudosuchian but not closely related to crocodylians.

[Mesoeucrocodylians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoeucrocodylia), a grade of crocodyliforms that isn't a valid taxon but useful for referring to groups outside the crown group, often look more like the body plan associated with typical crocodylians, but they also show significantly more morphological diversity than that. Pholidosaurs (like [*Sarcosuchus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcosuchus)) and dyrosaurs have a similar body plan. Metriorhynchids like [*Metriorhynchus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metriorhynchus_superciliosus) were marine and had flippers. Notosuchians like [*Simosuchus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simosuchus) are very different. *Simosuchus* probably wasn't even carnivorous. It was also pretty adorable. 

The oldest members of crown-group Crocodylia are more morphologically similar to extant crocodylians. However, you still have morphological variation within Crocodylia, such as the [pristichampsids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pristichampsidae), which were terrestrial. Terrestriality shows up again even in the family Crocodylidae (with the Mekosuchinae, including *Quinkana*).

The oldest members definitely attributable the genus *Crocodylus* [date to the Late Miocene](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1643/0045-8511%282000%29000%5B0657:PRADTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2) (paywalled, sorry), and the genus probably diverged in the last 10 million years or so. That's pretty recent in the grand scheme of things, and some 55 million years after the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct.

NAG3LT,"Well, almost all 3D stuff that is made today is Stereoscopic 3D. It means that two images are created with a slight offset in camera position. When one image is shown to one eye, while the other eye sees the slightly different picture we perceive it as a single 3D image. So to display such 3D content, your TV must be capable to display two different images to the two eyes at the same time.


Your standard TV is likely an LCD panel with 50 or 60 Hz refresh rate. Your both eyes see the same image on TV, which is slightly shifted between eyes and you perceive it at the same distance as the TV is. To allow your eyes to see different images you need some additional tricks. The simplest solution is to use special glasses with filters capable of filtering different stuff. 


There is one type of 3D your TV can show with no issues - those 2 colour [Anaglyph images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D). You then use glasses with red and cyan filters (or other colour combo) and one eye sees only red and other only the cyan image. The main issue of this method is colour reproduction, which is awful, so it works best with black and white content. Some colour choices are less bad, but there is no perfect choice for this method. Another type of 3D that normal TV can display is [active shutter 3D] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shutter_3D_system). You use a glasses with LCD shutters which show 1 frame to right eye while covering the left, second to the left and so on. TV meanwhile displays frames in pairs: R-L-R-L-... , which you also perceive as a 3D view. The refresh rate you see is effectively halved and the smaller it is the more perceptible the flickering is. Using it on a 60 Hz display is possible, but far from comfortable, so TV's using it have 100 Hz or higher refresh rates to get 50 Hz of more perceived 3D refresh rate. 


Another interesting property of light used for 3D displays, but mostly with projectors is the polarisation. The light can come in two different polarisations, like linear vertical and linear horizontal or CW circular and CCW circular. These are just some of possible combinations, but what is important that they are exclusive. You can use a special polariser to pass only CW polarisation while completely blocking CCW. Polarisation is also independent from colour and can be filtered by a passive filter, making glasses with polarised filters relatively cheap. So by showing image for one eye in CW polarisation and other image in CCW, glasses with corresponding filters can allow you to see a 3D film. This technique simply requires the special hardware to show different polarisations and wont work on a normal TV. BTW, all LCD displays emit a linearly polarised light, but only in one polarisation. 


If you don't want to use glasses there are some solutions, but they are less reliable so far and less used. Some TVs use micro lenses to show some pixels only from a specific angle of view. This allows them to show different images to your eyes, which look at TV with a slight difference in angle. Their main problem is the fact that you can only view them from specific spots, otherwise the 3D effect breaks down. 


There are other methods as well, but all of them still require you to have additional hardware to show separate images to each eye. The methods with the highest quality require hardware solutions that normal non-3D TVs almost always lack.",null,0,cdkn5i6,1r8ayj,askscience,top_week,5
threegigs,"3D TVs have alternating pixels which are polarized horizontally and vertically, allowing it to display one vertically polarized image and one horizontally polarized image, which are then selectively filtered out by 3D glasses (one lens horizontal, one vertical).

Alternately, active shutter glasses can be used to make any TV a 3D TV, by presenting alternating images for the left/right eyes, and by using special glasses which alternate turning each lens opaque, thus presenting different images to each eye.",null,1,cdkn8xx,1r8ayj,askscience,top_week,3

By shooting energetic electrons or neutrons at some kind of grating for which the spacing of the grates are on the order of the wavelength of the particles used, one can produce a sort of ""many-slit"" experiment. 

Crystalline materials are good for this, because they have regular atomic spacings, such that the atoms scatter incoming particles, generating quasi-point sources of scattered particles similar to the slits in a double slit experiment. If you then have detectors set up to measure where these particles end up, you will see an interference pattern where certain places get many hits (where constructive interference of the wave-like particles occurs) and other places get few or none (where destructive interference occurs).

proule,"Simply put: Genes come in different versions referred to as ""alleles"". Different alleles show different degrees of dominance over each other, and on top of that, some alleles may show incomplete dominance when expressed along with a certain other allele. 

In the dominant-recessive gene interaction, one gene's visible end effect dominates and is all you see. In incomplete dominance, two alleles are expressed where neither fully dominates the other.

In reference to the eye colour question: Eye colour tends to be more of a dominant-recessive relationship. The allele for brown eyes dominates that for blue, so we don't get any sort of brown-blue intermediate. This works similarly for green and blue.

Skin pigmentation is the result of several (I believe around 6?) separate genes relating to the amount of pigment produced, the ability for pigment to be shipped to the proper place in the body, stuff like that. In this case, the myriad of different genes contributing to skin pigmentation result in expression that mirrors incomplete dominance (but is actually slightly more complicated than the normal single-gene dominance question).

There are some concrete reasons that some traits mix and others don't. People with blue eyes have significantly reduced melanin in their irises, so any allele for eye colour that isn't blue will just overwrite blue eyes, since the trait is due to little pigmentation (so it can just be overwritten essentially, by the presence of said pigment). The reasons for other allelic interactions vary by case, and there's likely no satisfactory answer that's all encompassing.",null,0,cdklnkc,1r847u,askscience,top_week,5
ToThink,"I'm only in my 3rd year studying genetics, so I hope I can get this through properly :)

First we have to establish the fact that within a gene, there are alleles of that trait. Alleles are just different forms of a gene, so for eye colour there is a ""green eye"" allele and there is a ""blue eye"" allele. I put the quotations there because eye colour isn't due to a specialised pigment which reflects that colour of light (e.g., blue eyes aren't due to a pigment which reflects blue lights), rather eye colour is dependent on the amount of melanin in the eye. So blue eyes = very low melanin
Similarly with skin colour, the amount of melanin in your skin determines how dark you are.
Currently, one of the explanations behind why a parent with blue eyes and a parent with green eyes don't make a turquoise eye baby is because of dominance of alleles. The child will most likely have green eyes because the green eye allele is ""dominant"" to the blue eye allele. This isn't completely true but eye colour works in a ""dominance-recessiveness"" sort of manner.
There are new studies which reveal this may not be the case, rather some new studies reveal eye colour is dependent on many different genes. (I tried looking for them, couldn't find them).",null,1,cdkkf68,1r847u,askscience,top_week,6

In the case of the blood genes though any amount of antibody production is enough to make certain types of blood incompatible with you. Since people with the AB blood type are producing A and B antibodies, they will react with blood that contains the relevant antigens.

On the other hand though you have traits like hair colour. Say you have the blond hair allele, and the brown hair allele.

In simpler terms, an object will be perceived as having different energies depending on your relative motion with respect to it. For instance, take a basketball on a bus. In the stationary frame of reference of an observer on the sidewalk, the ball has a kinetic energy due to its motion with the bus, but in the frame of reference of someone on the bus, the ball would appear stationary and have no kinetic energy.

Now think of light (or photons) as the basketball. The energy of the light is given by h*f, where h is Plank's constant and f is the frequency. Two observers moving relative to one another will observe the photon to be moving with the same speed. However, at the same time, they will measure different energies for the light, which due to the relation above means that they will observe different frequencies/wavelengths. 

Since there is a known relationship between the change in apparent frequency and the relative motion between two reference frames, we can use this information to calculate the relative motion of say an object emitting that light towards us assuming we know the energy of the light in the frame of reference of the body emitting it.

To put it simply: the wavelength of the light is a different quantity than the velocity. Any given photon travels at constant velocity c. It's the wavelength of the photon that is 'stretched' at the point and at the time of emission of the photon, due to the relative speed of the light source to the observer.

Spiralofourdiv,"I see a lot of kinda complex answers here, so let me take a crack a a simple one:

Light is indeed a fixed speed for all reverence frames, etc. but the color of light has nothing to do with speed, it only has to do with frequency.

Dopler shift **doesn't** ""speed up"" or ""slow down"" light, it's actually entirely dependent on the fact that neither can happen! Since light moves at a fixed speed for all observers, if the source and/or target are moving, then the wavelength needs to adjust correspondingly so that there can be n/2 wavelengths between the objects (that's the ""quantum"" part of quantum mechanics, no ""23.1495 wavelengths"" allowed, only 1/2, 1, 3/2, 3, ...). When the wavelength is ""pulled out"" because the targets are moving away from each other, the light is red. It's not slower light, it's simply lower wavelength/frequency light. 

This actually makes some intuitive sense if you consider that frequency is a measure of energy. The following is a bit naive, but I think it's fair. It makes sense that light has to travel farther to reach targets that are moving away, and traveling farther takes more energy, so the light we perceive is lower frequency/energy. Similarly, objects moving towards each other ""give"" energy to the light since it's reaching it's target in shorter distance.

shavera,"Okay so imagine you have the simplest circuit. Current flows around a simple loop of wire. Now, you cut the wire. The electrons are still in motion, so one end of the cut gets a little bit depleted of electrons, and the other one gets an electron pile-up. But this won't last too long, since the depleted end now has a positive charge, and the pile-up end is negatively charged, the electrons will be pulled in the opposite direction somewhat.

A simple analogy is like a circular pipe of water that's got water flowing around through it. Imagine you were to cut the pipe *and* seal the ends simultaneously. There would be a back pressure at one end, and a low pressure at the other end, causing the flow to slow down and stop. (neglecting some other effects we'll get to in a bit like ""ringing"")

So what if you wanted the effect to last longer, to take a bit longer before the circuit slowed to a halt, what could you do? Well you could take the ends of each wire and add more and more metal to them, giving the electrons more space to spread out on the pile-up end, and more electrons to draw from on the depletion end. (we'll call the pile-up end the negative plate, and the depletion end the positive plate from now on). And if those plates were closer together, the electrons would ""see"" the opposite plate more easily and so not feel the effect as strongly (ie, electrons travelling toward the negative plate and being repelled would also be attracted to the positive plate just slightly beyond it, and so the overall repulsion would be relatively less). 

So that describes our basic ""parallel plate capacitor:"" The amount of charge you can ""store"" in the capacitor, its 'capacitance' is proportional to the area and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates. C = k A / d (where k is just a constant to show proportionality).

---

Now let's look at the next step. We have these plates of charge, one positive and one negative. The current has stopped. well since we have a potential difference, that's going to drive a current in the opposite direction, no? The electrons on the negative plate are going to be pushed off of it and pulled onto the positive plate. But since they can't cross the gap between the plates (deal with this a bit later) they have to go the opposite way of the current that charged the plates up; they are 'discharging.'

---

So now let's put a little more into it. Clearly if you just pushed the electrons harder, you could push more electrons onto the plate, so we can also make a new equation Q=CV, where the charge Q is given by the structure of the capacitor itself (how it distributes charges) and the Voltage (how strongly charges are being pushed onto the plate).

Furthermore, we'd like to see how these plates change over time, right? Well, the amount of charge being added or removed from the plates is going to relate to how much charge is already on the plates, right? If they're really charged up, there are going to be very few new charges added to them (if we're charging) or a *lot* of charges leaving them (if we're discharging). And if we want something where the rate of change is proportional to the value at that moment, we want an exponential. Some kind of e^t function. 

Well let's consider discharging full plates. They start with some charge Q0 and get rid of a lot quickly. But as time goes on, there's less pressure to push new charges out, so they lose less charge. So if we look at e^t, we see that it goes from 0 at t=-infinity, passes through ""1"" at t=0 and then climbs high after that. What we'd like to do is flip that graph around the t=0 axis, right? So that it starts with some value and trends toward 0 after very long times. Flipping about that axis takes t to -t. So we can say that Q(t) = Q0 * e^-t . 

Now let's think of charging. Again we know that to start there's no charge, so we want rapid change. But we also want it to level off to some constant value, where the ""back-pressure"" from the charge on the plates is equal to the ""forward-pressure"" we're using to charge it with. So we look at our e^t again. Well that won't work since it goes up to infinity, which isn't reality. We try flipping it about the t=0 axis again (e^-t ), since that at least levels off. But this graph is decreasing charge, and we want increasing. So we multiply the whole thing by a -1, giving us -e^-t . Well the charge is increasing from a negative 1 to zero... that's not right either, since it starts at 0 and goes to some steady value. So let's add 1 to it, and we get 1 - e^-t . It starts at 0 and increases to 1 in a way that's proportional to the amount that's on the plate. That's nearly what we're looking for. If we just multiply the whole thing by its steady constant charge (Q0) then we'll have it. Q(t) = Q0 * (1 - e^-t ). ",null,2,cdkkfxd,1r841l,askscience,top_week,46

The function of the capacitor will depend on the type of input voltage (alternating or direct) as well as the placement of the component relative to the circuit.

The capacitor is very useful in a circuit because its impedance (electrical ""resistance"") is a function of the capacitance and the frequency of the signal as Z = 1/(2*pi*f*C).

shavera,"Okay so imagine you have the simplest circuit. Current flows around a simple loop of wire. Now, you cut the wire. The electrons are still in motion, so one end of the cut gets a little bit depleted of electrons, and the other one gets an electron pile-up. But this won't last too long, since the depleted end now has a positive charge, and the pile-up end is negatively charged, the electrons will be pulled in the opposite direction somewhat.

A simple analogy is like a circular pipe of water that's got water flowing around through it. Imagine you were to cut the pipe *and* seal the ends simultaneously. There would be a back pressure at one end, and a low pressure at the other end, causing the flow to slow down and stop. (neglecting some other effects we'll get to in a bit like ""ringing"")

So what if you wanted the effect to last longer, to take a bit longer before the circuit slowed to a halt, what could you do? Well you could take the ends of each wire and add more and more metal to them, giving the electrons more space to spread out on the pile-up end, and more electrons to draw from on the depletion end. (we'll call the pile-up end the negative plate, and the depletion end the positive plate from now on). And if those plates were closer together, the electrons would ""see"" the opposite plate more easily and so not feel the effect as strongly (ie, electrons travelling toward the negative plate and being repelled would also be attracted to the positive plate just slightly beyond it, and so the overall repulsion would be relatively less).

BizQuit,"3d printers that use DLP projectors are more expensive because they require a powerful projector to initiate polymerization of photosensitive resin. 

The more common hobbyist 3d printers are simply melting plastic and drawing lines with it requiring little expense as they are only slightly more than a hot glue gun. These common printers are very limited in just how fine a line they can draw, and they must create their work very slowly drawing out the entire parts layer.

With that understanding, It is easiest to think of a Dlp based 3d printer as a photographic process. Each layer is ""drawn"" not line by line but entire layer at once. An image of each layer is projected for a few seconds. Areas where pixels are dark remain fluid and uncured. Pixels that are illuminated cause a chemical reaction which causes solidification of the resin. The printer must then advance in only one direction UP or down depending on the design of the printer, allowing new resin to flow, and another layer can be ""exposed"". 

The tradeoff here comes in resolution and maximum part size. In the melt and deposit printers where you are limited by the fineness of the drawn line (minimum features of 200-400 microns at its best) you can, within the boundaries of the mechanical construction of your printer print parts of any size. The fineness of motor movement can make these parts seem quite smooth, but the ""line thickness"" can significantly limit small features.

Whereas the DLP printer has a fixed resolution in general no greater than 1920X1080.  If you fix your projector at a focus in a similar size to the line of an extrusion printer you only get to print (@200microns 15.1X8.5 inches) and you do not get the smoothing effect of a motor gliding along. BUT unlike these melt and draw printers, a DLP printer can attain VERY fine focus creating individual pixels 50 microns, 20 microns, a few have successfully managed as fine as 5 microns with off the shelf projectors. But each step down shrinks the total field printed. @20 microns you only get 1.5X.85 inches but the resulting part is amazingly detailed as a result. 

All that said, Photopolymer is more expensive than filament. The projector adds expense. And for many hobbyists the resolution is not worth the tradeoff in build size. If you are looking to make large objects it is not the right technology. If you are looking to make fine jewelry, intricate small scale models, dental work (yep labs are making dental crowns with these printers) right now the speed and resolution cannot be beat by any other hobbyist attainable technology.

Marsdreamer,"We breath oxygen today primarily because of organisms called cyanobacteria which created organic compounds from H2O and CO2; turning it into O2. Before this time there was no or very little atmospheric oxygen and it was actually toxic to most other organisms. This catapulted the Oxygen Revolution and is largely responsible for shaping the world as we know it today. 

Fast forward to your more pertinent question, which the answer is The Electron Transport Chain. You see, in order for our bodies to generate chemical energy in the form of ATP we metabolize organic compounds. Through some very lengthy and complex chemistry electrons are stripped from atoms and other molecules to generate an electrochemical gradient responsible for powering the generation and packaging of dense energy molecules known as ATP. 

During this process of ripping negative charges (Electrons) from organic compounds a build up of electrons takes place and they *must* go somewhere. 

Enter Oxygen. Oxygen loves electrons and it is *highly* electronegative. Because of this our bodies have adapted to harvest oxygen for the use of dumping the excess electrons generated from the Electron Transport Chain. Oxygen takes the electrons, binds with Carbon, and then is exhaled.

proule,"Many organisms actually use nitrogen as a terminal electron acceptor (essentially ""breathing"" it in the same way we breath oxygen). The difference is that these organisms are very small and can live on significantly less energy than higher multicellular organisms.

Oxygen is significantly more electronegative than nitrogen (especially considering nitrogen in the atmospheric form N2 is already satisfied with its electron configuration and won't accept more electrons). This difference in electronegativity results in a significant increase in energy liberated from giving oxygen electrons. 

You can think of giving oxygen electrons as a starting point and an end point (your electron donor, and your electron acceptor, which is oxygen). If you simply give oxygen the electron right away then you're losing a bunch of energy to heat. So, between the oxygen and the electron you essentially put up walls for the electron to push (walls being an analogy for cellular work). Oxygen is so powerfully attracting the electron that it pulls it in despite these walls, with the movement of the walls performing work in the cell.

Nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, meaning that nitrogen can't pull electrons through as many walls. Giving an electron to nitrogen just doesn't result in as much energy because it's not pulling on the electron as hard.

Higher organisms, mammals especially, have tremendous energy consumption. From a single glucose molecule, a fermenting organism like yeast will produce two molecules of ATP (the energy currency of any cell). The only way for complex multicellular organisms to evolve was to get more energy out of a single molecule of glucose. With oxygen and the electron transport chain we get more like 38 molecules of ATP. If multicellular organisms extracted energy from glucose as inefficiently as fermenting organisms, we'd have to (very simplified) basically consume 19 times more food to get the same energy.

Animals are all nitrogen dependent, but luckily, consuming other organisms yields plenty of nitrogen, because it's the base of amino acids that make up proteins. Trees fix nitrogen in their roots (with the help of symbiotic relationships to bacteria; they don't do this themselves) because they get their energy from the sun, and light obviously can't provide the tree with nitrogen.",null,1,cdkm17n,1r7w97,askscience,top_week,5

The reason this is a problem during blood transfusions is because if you have a certain antigen, it means you have an antibody for the other antigens you dont have. For example, if you have type A+ blood, meaning you have the A and D antigens, you have a B antibody. If your A+ blood were to come into contact with a B type blood, the B antibodies in your blood would react with the B antigens in the B blood, causing the B blood to coagulate and virtually be unusable. 

This is why type O- is the ""universal donor"", because it has no antigens for anybody else's antibodies to react with. This is also why AB+ is the ""universal acceptor"" because it has no antibodies to coagulate any type of donor blood. 

also, I do not know *why* we have different types.

Yes_That_Guy,"Have had this saved after answering this question a few times.  Much better summary than I could write up with the time I have this morning.  Edited for content.  Credit to /u/Its_the_bees_knees

**If you have any other specific questions after reading this please let me know.  I feel this should satisfy most if not all of your questions**

**Antigen**- The tag that identifies something. These antigens exist, to help our body distinguish molecules as ""self"" or ""non-self."" Our immune system will recognize these antigens and react, or wont react. When there is an antigen-antibody reaction that is what causes the destruction of these cells and a massive clot forms.

*Edited expansion*- In my analogy. The antigens are the Locks. And the Antibodies are the keys. When your body encounters a Lock that doesnt belong to you, it tries to destroy it (open it) Once your body encounters this lock, it has now seen it and has now seen its design. After encountering a foreign lock, your body will now make keys to open and destroy these locks. Some of these locks are small (ABO blood group) and the keys can be made immediately and the reaction occurs immediately. However the locks of Blood type of +/- (explained more detailed below) are relatively big and can take a while for the appropriate keys to be made. So you constantly have these keys floating around in your blood constantly looking for a compatible lock. When a key matches a lock, that's what activates your immune response, destroys the lock and in turn causes all the negative effects of a transfusion reaction (explained more below)

**Why are there different types of antigens?** This boils down to their molecular structure. All blood types have the same ""core"" structure, but what differentiates the types is a Polysaccharide molecule that sticks out from the molecule. This polysaccharide (or Sugar in simpler terms) is what is the antigen and helps our body identify them as different blood types.


**Antibodies**- The main part of our immune system. Antigen-antibody interactions follow a lock (antigen) and key (antibody) When the key fits the lock that's what causes and immune reaction which ends up destroying the Red Blood Cell (RBC)

The locks are pre-determined due to the sugar ""tag."" Now one thing people dont realize is that certain blood types will have the specific antigen, but WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE ANTIBODY.


**What does that mean?**

*Blood Type A*: Has A Antigen, and B Antibody

*Blood Type B*: Has B Antigen, and A Antibody

*Blood Type AB*: Has A and B antigens, No antibodies

*Blood Type O*: Doesn't have A and B, Has both A and B antibodies 

*edit*- (as pointed out by nearquincy below, Blood Type O actually contains H antigen, which is the precursor antigen to both antigen A and antigen B.
There are other antigens that is present on the surface of the blood type O itself although they are not significant in ABO system.""






**What does that translate into the real world?**

*Blood Type A*: They only have 1 antibody-Type B, so if that antibody finds its partner antigen (found in Type B or type AB transfusion) then it will cause a reaction and essentially self-destruct.

*Blood Type B*: They only have 1 antibody-Type A, so if that antibody finds its partner antigen (found in Type A or type AB transfusion) then it will cause a reaction and essentially self-destruct.

*Blood Type AB*: Has both antigens, but no Antibodies. (Because if it had any antibodies to either A or B, the person wouldn't exist in the first place, because the Antibodies would keep finding their Locks, and self-destructing the RBC's) Because blood type AB has no Antibodies, they are known as **Universal Recipients** Meaning that because there are no keys, there will never be keys to correspond with the locks.

*Blood type O*: Has no antigens, but does have both types of antibodies. Because of the lack of antigens, they are known as **universal donors** meaning their blood can be transfused/mixed with any other blood type and there will not be a reaction.





**Below an even simpler version of what this means**

*Type A blood*- Can Receive type A or Type O Blood. Will react with type B or type AB.

*Type B blood*- Can receive Type B or Type O Blood. Will react with type A or type AB.

*Type AB blood*- Can receive all types of blood- Type A, B, AB, or O. Will not react with any.

*Type O blood*- Can only receive type O blood. But can be donated to any blood type person. Will react with types A, AB, and B (when type O is the type of the receipient)

*edit*- cheat sheet for blood types http://i.imgur.com/fTw8AIj.png




**What is Positive and Negative Blood?**

Well this refers to the presence or the lack of another type of antigen, known as the Rh Factor or also known as the D antigen.



**Why is being positive or negative important?**

Well, this is most important for pregnancies. Specifically a mother's **second pregnancy**. It occurs in a Rh(-) Mother and an Rh(+)Baby. What does being Rh (-) or (+) mean? Well like I said it depends on whether or not you have the Antigen or you don't. During the 1st pregnancy the fetal blood will mix with the mothers blood. Because the mother has no Rh factor, but the fetal blood does- the immune system will recognize these particles as foreign and will in turn start making antibodies to it. Anything your immune system recognizes as foreign, it assumes its an enemy and will start to attack it.



**Why did you mention 2nd pregnancy and not first?**

Well these antibodies belong to a different class than the ones that react with blood typing. These antibodies take MUCH longer to form. Hence it wont affect the first pregnancy, but can affect the second pregnancy.


**Also, can a A- receive A+ blood?**

A+ can receive blood from a A- Negative donor, or A+ donor.

A- can only receive blood from A-.

Its the antigens that make up the difference. Negative means you have no antigen, so even if - donor blood present inside of a + person's body, the body doesn't recognize it as foreign, so its okay.

The problem exists when - person receives + blood. + Blood does contain the antigen, so when - Persons body sees the + blood, it sees the antigen, recognizes it as foreign and attacks it. So this blood transfusion is incompatible


**What happens when you have an incompatible blood type?** 

You get-

Fever

Jaundice

Decreased blood pressure

Increased heart rate

Increased breathing rate

Acute kidney failure (if severe enough)

Blood in urine (after it reaches the kidney failure stage)

Shock ( if severe, and untreated)

Death ( if severe and untreated due to the sudden loss of blood pressure and the shock)

Basically I described it as self destruct, because the host antibodies attack the foreign antigens and cause these red blood cells to be destroyed. When your red blood cells are destroyed they release a molecule know as hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is normally a good molecule which is responsible for oxygen transport, but that is only of its attached to/inside of the Red blood cell. When there is too much free floating hemoglobin in the blood- that is what causes all of the above symptoms.


**Can transfusion reactions be treated? And is it symptomatic treatment or does it require another full transfusion?**
Yeah it's basically sympomatic treatment.

But remember, that symptoms that appear are really variable and dependent on how severe the reaction is. 
But for a complete overall treatment of the above symptoms you would require-

Treating and anticipating the Shock (Which would also treat the low blood pressure and fast heart rate

Treating the kidney failure (Dialysis to filter out the hemoglobin) (If the reaction is severe enough, it may require a complete re-transfusion)

Treat the subsequent clot that will form. (When there is a transfusion reaction there will also be a massive blood clot that forms due to all of the now destroyed Red Blood cells)

**Certain blood types have shown greater incidence with certain diseases/infections. But there is no increased susceptibility**

Blood Type A: Hepatitis, Small Pox

Blood Type O: Black Plague, other digestive system infections, Autoimmune disorders(when your body attacks itself)

Blood Types A, B, AB: Clots in your veins


**Also some other interesting things to note is that-**

ABO (+/-) Blood typing will fit and categorize about 99.97% of the worlds population. But there is still that 0.03% who's blood has neither A/B Antigens nor the A/B Antibodies.

For these special people we have to to EXTREMELY careful when transfusing any type of blood, also we have to use other systems to type/categorize their blood

When a Blood Type O patient, receives blood from a blood type A patient. This causes the most severe of the transfusion reactions.

About 40% of the population is Type O. Type AB is the rarest.

About 80% of the population is +. So being AB- is the rarest of blood types


**Are there any benefits to having either A, B, AB, or O blood types?**

Type O can donate to all types of blood.

Type AB can receive all types of blood.

Types- A, AB, B dont have a distinct advantage over the other. *edit*- as pointed out by /u/hammurarbisan "" both A and B types routinely have elevated platelet counts versus the other blood types - most especially female A types - and thus more frequently tested for platelet counts and targeted for apheresis collection. Platelets are commonly used for transfusion during surgery.""

Being + however is an advantage over being negative. + Can receive from + or - people. Negative people however can only receive from Negative people.

*edit*- Type AB can donate PLASMA to all people, since they dont have any antibodies (the donation rules for plasma and whole blood are opposite in terms of antigens and antibodies)

swamp14,"A lot of people have been asking about the ""why"" and rightly so because it was asked in the OP but not yet answered. 

WHY humans have different blood types is akin to why some humans have more or less of a specific protein that helps break down alcohol, why some humans tend to be taller or shorter than others, why some humans have different proportions in arm/leg length... etc. It's simply genetic variation. Different genes being expressed because of genetic diversity in the human species, amplified by sexual reproduction.

To all the people asking what evolutionary advantage different blood types offer - just because a species has a particular trait doesn't mean that trait helps the species survive and reproduce more than if the species lacked that trait. Traits can be passed on simply because of luck or a number of other factors. Evolution works because traits that tend to be favorable for survival and reproduction tend to get passed on and thus become more prevalent in the species. But that doesn't mean disadvantageous traits don't get passed on. They're just less likely.

""Isn't it more evolutionarily advantageous to have a single blood type?""
Perhaps. I can't give a straight answer because I don't know. But this question indicates a misunderstanding of evolution. It's like asking ""Isn't it more more evolutionarily advantageous for humans to be stronger, faster, and smarter?"" So, even if the answer is yes, it doesn't mean it should be true. 

What this tells us is that evolution is not perfect. It is the process that results from random mutations and natural selection over long periods of time. We have different types of blood because of random mutations and those blood types got passed on. Whether or not those different blood types contributed to our survival and reproduction, I cannot tell you.

But what I can tell you is: 1) traits are not perfect, and asking why they are not ""better"" usually demonstrates a misunderstanding of evolution; and 2) traits do not necessarily need to contribute to survival and reproduction in order to be passed on, and assuming that they MUST be is not reasonable. Yes, traits usually are advantageous because if they weren't advantageous, they'd be less likely to be passed on. But again, this does not mean they absolutely need to be.

Chl0eeeeeee,"Differences in blood types arise from different protein expression on the red blood cell. So, first with the Rh factor (named so because it was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys). You can be Rh + or -, which means that your red blood cells have or don't have this certain protein on the surface. Problems can arise when a mother is Rh - and is carrying a child who is Rh+, as an immune reaction can occur (because the mothers body sees the Rh+ proteins as being foreign) if there is blood exchange between the two.  Usually the first child is fine, but when there's blood exchange in child birth, the mother builds up anti-Rh antibodies. To help with this, all Rh- mothers are treated with Rhogam to suppress that response. 

Now, on to the A/B/O blood type. Again, this is code for the type of proteins that are on the surface of the blood cell. The differences arise from genetic inheritance with one gene determining ABO inheritance. So, without making it too complicated... The presence of at least one ""A allele"" will cause the body to make specific glycoproteins, while the absence causes anti-A antibodies. The same goes for the B allele. If a person has one A and one B, then they are type AB. Because they are AB, they don't produce either antibodies. If they have two As, they are type A and likewise for B. In this gene, both the A and B genes are co-dominant. Type O arises when the person has neither an A allele nor a B allele, and instead has two recessive alleles. This person would not have any glycoproteins on the cell, and would produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies. This is why they are the universal donor (transfusion of blood won't set off an immune reaction, especially if they are O-). AB blood types are considered the universal receiver because they don't have the antibodies for any of the blood types, and thus can receive any blood.

billyvnilly,"A,B,AB,O are designations for cells that express antigens.  D is also an antigen, and its significance is that it's reactive with antibodies as much as A and B.

We have evolved to develop these blood groups.  When Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are made they express a carbohydrate chain (millions) which is called H.  We have evolved over time to have different enzymes that modify this carbohydrate chain.  Most people believe B was the original enzyme.  A is speculated to happen afterwards.  So enzyme A or B act on the carbohydrate chain H, and modify it.  The modified chain is thus termed A or B.  If neither enzyme acted on the H chain, its termed O.  The enzyme A and B behave totally differently (enzyme activity and thus amount of H chains they convert), so if you have enzymes A and B, its not an equal split (thats a minor point, doesn't matter for this).  So these are just two examples of antigens on RBCs.  D is a third antigen that is clinically significant and very common, that is why people know about it.  What they don't know is D is a combo of many antigens.  D,C,c,E, and e.  but we always say if you're D+ then your blood is positive.  there is no d antigen.  
What most people don't know is that there are tons of antigens (100s) on red blood cells.  Some are there from the development of the RBCs' nucleus, and some are adsorbed from secreted antigens circulating in the blood stream.  
Why are all these important?  Well as your body makes antigens, it is also recognizing those antigens as ""self"" ... our bodies have the ability to then recognize ""not-self"".  So if you only have enzyme A, and not make any RBCs with B on their surface, you make antibodies to B, but not to A.  People with type A blood cant receive type B or AB blood because they have antibodies to B.  
Why do we have different blood types?  Well a good example is a blood group called Duffy.  The blood group has two antigens: Fya and Fyb.  And again these antigens come from two enzymes.  If you lack both enzymes, you lack the antigens.  And if you lack both antigens you're termed Fy(a-b-).  Why is this evolutionary?  Well because Plasmodium vivax (malaria) uses the antigen site to enter cells.  So if you lack the antigen, malaria cannot enter the cell (evolutionary!

Different kinds of sugars, (glucos, carbohydrate) and the +/- is a protein.





For example, the antigens of the ABO blood group are sugars. They are produced by a series of reactions in which enzymes catalyze the transfer of sugar units. A person's DNA determines the type of enzymes they have, and, therefore, the type of sugar antigens that end up on their red blood cells.
In contrast, the antigens of the Rh blood group are proteins. A person's DNA holds the information for producing the protein antigens. The RhD gene encodes the D antigen, which is a large protein on the red blood cell membrane. Some people have a version of the gene that does not produce D antigen, and therefore the RhD protein is absent from their red blood cells.

ABO bloods types are distinguished by the individual alleles that encode an enzyme.  The different enzymes have long names and essentially add different sugars via O-linked glycosylation to what could be a ""base"" sugar chain that is added first.  This ""base"" sugar chain exists on our RBCs and receives a fucose residue by fucosyl-transferase and having this enzyme alone constitutes the ""O"" phenotype/antigen.  The ""A"" and ""B"" enyzmes each add a different sugar to this base carb chain with the fucose and that creates the different antigens that we see.

Son_of_Thomas,"The different blood types refer to the different types of antigens on the surface of our red blood cells. There are 3 main ones: A, B, and D. A and B determine the type of blood you have (A, B, AB, or O type) and D determines whether your blood is positive or negative- the presence of the D antigen (also known as the Rh factor mentioned in another comment) means you are positive. For example, having the antigens A and D make your blood A+. If you have A and B but no D, your blood is AB-. Having only the D antigen without A or B means you have O+ blood, and a lack of all 3 antigens means you have O- blood. 

The reason this is a problem during blood transfusions is because if you have a certain antigen, it means you have an antibody for the other antigens you dont have. For example, if you have type A+ blood, meaning you have the A and D antigens, you have a B antibody. If your A+ blood were to come into contact with a B type blood, the B antibodies in your blood would react with the B antigens in the B blood, causing the B blood to coagulate and virtually be unusable. 

This is why type O- is the ""universal donor"", because it has no antigens for anybody else's antibodies to react with. This is also why AB+ is the ""universal acceptor"" because it has no antibodies to coagulate any type of donor blood. 

also, I do not know *why* we have different types.

Yes_That_Guy,"Have had this saved after answering this question a few times.  Much better summary than I could write up with the time I have this morning.  Edited for content.  Credit to /u/Its_the_bees_knees

**If you have any other specific questions after reading this please let me know.  I feel this should satisfy most if not all of your questions**

**Antigen**- The tag that identifies something. These antigens exist, to help our body distinguish molecules as ""self"" or ""non-self."" Our immune system will recognize these antigens and react, or wont react. When there is an antigen-antibody reaction that is what causes the destruction of these cells and a massive clot forms.

*Edited expansion*- In my analogy. The antigens are the Locks. And the Antibodies are the keys. When your body encounters a Lock that doesnt belong to you, it tries to destroy it (open it) Once your body encounters this lock, it has now seen it and has now seen its design. After encountering a foreign lock, your body will now make keys to open and destroy these locks. Some of these locks are small (ABO blood group) and the keys can be made immediately and the reaction occurs immediately. However the locks of Blood type of +/- (explained more detailed below) are relatively big and can take a while for the appropriate keys to be made. So you constantly have these keys floating around in your blood constantly looking for a compatible lock. When a key matches a lock, that's what activates your immune response, destroys the lock and in turn causes all the negative effects of a transfusion reaction (explained more below)

**Why are there different types of antigens?** This boils down to their molecular structure. All blood types have the same ""core"" structure, but what differentiates the types is a Polysaccharide molecule that sticks out from the molecule. This polysaccharide (or Sugar in simpler terms) is what is the antigen and helps our body identify them as different blood types.


**Antibodies**- The main part of our immune system. Antigen-antibody interactions follow a lock (antigen) and key (antibody) When the key fits the lock that's what causes and immune reaction which ends up destroying the Red Blood Cell (RBC)

The locks are pre-determined due to the sugar ""tag."" Now one thing people dont realize is that certain blood types will have the specific antigen, but WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE ANTIBODY.


**What does that mean?**

*Blood Type A*: Has A Antigen, and B Antibody

*Blood Type B*: Has B Antigen, and A Antibody

*Blood Type AB*: Has A and B antigens, No antibodies

*Blood Type O*: Doesn't have A and B, Has both A and B antibodies 

*edit*- (as pointed out by nearquincy below, Blood Type O actually contains H antigen, which is the precursor antigen to both antigen A and antigen B.
There are other antigens that is present on the surface of the blood type O itself although they are not significant in ABO system.""






**What does that translate into the real world?**

*Blood Type A*: They only have 1 antibody-Type B, so if that antibody finds its partner antigen (found in Type B or type AB transfusion) then it will cause a reaction and essentially self-destruct.

*Blood Type B*: They only have 1 antibody-Type A, so if that antibody finds its partner antigen (found in Type A or type AB transfusion) then it will cause a reaction and essentially self-destruct.

*Blood Type AB*: Has both antigens, but no Antibodies. (Because if it had any antibodies to either A or B, the person wouldn't exist in the first place, because the Antibodies would keep finding their Locks, and self-destructing the RBC's) Because blood type AB has no Antibodies, they are known as **Universal Recipients** Meaning that because there are no keys, there will never be keys to correspond with the locks.

*Blood type O*: Has no antigens, but does have both types of antibodies. Because of the lack of antigens, they are known as **universal donors** meaning their blood can be transfused/mixed with any other blood type and there will not be a reaction.





**Below an even simpler version of what this means**

*Type A blood*- Can Receive type A or Type O Blood. Will react with type B or type AB.

*Type B blood*- Can receive Type B or Type O Blood. Will react with type A or type AB.

*Type AB blood*- Can receive all types of blood- Type A, B, AB, or O. Will not react with any.

*Type O blood*- Can only receive type O blood. But can be donated to any blood type person. Will react with types A, AB, and B (when type O is the type of the receipient)

*edit*- cheat sheet for blood types http://i.imgur.com/fTw8AIj.png




**What is Positive and Negative Blood?**

Well this refers to the presence or the lack of another type of antigen, known as the Rh Factor or also known as the D antigen.



**Why is being positive or negative important?**

Well, this is most important for pregnancies. Specifically a mother's **second pregnancy**. It occurs in a Rh(-) Mother and an Rh(+)Baby. What does being Rh (-) or (+) mean? Well like I said it depends on whether or not you have the Antigen or you don't. During the 1st pregnancy the fetal blood will mix with the mothers blood. Because the mother has no Rh factor, but the fetal blood does- the immune system will recognize these particles as foreign and will in turn start making antibodies to it. Anything your immune system recognizes as foreign, it assumes its an enemy and will start to attack it.



**Why did you mention 2nd pregnancy and not first?**

Well these antibodies belong to a different class than the ones that react with blood typing. These antibodies take MUCH longer to form. Hence it wont affect the first pregnancy, but can affect the second pregnancy.


**Also, can a A- receive A+ blood?**

A+ can receive blood from a A- Negative donor, or A+ donor.

A- can only receive blood from A-.

Its the antigens that make up the difference. Negative means you have no antigen, so even if - donor blood present inside of a + person's body, the body doesn't recognize it as foreign, so its okay.

The problem exists when - person receives + blood. + Blood does contain the antigen, so when - Persons body sees the + blood, it sees the antigen, recognizes it as foreign and attacks it. So this blood transfusion is incompatible


**What happens when you have an incompatible blood type?** 

You get-

Fever

Jaundice

Decreased blood pressure

Increased heart rate

Increased breathing rate

Acute kidney failure (if severe enough)

Blood in urine (after it reaches the kidney failure stage)

Shock ( if severe, and untreated)

Death ( if severe and untreated due to the sudden loss of blood pressure and the shock)

Basically I described it as self destruct, because the host antibodies attack the foreign antigens and cause these red blood cells to be destroyed. When your red blood cells are destroyed they release a molecule know as hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is normally a good molecule which is responsible for oxygen transport, but that is only of its attached to/inside of the Red blood cell. When there is too much free floating hemoglobin in the blood- that is what causes all of the above symptoms.


**Can transfusion reactions be treated? And is it symptomatic treatment or does it require another full transfusion?**
Yeah it's basically sympomatic treatment.

But remember, that symptoms that appear are really variable and dependent on how severe the reaction is. 
But for a complete overall treatment of the above symptoms you would require-

Treating and anticipating the Shock (Which would also treat the low blood pressure and fast heart rate

Treating the kidney failure (Dialysis to filter out the hemoglobin) (If the reaction is severe enough, it may require a complete re-transfusion)

Treat the subsequent clot that will form. (When there is a transfusion reaction there will also be a massive blood clot that forms due to all of the now destroyed Red Blood cells)

**Certain blood types have shown greater incidence with certain diseases/infections. But there is no increased susceptibility**

Blood Type A: Hepatitis, Small Pox

Blood Type O: Black Plague, other digestive system infections, Autoimmune disorders(when your body attacks itself)

Blood Types A, B, AB: Clots in your veins


**Also some other interesting things to note is that-**

ABO (+/-) Blood typing will fit and categorize about 99.97% of the worlds population. But there is still that 0.03% who's blood has neither A/B Antigens nor the A/B Antibodies.

For these special people we have to to EXTREMELY careful when transfusing any type of blood, also we have to use other systems to type/categorize their blood

When a Blood Type O patient, receives blood from a blood type A patient. This causes the most severe of the transfusion reactions.

About 40% of the population is Type O. Type AB is the rarest.

About 80% of the population is +. So being AB- is the rarest of blood types


**Are there any benefits to having either A, B, AB, or O blood types?**

Type O can donate to all types of blood.

Type AB can receive all types of blood.

Types- A, AB, B dont have a distinct advantage over the other. *edit*- as pointed out by /u/hammurarbisan "" both A and B types routinely have elevated platelet counts versus the other blood types - most especially female A types - and thus more frequently tested for platelet counts and targeted for apheresis collection. Platelets are commonly used for transfusion during surgery.""

Being + however is an advantage over being negative. + Can receive from + or - people. Negative people however can only receive from Negative people.

*edit*- Type AB can donate PLASMA to all people, since they dont have any antibodies (the donation rules for plasma and whole blood are opposite in terms of antigens and antibodies)

swamp14,"A lot of people have been asking about the ""why"" and rightly so because it was asked in the OP but not yet answered. 

WHY humans have different blood types is akin to why some humans have more or less of a specific protein that helps break down alcohol, why some humans tend to be taller or shorter than others, why some humans have different proportions in arm/leg length... etc. It's simply genetic variation. Different genes being expressed because of genetic diversity in the human species, amplified by sexual reproduction.

To all the people asking what evolutionary advantage different blood types offer - just because a species has a particular trait doesn't mean that trait helps the species survive and reproduce more than if the species lacked that trait. Traits can be passed on simply because of luck or a number of other factors. Evolution works because traits that tend to be favorable for survival and reproduction tend to get passed on and thus become more prevalent in the species. But that doesn't mean disadvantageous traits don't get passed on. They're just less likely.

""Isn't it more evolutionarily advantageous to have a single blood type?""
Perhaps. I can't give a straight answer because I don't know. But this question indicates a misunderstanding of evolution. It's like asking ""Isn't it more more evolutionarily advantageous for humans to be stronger, faster, and smarter?"" So, even if the answer is yes, it doesn't mean it should be true. 

What this tells us is that evolution is not perfect. It is the process that results from random mutations and natural selection over long periods of time. We have different types of blood because of random mutations and those blood types got passed on. Whether or not those different blood types contributed to our survival and reproduction, I cannot tell you.

But what I can tell you is: 1) traits are not perfect, and asking why they are not ""better"" usually demonstrates a misunderstanding of evolution; and 2) traits do not necessarily need to contribute to survival and reproduction in order to be passed on, and assuming that they MUST be is not reasonable. Yes, traits usually are advantageous because if they weren't advantageous, they'd be less likely to be passed on. But again, this does not mean they absolutely need to be.

Chl0eeeeeee,"Differences in blood types arise from different protein expression on the red blood cell. So, first with the Rh factor (named so because it was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys). You can be Rh + or -, which means that your red blood cells have or don't have this certain protein on the surface. Problems can arise when a mother is Rh - and is carrying a child who is Rh+, as an immune reaction can occur (because the mothers body sees the Rh+ proteins as being foreign) if there is blood exchange between the two.  Usually the first child is fine, but when there's blood exchange in child birth, the mother builds up anti-Rh antibodies. To help with this, all Rh- mothers are treated with Rhogam to suppress that response. 

Now, on to the A/B/O blood type. Again, this is code for the type of proteins that are on the surface of the blood cell. The differences arise from genetic inheritance with one gene determining ABO inheritance. So, without making it too complicated... The presence of at least one ""A allele"" will cause the body to make specific glycoproteins, while the absence causes anti-A antibodies. The same goes for the B allele. If a person has one A and one B, then they are type AB. Because they are AB, they don't produce either antibodies. If they have two As, they are type A and likewise for B. In this gene, both the A and B genes are co-dominant. Type O arises when the person has neither an A allele nor a B allele, and instead has two recessive alleles. This person would not have any glycoproteins on the cell, and would produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies. This is why they are the universal donor (transfusion of blood won't set off an immune reaction, especially if they are O-). AB blood types are considered the universal receiver because they don't have the antibodies for any of the blood types, and thus can receive any blood.

billyvnilly,"A,B,AB,O are designations for cells that express antigens.  D is also an antigen, and its significance is that it's reactive with antibodies as much as A and B.

We have evolved to develop these blood groups.  When Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are made they express a carbohydrate chain (millions) which is called H.  We have evolved over time to have different enzymes that modify this carbohydrate chain.  Most people believe B was the original enzyme.  A is speculated to happen afterwards.  So enzyme A or B act on the carbohydrate chain H, and modify it.  The modified chain is thus termed A or B.  If neither enzyme acted on the H chain, its termed O.  The enzyme A and B behave totally differently (enzyme activity and thus amount of H chains they convert), so if you have enzymes A and B, its not an equal split (thats a minor point, doesn't matter for this).  So these are just two examples of antigens on RBCs.  D is a third antigen that is clinically significant and very common, that is why people know about it.  What they don't know is D is a combo of many antigens.  D,C,c,E, and e.  but we always say if you're D+ then your blood is positive.  there is no d antigen.  
What most people don't know is that there are tons of antigens (100s) on red blood cells.  Some are there from the development of the RBCs' nucleus, and some are adsorbed from secreted antigens circulating in the blood stream.  
Why are all these important?  Well as your body makes antigens, it is also recognizing those antigens as ""self"" ... our bodies have the ability to then recognize ""not-self"".  So if you only have enzyme A, and not make any RBCs with B on their surface, you make antibodies to B, but not to A.  People with type A blood cant receive type B or AB blood because they have antibodies to B.  
Why do we have different blood types?  Well a good example is a blood group called Duffy.  The blood group has two antigens: Fya and Fyb.  And again these antigens come from two enzymes.  If you lack both enzymes, you lack the antigens.  And if you lack both antigens you're termed Fy(a-b-).  Why is this evolutionary?  Well because Plasmodium vivax (malaria) uses the antigen site to enter cells.  So if you lack the antigen, malaria cannot enter the cell (evolutionary!

Different kinds of sugars, (glucos, carbohydrate) and the +/- is a protein.





For example, the antigens of the ABO blood group are sugars. They are produced by a series of reactions in which enzymes catalyze the transfer of sugar units. A person's DNA determines the type of enzymes they have, and, therefore, the type of sugar antigens that end up on their red blood cells.
In contrast, the antigens of the Rh blood group are proteins. A person's DNA holds the information for producing the protein antigens. The RhD gene encodes the D antigen, which is a large protein on the red blood cell membrane. Some people have a version of the gene that does not produce D antigen, and therefore the RhD protein is absent from their red blood cells.

ABO bloods types are distinguished by the individual alleles that encode an enzyme.  The different enzymes have long names and essentially add different sugars via O-linked glycosylation to what could be a ""base"" sugar chain that is added first.  This ""base"" sugar chain exists on our RBCs and receives a fucose residue by fucosyl-transferase and having this enzyme alone constitutes the ""O"" phenotype/antigen.  The ""A"" and ""B"" enyzmes each add a different sugar to this base carb chain with the fucose and that creates the different antigens that we see.

CFC stands for chloro-fluoro carbons. For those without O-chem knowledge,  carbon atoms can bond with up to 4 other atoms. In CFC's, there are at least one chlorine and one flourine atoms bonded to the central carbon atom, with the rest being hydrogen atoms (there are multiple variations based on numbers and positions of these atoms). When these CFC's get into the atmosphere, they start to break down due to UV radiation, and chlorine atoms are released. These chlorine atoms then proceed to catalyse the chemical reaction series I linked earlier.

[Here's a link from the US EPA with more detail](http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/process.html)

A quote from the article: ""It is estimated that one chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere """,null,0,cdkk6rk,1r7s9w,askscience,top_week,3
richard_woodhouse,"It's a bit of a long process but there were 4 major breakthroughs associated with the discovery of the Ozone Hole:

1.)  **The Fate of CFCs:**  Mario Molina was a postdoc working with Professor Sherwood Rowland at UC Riverside in the 70's.  His project was to determine the fate of CFCs in the atmosphere.  CFCs were used as refrigerants for a lot of industrial processes because they were incredibly stable.  They happen to be so stable that nothing in the troposphere can break them down, so no one really knew what happened to them when they were released.  Molina eventually discovered that the CFCs would finally break down high in the stratosphere (~20-40km) when they absorb high-energy UV light (~175-220nm).  This releases Cl radicals into the stratosphere.  Their famous Science paper [here](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v249/n5460/abs/249810a0.html) (with a great typo in the title, see the [pdf](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v249/n5460/pdf/249810a0.pdf)) presented this initial warning that CFCs could deplete ozone.  However, this reaction needed observational evidence now.

2.) **Observations of enhanced ClO:**  In 1976 James Anderson of Harvard lead a field campaign to the south pole and made in situ observations of enhanced ClO.  This confirmed that chlorine was present in the stratosphere and verified Molina's proposed CFC fate.

3.) **Observations of the Ozone Hole:**  This one's kinda funny in hindsight, in 1985 Joe Farman published a paper in Nature ([here](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v315/n6016/abs/315207a0.html)) showing dramatic ozone loss in the austral spring.  This was in direct contrast to satellite observations over the south pole at the time.  It turns out that the satellite data was being filtered out because concentrations were so low.  Essentially, the scientists had assumed the satellite measurements must have been noisy and were throwing out data that was ""unrealistic""!

4.) **Clouds and Crazy Chemistry:**  The original chemical reaction chain that Molina proposed was not the cause of the ozone hole (the source of chlorine was right but the catalytic reaction mechanism was not).  The ozone depletion that Farman noticed occurred in the spring at first light in the south pole.  There's three reasons for this depletion:  (1) the polar vortex keeps the south pole somewhat isolated from the surrounding regions, (2) typically the chlorine can be ""locked up"" in reservoir species such as chlorine-nitrate, however Susan Soloman discovered that [polar stratospheric clouds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_stratospheric_cloud) can form due to the extremely cold temperatures and provide a surface for heterogeneous chemistry to occur.  The chlorine nitrate can react with HCl to yield Cl_2 + HNO_3 and the HNO_3 will dry deposit over the winter.  So in the spring there's a lot of Cl_2 that will photolyze and no nitrogen to lock it up.  (3)  In 1986 [Luisa and Mario Molina discovered](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100286a035) that ClO can self react: ClO+ClO -&gt; ClOOCl and that the dimer will break at the Cl-O bond, not the weaker O-O bond.  This means that ClO self reactions can produce radical chlorine and deplete ozone without radical oxygen atoms!  

In summary, Mario Molina proposed that CFCs could deplete ozone in the stratosphere.  His original paper correctly pointed out the source of chlorine in the stratosphere but didn't identify the actual reaction that would cause the ozone hole.  2 years later Jim Anderson then verified that enhanced chlorine was present in the stratosphere.  10 years later Joe Farman noticed the ozone hole.  3 years later Susan Soloman, Luisa Molina, and Mario Molina discovered the crazy set of chemical reactions that lead to the ozone hole.

Surf_Science,"So an antidote can vary widely but I'm not aware of any 'traditional' antidotes that might think of from the movies. 

In the case of venoms we often use antibodies generated by exposing animals to the venom. These antibodies bind the venom, may prevent it from acting and may help our body remove it (antibody opsonization). 

In the same way an antibody will bind a dangerous substance we will sometimes use chelators to bind other molecules that may be problems (heavy metals, iron). 

In some other cases the antidote may be using something that competes with the dangerous substance for a receptor. In the case of ethylene glycol poisoning for example (and this is what happens when a dog for example drinks antifreeze) ethanol can be used as a treatment. Ethanol will compete for the target receptor with the ethylene glycol preventing the action of ethylene glycol (ethanol has a higher affinity for the receptor).

I think it’s easier to use the term ‘innate behavior’ rather than ‘instincts’ because the latter has a lot of more metaphysical connotations in humans, at least. I can describe an innate behavior in a simpler organism, like a fly. 

Fly mating behavior is what we call ‘stereotyped’- given certain stimuli (like a young female fly or something that smells like one) a male fly will initiate a series of behaviors that are pretty much the same every time: a little wing dance, an attempt to mount her, etc. The neurons that sense the odor of the female fly connect to a few parts of the fly brain, including an area called the lateral horn. It’s a little oversimplified, but neurons in that region connect with downstream neurons that control the fly’s muscle movements that cause them to do the dance, and more complex series of movements that include mounting. It’s a circuit of neurons that starts with a sensory stimulus and ends in a behavior, with a little processing in the middle. 

So where to genes come in? Genes are what tell the brain how to structure itself in the first place. In each neuron there are a series of genes transcribed that tell the neuron how to develop, what kind of neuron to be, where to migrate to in the brain during development. The neurons in the lateral horn that bridge the gap between the smell of a female (sensory stimulus) and the mating (behavior) are where they are, and fire when they fire, because of the history of genetic switches that got them there. 

I should add, there is no one gene for this behavior or that, every single cell is the product of thousands of genes turned on or off throughout the organism’s development. Cells (such as neurons) are the sum of their genetic history, and behaviors are the sum of the neural activity that was elicited by a stimulus. 

You can check out the work of [Vanessa Ruta](http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/VanessaRuta/), for a more in-depth explanation. I am probably butchering my description her work but you might find more of what you are looking for there.

Most of human behavior is learned, though we can suck as infants and grasp things, most of what we do during the day we had to learn at some point. We don’t have a specific brain structure devoted to drinking coffee that is the same for all humans. Less complex organisms tend to have a much greater percentage of their brains devoted to innate behaviors than we do.

I'm not too sure why ammonia would be added, or I should say, we never used ammonia in any of our colorings, but sulfites are used as a preservative. In fact, if you punch sodium sulfite into [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_sulfite), one of the uses listed is a preservative.

Since sodium sulfite isn't exactly tasteless, there is a lot of pressure from consumers to eliminate its use in certain foodstuffs. Also, with the ever growing presence of chemophobia regarding food, consumers want less stuff added. However, sodium sulfite doesn't just limit bacteria growth.

The caramel coloring I was developing was actually based on a particular strain of corn starch. To extract the starch completely from the raw kernels, the corn was soaked in a dilute solution of sodium sulfite overnight. This helped loosen the intermolecular connections between the starch and cellulose present in each kernel. Higher yields of starch means more coloring which means lower prices for our buyers and their customers.

QCD-uctdsb,"In any experiment used to determine mass, pure energy (photons/gluons) is actually indistinguishable from matter. Imagine you have a mirrored box full of photons, and let's say that the total energy of all these photons is 9x10^17 joules. If you measure the mass of this box (say you put it on a scale) then from your mass-energy equation the box will have a mass of 10 kg. 

As another example, up and down quarks have a mass of roughly 3 MeV. You have 3 of these in a proton, so you'd guess that the proton would have a mass of 9 MeV. But nope!.. the measured mass is actually 938 MeV. This is because protons have extra ""binding"" energy (mostly in the form of gluons) which contribute to the total proton mass.

arumbar,"There is a 'minimum' lung volume - this is known as the [residual volume](http://www.admit-online.info/fileadmin/materials/images/cd_rom/1221_lung_volume.gif).  This is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after maximal expiration.  You can see some of the other typically referenced volumes in that figure there - the narrow band in the middle (tidal volume) represents air movement during regular breathing, while the peak (inspiratory reserve) represents how much additional air intake occurs during maximal inspiration.  Similarly, expiratory reserve tells you how much additional air you can blow out to reach residual volume.  These values are often clinically very significant in describing pathologies of various lung diseases (for example, someone with restrictive lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis typically has reduced volumes due to inability to fully expand the lungs, while someone with obstructive disease like COPD/asthma may have larger volumes due to air trapping).  We also use [spirometery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry) to further characterize how air moves in and out of lungs.

Outside of intentionally breathing out to collapse a lung, this can also happen with a pneumothorax, where the pressure gradient normally created by the pleural space is lost (eg due to a puncture wound to the chest).  This can result in collapse of the [lung on one side of the chest](http://www.daviddarling.info/images/pneumothorax_radiograph.gif) - note the loss of pulmonary markings on the right side of the chest (left side of the picture).",null,0,cdkejtb,1r77hw,askscience,top_week,7

With that said, it's still an important measurement to make with a spacecraft. Over the past few years, we think we may have detected methane on Mars using Earth-based telescopes - but this is a very hot topic, and very controversial. There are quite a lot of people in the planetary science community that are not convinced by the evidence, and yet also quite a lot who have based their research on it being true.

The biggest problem here is that it's an exceptionally difficult measurement to make from Earth, because our own atmosphere's methane gets in the way. When looking at a spectrum, it's hard to tell exactly what's coming from our planet, and what's coming from Mars. By measuring this from outside Earth's atmosphere, we can instantly remove that source of confusion from the data. 

The current data taken from Earth is pretty ragged and down in the noise. It's equally suspicious that the methane seems to come and go in both location and time, with only some groups detecting it, and others not able to do so (the Curiosity rover, so far, has not). Maybe it's an exciting dynamic process that suggests Mars is not a dead planet...or maybe it's just imprecise measurements. 

Either way, it's an important enough result that it bears checking with greater precision by a spectrometer outside the Earth's atmosphere.

This is because there's an awful lot of methane in the Earth's atmosphere (roughly a part per million - ppm) compared to Mars' atmosphere (if there is any - it's around a part per billion - ppb) so you have to 'correct' for the terrestrial atmosphere. This can be done, but only to a certain level of accuracy (since the atmosphere gets stirred up a lot), which turns out to be about accuracy you need to be able to detect methane on Mars at all. However, there's a bit of leeway given by the fact that spectra taken from Earth of Mars are either slightly red-shifted or blue-shifted depending on the planets' relative motion. This means you should be able to distinguish martian methane by a slight shift in the methane absorbance. Unfortunately there are other issues that mean this isn't quite as straightforward, either.

So basically this all means that we need to send instruments to Mars so they can image the atmosphere without interference. Curiosity's in-situ experiments set the level of methane as having to be very low (they didn't detect any, so it must either not have been there or be there at a level below the instrument's precision) but that was only measured at one place on the planet at one time, and the measurements we do have suggest that any methane is highly variable in the atmosphere, so really we need long term observations on a planet-wide basis, which is what orbital spectroscopy allows us to do!

DEATH-OF_RATS,"What others have said is more or less correct. There are a few stipulations, though they're tangential.

The knee jerk reflex only changes with length of the nerves between muscles around the knee and where they they hit the spinal cord. It's a locally generated spinal reflex, so the brain has no part in it (this is a general definition of a reflex - that it's generated in the spinal cord).

In addition to some variance of axon size across people, different sensory inputs have different axon conduction speeds. Proprioception is a very fast sense, where vision is relatively slow. /u/SimpleBen summarized delay times nicely. As /u/batmantis25 pointed out, the brain also compensates for the lag by extrapolating current vision to what we should expect to see next.

The same thing happens in the sensory system with tactile and proprioceptive inputs. The brain predicts what future tactile and proprioceptive input it expects to receive based on the current tactile and proprioceptive inputs in combination with the current motor output.

This sharing of motor output is called ""efference copy"" - the motor cortex sends commands directly to sensory cortex, as well as to muscles. The sensory cortex can use that information to predict what it should next feel, allowing much better control than systems that are purely reactive. This is one problem you run into with rudimentary robotics - they adjust activity to compensate for sensed (past) inputs, instead of having a good generative model of what should come next.

What this all means at a higher level is that, in very trained movements (like an olympic wrestler executing a take-down during a match), your brain knows how to predict what will come next based on current input, because it has a very good model of how the system acts. Here, ""the system"" includes the player's own body, the floor, the opponent... everything that interacts. As a result, the athlete knows quite well what move their opponent is doing once the opponent starts the move, which means they know what the future state of the opponent will be, and can respond to that future instead of the present, which is really the past. A novice wrestler does not yet have a good model built and relies only on reaction time (usually in the 200-400ms range), which is usually not enough to compete against someone with training.

The idea of ""compiled"" actions also comes into play, and are the reason for repetitive drills.

PepperJack_delicacy,"To understand prolapses, you'll need to know just a little bit about the anatomy of the pelvis. Basically, all the pelvic organs (bladder, intestines, uterus, vagina, etc.) are held in place by a sheet of muscles and ligaments referred to as the **pelvic floor**. Here is a very short clip that gives you a 3D view of what's going on down there: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWZdRebxsdM
If you take a look, you'll see that it pretty much acts like a ""net"" holding the organs in place and has passageways that let the anus (and in women, the vagina) pass through. 

The immediate cause of a rectal prolapse is a weakening of these muscles and ligaments. **Once the weight bearing down exceeds the strength of the supports, you'll get a prolapse**. What exactly causes the weakness though? The important thing to keep in mind is that we don't know the **exact** causes but there are several conditions that can increase the chances of you getting a prolapse. I'll try to outline some of the biggest factors.

* **Straining**: If you have a long history of straining while pooping because of chronic constipation, you're more likely to wear out the muscles.
* **Old age**: As you get older, your muscles get weaker in general. The same applies to the pelvic floor muscles.
* **Nerve damage**: If the nerves that supply the pelvic floor muscles don't work properly, the muscles will have a harder time supporting the organs.

Again, since we don't know the exact causes of a prolapse, it's a bit hard to say for certain why women experience it more often. The most likely explanation is that women experience pregnancy and child birth, which absolutely do weaken the pelvic muscles. 

If you're worried about getting a prolapse, remember to have enough fiber in your diet and to drink adequate amounts of water. If you notice that you're constipated a lot and having to strain, have it checked out by a doctor. 

Let me know if you want me to clarify anything.

I'm a mechanical engineering student, I noticed you have not had any responses yet, so although this is not strictly my area of expertise, I will share my thoughts on your question with no pretense of absolute certainty...If you were to model an arm or leg for example, as a set of mechanical elements, it might be reasonable to model the bone as a cylindrical beam, and the muscles and tendons as a set of parallel springs and dampers on different sides of the beam. Additionally, it might be reasonably to say that: at rest these springs are likely in a small amount of tension(putting the bones in a small amount of compression). Also, the human body is only able to actuate these springs to either relax them or to put them into greater tension. Therefore my conclusion is this: Yes! muscles and tendons provide strain relief especially in tension because the muscles are able to ""share the load"" in tension and only a minimal amount (if any) in compression because the muscles are not likely to be brought past their relaxed (small tension) state into a state of much compression, the body is simply not able to physically actuate muscles in this way.

ImpossiblePossom,"As with all things in chemistry and thermodynamics: The reactions and resulting mixture allow for a lower Gibbs Free Energy (GFE) at the conditions of reaction. 

At room temperature and in the right environment, iron reacts with oxygen to form a few different iron oxides we commonly consider rust. One could assume that this would also occur in the furnace during the production of steel from pig iron.  However iron oxides that make up rust do not end up forming at high levels because other reactions occur instead. These reaction(s) are known as decarburization reactions.  In the case of steel making the exact reactions are O + C -&gt; CO and CO + O -&gt; CO2 (per OP’s link). Some iron oxide are formed in the BOS process (FEO). However these are not the same oxide’s present in rust (Iron III Oxide and Iron III Hydroxide). The FeO that formed is either blown out the top of the furnace’s effluent gas stream or forms a separate phase in the form the slag that can be removed.

I think the crux of the question is: Why do some reactions (decarburization) occur preferentially and others do not (Iron Oxide formation). This is where Gibb’s Free Energy comes in.  At the conditions in the furnace the decarburization reactions and resulting products require an overall lower Gibb’s Free Energy.  Since Gibb’s Free Energy is always minimized at equilibrium, the reactions and resulting mixtures that require a lower GFE will occur preferentially. This is why the majority of the carbon in the pig iron reacts to form CO, and a much smaller fraction or carbon forms CO2, and an even smaller fraction of Iron Oxide (FeO) is formed. 

So why doesn’t this happen at room temperature too? Well at room temperature Iron-O2-Environment system changes dramatically such that rust formation gives a lower GFE and the Iron Oxides in rust are preferentially formed.

Thanks for the question. It really challenged me to answer it in an accurate, concise, and understandable way.

The creation of SiO2 is far more energetically favorable than the creation of, say, Fe2O3, and as such the oxygen will selectively bind with the Si and prevent rust formation. Elements like Si are intentionally added to the steel melt to scavenge oxygen and prevent rust formation (as well as to form ceramic inclusions which increase the strength/hardness of the steel); these elements are known as [deoxidizers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxidizer).

mjwaters,"I think the answer you are looking for is that there is a lot of carbon in the molten iron at this point (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_iron). When they blow the oxygen in, it will preferentially react with carbon forming carbon monoxide and releasing a bunch of heat. With good mixing from the oxygen lance and good exhaust pull from above, the CO is stirred and pulled out. Silicon also reacts with oxygen before iron, but the primary reaction is combustion of carbon. If there was no carbon in the iron, you would see very fast oxidation into iron oxide.

ImpossiblePossom,"As with all things in chemistry and thermodynamics: The reactions and resulting mixture allow for a lower Gibbs Free Energy (GFE) at the conditions of reaction. 

At room temperature and in the right environment, iron reacts with oxygen to form a few different iron oxides we commonly consider rust. One could assume that this would also occur in the furnace during the production of steel from pig iron.  However iron oxides that make up rust do not end up forming at high levels because other reactions occur instead. These reaction(s) are known as decarburization reactions.  In the case of steel making the exact reactions are O + C -&gt; CO and CO + O -&gt; CO2 (per OP’s link). Some iron oxide are formed in the BOS process (FEO). However these are not the same oxide’s present in rust (Iron III Oxide and Iron III Hydroxide). The FeO that formed is either blown out the top of the furnace’s effluent gas stream or forms a separate phase in the form the slag that can be removed.

I think the crux of the question is: Why do some reactions (decarburization) occur preferentially and others do not (Iron Oxide formation). This is where Gibb’s Free Energy comes in.  At the conditions in the furnace the decarburization reactions and resulting products require an overall lower Gibb’s Free Energy.  Since Gibb’s Free Energy is always minimized at equilibrium, the reactions and resulting mixtures that require a lower GFE will occur preferentially. This is why the majority of the carbon in the pig iron reacts to form CO, and a much smaller fraction or carbon forms CO2, and an even smaller fraction of Iron Oxide (FeO) is formed. 

So why doesn’t this happen at room temperature too? Well at room temperature Iron-O2-Environment system changes dramatically such that rust formation gives a lower GFE and the Iron Oxides in rust are preferentially formed.

Thanks for the question. It really challenged me to answer it in an accurate, concise, and understandable way.

OrbitalPete,"There are several problems with forecasting reversals. Firstly, they do not occur at regular intervals. 

I was going to post a big explanation with nice figures, but in searching for nice figures I found this, which does the job brilliantly. http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/2009/02/is-the-earths-magnetic-field-about-to-flip/

The long and short is we can go for millions of years without reversals, and a reversal is not an instantaneous thing but can take decades to millenia to occur.  

The causes are due to changes in convection direction in the outer core - convecting a fluid around a rotating sphere leads to instabilities. Then the bulk fluid direction changes, so does the field polarity.

It's worth noting that earth's field is currently not a true dipole either, there are significant positive and negative magnetic anomalies (particularly one over the South Atlantic), and if you look at the magnetic field at depth we are currently in a fairly multipolar condition, with several North and South magnetic poles. This may or may not be an indication that the poles are in the process of reversing. ",null,0,cdkd57i,1r6vce,askscience,top_week,3
McBented,"Some background: 

1) Reversals do not occur on regular intervals. It could happen after 100k years, and then not happen for a million years after that. 

2) Sometimes, the dynamo also tries to reverse, but end up the same polarity after the ""reversal"". These are called ""excursions"".

3) The reversal process itself usually takes about ~20,000 years, so it's very gradual to the time-scale we live in.

There are some people in the field who believe that we are at the beginning of a reversal right now. In my opinion it's pretty much impossible to know what the dynamo is trying to do until we're well into the reversal, so I find it pointless to speculate.

Dynamo reversals occur due to nonlinear behavior of the convecting fluids in Earth's iron-core, and its interactions with the magnetic field it generates. We can now simulate these fluids by solving the appropriate equations with a computer. In our models, we do get spontaneous reversals for geodynamo models. Since these equations are non-linear, they are not predictive for very far into the future (just like how weather forecast models are only good for the next few hours/days or so).

Interestingly, we can also model a cyclic dynamo with predictable reversals with the right parameters, like the Sun's dynamo.",null,0,cdkjlp1,1r6vce,askscience,top_week,1

* The planet would have to be extremely more massive than the moon, so that their center of mass (the barycenter), about which they both are truly orbiting, is very close to the center of mass of the planet.

* The moon would have to have been captured, not formed by normal gravitational collapse of a gaseous field. Otherwise, the clumps falling together to form the moon would not have had a chance to ""sweep"" through the area of its orbit. Someone may be able to argue down this point.

* The moon must be orbitting directly in the sidereal plane of the planet, i.e. directly above the equator, which is unlikely to occur. If its orbit has any inclination, it is no longer a ""stationary"" orbit, but could be a ""synchronous"" orbit.

* Similarly, the moon's orbit must be circular. Any elongation means the moon's speed changes throughout its orbit, also changing it from a ""stationary"" orbit to a ""synchronous"" orbit. This is also very unlikely to happen coincidentally.

GProteins,"Okay-- so I'm going to assume that you're talking about things like cuts/abrasions/etc. 

The first thing that happens is your blood vessels release a variety of cells, some to eat bacteria, some to help close the hole by a) plugging it and b) secreting chemicals that help plug it in a more stable manner (that thing we call a 'scab'). 

Then, your body rushes to fill the gap with really fibrous tissue-- mostly collagen and some elastic fibers. This is your initial scar. It's red and leaky and not terribly strong, but it's better than nothing. Your body then goes through and slowly replaces that fast-placed fibrous tissue with the normal cells that belong in the area. Eventually, the fibrous tissue gets replaced (sometimes it doesn't entirely go away), but the tissue that's there is a LITTLE smaller than the tissue that was originally in the wound area, which is why scars can feel ""tight"". 

Basically, when you're talking more severe wounds, you're just seeing more fibrous tissue, meaning a longer time for the body to replace it with normal cells.

Going back to the question in hand though: What would actually happen if these planets could touch atmospheres without being ripped to shreds (eg, assume they are made of adamantium). Well, as the gases mix some of the molecules would become gravitationally bound by the planet above and cross the gap to the other, effectively. It would also cause huge atmospheric disruption on both planets, possibly with supersonic winds created that might blow around the planet for days.

However, such a scenario would be unlikely to last for more than a couple of orbits: the atmospheric drag on both would reel in their aphelion until, rather than just kissing atmospheres, they were slamming into each other head-first.

Hiddencamper,"Nuclear engineer here.

The RBMK is graphite moderated. This means that the cooling medium and the moderation medium are separated. 

Under normal operation, water enters the bottom of the reactor, and flows upward. The water heats up on its way through the core, and the amount of steam voids by volume increases on your way up through the core. 

Steam is drastically less dense than liquid water, and is virtually transparent to neutrons when compared to liquid water. As such, an increase in voids means that my water is absorbing less neutrons. It also means that my neutrons will have a longer mean free path length, and ultimately means more neutrons will be able to get to my moderator. tl;dr, Increase in steam voids = increase in moderation = increase in power.

Inherently this has stability issues. As I increase my heat output, I'm going to increase the amount of voiding I have. This will then increase power, which further increases voiding. Active control systems which adjust control rods can come down to compensate for this. The control rods for this reactor design drop in from the top, which makes sense as the top is where the highest neutron flux is likely to be seen. Active control rod motion suppresses any power excursions and maintains the reactor in a stable operating state.

At high power levels, you are producing a lot of steam flow, and as a result, you have a high flow of water through the reactor. With high flow rates through a reactor, your boiling boundary remains fairly constant, and it takes quite a bit to have a runaway excursion, as the forced flow of water into your reactor tends to push voids out quickly and ensure cooling water gets to where it needs to be. Additionally at high flow high power conditions, the voids do not have a dominiant contribution to reactivity, meaning small changes in voids have small changes in reactivity.

When you are at low power, you are in a situation where you have low flow. Your boiling boundary is higher. Your voids have a much larger contribution to reactivity in the reactor. At low flow conditions with low control rod density conditions in boiling reactors, we observe the boiling boundary is somewhat unstable. Steam voids take longer to get out of the reactor, and they begin to have a stronger impact on reactivity. As such, anything that changes your boiling boundary even a little bit is going to have an amplified effect on your neutorn flux and power output. Little things like random noise in your pump flow can start these oscillations, causing the boiling boundary to move, which starts causing power oscillations. In the RBMK, to respond to the power oscillations, the control rods will start moving in and out to try and stabilize this. Having graphite tipped rods combined with having a control system with a response time constant in seconds (which is similar to the fuel's thermal time constant) just means that the control rods are going to be trying to catch a power change, but will have trouble keping up because it will be causing some of its own problems. 

All of these things together will drive power oscillations in the core. Under a worst case condition it can drive a runaway condition requiring a reactor scram. When operated appropriately, the reactor scram (even with the graphite tips) will have sufficient margin to preclude a steam explosion. When not operated appropriately (with nearly all control rods out), a power excursion can occur which leads to a steam explosion and loss of the unit.

The reason this is an issue at low power is due to the way the boiling boundary behaves at low flow conditions with low control rod density. The voids have too much contribution to the core's reactivity under these conditions, and small changes in voids drive large changes in flux. Because the voids contribute so much to reactivity under these conditions and the possibility of an instability can occur, RBMKs have a safety limit which requires a minimum number of control rods to be inserted at all times, to ensure that the voids do not carry enough reactivity to drive a core damaging power excursion. At Chernobyl they removed these rods past the safety limit because they were in the xenon pit, and trying to reach a specific power level on their reactor.

I'm more familiar with BWRs for instabilities. Standard BWRs like those in the US have stability issues as well at low flow low control rod density conditions, however the because the moderator and coolant are the same, they tend to be self limiting and are not capable of undergoing a power excursion/steam explosion. Most BWRs also have a system (called OPRM) that detects core stability issues and initiates an automatic reactor scram. What we see in BWRs is an oscillation with a time constant that is usually 1-2 seconds. We will start seeing small oscillations, then the oscillations will start growing. Oscillations in a BWR grow slowly. If the plant has an OPRM, it will scram the reactor prior to it increasing past certain limits. If the plant does not have an OPRM, it will grow over several minutes until the reactor hits either the high or low flux scram setpoints. The main danger in BWR type reactors is that you can cause localized thermal stress and plastic strain on the fuel (localized fuel cladding damage), but no power excursion.

For BWR light water reactors that have it equipped (all US BWRs have this) the OPRM (Oscillation Power Range Monitor) looks for counts (how many oscillations am I getting in a row), period (are the oscillations in the right time constant that is indicative of thermalhydraulic instabililty or is it just random noise), and growth (is my oscillation diverging with a &gt;1.0 decay ratio). There is also a confirmation density algorithm which uses a factor that looks at the above factors across the core to anticipate these factors before they start. If the OPRM gets enough counts, on the right period, with growth, it will initiate a scram immediately. US BWRs are forbidden from entering the region where core thermalhydraulic oscillations exist, and are required to insert an immediate reactor scram if they enter the region.

Generally, the only time a BWR enters the instability region is if they have an inadvertent loss of their reactor cooling pumps. 

Another poster mentions xenon. Xenon can cause long term issues which force you into a low rod density low flow situation, however xenon will not cause the instabilities that created the chernobyl event. Xenon does not respond fast enough (hours), while the boiling boundary response is in seconds. He's not entirely wrong, xenon transients can force you into an instable core operating region, but they do not cause the instability. Proper reactivity management can ensure that you pass around the instability region without going into it. RBMK reactors have a very tough time with the xenon pit and are more likely to put themselves into an instability, while other BWR type reactors can deal with it just fine.

grillkohle,"Are you referring to the Chernobyl incident? I will try to explain the problems without looking at that incident.  
Controlling nuclear reactors is all about controlling (slow) neutrons. The slow neutrons basically are the chain reaction.  
A big problem with reactors in low power mode is Xenon 135. It is known as a neutron poison, because it has a high probability for absorbing neutrons (and thereby reacting to the stable Xenon 136). It is formed by decay of Iodine with a half life of 6.6 hours. When the reactor is running in normal operation mode, there is a balance between the ""production"" and the ""reduction"" of Xenon 135.  
If you lower the power output, there is more production of Xenon 135 because of the delay (decay from Iodine). Hence, it is more difficult to control the reactor, you can't increase the reactivity, because the Xenon will absorb your neutrons. Usually you have to shut it down and wait until most of the Xenon is decayed itself (half life 10 hours).  
But if you try to increase the reactivity (by pulling out control rods for example), you increase the reduction of Xenon (obviously the production stays at a lower level for some time because it takes some time for the ""production"" of the Iodine and its decay), which further increases your reactivity because you have more slow neutrons because less neutrons are absorbed by the Xenon. This happens to all nuclear reactors.   
The next problem is the positive void coefficient, which basically means: more thermal activity (more reactivity) =&gt; less cooling water (because more steam (much lower density!), more bubbles) =&gt; more thermal activity because of the void coefficient [because of the graphite still moderating at higher temperatures].  
These 2 effects support each other and make controlling the reactor in a low power state quite difficult.  
In a water moderated reactor (negative Void coefficient) for example the chain reaction stops or slows down if the water vaporizes too quickly, because there is less moderator to slow neutrons down. It is sort of ""self stabilizing"".  
I don't know how much you know about reactors, but I hope I could explain it to you. I know that stuff because I took a course at the university about nuclear reactors.

jvs_nz,"There are a few reasons why multicopters have not been brought to life size yet. I can see it being feasible one day, but improbable.

* Most multicopters you see (4,6 and 8 rotors) control their pitch, altitude, and yaw by varying the speed of the blades. They can do this because the inertia of the blades is quite small, so the motors don't have a big job of changing the speed. This wouldn't be the case for full size blades needed to lift a multi-ton craft. 
This can however be offset by using variable pitch blades, much the same as on a normal helicopter - this obviously increases complexity however and also the number of components that can fail.
* 4 rotor crafts will crash if a prop fails. All 4 are fundemental to having controlled lift. 6 and 8 rotor crafts can survive quite easily if 1 prop or motor fails (provided the failure doesn't take any of the other motors out, like a blade flying through neighbouring motors). 
* The electronics and systems needed to keep multicopters afloat are still very new - only in the past 5-8 years has the technology matured enough to make such a thing feasible. 
* Cost. A single engine, single rotor heli is expensive enough. Now times that by 6 - and for what? There are very few scenarios where a traditional helicopter can't do a job a multi could. Now times the running costs by 6 as well. (I say 6 because you wouldn't build a 4 rotor due to above mentioned safety/redundancy reasons).

The reason multi rotors have taken off in the hobby and small scale world is because traditional single rotor model helicopters have been very difficult to control and learn to use - as well as horribly dangerous. Because multi rotors are controlled by software - it's easy enough to make that software user friendly, so it doesn't take much to pick up and learn. They are also cheaper in a lot of the cases - you can build a multi rotor for a couple of hundred $. 
They can also be quieter.

Farnswirth,"A lot of people here are arguing that more rotors = more complexity.  While this is true, it does not mean that more rotors = worse design.  Take the B-52 for example, it has 8 jet engines.  Or the V-22, it has two engines built on rotating pivots.  Complexity is not always bad, sometimes you are merely trading simplicity for functionality.  In the case of the B-52 you are gaining redundancy and power.  In the case of the V-22 you are gaining speed and VTOL capability.  

There is no reason you couldn't build a full sized multi-copter.  I am sure there are companies working on one right now.  The problem with multicopters is not necessarily the complexity of the *design* but the complexity of the software and control systems needed to build a full scale one.  For example, if you loose one engine on a B-52 and the flight computer fails, a pilot can still fly the plane manually with no problem.  If the flight computer fails on a multicopter - you are screwed, especially if a rotor fails as well.  A pilot simply can't react fast enough.  We've seen examples of unstable aircraft with extensive flight control systems: the F-16, the [F-22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faB5bIdksi8), [V-22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lbKqStvHI), [B-2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZCp5h1gK2Q), F-117, etc.  Consequently, most of these planes have had horrific crashes where the flight computer fails and the pilot can't react fast enough - that's just the nature of the plane.

Alcohol is metabolized predominantly in the liver and there are **3** important enzymes that you should be aware of. First, alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde by **alcohol dehydrogenase** or **cytochrome P-450**. In turn, acetaldehyde is converted to acetate by **acetaldehyde dehydrogenase**.

Both alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase create molecules of **NADH** during these reactions and NADH will inhibit gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The important thing to take away from this is that **this leads to a very fatty liver when you chronically abuse alcohol**.

Also, an alcoholic will have an increased amount of cytochrome P-450 (this is because the body tries to adapt to the increased intake of alcohol). Cytochrome P-450 handles many other reactions and will cause the body to create an excess amount of **reactive oxygen species**. Having a lot of reactive oxygen species around creates unnecessary inflammation, cell death, and fibrosis.

The hydrostatic pressure you feel at the surface of the earth is due to gravity acting on all the air above you. Now, gravitational attraction decreases with height... and if you were to create a vacuum chamber at the surface, this would have the effect of pushing air up, towards higher altitude, where gravity is weaker. So I could see that creating a vacuum chamber at the surface of the earth might actually *lower* the ambient atmospheric pressure. Analogous to the notion that if Earth's radius doubled, but the total mass of air stayed the same, the ambient pressure would be much lower.

As /u/Davecasa said, your spinal column becomes decompressed in space and your bones decrease in density. This can compensate for a good portion of your height since the spinal column counts for nearly 25% of the average person's height. The cartilaginous discs that intercalate with our vertebrae can change shape and compress to allow for weight bearing to shift from the bones themselves to the cartilage in certain positions. 

In space, and when you aren't walking bipedally, the weight bearing role of your spinal column decreases, so the cartilage can return to its resting shape and density, and your height increases, even if by a little bit.

Now, in any given person, the sequence of bases will in fact be unique, but unique doesn't mean completely different. In fact, if you lined up the sequences from any two people on the planet, something like 99% of the bases would be the same. You would see long stretches of identical bases, but every once in a while you'd see a mismatch, where one person has one color and one person has another. In some spots you might see bigger regions that don't match at all, sometimes hundreds or thousands of bases long, but in a 3 billion base sequence they don't add up to much. 

edit 2: I was wrong, it ain't a consensus, it's a mosaic! I had always assumed that when they said the reference genome was a combination of sequences from multiple people, that they made a consensus sequence, but in fact, any given stretch of DNA sequence in the reference comes from a single person. They combined stretches form different people to make the whole genome. TIL the reference genome is even crappier than I thought. They are planning to change it to something closer to a real consensus in the very near future. My explanation of consensus sequences below was just ahead of its time! But it's definitely not how they produced the original genome sequence.

If you line up a bunch of different people's genome sequences, you can compare them all to each other. You'll find that the vast majority of beads in each sequence will be the same in everybody, but, as when we just compared two sequences, we'll see differences. Some of those differences will be unique to a single person- everybody else has one color of bead at a certain position, but this guy has a different color. Some of the differences will be more widespread, sometimes half the people will have a bead of one color, and the other half will have a bead of another color. What we can do with this set of lined up sequences is create a *consensus* sequence, which is just the most frequent base at every position in that 3 billion base sequence alignment. And that is basically what they did in the initial mapping of the human genome. That consensus sequence is known as the reference genome. When other people's genomes are sequenced, we line them up to the reference genome to see all the differences, in the hope that those differences will tell us something interesting. 

As you can see, however, the reference genome is just an average genome*; it doesn't tell us anything about all the differences between people. That's the job of a lot of other projects, many of them ongoing, to sequence lots and lots of people so we can know more about what differences are present in people, and how frequent those differences are. One of those studies is the 1000 Genomes Project, which, as you might guess, is sequencing the genomes of a thousand (well, more like two thousand now I think) people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. 

*It's not even a very good average, honestly. They only used 8 people (edit: 7, originally, and the current reference uses 13.), and there are spots where the reference genome sequence doesn't actually have the most common base in a given position. Also, there are spots in the genome that are extra hard to sequence, long stretches where the sequence repeats itself over and over; many of those stretches have not yet been fully mapped, and possibly never will be.

edit 1: I should also add that, once they made the reference sequence, there was still work to be done- a lot of analysis was performed on that sequence to figure out where genes are, and what those genes do. We already knew the sequence of many human genes, and often had a rough idea of their position on the genome, but sequencing the entire thing allowed us to see exactly where each gene was on each chromosome, what's nearby, and so on. In addition to confirming known sequences, it allowed scientists to predict the presence of many previously unknown genes, which could then be studied in more detail. Of course, 98% of the genome *isn't* genes, and they sequenced that as well -some scientists thought this was a waste of time, but I'm grateful the genome folks ignored them, because that 98% is what I study, and there's all sorts of cool stuff in there, like ancient viral sequences and whatnot.

zedrdave,"In addition to other answers in this thread, one important clarification: when one says that a person's DNA is unique, that's still no more than somewhere around a 0.01% difference, out of the entire sequence, between two individuals.

Most nucleotides (the small bricks that make the DNA sequence) are the same for all individual of the same species (humans, for instance), with a very few single nucleotides changing here and there (these changes are called [SNPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism)). Just the same way that moving a single cog in a complex mechanism, or modifying a single byte in a computer program, will give out a completely different result, that single nucleotide modification can have huge consequences on the person's appearance, health etc.

Mapping the first genome, meant mapping *a* genome (with its specific SNPs), with the implicit idea that we were first interested in the parts that were common to everybody. Now that sequencing is a lot cheaper and more widespread, there are a number of efforts to map genomes for a number of individuals, in order to figure out more specifically which positions in the sequence can occasionally differ (see ""1000 genome project"").

**Edit:** I should have also mentioned that, while some SNP variations have huge effects on the resulting organism, other SNP mutations are completely silent (""synonymous mutations""), thanks to the redundancy of the DNA-Amino Acid transcription code (i.e. different triplets of DNA can end up coding for the same AA).

As a side note, this is very strong evidence that these abilities evolved only once in a distant ancestor, and then because they were so successful compared to all species around at *their* time, they outcompeted them and all their descendants now share those genes.

The closer you get to a human in genetic relatedness, the similarities extend beyond simple housekeeping genes to those which allow us to be 4-limbed, air-breathing, visually-dominant omnivores. Cows are 4 limbed - we share the same genes which switch on in embryonic development which cause 4 limbs to develop. We *also* share these with fish - after all, these are the genes which were first used to make fins, they were just 'repurposed' to make limbs through mutation and natural selection.

And so on with all 30,000 genes that make us human.

knobtwiddler,"I work in genetic informatics and we sequence and analyze human genomes.  ""complete mapping,"" rather optimistically, means is that we have assembled a reference genome of a number of pooled humans' gene sequences, so we know where a typical human's sequences fall in the chromosomes from beginning to end (around 50 billion base pairs).  This assembly is used as a reference to compare against.  Currently we are using a reference genome sequence called HG19. HG20 (human genome v20) is coming
out soon.   It's an ongoing process.


From this reference genome we can align pieces of sequenced dna from samples in an effort to to say where those pieces of dna came from in the genome.


This is far from an exact science, and there are large portions of the genome for which we have no clue about their function.  However we have identified around 56,000 protein-coding genes (the exome) and a large number of ""intronic"" non-protein-coding regions which do code for RNA (lncRNA), some of which are functional, most of which we don't know anything about (previously referred to as ""junk dna"").

jams2014,"Think of the Genome like the spec sheet for a car, except it's been broken up into 46 text files and compressed so that the data is all mashed together into 46 strings, and somewhat difficult to parse out. Somebody didn't comment their code. If we were just trying to read the strings, and infer what they mean, we would fail. But luckily! there's also an automatic, computer-controlled factory that reads the strings and builds stuff! (Cells in the body.)

In the simplest sense, genome mapping is about making the factory build from *parts* of these strings, so that we can see what they do.  Imagine that you run your fictional automatic car factory like normal - it builds you a hot little red Corvette. Now imagine that you take part of the instruction string and copy/paste/copy/paste that part until you've made that section repeat a bunch of times. When you run the factory again, the car comes out a *deep, vivid red* instead of the ordinary red from before. 

You've found a gene for the paintjob, but you don't know for sure whether you've found the gene for red paint only, or for the whole thing. Now, that section might be a little bit different in someone else - like, maybe it's a different color. If you enhanced that section in someone else's instruction sheet, maybe you'd go from blue to a more vivid blue (if all of the color selection is in that part). Or maybe you would just add red, so that someone's purple paint would approach pink.

Anyway, what you've found is the meaning of a section of the instruction sheet, but it can be difficult to determine exactly which of the machines are activated by each string. Sometimes the instructions trigger other instructions, and wind up causing lots of parts to move. Sometimes they trigger something very tiny - like spinning a part of one machine. And sometimes they don't do anything at all (like bits of commented-out code). And sometimes they do something, but don't appear to unless certain conditions are met - imagine instructions to turn on or off some safety feature on the factory floor.

- EDIT - 

To perfect the analogy - we're not talking here about running the whole apparatus to create new cars. That would be like making changes to an embryo's genes and letting them grow up, which is unethical.

It's more like flipping switches in the factory while the assembly line is down, just to see which machines start to spin, or spray paint. ",null,1,cdjw201,1r54d1,askscience,top_week,4

The difference is the wealth of knowledge already learned from this project due to its ""simplicity"", such as finding genes responsible for specific proteins and tracing them all the way back to the base pair patterns.  You can search through the big discoveries, and even look for specific proteins.

Click on chromosome 1 and then click the link for the first accession.  This first set has 31,687 base pairs (bp) (think ATCG).  You can then click on a gene and see the sequence that scientists believe is responsible for a gene.  The reason it is a ""gene"" is because it has the correct properties for coding of a gene, including a start sequence (a pattern they look for that is typical for the beginning of a gene), and a stop sequence (called codons).

Additionally, you can click and see a specific pattern of base pairs responsible for coding an mRNA and even specific proteins.  Using these ""Maps"", scientists can study each chromosome and find which genes are responsible for specific attributes of the organism.

DLove82,"Mapping tells us the relative location of stretches of DNA that actually encode something (genes). This arrangement is very very similar between individuals (rarely, duplication, deletion, or transposition events can add, move, or delete a region of DNA, but that is uncommon), even if the genes themselves differ slightly on occasion. The genes are arranged in a group of 23 different unique chromosomes, or HUUUUGE stretches of DNA that are wrapped up really tight.

Mapping tell us the location of one gene relative to another in one dimension (along a line). (EDIT: 3-dimensional genome sequence is all the rage now - it actually looks in 3D at which stretches of DNA are in contact or close to which others - this is very important because those local interactions between genes REALLY far away have turned out to really impact gene function) Each of these genes is composed of a sequence of building blocks, or nucleotides, of which there are four - A, T, C, G (each is a slightly different molecule). The sequence of these nucleotides in a gene determine almost everything about its function - when it turns on and off, what it makes, what cells it's active in. Between individuals, the sequence of these genes is nearly identical, because the products of most genes (proteins) only function if they are composed of precisely the correct sequence of molecules (amino acids). Some, however, can work to varying degrees when the sequences are slightly different. If these occur in more than 1% of the population, they're called ""polymorphisms."" If they occur in less than 1% of the population, they're regarded as ""mutant"" forms of a ""wild-type"" (or normal) gene. 

So, in fact, mapping a bunch of individuals genomes actually allows researchers to come up with a heat map of the building block changes that occur in individuals. Genomic mapping is actually what tells us specifically what areas of the genome are unique between individuals. This can be immensely helpful in disease research where large regions of chromosomes are duplicated, lost, or moved. By mapping genomes, we can say which genes specifically are lost in a certain disease, narrowing down the number of genes which might cause the disease. For example, Down syndrome is caused by an entire extra copy of a chromosome (I think it's 21). That means these individuals have an extra copy of ALL the genes on that chromosome. And since we've mapped where all the genes in the genome are, we can identify which genes might be involved in Down syndrome (this is just an example, it's not really all that practical since the chromosome encodes THOUSANDS of genes).

tl;dr: The unique components of a person's genome are very few relative to the HUGE size and homogeneity (""sameness"") of the genome as a whole between individuals. For the most part, we all have the same number of chromosomes, each with the same number of genes in the same orientation.

Now, in any given person, the sequence of bases will in fact be unique, but unique doesn't mean completely different. In fact, if you lined up the sequences from any two people on the planet, something like 99% of the bases would be the same. You would see long stretches of identical bases, but every once in a while you'd see a mismatch, where one person has one color and one person has another. In some spots you might see bigger regions that don't match at all, sometimes hundreds or thousands of bases long, but in a 3 billion base sequence they don't add up to much. 

edit 2: I was wrong, it ain't a consensus, it's a mosaic! I had always assumed that when they said the reference genome was a combination of sequences from multiple people, that they made a consensus sequence, but in fact, any given stretch of DNA sequence in the reference comes from a single person. They combined stretches form different people to make the whole genome. TIL the reference genome is even crappier than I thought. They are planning to change it to something closer to a real consensus in the very near future. My explanation of consensus sequences below was just ahead of its time! But it's definitely not how they produced the original genome sequence.

If you line up a bunch of different people's genome sequences, you can compare them all to each other. You'll find that the vast majority of beads in each sequence will be the same in everybody, but, as when we just compared two sequences, we'll see differences. Some of those differences will be unique to a single person- everybody else has one color of bead at a certain position, but this guy has a different color. Some of the differences will be more widespread, sometimes half the people will have a bead of one color, and the other half will have a bead of another color. What we can do with this set of lined up sequences is create a *consensus* sequence, which is just the most frequent base at every position in that 3 billion base sequence alignment. And that is basically what they did in the initial mapping of the human genome. That consensus sequence is known as the reference genome. When other people's genomes are sequenced, we line them up to the reference genome to see all the differences, in the hope that those differences will tell us something interesting. 

As you can see, however, the reference genome is just an average genome*; it doesn't tell us anything about all the differences between people. That's the job of a lot of other projects, many of them ongoing, to sequence lots and lots of people so we can know more about what differences are present in people, and how frequent those differences are. One of those studies is the 1000 Genomes Project, which, as you might guess, is sequencing the genomes of a thousand (well, more like two thousand now I think) people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. 

*It's not even a very good average, honestly. They only used 8 people (edit: 7, originally, and the current reference uses 13.), and there are spots where the reference genome sequence doesn't actually have the most common base in a given position. Also, there are spots in the genome that are extra hard to sequence, long stretches where the sequence repeats itself over and over; many of those stretches have not yet been fully mapped, and possibly never will be.

edit 1: I should also add that, once they made the reference sequence, there was still work to be done- a lot of analysis was performed on that sequence to figure out where genes are, and what those genes do. We already knew the sequence of many human genes, and often had a rough idea of their position on the genome, but sequencing the entire thing allowed us to see exactly where each gene was on each chromosome, what's nearby, and so on. In addition to confirming known sequences, it allowed scientists to predict the presence of many previously unknown genes, which could then be studied in more detail. Of course, 98% of the genome *isn't* genes, and they sequenced that as well -some scientists thought this was a waste of time, but I'm grateful the genome folks ignored them, because that 98% is what I study, and there's all sorts of cool stuff in there, like ancient viral sequences and whatnot.

Most nucleotides (the small bricks that make the DNA sequence) are the same for all individual of the same species (humans, for instance), with a very few single nucleotides changing here and there (these changes are called [SNPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism)). Just the same way that moving a single cog in a complex mechanism, or modifying a single byte in a computer program, will give out a completely different result, that single nucleotide modification can have huge consequences on the person's appearance, health etc.

Mapping the first genome, meant mapping *a* genome (with its specific SNPs), with the implicit idea that we were first interested in the parts that were common to everybody. Now that sequencing is a lot cheaper and more widespread, there are a number of efforts to map genomes for a number of individuals, in order to figure out more specifically which positions in the sequence can occasionally differ (see ""1000 genome project"").

**Edit:** I should have also mentioned that, while some SNP variations have huge effects on the resulting organism, other SNP mutations are completely silent (""synonymous mutations""), thanks to the redundancy of the DNA-Amino Acid transcription code (i.e. different triplets of DNA can end up coding for the same AA).

Sometimes the instructions trigger other instructions, and wind up causing lots of parts to move. Sometimes they trigger something very tiny - like spinning a part of one machine. And sometimes they don't do anything at all (like bits of commented-out code). And sometimes they do something, but don't appear to unless certain conditions are met - imagine instructions to turn on or off some safety feature on the factory floor.

To perfect the analogy - we're not talking here about running the whole apparatus to create new cars. That would be like making changes to an embryo's genes and letting them grow up, which is unethical.

It's more like flipping switches in the factory while the assembly line is down, just to see which machines start to spin, or spray paint. ",null,1,cdjw201,1r54d1,askscience,top_week,4

Here you can click on a chromosome and literally see the sequences which have been directly mapped.  The difference is the wealth of knowledge already learned from this project due to its ""simplicity"", such as finding genes responsible for specific proteins and tracing them all the way back to the base pair patterns.  You can search through the big discoveries, and even look for specific proteins.

Click on chromosome 1 and then click the link for the first accession.  This first set has 31,687 base pairs (bp) (think ATCG).  You can then click on a gene and see the sequence that scientists believe is responsible for a gene.  The reason it is a ""gene"" is because it has the correct properties for coding of a gene, including a start sequence (a pattern they look for that is typical for the beginning of a gene), and a stop sequence (called codons).

Additionally, you can click and see a specific pattern of base pairs responsible for coding an mRNA and even specific proteins.  Using these ""Maps"", scientists can study each chromosome and find which genes are responsible for specific attributes of the organism.  We can find which sections of DNA are responsible for specific proteins, and use that to find mutations that result in the absense or mutation of a protein that causes harm in an organism.

DLove82,"Mapping tells us the relative location of stretches of DNA that actually encode something (genes). This arrangement is very very similar between individuals (rarely, duplication, deletion, or transposition events can add, move, or delete a region of DNA, but that is uncommon), even if the genes themselves differ slightly on occasion. The genes are arranged in a group of 23 different unique chromosomes, or HUUUUGE stretches of DNA that are wrapped up really tight.

Mapping tell us the location of one gene relative to another in one dimension (along a line). (EDIT: 3-dimensional genome sequence is all the rage now - it actually looks in 3D at which stretches of DNA are in contact or close to which others - this is very important because those local interactions between genes REALLY far away have turned out to really impact gene function) Each of these genes is composed of a sequence of building blocks, or nucleotides, of which there are four - A, T, C, G (each is a slightly different molecule). The sequence of these nucleotides in a gene determine almost everything about its function - when it turns on and off, what it makes, what cells it's active in. Between individuals, the sequence of these genes is nearly identical, because the products of most genes (proteins) only function if they are composed of precisely the correct sequence of molecules (amino acids). Some, however, can work to varying degrees when the sequences are slightly different. If these occur in more than 1% of the population, they're called ""polymorphisms."" If they occur in less than 1% of the population, they're regarded as ""mutant"" forms of a ""wild-type"" (or normal) gene. 

So, in fact, mapping a bunch of individuals genomes actually allows researchers to come up with a heat map of the building block changes that occur in individuals. Genomic mapping is actually what tells us specifically what areas of the genome are unique between individuals. This can be immensely helpful in disease research where large regions of chromosomes are duplicated, lost, or moved. By mapping genomes, we can say which genes specifically are lost in a certain disease, narrowing down the number of genes which might cause the disease. For example, Down syndrome is caused by an entire extra copy of a chromosome (I think it's 21). That means these individuals have an extra copy of ALL the genes on that chromosome. And since we've mapped where all the genes in the genome are, we can identify which genes might be involved in Down syndrome (this is just an example, it's not really all that practical since the chromosome encodes THOUSANDS of genes).

tl;dr: The unique components of a person's genome are very few relative to the HUGE size and homogeneity (""sameness"") of the genome as a whole between individuals. For the most part, we all have the same number of chromosomes, each with the same number of genes in the same orientation.

Some animals have evolved mechanisms that use these ion gradients in pretty interesting ways in what are called electric organs.

Some use it to paralyze prey, others as defense, and others as communication and navigation.

Clusters (both globular and open) are generally thought to be made by the collapse of massive clouds of gas.

haikuginger,"I can talk about two things that were factors in the long development process of color TV: backwards compatibility and display technology.

These two topics are heavily linked together. For example, during the early days of color TV development, one system, CBS Color, was a filter that spun in front of the screen, sequentially showing red, green, and blue. With that system, each frame was transmitted three times sequentially; one time each as red, green, and blue. The TV would time the spinning of the disk to its reception of each colored frame; the red frame would be drawn on the screen while the red filter was in front, and so on.

However, to see why that wouldn't work very well, we need to take a step backwards to see how black and white TV worked. Reduced to a basic level, a stream of electrons was fired at the inside of a glass screen coated in phosphorus. When electrons struck the phosphorus, it lit up. By using electromagnets, that single beam of electrons could be moved to point at any part of the screen. 

So, to form a picture on the screen, the electron beam would sweep across the screen, line by line, with the intensity of the beam determined by the amplitude of the TV signal arriving in the set at any given moment.

So, if you fed a CBS color signal into a black-and-white TV, it simply wouldn't work. TV at that point relied on the signals coming down exactly as the set expected them to, and on being able to ""line up"" those signals so that the first bit of a frame arrived at the TV when the electron beam was pointing at the top-left corner of the screen. CBS color just couldn't do that.

So, an alternate route needed to be taken. Color TV couldn't use an additive color space (composed of separate red, green, and blue signals), it needed a subtractive color space- one that started out as a complete monochrome picture (with equal amounts of red, green, and blue) that any black-and-white TV could read, but that had bits of extra information carried alongside it that could be used to turn that monochrome picture into color.

This introduced a new challenge, though. TVs at that point in time didn't have any ""memory""- they were sending the signal from an antenna or cable directly to the picture tube. If what was coming in didn't get drawn on the screen immediately, it wasn't getting drawn at all. And, with a subtractive color space, all the color was coming in at once. Unlike with CBS color, a TV couldn't use a mechanical trick like a spinning wheel to alternate between colors being drawn by a single electron beam- it needed to draw all the colors at once.

So, the logical answer to that problem was to go from using one vacuum tube producing an electron beam to three; one for each of red, green, and blue. Each tube would fire only when aimed at a bit of phosophor designated specially for it; each bit of phosphor would have a tiny filter in front of it so that, from the front, it would appear to glow red, green or blue.

As you might guess, this arrangement introduced a new problem. Before, it didn't matter if your electron beam was aligned exactly right or if it was particularly fine; the entire tube of your TV was coated in phosphor, and the picture would show up no matter what, even if the electron beam was angled over to the left a bit.

With the new arrangement, the problem was that the electron beams weren't fine enough and couldn't be aligned exactly right 100% of the time. This meant that ""blue"" phosphor dots were being lit up by the ""red"" electron beam- and the same for every other color. A reliable color picture wasn't being produced.

That's where Werner Flechsig's shadow mask comes in. The concept is simple, but brilliant. Take a metal sheet, and poke thousands of tiny holes in it. Then, put it directly behind the screen, which has your pattern of differently-colored phosphor dots on it. Now, because you're using three different electron beams, they're each coming from a different location- and each will enter any particular hole in the shadow mask, as the metal sheet is called, at a different angle. This allows you to restrict where the electrons from each beam land on the screen.

You can try it yourself. Take a sheet of paper and poke a hole in it. Then, holding the paper still, look through that hole from different angles. You'll see different things through it. Similarly, even if the electron beams were too big to focus and align down to the sizes they needed to be, shooting them through a tiny hole from slightly different places resulted in precise control over which points on the screen they struck.

Those are the things that were necessary for color TV to take off. We needed a way to send a color TV signal that could be viewed by people with black-and-white TVs. We needed a way to put each component color of that color signal on the screen simultaneously. And we needed a way to  keep each color at the point on the screen it needed to be.",null,1,cdjv089,1r4qud,askscience,top_week,12
cheeseynacho42,"Well, a huge obstacle towards broadcasting colour television was the massive amount of bandwidth it took. This went away slowly with time, as we got better and better at transmitting radio signals. 

As far as the actual television goes, there were a lot of ideas as to how you could make a TV colour. There was combining three monochrome images (red, green, and blue ones) to make a colour one, and shooting electrons at a phosphor plate (knows as ""Telechrome""), but probably the best-known one is Technicolour.

Technicolour evolved a lot over its lifespan, and while itw as eventually replaed, throughout most of the late 40s and 50s it was the dominant way of filming in colour and broadcasting in colour. Early Looney Toons used Technicolour, and the Wizard of Oz was filmed using it. 

Also, the way you talk about black-and-white TV makes it sound like we could have filmed in colour, but chose not to. That's not the case at all - it was very hard to figure out how to properly capture colour on film, much harder than filming black and white images. They weren't stripping the colour, or changing it, that was just what the film could capture.

FatSquirrels,"That somewhat depends on what humidity you are talking about.

Absolute humidity is how much water is in the air.  Opening the window will equalize the absolute humidity between inside and outside.  Hot air can hold more moisture, but that does not mean that it necessarily has more water in it.  If it is dry outside then likely your enclosed space inside with showering, respirating humans/animals, cooking and such is actually more humid.

Relative humidity is the amount of water in the air relative to how much it can hold.  I think this is more relevant to humans as it determines the perceived temperature and how close the atmosphere is to precipitation.  Warm air can hold more water, so if you increase the temperature inside by opening a window the relative humidity will go down (assuming equal absolute humidity inside and out).  Opposite if it is colder outside.

Really what this means is that you need to know both the temperature and the relative or absolute humidity both in and outside to make this call.

Actually it may look like it's rotating faster or not at all or even in the opposite direction.

It's illusion that's very similar to what we see with camera strobing that we might see in dance club or a party, when you have a flashing light that kind of freezes dances in a series of images.

If we think of the wagon wheel and we imagine that one of the spokes is painted white and it's pointed straight up - so like at like 12:00 on a clock - if we rotate that wheel at once per second and then we take images once every second, in our minds, it's going to look like that spoke never moved, because it's always going to be pointing at the 12.

Mossman11,"I can't comment on why a cheaper high octane fuel isn't available, but considering the relatively small market and the fact that 93 octane for cars is $3.50, $6 for 100LL doesn't seem ridiculous to me.  Check out race fuels for cars, they're upwards of $10/gallon.

I do know a thing or two about motors, and octane, and compression so I can clear some stuff up there.  The 100 in 100LL is the motor octane rating.  This is a measure of how resistant to knock the fuel is, and how slowly it burns.  Especially in high compression engines, if a fuel is too volatile and its knock resistance is not sufficient, the fuel can pre-ignite due to compression alone.  When combustion happens while the piston is still on the way up, the piston now has to be fight through the high combustion pressures generated, as opposed to using them to propel it down again (the power stroke).  This is called knock, or ping, and is really bad for engine internals.  I know on some older aircraft the pilot had to control timing advance.  This would be equivalent to running too much timing advance all the time, except you can't push a lever to rectify it.  I've never flown a Cessna but I imagine if your motor grenades mid-air, that's not a good thing.  

As for why aircraft use high compression engines I would imagine it's to make the most power from the smallest/lightest engine.  Also the fact that you're flying in thin air means that you're sucking in less oxygen,nitrogen,etc. at altitude and in order to have sufficient power at altitude you'd need a high compression, knock prone engine at sea level.  

Also, I found this on wikipedia which seems like a nice feature of 100LL that possibly the proposed replacements don't have:

It turns out that [entanglement is monogamous](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9907047). If systems A and B are perfectly entangled, it turns out that they cannot be entangled (or even correllated) with any other system C. More generally, the amount of entanglement between A and B places a limit on the amount of entanglement that either system, or both considered together, can share with C. The right way to count entanglement is still an open question, but this odd behaviour is the reason why particles become un-entangled.

The most important thing to realize about entanglement is that it *cannot arise without interaction*. That is to say, systems that do not directly interact cannot become entangled. Therefore, a particle P that is entangled with a system S generally becomes less entangled with S if P interacts with another system R.

This of course begs an interesting question: is there such a thing as an un-entangled particle? All particles might be entangled with *something*.

baloo_the_bear,"Electronegativity is how strongly a particular atom attracts electrons. 

To understand what that means, you need to know what attracts electrons, and what factors can affect that.

Electron orbitals have very specific shapes in 3 dimensions, and can be thought of as a waveform. These waveforms are most stable when filled with an appropriate number of electrons. The first valence shell is *s* and the first level of the *s* orbital prefers 2 electrons, this makes it most stable. Hydrogen is nothing more than a proton and an electron, but it is very stable when it can fill its valence shell with 2 electrons, hence a high electronegativity and why it is so weird. Helium has 2 protons and 2 electrons (and 2 neutrons, but they don't matter for the moment), so its valence shell is full at 2 electrons, and it does not attract electrons to fill and sort of void, and therefore has a low electronegativity. 

Now, we talk about ionic forces.

Electrons are negatively charged, and as such they are attracted to positive charges, such as the nucleus of an atom. The force of ionic attraction is proportional to the charges of the two objects, and inverse of the square of the distance between them. The higher the positive charge of an atomic nucleus, the stronger the force of attraction, and the smaller the distance between those charges, the stronger the force of attraction.

As you move from the left to the right of the periodic table, you have more and more protons, which means an increasing positive charge in the nucleus. This increasing positive charge exerts an increasing force of attraction on the electron orbitals. This causes the **size** of the orbital to **decrease** as you move across the periodic table. This is why the **electronegativity increases going from left to right.** 

Now to add another concept.

Valence shells exist in orbitals that have different levels of energy. The fact that energy is discrete (dividable down to quanta) means that the orbitals have discrete levels, or layers. Not only do more layers increase the distance between the nucleus and the electron it is attracting, but those layers are all negatively charged and will act to repel another negatively charged electron. 
This is why as you **move down** the periodic table (increasing levels of valence shells), the **electronegativity reduces.**

Now remember that we talked about valence shells being most stable with certain numbers of electrons? The next 'magic number' of valence electrons that make the orbitals stable is 8. Now count over from left to right on the table. Florine has....**7** electrons in its valance shell, just one short. It strongly attracts that last electron not only because it is small and has a large charge in its nucleus, but because gaining another electron makes it have a **more stable** valence structure. 

OK, so we've talked about what electronegativity means, and what factors have an affect on it, but why do we care?

We stated that a stable valence shell has 8 electrons. This is why Carbon, with 4 electrons in its valence shell, will make 4 covalent bonds. Covalent bonds, as their name suggests, are when 2 atoms **share** an electron so that **both** atoms can have a stable valence shell. in the case of a covalent bond between atoms that are the same, the electron is shared equally, because the **electronegativity** of each atom is the same. However, if one atom in the covalent bond has a higher electronegativity, the electron is attracted more to that side of the bond. What happens when you're attracted to something? You want to spend more time there. Because of this unequal sharing, the bond becomes **polar**, in that one side of the bond has a slightly negative charge, and one side has a slightly positive charge. 

This matters in incredibly significant ways. Water, for example, is a polar molecule. Because of this water is liquid at room temperature, held together by hydrogen bonds (a consequence of polar molecules). DNA is also held together to their complementary strands by hydrogen bonds. 

edit: the stability of 8 valence shell electrons are also why the noble gases are very unreactive. They do not need to share electrons to be stable. The low reactivity of this group of elements is why they are called 'noble', as nobility kept to themselves.

baloo_the_bear,"Electronegativity is how strongly a particular atom attracts electrons. 

To understand what that means, you need to know what attracts electrons, and what factors can affect that.

Electron orbitals have very specific shapes in 3 dimensions, and can be thought of as a waveform. These waveforms are most stable when filled with an appropriate number of electrons. The first valence shell is *s* and the first level of the *s* orbital prefers 2 electrons, this makes it most stable. Hydrogen is nothing more than a proton and an electron, but it is very stable when it can fill its valence shell with 2 electrons, hence a high electronegativity and why it is so weird. Helium has 2 protons and 2 electrons (and 2 neutrons, but they don't matter for the moment), so its valence shell is full at 2 electrons, and it does not attract electrons to fill and sort of void, and therefore has a low electronegativity. 

Now, we talk about ionic forces.

Electrons are negatively charged, and as such they are attracted to positive charges, such as the nucleus of an atom. The force of ionic attraction is proportional to the charges of the two objects, and inverse of the square of the distance between them. The higher the positive charge of an atomic nucleus, the stronger the force of attraction, and the smaller the distance between those charges, the stronger the force of attraction.

As you move from the left to the right of the periodic table, you have more and more protons, which means an increasing positive charge in the nucleus. This increasing positive charge exerts an increasing force of attraction on the electron orbitals. This causes the **size** of the orbital to **decrease** as you move across the periodic table. This is why the **electronegativity increases going from left to right.** 

Now to add another concept.

The gate is a plate system that holds the physical medium in place. At this speed, with the proper F/stop, the film is exposed properly.

When you increase the frame rate, you need more light because the speed that the film is going through the gate is getting the proper exposure.

You can compensate for a higher frame-rate by either switching to a higher shutter speed, which can effect the motion blur of the image or you can open your lens up to a lower F/Stop. 

If you don't have the available light, you can compensate with the shutter speed but it does effect the visual aesthetic of the image.

Big cats are genetically related but distinct from house cats (as well as distinct from each other) and have different forms of the allergenic protein Fel d 1. The big cat version of the protein can cause an acute allergic reaction in humans but not all to the same extent as Fel d 1 does. I cite the same paper as brawnkowsky does; in it they have a chart of histamine release vs. concentration of proteins as well as relative release of the relevant immunoglobulins from big cats compared with Fel d 1. The lion, for example, has a significantly lower reactivity in a cat allergic patient than both a tiger and Fel d 1 cause (and fel d 1 &gt; tiger). The chart also shows dramatic (at least 50%) lower immunoglobulin release during exposure for big cat dander vs. Fel d 1/house cats. While the conclusions presented in the abstract are technically correct, since they can/do elicit an immune response, the actual data within the paper much more clearly demonstrates the nuances of their conclusion: while many are still allergenic to some extent, Fel d 1 has a much higher activity than any protein present in the big cats by a fairly wide margin for both IgE and IgG4.

Platypuskeeper,"It's a common misconception, from the [Bohr model of the atom](http://images.tutorvista.com/cms/images/38/bohr-atom-model.JPG), that there'd be any 'empty space' between the atom and nucleus. Electrons are quantum-mechanical particles, which means they don't normally occupy a precise location, nor radius from the nucleus, they're sort of 'smeared out' in space. Atoms actually 'look' more [like this](http://kaffee.50webs.com/Science/images/orbitals/1s.gif), with a diffuse 'cloud' of electrons around them, where the density represents the probability of finding an electron in the vicinity of a point. The density is actually _highest_ near the nucleus, and drops off exponentially as you move away from it.

So there's no real 'empty space' there, but some parts of space are emptier than others. (That said, there's still a concept of the vacuum in physics). 

One thing that could be said to be true of the Bohr model is that it shows that the 'size' of an atom is the 'size' of the volume which its electrons occupy. Although that's a diffuse 'cloud', it's still 4-5 orders of magnitude larger than the 'cloud' of the nucleus. 

Electrons and protons are not very 'solid'. An electron has no radius of its own, and the protons (which are composite particles) are also spread out. Due to this quantum smearing-out, electrons (if they have opposite 'spins') can occupy the same location, and the electron and proton can be in the same location, which wouldn't be possible for classical point-charges, as it would lead to infinite energies. 

The classical concepts of things 'touching' and having surfaces and volumes don't apply here. You have to flip it around: _Because_ the electron density drops off so rapidly as you move away from the nucleus, the electrical forces between two adjacent atoms get enormous within a short distance, once their electron clouds start pushing into each other. Things push back with more force than you can exert over an imperceptibly small distance, which is why things appear 'solid' to you at the large-scale, macroscopic, level.

If they actually fall at different speeds, they would separate in one case. They'll fall together in both though, because the paper is shielded from air resistance effects by the book.

IAmMe1,"The key difference here is between force and acceleration. You won't really be able to get away with avoiding inertia to explain this.

See, the gravitational *force* is indeed stronger for an object with more mass. However, that object also has more mass and thus more inertia. This means that it takes a larger force to reach the same *acceleration* for that object. It just so happens that the dependence on mass cancels out for gravity; every object experiences the same *acceleration* due to gravity.

However, the *force* of air resistance does not depend on mass; it depends on the shape of the object (and its speed). The result is that, while all objects of the same shape (moving at the same speed) experience the same *force* of air resistance, due to different amounts of inertia (mass) they experience different *accelerations* due to air resistance. In particular, since the heavy object has more inertia, the same force produces less acceleration than on a light object.

To summarize: gravity produces more force on a heavier object than a light one but the same acceleration, while air resistance produces the same force on each but less acceleration for the heavy one.",null,1,cdj7jf3,1r37tg,askscience,top_week,7
Weed_O_Whirler,"So, to answer this you have to understand the difference between ""force"" and ""acceleration"" (I know, you're thinking- of course I do! But, your explanation shows a misunderstanding between them). Gravity attempts to *accelerate* everything at the same rate- and it does this by pulling on heavier things with more *force.* 

A nine year old might not be able to fully understand Newton's second law (F = m\*a if you need a refresher) but you can probably explain it to him pretty well. Tell him to imagine a rocket hooked up to a car, and how that rocket can make the car go fast. Now imagine that instead of a car, it is a big truck. The rocket, which puts out the same force regardless, will push the truck slower than the car. And now hook that rocket up to a train, and the train might not move at all. Or if it does, it will move slowly. This is the basics of Newton's second law- if you apply the same force to objects, the heavier ones will move slower than the light ones. You can do this experiment by trying to push a book across the table, or a stack of books- you'll have to push harder for the stack. 

OK, so gravity isn't a rocket. Gravity pulls harder on things which are heavier. In fact, if you double the mass of the object, gravity will pull twice as hard. So that is like if you made a car twice as heavy, but also attached two rockets- the acceleration would be the same regardless. So, gravity provides *twice the force* on an object twice as heavy, but due to Newton's second law, that is *the same acceleration.*

So now, add in air. Air resistance comes from the object having to move air molecules out of the way as it falls. So, it makes sense that the force of air resistance would be dependent on two things- the ""surface area"" or shape of the object in the direction it is falling and the speed at which it falls. The larger the surface area (again, only in the direction of falling, a book turned up on its spine would have less air resistance than a book lying flat), the more air molecules it has to move out of the way. Also, the faster it is falling, it will hit more air molecules it has to move. So, the larger those things are, the larger the force of air resistance. 

Thus, as you might expect, a book and a single sheet of paper should have the same air resistance (at least, when it first starts to fall- eventually the book will have more because it is moving faster). So, they have the same force pushing up on them- but that *force* causes more *acceleration* on the lighter object (the sheet of paper) than the heavy one (the book). 

Playing with some numbers (we'll choose easy ones). Imagine you have a 1 kg book and a 2 kg book, and we'll say the acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s^(2). The, using Newton's 2nd law we can see that the force due to gravity on the first book is 10 Newtons (A Newton is the SI equivalent to a pound, it has units of force) and the second book at a force of 20 N. But now imagine each of them have 5 Newton's of air resistance acting on them. So, the total force acting on book 1 is 5 N, and the total force acting on book 2 in 15 N (Forces add- and since they are in opposite directions you are getting 10-5 and 20-5). So now, we can use Newton's second law to calculate their acceleration:

&gt; a = F/m (just re-arranged) 

&gt; a1 = 5N/1kg = 5 m/s^2

&gt; a2 = 15N/2kg = 7.5 m/s^2

So, the book that weighs more (but has the same air resistance) accelerates faster. ",null,0,cdj932w,1r37tg,askscience,top_week,4

natty_dread,"The thing is, that gravity **does** pull with different force on different things.

The actual constant value is *acceleration* not *force*. The sheet of paper and the book are being accelerated equally towards the ground. Since their shape is the same, the force of air resistance should be roughly the same too. However, since the book has more mass, the earth pulls harder on the book, thus making it fall faster.


The mathematical description is as follows: (This is meant to give **you** additional insight in order to give you well funded knowledge to share with your son)

 
Newton's law of gravity states that F_Gravity=G * m * M/r^2 (G being the gravitational constant, M&amp;m the masses and r the distance between them)

Now, Newtons Axiom states that the movement of a mass under the influence of a force is given by F=m*a

If we substitute F with F_Gravity we get G * m * M/r^2 = m * a.

As you can see, m can be canceled out of the equation.

This leaves us with a = g = G*M/r^2 .
This equation shows, that the acceleration of all masses in a gravitational field is, indeed, equal.

Then why are some things heavier than others?

To answer this question, we have to ask ourselves, what weight is. Weight is the force with which an object is pulled towards the earth.
Since the force, is given by F=m * a, and the mass of different object differs, the force which objects are pulled towards the ground is does not necessarily have to be constant.

Your questions are about a [vibrating string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_string). The equation for the frequency of a vibrating string is given by

f=(1/2L) \* √(T/µ)

Where f is frequency (pitch), L is length, T is tension, and µ is linear density (mass per unit length). The answers to your first two equations should be apparent from that equation, but I'll explain each by itself.

1. You increased the length while holding T and µ constant, thus f decreased.

2. You increased L while also increasing T and lowering µ (µ decreased because the mass of the rubber band is conserved, just spread over a longer band now). µ ought to change as µ=µ_0\*L_0/L, where µ_0 and L_0 are the initial linear density and length respectively. Thus, the new equation becomes: f=(1/2) \* √(T/µ_0\*L_0\*L). Tension will also increase as you increase the length, but if it's increasing more than just linearly, you'll find the frequency increasing.

IAmMe1,"Let's talk quickly about what determines pitch. The pitch of the sound wave is determined by its frequency, which is set by the number of times per second that the object producing it (the rubber band) wiggles up and down. Now, the wiggling of the rubber band itself is set by two things: the wavelength of the wiggles and the wave speed in the rubber band.

The wavelength is basically how long a wave has to be to ""fit perfectly"" into the amount of rubber band available to wiggle. This means that the wavelength is basically the length of the wiggling part of the rubber band (over 2 for the fundamental frequency, but that's not important).

The speed of waves in the rubber band is set by the band's density (a property of the material it's made out of) and the tension in the band. Higher tension makes the wave travel faster.

Also, you should know that pitch goes up if wavelength goes down and pitch also goes up if the wave speed goes up.

1) You have kept the tension in the band the same while increasing the length. This means you haven't changed the wave speed, but increased the wavelength, so the pitch goes down.

2) You have increased both the tension (EDIT: and decreased the density) and the length. Increasing the tension (EDIT: and decreasing the density) should increase the pitch, and increasing the length should decrease the pitch, so it's a question of which effect is bigger.

Essentially the answer is never.

nosignificanceatall,"It is common to describe the creep rate of a material by an empirical power law of the applied stress, i.e.  
dε/dt = k\*σ^n where k is a constant determined by the creep mechanism, temperature, etc.  If we substitute ε=σ/E, then we have a simple differential equation for the time-dependence of the stress.  It can be solved to yield  
σ(t) = ( σ(0)^(n-1) - E\*k\*t\*(n-1) )^1/(n-1)

This model predicts that the stress never reaches zero, so there will always be some expansion when the load is removed, but that the expansion becomes arbitrarily small as time increases.  If you run experiments/look up tabulated values to determine E, k, and n, then you can use the above equation to predict how much your material will expand when you remove the applied load after some time t.

Adjustments can be made to the differential equation to better suit the particular material that you are working with.  For example, when the dominant mechanism of deformation is dislocation creep (as is probably the case for your example of a spring), it is common to replace σ^n with (σ-σ\*)^n - that is, the material ceases to creep once the stress drops below some threshold σ\*.  In this situation, the material will still expand by σ\*/E even if you leave it under stress for an indefinite amount of time.",null,2,cdje1vg,1r35c8,askscience,top_week,5
Trill-Nye,"Materials scientist here. Technically, all materials will, over a long enough time scale, relax at the atomic level such that any stresses are negated.

Stress, like almost everything else, really happens at the atomic level. When you compress a string, the atoms in that metal must rearrange in some way to accommodate this deformation. This can means stretching of atomic bonds or simply the grinding together of microscopic grains within the metal, for example. These structural rearrangements will leave the atoms in a high energy state.

Thermodynamically, atomic systems tend to relax to their lowest energy accessible state. Thus, when the atoms are rearranged during deformation, they will then move around until they adopt an arrangement that minimizes the material's internal stress, one similar to that exhibited prior to deformation. The problem is that, at room temperature, this process is extremely slow. The motion of atoms, called diffusion, is, for most materials, only appreciable at high temperatures.

So yes, the relaxation time of an applied stress can be calculated if a lot of material specific values related to atomic vibrations, diffusion, grain boundary slide, structure defects, etc. are known. For most engineering materials, at room temperature, this will yield very long times (sometimes geologic timescales). Plastics, on the other hand, often relax very quickly, such that it can be observed in laboratory experiments.

FlyingSagittarius,"Springs are usually made of metal, which has already been discussed.  Ceramics act similarly, within the elastic limit at least.  Polymers, on the other hand, can have both a strain and a strain rate, so if you apply a constant strain to most plastics they will eventually flow to relieve the stress.

The basic equation for this behavior is e = (S / E) + (T / V)*t.  e is the normal strain, S is the normal stress in the material, E is the tensile modulus, T is the shear stress in the material (which always exists, even if only normal force or stress is applied), and V is the viscosity.  If you set a value for e and you know everything else, you can solve for the time.  E and V are material properties, T can be calculated from S, and S can be calculated from e.  The resulting expression is a differential equation that shows the stress in the material asymptotically approaches zero, and the strain rate asymptotically reaches zero.  The time constant depends on the material properties.

This is for a constant strain, though.  What about for a constant stress?  This would be like suspending a weight with a polymer rope.  As the polymer rope supports the weight, the polymer flows to relieve the stress.  But the weight responds by dropping down, and ""reapplying"" the stress.  So the stress stays constant, and the rope would respond with a constant strain, plus a constant strain rate.

Sometimes they only converge (or make sense) for particular values of the variable. Sometimes we write other functions in terms of power series, such as exp(x) = sum(n = 0 to infinity) x^(n)/(n!). There are methods to figure out how to write a given function as a power series. In that sense, a power series is way to represent a function that is often more convenient. For instance, if you had paper and pencil only, how would you compute exp(2)? The best way is to use the power series. (Many calculators and mathematics software internally use power series, or something related, to compute exp, sin, cos, etc.)

In algebra, by contrast, we sometimes use ""formal"" power series. A formal power series looks just like a usual power series but it's regarded as its own object divorced from any notion of values of x for which it converges or not. The coefficients of the formal power series may be chosen from a given ring or field (generalizations of real numbers). We can add, multiply, even divide formal series using the usual rules, and doing so we define a ring or field of power series that are of interest to algebraists. This kind of power series is less encountered in applications.",null,1,cdjhknw,1r2u62,askscience,top_week,2
Spiralofourdiv,"Which part is confusing, the ""power"", or the ""series"" part?

It's important you understand what a series representation of a function is fairly well before you can understand what makes a power series special. A power series is just a clever way of rewriting a function as a, perhaps infinite, polynomial using its derivatives and a center. How it works takes a bit of calculus background. If you have a calculus background and are still mystified, then your hang up probably will be answered sometime throughout a real analysis course. 

However, I have a feeling exploring series' in general as representations of functions might answer part of your question. A great example is a Fourier Series, which is a way to describe **any** periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines. First, consider and understand [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sine_curve_drawing_animation.gif) illustration of sine. Now look at what a [Fourier Series](http://i.imgur.com/w1IuPKJ.gif) looks like in the same fashion. If you were to add an infinite number of circles, you'd have a square wave, even though it's simply a sum of the very-non-square trig functions. Each additional circle is just another sine or cosine term in the series, and this makes sense in the picture! A little circle is added on that behaves the same way. The specific radii and angular frequency will depend on the series, but study this gif and it will make sense how the series approaches a square wave.

Most series work in a really similar way: they start out as a broad approximation and then, as more terms are added, get closer and closer to the function. Sometimes you can describe the function in a finite number of terms, and sometimes you need an infinite amount. A power series is no different: each term in the sequence of partial sums is a more accurate approximation of the function than the proceeding element. With an infinite amount of elements, we get infinite accuracy and we're done.

If you're asking WHY an infinite series is easier to deal with than the original, nice looking function, all I can say is there are too many reasons to count, or at least applications to count. Most of the time it has to do with certain operations being significantly easier to do on the series representation.",null,0,cdkx38e,1r2u62,askscience,top_week,1

Atoms, rather than nuclei, did not become stable till the universe was about 370,000 years old; prior to this, the universe was so hot that electrons and nuclei did not reliably bind.

The nuclei heavier than the ones made right after the Big Bang are primarily formed via the nuclear fusion processes that go on in stars.

2dwgs,"Coarsely ground coffee is usually exposed to water for more time (french press, for example) which leads to a bold cup of coffee. But finer ground coffee has more surface area exposed, which leads to a stronger flavor when comparing coarse vs. fine *given everything else is the same* (brew time, water amount, origin, roast, etc.)",null,0,cdizqhy,1r2jdi,askscience,top_week,8
endocytosis,"Not a barista, but increasing the grinding time on something has an effect on surface area.  Here's an example:

4 coffee beans, 16 x 16 x 16, total volume = 16384 units (4096 units each, assume for simplicity the coffee is cubic in shape)
SA = 6*L^2 = 6*256 = 1536 x 4 = 6144 units total surface area

The coffee goes through a special grinder and the grinds are perfectly halved in size to be Coarsely ground coffee:
8 grounds of coffee, 16 x 16 x 8 = 16384 total volume (2048 units each, no size is lost)
SA = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 2(16*16) + 2(16*8) + 2(16*8) = 8*(512 + 
256 + 256) = 8192 units total surface area

This makes sense.  You don't put coffee beans into a coffee maker, you grind them up.

The coffee again goes through the special grinder and the grinds are perfectly halved in size to be Finely ground coffee:
16 grounds of coffee, 16 x 8 x 8 = 16384 total volume (1024 units each, no size is lost)
SA = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 2(16*8) + 2(8*8) + 2(8*8) = 16*(256 + 
128 + 128) = 8192 units total surface area

No Change.  So we keep on grinding...

The coffee once again goes through the special grinder and the grinds are perfectly halved in size to be Super Finely ground coffee:
32 grounds of coffee, 8 x 8 x 8 = 16384 total volume (512 units each, no size is lost)
SA = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 2(8*8) + 2(8*8) + 2(8*8) = 32*(128 + 
128 + 128) = 12288 units total surface area

Now the surface area is greater, but it is worth noting that the relationship between surface area and grind time isn't exactly linear.  However, the more finely ground something is, *usually* the slower it is that the coffee passes through.  More coarse grinds are bigger and don't fit together as well, so there's more room for water to pass around the bits and pieces.  Finer grinds will pack together more tightly and slow the passage of water, probably increasing flavor and caffeine extraction.

TL;DR: Grinding coffee more increases surface area, but you need to fine-tune your grinding to get the maximal effectiveness.  Also the finer the grind, the longer the water will sit.",null,2,cdj21cy,1r2jdi,askscience,top_week,3

dddm,"A single atom or particle (or photon) passing through a human body would never be able to cause much damage, although a beam containing many individual particles certainly could.  There is a range of energies that are most damaging and it's not accurate to say that higher energy radiation sources always produce greater radiation damage.

If the energy is too low, below about 5-100 eV depending on which [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation#Ionization_and_the_definition_problem) is used, the radiation is not energetic enough to ionize the target material.  This type of non-ionizing radiation is generally not much of a concern (sitting near a normal light bulb probably won't cause much long term damage), but there still are some [damaging effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation#Health_risks) mostly due to heating in the target material.

Above the ionizing threshold, radiation damage generally increases with energy up to a certain point.  This is because radiation damage is generally proportional to the total energy deposited.  If the energy of the incident particle isn't too high, it will stop within the target material, indicating that all of its kinetic energy was deposited into the target.  In this regime, higher energy particles will always lead to a larger radiation dose.

However, the situation isn't as clear when the incident particle has enough initial energy to pass through the target.  Even if a particle passes through the target, much of its initial energy may be deposited in the target material along its path.  The rate of energy deposition (called the [stopping power](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/passagerpp.pdf)) as a function of depth within the target is described by the [Bragg curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_peak).  As an approximation, the shape of the Bragg curve depends mostly on the species and initial energy of the incident particle, and on the density of the target.

The rate of energy deposition by a particle generally decreases for shallow depths as the particle initial energy increases.  Thunderf00t has an excellent video describing this effect (the pertinent discussion is towards the end of the video, but the whole video is relevant):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6v8MtuVdU

For very high energy, the thickness of a human body may be a very small portion of the maximum radiation depth, and the stopping power in this depth range would approach zero as the particle energy increases.  So there exists a threshold energy above which the particle actually does less radiation damage compared to (comparatively) lower energies.

Estimating this threshold energy for simple geometries, such as a human hand in a large vacuum, can be done by integrating the stopping power up to the target thickness and comparing the result for different energies.  For more complicated geometries, for example those involving non-vaccum materials near the target that may produce secondary particles when exposed to the initial radiation, the system generally needs to be simulated using particle tracking toolkits such as Geant4, FLUKA, or MCNP.

In any case, a single particle cannot impart an infinite amount of energy into a target material.  The maximum deposited energy would be on the order of 100's of MeV for protons, yielding a single proton maximum effective dose of maybe 100 nSv.  This is an negligible dose compared to [other common exposures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(radiation\)), such as the daily background dose of about 10,000 nSv.

A string of particles, which would be a model for a particle beam, can certainly lead to intense radiation damage, since a typical particle beam may contain on the order of 10^10 individual particles.",null,2,cdjaj1n,1r2gwb,askscience,top_week,7

yinz_n-at,"Depends. Lost of Probability involved. The higher the energy the more damaging but also the more likely it'll just go straight through you (gamma ray) . Low energy particles are less damaging but more likely to collide with a nucleus in your body (atoms are vastly empty).

A neutron from radioactive decay is pretty damaging because it has a high probability of colliding with a human nucleus. 

And one nuclei isn't all that damaging because the probability of one particle causing damage is very small. Now a flux or beam of particles will do some serious damage. 

Side Note: Ingesting a radioactive material is pretty dangerous because every decay product will be absorbed by your body. Alpha particles are pretty easy to shield against but if theyre not shielded then they'll definitely knock some nuclei around (worst case is knocking a DNA nuclei out causing mutations.)

dddm,"A single atom or particle (or photon) passing through a human body would never be able to cause much damage, although a beam containing many individual particles certainly could.  There is a range of energies that are most damaging and it's not accurate to say that higher energy radiation sources always produce greater radiation damage.

If the energy is too low, below about 5-100 eV depending on which [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation#Ionization_and_the_definition_problem) is used, the radiation is not energetic enough to ionize the target material.  This type of non-ionizing radiation is generally not much of a concern (sitting near a normal light bulb probably won't cause much long term damage), but there still are some [damaging effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation#Health_risks) mostly due to heating in the target material.

Above the ionizing threshold, radiation damage generally increases with energy up to a certain point.  This is because radiation damage is generally proportional to the total energy deposited.  If the energy of the incident particle isn't too high, it will stop within the target material, indicating that all of its kinetic energy was deposited into the target.  In this regime, higher energy particles will always lead to a larger radiation dose.

However, the situation isn't as clear when the incident particle has enough initial energy to pass through the target.  Even if a particle passes through the target, much of its initial energy may be deposited in the target material along its path.  The rate of energy deposition (called the [stopping power](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/passagerpp.pdf)) as a function of depth within the target is described by the [Bragg curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_peak).  As an approximation, the shape of the Bragg curve depends mostly on the species and initial energy of the incident particle, and on the density of the target.

The rate of energy deposition by a particle generally decreases for shallow depths as the particle initial energy increases.  Thunderf00t has an excellent video describing this effect (the pertinent discussion is towards the end of the video, but the whole video is relevant):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6v8MtuVdU

For very high energy, the thickness of a human body may be a very small portion of the maximum radiation depth, and the stopping power in this depth range would approach zero as the particle energy increases.  So there exists a threshold energy above which the particle actually does less radiation damage compared to (comparatively) lower energies.

Estimating this threshold energy for simple geometries, such as a human hand in a large vacuum, can be done by integrating the stopping power up to the target thickness and comparing the result for different energies.  For more complicated geometries, for example those involving non-vaccum materials near the target that may produce secondary particles when exposed to the initial radiation, the system generally needs to be simulated using particle tracking toolkits such as Geant4, FLUKA, or MCNP.

In any case, a single particle cannot impart an infinite amount of energy into a target material.  The maximum deposited energy would be on the order of 100's of MeV for protons, yielding a single proton maximum effective dose of maybe 100 nSv.  This is an negligible dose compared to [other common exposures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(radiation\)), such as the daily background dose of about 10,000 nSv.

A string of particles, which would be a model for a particle beam, can certainly lead to intense radiation damage, since a typical particle beam may contain on the order of 10^10 individual particles.",null,2,cdjaj1n,1r2gwb,askscience,top_week,7

A neutron from radioactive decay is pretty damaging because it has a high probability of colliding with a human nucleus. 

And one nuclei isn't all that damaging because the probability of one particle causing damage is very small. Now a flux or beam of particles will do some serious damage. 

Side Note: Ingesting a radioactive material is pretty dangerous because every decay product will be absorbed by your body. Alpha particles are pretty easy to shield against but if theyre not shielded then they'll definitely knock some nuclei around (worst case is knocking a DNA nuclei out causing mutations.)

snusmumrikan,"Starting a new comment because I'm directly answering your question but that is not to take away from some valid points made by Rupert and botanist. 

I have experience in early R&amp;D at the UKs largest pharma (devilishly difficult clue there). 

For a new drug to have even the slimmest chance of getting to first-time in human (FTIH) it has to have gone through extensive and rigorous tests. Initially almost all drug design begins with the development of assays (repeatable standardised test experiments) which are used to screen a company's vast library (millions and millions) of compounds. These assays are becoming more extensive and phenotypicaly relevant over time as the biggest problem in drug development is attrition, and for every step further down the chain you take a compound before finding out it is not fit for use as a medicine it costs exponentially more - you want to be almost completely sure you're compound is viable before progressing it. A shift away from standard model cell lines and towards disease-relevant tissue samples derived from patients is currently underway as this gives significantly more confidence that the 'hits' are actually good, whilst doing away with the confidence, experience and reliability of those extensively studied model cell lines. If you're interested I can send you sections of my Masters research project which was in this area and has the appropriate references.

Once you have your hits from your initial screen these are then run against standard assays for things like cardiac liability (will it mess up ion channels in your heart?) or general toxicity to know whether it shouldn't be allowed in your body at all, you'd be surprised just how often certain molecules come up as great hits (elevating the protein which is deficient in a disease, for example) but turn out to be the old red herrings like HDAc inhibitors.

After this the compound will be carried forwards into animal trials, and this is where there is too much variation to try and cover it all but it will usually start in something small with a shorter lifespan like mice, potentially recombinant mice which have had a disease phenotype replicated within them, along with healthy controls and so on. After this other animals may be used, for example for respiratory and cardiac models, dogs are used as they represent the most human-like model.

Once the animal testing has been done extensively and for a long period to identify any and all side effects, if there are none which would indicate toxicity or severe side effects in humans the company will spend several months compiling the data, checking it, analysing it extensively before submitting it for Phase 0 clinical trials. These are before phase 1 trials and involve extremely low doses in relatively very few people in order to assess at an early stage the pharmacokinetic (where it goes inside you) and pharmacodynamic (what it does) implications of the compound. 

As you can see it takes a lot to get there and companies want to be incredibly sure of their compound before going near a human because A: it costs an armada full of money and B: no one wants another thalidomide. 

This is obviously a huge subject and i have left out many of the initial stages and assumed the compound came from a small molecule library (as opposed to chemical design, structural rational design or biologics such as antibodies) but the general principles remain true.

czyivn,"All the rules of pharma are written in blood.  Past experiences with bad drugs have shaped our current practice to prevent patient deaths.  Here are the major things that prevent human deaths during drug trials:

1. Test it before it gets to animals.  Lots of general mechanisms where drugs kill people are already known.  Inhibition of hERG channels causes cardiac deaths, so they have an assay where all drugs are tested for hERG inhibition.  Liver damage is another mechanism, so all drugs are tested for toxicity to hepatocytes. 

2. Test it extensively in animals.  Before it ever sees a human, the drug has usually been tested in at least rats and at least one larger animal (dogs, monkeys, pigs).  We aren't smart enough to predict animal toxicity in advance (and anyone who says otherwise is a liar), so the only way to be safe in humans is to test it in other animals first.

2. Dose escalation.  They start out in humans at doses that are usually much less than where they expect serious side effects.  They gradually increase the dosage until side effects start to appear, like elevated liver enzymes.

polistes,"In addition to the answers already given, I'd like to also illustrate this issue with the difference between short-lived plants and long-lived plants (I like using plants because they cannot run away from their problems). Some plants live for many years, while others only live one season. There are advantages for both strategies. Short lived plants use resources quickly and don't have to invest too much in adaptations for surviving hard conditions, like a dry period or winter. They simply make lots of seeds, which can survive these difficult periods. On the other hand, if there is a year in which the growing season is very tough as well (prolonged drought, insect pests like locusts), the population of single-season plants gets a large blow, because many plants won't make it to seed production and you end up with less seeds being deposited.

Now if you are a long-lived plant, you invest a lot in these survival skills and grow slower. If you endure a particulary hard year, you may end up with not having enough energy to make flowers and seeds. However, this is not that bad, because you'll have a new chance next year! For example, there are a lot of plants in remote areas that struggle to attract pollinators for their flowers, so they end up not having seeds in many consecutive years. However, because they are long-lived, they still have many opportunities to pass their genes. If you were a short-lived plant, your population would die of pretty soon.

oliverisyourdaddy,"I'm an evolutionary anthropologist!

They compared the genomes of humans and chimps, estimating the total number of divergences (changes).  Then they calculated the average number of mutations (changes) in one generation (by comparing the genes of parents and children).  

Then they performed the following calculation: 
[(Number of total divergences)/2]/(mutations per generation)
to determine how many generations have passed since the divergence of humans and chimps.  (They divide the total number by two because the divergences represent changes accumulated in both the chimp genome AND the human genome, whereas you want the number of generations for just one species, since they're happening simultaneously.)

Now that they have the number of generations, they convert that to a time by multiplying that number by the average generation time - that is, the age at which a parent has a child (the average child, not first or last). 

So basically, find out how different the genomes are, find out how many mutations happen per generation, and calculate how many generations have passed.  Then multiply by the number of years a generation is.

Finally, they corroborate it with fossil evidence.  We can date fossils using isotope dating, so if we have fossils for all the ""intermediate"" species dating back to a common ancestor for two species, we can get a good timeframe for their divergence.  The problem with fossil evidence is that it's actually very limited for non-human apes.  We have a good fossil record for the human lineage, but not for the chimp, gorilla, or orangutan lineage.  The next closest primate that has a really good fossil record is actually macaques (a type of monkey), so calculations are often checked against the macaque record.  For a long time, our ape calculations actually didn't jive so well with the macaque record.

Something interesting happened in 2012 (I could be misremembering the year).  Scholars named Scally and Durbin proposed that the calculations had all been incorrect because they had used generation time for *current apes*.  Larger animals tend to have larger generation times (bigger animals have kids later, take longer to mature), and extant modern apes are generally larger than their ancestors.  Therefore the ""generation time"" variable was decreased a little, and these guys' new calculations fit better with the macaque evidence.

Some proteins, such as cytochrome c (present in almost all organisms) seem to have a fairly consistent time between neutral mutations, meaning that if most mutations are neutral (have no effect on fitness), and if they occur at more or less regular intervals, you can estimate how many new mutations you should see in a generation. 

Thus, by measuring the number of mutations in that protein from the time when two now distinct species had the same or very similar versions of these proteins, one can theoretically estimate the time these species diverged. There are several limitations of this process, like fossil prevalence, generation time and metabolic rate, among others. So while it may not be a perfect process, it's not without its uses.",null,73,cdiruch,1r1z4w,askscience,top_week,382
oliverisyourdaddy,"I'm an evolutionary anthropologist!

They compared the genomes of humans and chimps, estimating the total number of divergences (changes).  Then they calculated the average number of mutations (changes) in one generation (by comparing the genes of parents and children).  

Then they performed the following calculation: 
[(Number of total divergences)/2]/(mutations per generation)
to determine how many generations have passed since the divergence of humans and chimps.  (They divide the total number by two because the divergences represent changes accumulated in both the chimp genome AND the human genome, whereas you want the number of generations for just one species, since they're happening simultaneously.)

Now that they have the number of generations, they convert that to a time by multiplying that number by the average generation time - that is, the age at which a parent has a child (the average child, not first or last). 

So basically, find out how different the genomes are, find out how many mutations happen per generation, and calculate how many generations have passed.  Then multiply by the number of years a generation is.

Finally, they corroborate it with fossil evidence.  We can date fossils using isotope dating, so if we have fossils for all the ""intermediate"" species dating back to a common ancestor for two species, we can get a good timeframe for their divergence.  The problem with fossil evidence is that it's actually very limited for non-human apes.  We have a good fossil record for the human lineage, but not for the chimp, gorilla, or orangutan lineage.  The next closest primate that has a really good fossil record is actually macaques (a type of monkey), so calculations are often checked against the macaque record.  For a long time, our ape calculations actually didn't jive so well with the macaque record.

Something interesting happened in 2012 (I could be misremembering the year).  Scholars named Scally and Durbin proposed that the calculations had all been incorrect because they had used generation time for *current apes*.  Larger animals tend to have larger generation times (bigger animals have kids later, take longer to mature), and extant modern apes are generally larger than their ancestors.  Therefore the ""generation time"" variable was decreased a little, and these guys' new calculations fit better with the macaque evidence.

My understanding has always been that divergence time estimates are generally obtained based on fossil calibration. These estimates are then compared to the number of (purportedly neutral) substitutions to obtain a neutral substitution rate and hence mutation rate, *not the other way around*. Measuring mutation rates in vivo is really hard, and we've only just recently been able to do it with any degree of precision, and a variety of factors can cause it not to agree precisely with mutation rates estimated phylogenetically (though they typically agree to within fifty per cent or so).

My_Nipples_AreOnFire,"Your question actually touches on a great deal of pharmacological principles. Classical pharmacology assumes that a drug's therapeutic/toxic effects are directly related to concentration achieved at the site of action (ie. the tissue/cells that the drugs are effecting). This concentration is directly correlated to the concentration achieved in the blood, since this is essentially how much drug will be distributed to the site of action. This assumption leads to the conclusion that taking more of a drug will ellicit a greater effect:

* Greater drug concentration administered -&gt; greater blood concentration achieved -&gt; greater distribution to site of action -&gt; stronger elicited effect

This principle has essentially dictated pharmacology for a long time and has had good results.

However, I think this is what others are getting at, this does not mean that greater dose necessarily means more **therapeutic** effect. This simply means greater dose produces greater effect. After a point, this effect leads to a **toxic** effect rather than a therapeutic one. As you increase concentration you will reach a point where 100% of respondents are experiencing the drug effect, but you enter a concentration where toxic effects are produced. So to answer your question, classical pharmacology (actually pharmacokinetics, to be specific) would say, in terms of effect, no. Greater concentration of drug will elicit greater effect up to a point, but this does not necessarily equal the desired therapeutic effect. Just the drug's chemical effect.

This is the distinction that must be made. Because some drugs (such as those listed by /u/YoYoDingDongYo) will have some idea therapeutic dose, but prescribing a dose greater than that could lead to a greater *drug* effect that inhibits it's *therapeutic* effect.",null,2,cdj4v6k,1r1xxt,askscience,top_week,4
mrdeath5493,"So basically I think you would want to look into dose-response curves.  [This one](http://www.softchalk.com/lessonchallenge09/lesson/Pharmacology/dose_response.png), for morphine, shows that at some point increasing the dose  no longer increases its analgesic effects (pain relief).  But if you keep going, you start getting way way too much respiratory depression.  So if you were giving a dose that was too high for a particular patient, then you could decrease the dose and it would be just as effective at pain relief but with very little of the undesirable effect.  In a way, a decrease in this manner is making better use of the drug.  even though I don't think this is what you were looking for, it applies to most drugs and is a very good example to start with.

From here it is important to note that it is all relative.  Drugs have many effects, but are mostly used for a single effect.  I'll try to focus on the single therapeutic uses instead of the side effects.  In trying to answer your question, I found myself at a theoretical conundrum.  The smallest dose of a drug would be 1 individual particle.  Is there a drug out there that has its greatest effect at 1 particle and then decreases in effect as you increase the dose.  I wasn't sure that was possible, [however /u/YoYoDingDongYo provided an excellent example](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1r1xxt/chemistrypharmacology_are_there_any_drugs_that/cdir0dx) where a drug was more effective at *1 part per billion* than at higher doses which actually kinda blew my mind.

Why is this?...The following is educated guessing:  Well, the drug in that study exerts an effect a 1ppb, and at some point past that it must breech a threshold where it activates another biological process that works against the desired effect.  Either a detection mechanism is triggered or as it becomes more concentrated the cell might start to actively eliminate it.  I would like to see studies to see if there was an induction of elimination and if it was permanent.  Also, it might be helpful to look at 1,2,3,4, etc. ppb to see if there might actually be a threshold and perhaps an increasing effect on its way to 1,000 ppb.",null,2,cdiwwtj,1r1xxt,askscience,top_week,3

[John Dalton's theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton%27s_atomic_theory#Atomic_theory) in 1800 was more than just a neat idea: he took the time to deduce what consequences would follow from the initial idea, such as different types of atoms having particular weights, and used his theory to [explain his observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_multiple_proportions).

The thing is, 100% certainty is impossible. Alternative theories can always account for the observed evidence if you twist them enough. The geocentric model of the solar system was bolstered by adding more and more [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle) to fit the planets' observed orbits, and even though the heliocentric model is much simpler, the geocentric one isn't actually ruled out.

A rule of thumb to decide between two models is [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor), which basically says that you should prefer the simpler theory as long as it explains the same data.

The [precession of Mercury's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury) could be dismissed as observational error, or a result of some unknown celestial body influencing it, or other explanations.

There is too much evidence and consistency in the model we have.  The model cannot be proven 'wrong' at this point.  It can be proven to be a constrained version of a more general model.  We could discover them doing something we didn't notice before if we put them under extreme conditions we havn't observed them under before.

It's just when you things get extremely massive and/or fast, or are massless, the equations no longer accurately describes their behavior.  But if you use the more general equations Einstein and others have developed since, the equations reduce back to the Newtonian approximations when used on everything from large molecules to stars going slower than 1% lightspeed.

This has to do with how we figured out how the elements were [ordered in the periodic table](http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/resources/periodictable/pre16/order/atomicnumber.htm).

It is important to note that additional knowledge can further refine a theory, but that in the context of what was known the original theory is not incorrect, but limited.

miczajkj,"I can choose an coordinate system, where the Origin and the trajectory of the object lie in the same plane and make this plane the xy-plane. 
The origin is now (0,0). Now if the particle is moving with constant velocity v (constant velocity also means always the same direction) I can choose t=0 in a way, that d(0) = (d_0, 0) and v(0) = (0, v). Than the position of the object at an arbitrary t is d(t) = (d_0, vt). 

This is only an coordinate displacement, so the formula is completely non-relativistic. The relativistic effects only arise in the objects reference frame.

Okay, now let's have a look on what we think about the particles position. At the time t we see the particle at the position b(t). As the light from the particle has taken the time t' = |b(t)|/c this is equals:

b(t) = d(t-t') = d(t-|b(t)|/c)

So now we have an implicit equation to calculate b(t) from a given d(t)!
Let's substitute it into our equation. Notice, that the x-coordinate doesn't change (it's always d_0) so we only need to investigate the y-coordinate: 

y = v*(t-sqrt(d_0² + y²)/c)

(always read y as y(t).)

We can easily solve this equation vor y: 

First we introduce ß = v/c and write the equation as

y - ßct = -ß sqrt(d_0² + y²)  
y² - 2 ßct y + ß²c²t² = ß² (d_0² + y²)
y²*(1-ß²) - 2ßct y + ß² (c²t² - d_0²) = 0  
y² - 2 ß/(1-ß²) ct y + ß²/(1-ß²) (c²t² - d_0²) = 0  

y = ß/(1-ß²) ct +- sqrt(ß²/(1-ß²) c²t² - ß²/(1-ß²) (c²t² - d_0²))  
y = ß/(1-ß²) (ct +- sqrt(c²t² - (1-ß²)(c²t²-d_0²))  
y = ß/(1-ß²) (ct +- sqrt( ß²c²t² + d_0²(1-ß²))

We can now think about what y(0) should be: because the particle is moving towards positive y-values, y(0) should be negative - it is a position the particle has been before t=0. So we need to take the negative root. (The other root belongs to the so called advanced particle [in comparison to the retarded particle] that is no physical solution to this situation). If we choose to substitute ß=v/c again, we get: 

y(t) = 1/(1-v²/c²) (vt - v/c sqrt( v²t² + d_0²(1-v²/c²))

Now the current position of the particle is (d_0, vt) = (u, w) so the observed position as a function of current position and the velocity is

(x(u, w, v), y(u, w, v)) = (u, 1/(1-v²/c²) (w - v/c sqrt(w² + u²(1-v²/c²)))

What can be expressed more nicely by using ß=v/c and  γ = 1/sqrt(1-v²/c²) as

(x, y) = (u, γ²(w-ß sqrt(w²+u²/γ²)))

To find the solution in other coordinate systems you can now make simple coordinate transformations. (Note that it get's more complicated, as v -&gt; v(cos ϕ, sin ϕ) because you need to know the direction too.)

It's a funny thing, that all those relativistic factors show up, even if we didn't choose to use any features of special relativity. 

[Can you think of the reason?](#s ""It's because the whole formalism of relativity is inspired from the asumption of retarded potentials. It needs to reproduce the feature of delay between the emission of a signal and the measurement of this signal at another position. Therefore these factors are inherent if you choose to consider finite speed of information."")

It's the simple formula for displacement with a constant velocity.

d = d*_0_* + vt

You should remember this formula from high school physics class.  It was pretty much the easiest one.  :)

&gt;Since it's for a little relativity game, it would be nice if the formula/algorithm were expressed in matrix/vector manipulation (eg cross product, dot product, matrix multiplication etc) and simple operators such (eg multiplication, addition subtraction, square root, etc.)

Just copy the formula above three times (one for each spatial axis) and put a subscript labelling the axis on every variable except t.  Then put them vertically in square brackets.  The only operation is simple vector addition -- you can add the components independently of eachother.  You can also combine them into a single magnitude of the vector with the Pythagorean theorem, which you should have learned in geometry class in jr. high school:

d = √(d*_x_*^(2) + d*_y_*^(2) + d*_z_*^(2))

Not sure what that has to do with relativity though.  Indeed it really doesn't have anything to do with relativity -- the relativistic formula is identical, it's just that the variables take on different values in different reference frames, and those variables are related to eachother in different frames by way of a [Lorentz transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation).

Chimpanzees and bonobos hunt for raw meat and it makes up a small portion of their diet. The rest of their diet consists of raw plant material, like fruits, leaves, roots etc.

There are a few major dietary milestones in the hominin lineage. 

1. The very early hominins, like [ardi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardi) are not associated with stone tools and they are not associated with fire. From these two observations we suppose that Ardi's diet was a lot like a modern chimps. Mostly plants and some scavenged meat (birds eggs, recently dead animals etc.).

2. Around 2.6 million years ago we see the first evidence of [stone tool use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool) this may not have changed the way [australopithecines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecine) hunted for meat, they were probably still mostly scavengers. Australopithecine species lived from about 2-4 million years ago. 

3. With [H. erectus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) we begin to see the first evidence of the control of fire. First we see changes in the morphology and dentition of H. erectus which some authors (listed below) link to a change in the diet. Cooked food allows an individual to have a higher caloric gain than raw food because the cooking process essentially pre-digests the food for us. These authors among others postulate that the cooked food diet is what finally enabled brains to grow larger. Brains are an energetically expensive organ and so is digestion. A constricting caloric intake meant that the brain could not grow too big even if their were environmental or social pressures for it to do so. By increasing their caloric intake by converting to a cooked diet this released the constraints on brain size and so it began to grow. So a cooked diet explains *how* brain size grew, but not *why*. Physical evidence for fire in the forth of hearths etc. dates back about 750,000 - 300,000 years. Thus ancestral Homo species were cooking food for a lot longer than humans have ever been around. However, we still don't know how pervasive this cooked food diet was, did all species living at this time know how to control fire? did all populations within the species? In any case some of them did - so their diet changed from raw to cooked, but not in composition. It was still mostly plants (fruits, nuts, tubers...) and some meat. They also had refined hunting techniques as tool cultures also became more complex. However, they were probably hunting small game (e.g. rabbits) rather than large game. I'll get into why this is probably the case if you like.

4. Humans arrive on the scene about 200,000 years ago. At this point Neanderthals are living in Europe and H. erectus has managed to spread herself all the way to the far corners of Asia (China, Java, India...). These early humans had the same tool cultures as these other species and they very likely also new how to control fire. Humans migrated out of Africa about 100,000 years ago and then things really began to get interesting. Tool cultures improved, humans kept expanding into new environments...we were innovators. We exploited and adapted. We became hunters. Our tools began to become so sophisticated that we could hunt from a distance (e.g. throwing a spear). In contrast it appears as if Neanderthal tool technology was stagnant at the time, and their spears could not be thrown - they were close ""combat"" spears. This is important because a lot of the neanderthal bones we have are broken, they have fractures etc. Humans on the other hand have less of these and this is attributed to the idea that we could hunt at a distance lowering the risk of injury. That being said big game still probably didn't make up a large portion of our diet. Modern hunter-gather societies have diets that consist mostly of plants, and some meat which is typically communally shared. This meat is more often than not small game. The success of small game hunting is on the order of every 1-3 days, whereas large game hunting is more on the order of once a month. You cannot reliably feed a population meat with large game using these early hunting techniques. So those depictions of early humans or neanderthals taking down a mammoth or a lion are very very unlikely. Try a fuzzy little rabbit, or collecting eggs from a nest.

5. 10-12,000 years ago humans begin domesticating plants and animals. Almost everything you find in the grocery today is a domesticated plant or animal, many of which date back to these first domestication events. Peppers, cauliflower, broccoli, corn, potato, carrot, wheat, barley, oats, rice, quinoa, lemons, grapefruit, oranges, apples, pears, olives, plums, millet, spelt, sunflowers, beans... all domesticated plants. Some of whose wild counterparts you would not even recognize - [teosinte](http://nrm101-summer2010.community.uaf.edu/files/2010/07/corn-and-teosinte_h1.jpg) or [wild potato](http://www.ars-grin.gov/nr6/bapotwso.jpg). So I often find those who argue that certain plants are not ""good"" for humans to eat because they have only recently been introduced to the diet (~10,000 years ago) often don't understand that the vast majority of our diet consists of plants and animals that never existed in their current form over 10,000 years ago. So humans around this time still had diets that consisted mostly of plants and some meat. However as populations began growing their own food and housing their own animals the types of things we ate changed. Moreover some populations began to acquire unique adaptations. For example, [lactase pesistence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence) is a gene mutation which occurred about 10,000 years ago in certain populations. It allows an individual to continue to digest milk *naturally* into adulthood by keeping the production of the enzyme lactase turned on. Lactase digests lactose, the sugar which many people are intolerant too. Lactase persistence is more common in cultures/populations where dairying is also common. 

6. But what does this mean for our modern diets? Well as omnivores we can eat pretty much whatever we want (baring plant products which have a lot of cellulose, a sugar we cannot digest) without too much trouble. As long as we get all the nutrients we need we are fine. Today, many people live in places were access to food is easy. Moreover you can access a wide variety of foods from around the world that would otherwise be inaccessible. **We have the unique opportunity and privilege of living in a society and time where we can tailor our individual diets to reflect our preferences, our intolerances, our allergies and our moral or ethical obligations.** For example, being a vegan or vegetarian is not impossible but rather very much attainable in today's society because we have access to many different food resources which can make up the difference in terms of nutrients and caloric intake.",null,1,cdiu8do,1r1n2n,askscience,top_week,4

Your mirror may reflect over 90% of light falling on it, but if it gets dirty the refelection will be dim. On average, Moon reflects just 1/10 of the light falling on it.

My own great-grandmother had fourteen children of which ten survived into adulthood - totally normal then.  
Consider that at that time, girls/women began puberty much later than now, and you can see that there was hardly time for her to get anything approaching a 'period' going.  
In fact, menstrual bleeding is a kind of emergency backup program that the body runs when no egg fertilization occurs, which explains why it causes so much discomfort for many women. As far as the body is concerned, an egg going unfertilized is not supposed to happen.

Cosmic rays are extremely high energy particles emitted from black holes and stars... they travel very very close to the speed of light. Some carry as much energy in one tiny little atom as a thrown tennis ball. Because they are so small, there is a very small chance they will actually impact any atoms in that sheet of aluminum unless it were very very thick... and even if they do impact, they usually create a shower of particles that will continue on if the material is not thick enough from the point of collision to absorb them.

The same is true for normal radiation. You need thick lead containers to fully absorb radioactivity.... and normal radiation is not nearly as powerful as a cosmic ray. On earth it would be easy to protect, but in space wrapping a spacecraft with lead plating is not really feasible.

Issues that you have to worry about when sending electronics to space:

* Radiation. Without the atmosphere as a shield there is more radiation in space. When a circuit gets hit by this radiation a variety of things can go wrong. A digital memory element may change state. This could lead to errors in CPU or FPGA controller chips. This is particularly a problem if the physical features are really small, so you have to get ""old"" parts that don't use current lithography scales. Analog parts may have problems too but I'm not sure. Parts that are qualified to not have errors when exposed to space levels of radiation are called ""radiation hard"" or ""rad hard"".
* Vibration. During launch the payload is subjected to vibrations. Why is this a problem? I think it's because the connections to the chip can break. Microchips are usually fabricated on a substrate of silicon, and the contact pads for wires going in and out are pretty small in cases where many wires are needed. You can't just solder to that. A common way to connect to the pads is with [wire bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_bonding), essentially very thin threads of metal that are sort of mashed onto the contact pads.
* Packaging. Consumer electronics are packaged in plastic. If you look inside your keyboard you'll see a variety of black square or rectangular things with metal pins sticking out. The black is plastic and the silicon die is inside. Plastic absorbs water from the air. When you send that into space it gets cold and I think the problem is that the water freezes, expands, and cracks the package. This would probably rip off some of the wire bonds. Now, having said that a guy in my lab put a consumer FPGA into a 4 Kelvin cryostat and it worked so I could be completely wrong about this.

As for the cost, there are two factors. The first is that making something with the right packaging and robustness against radiation means you aren't using your standard fabrication line. That means the price is higher just because of supply/demand. That aside, an enormous cost is *testing*. When NASA builds a satellite they require not only that the parts in principle deal with the things listed above, but also that they are actually tested by

Although very slow at first, the process eventually appears explosive. Because of this, (in my understanding) most people believe nothing is left behind. That is still explicit in Hawking's latest papers for instance. The total lifetime, estimated from the power emitted by Hawking's radiation (a formula which may not apply at late stages, but this stage should be short), varies like the cube of the mass of the black hole. For a black hole of one solar mass (10^30 kg), the lifetime would be 10^67 years. One should pause to contemplate such a number.

They travel at the ""Speed of Light"" through space. Photons can be picked up by other antennas and converted into electrical energy again, and then be converted into mechanical energy by a vibrating magnet, or a speaker.

This is a good question.   And the posters above are not wrong, as far as their answers go, but there is a sense in which the original question is not answered. 

As others have pointed out, contemporary physics has it that light exhibits a wave/particle duality.  

The sense in which light is a wave is, in modern physics, only a metaphorical sense. In the literal sense, a wave is a higher-order property of some physical substrate.   Waves in water are the more voluminous sections of water in a pattern of more (wave) and less (trough) voluminous sections of water.   Waves of sound are patterns of sections of air with greater and then lesser air pressure.   Light ""waves"", however, are not now believed to be real waves in any other physical substrate.  

For a very long time, it has been known that light exhibits behaviors that waves exhibit.  Light diffracts through thin slits, for example, into fan-shaped patterns of different colors of light.  Light exhibits interference behaviors, like water waves do.  This evidence led scientists to believe, for a very long time, that light, too, was a wave.  So, they reasoned, if light were a wave there must be some physical substrate of which it is a wave.   Aether was posited as the substance patterned variations in which were light waves. 

It turns out, however, that there is no other evidence for aether other than the fact that light seems wave-like.   There is no detectable drag on moving objects in the vacuum of space.  There are no relative-motion effects exhibited by light relative to the direction of earth's motion around the sun, as one would expect if earth were traveling with respect to aether.  And so on.  

So, the notion that there is aether was dropped, but we were still left with the awkward exhibition of wave-like behavior of light.   That's pretty much where we are now, as far as a comprehensible physical model of light is concerned.  The claims that light is a ""self-propogating"" wave, or that light is the kind of wave that is not a wave in anything else, are not really meant to *explain* the puzzling sounding claim that light is a wave of nothing.  That is, these claims are not meant as ways of thinking of waves in a literal sense as a *physical model* of what light really is.  

They are just ways of saying that light exhibits wave-like behaviors sometimes, and that a representation of light as a wave permits one to predict the behaviors of real light accurately.   Even the claim sometimes made that we can think of light waves as ""probability waves"" isn't meant to offer a description of a physical model of light.  It is a shorthand way of saying that there are higher probabilities of detecting photons at certain places in beams of light and that the pattern of these probabilities has a formal resemblance to physical waves. 

So, the question of *how* light can be a wave without being a wave of something isn't really answered by modern physics.  It's better to think of modern physics as telling us that that macro-level, real waves are not a physical model of real light, but that light nevertheless exhibits wave-like properties.   What light *really* is is something, modern physics tells us, that has no analogue in our direct, macro-level experience.  But we know it travels through a vacuum.  So, there you go.

~Sigh~

What D-Wave is selling has not been proven to be a quantum computer.

&gt; what general parts are there in a quantum computer?

I have [this saved from when /u/whittlemedownz explained it a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eg66q/a_15m_computer_that_uses_quantum_physics_effects/c9zzgfp) but I'll give me own spin.

A quantum computer has a bunch of individual information storage elements analogous to the bits in a classical computer CPU or memory. The physical incarnation of the bits in a quantum computer must be build so as to exhibit quantum mechanical behavior. As such they are called ""quantum bits"" or ""qubits"". There are many possible physical elements that can be used: atoms, electron spins, photon polarization, superconducting circuits, and more. The D-Wave machine uses superconducting circuits. Each one is a loop of superconducting wire. The current in the wire can flow clockwise or counterclockwise. Because it's quantum the qubit can also be in a state that is a superposition of both directions of current. The bits interact with one another via the magnetic dipole of each loop of current: each bit feels its neighbors' magnetic fields.

The computer also has wires that carry signals into the bits to control them in various ways. In the case of D-Wave this is by applying external magnetic flux to the loops. In fact this control circuitry is extremely difficult to get right and in my opinion is the most impressive thing about D-Wave's machine.

&gt; but what exactly am I looking at - some sort of scintillating CPU?

The thing in the center is the chip with the superconducting qubits. The rest of it is control wiring and a cryogenic mount. Look in the dead center. See the rainbow colors in the black square? That's the chip. The rainbow color happens because of diffraction off of the tiny lithographically defined features. Those sets of itty bitty parallel lines at the border of the black chip are [wire bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_bonding). The wire bonds connect wires on the chip to wires on the green circuit board mount. The circuit board has its own wires (the thin lines in the green board) which fan out and connect to those bundles of what look like braided copper wires (the brownish things with the white labels on them). The gold colored metal just a mounting apparatus. It's probably gold plated oxygen free copper, a commonly used material in cryogenic applications.

Now, what makes quantum computer 'quantum' is the fact, that it can work on those 'usual' 2 states (0 and 1) and everything BETWEEN them (let's say a current state can have 40% of '0' and 60% of '1' ), this is based on fundamental physical principle called [superposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition)

In a resonator, waves propagate around the structure continuously.  They don't decay unless they leak out of the resonator or are absorbed in the walls.

Well, unfortunately, 'mind control' implies some kind of agency to it that they don't really have. They don't 'know' what they are doing, and the mechanisms they do it aren't super-complicated machines they install in the host's brain or anything like that. They're just little tricks that ended up working in their favor. It's evolution in action -- they never 'figure out' the brain of their host, they brute force it with the evolutionary algorithm.

Take the commonly dragged out example of Dicrocoelium dendriticum. It's a trematode which 'mind controls' infected ants to go hang out on top of blades of grass in order to get eaten by cattle and such. At some point, they were just like many other non-behavior affecting parasites, but eventually some kind of small change to their genome resulted in some very slight chemical imbalance inside the ant hosts, that resulted in slightly more of the fluke's ancestors reproducing than they otherwise would.

This could have been any number of things. A chemical that makes the ant work harder, giving it more time to get eaten. Maybe it secreted something that slowed the ant down, just making it an easier target. It's impossible to say exactly.

After the first change, generations go by which more success, and slowly tiny changes that result in more reproductive success start to take hold. One generation moves a little closer to the nerve center, things get more efficient. Whenever a change is not beneficial to the host, it ends up failing to reproduce (or at least not outpacing reproduction). So the flukes that had their ants hang out on grass in the blazing sun didn't make grandchildren. Selection slowly weeds out the most beneficial effects.

Viewed as a whole as they exist today, they almost seem to be aware of what they are doing, like little pilots steering an ant ship. But that's just the culmination of thousands of tiny little brain hacks they've discovered along the way, automatic parts of their life cycle that interact with the host in an interesting way.

Could such a thing happen to humans? Absolutely, but again, it'd be on an evolutionary timescale. I mean, parasites exploit what is available to them. Parasites piggyback on your biology, altering it somewhat, and anytime things are altered there's always the potential for the brain being effected. There's conjecture that Toxoplasmosis infection makes people more prone to risk taking, for example. 

There's a constant arms race between complex, cooperating groups of cells like ourselves and the smaller complex cooperating groups of cells that want to get in there and defect, taking all the free resources they can get their hands on.

Their theory is built around issues of mobility, given that mobility is crucial for survival and reproduction in all species, predator and prey alike.

However if the brain and body are both compromised by an injury, this compensatory ability is diminished. The authors posit that because a non-lethal injury that damages the head and body is likely to be unilateral, having contralateral control by the brain can preserve these compensatory effects. 

The paper does not discuss the issues surrounding sensory processing that you raise in your question though, but the explanation holds to a certain effect here too. A truly severe injury to the right side of the head might knock out the right eye completely AND the right occipital lobe leaving the left eye ineffective; but such a serious injury would not fall under evolutionary pressures because animals who sustained such a serious injury wouldn't live regardless of whether sensory control was ipsilateral or contralateral.

3. Other homo species. We know that about 1-5% of human DNA is [Neanderthal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal#Coexistence_with_H._sapiens_sapiens) in origin. We know that early humans and neanderthals could interbreed and produce viable offspring. Since it is very likely that modern humans could reproduce with ancient humans living 200,000 years ago than it stands to reason that modern humans and neanderthals could interbreed and produce viable offspring. A few important caveats are worth mentioning:

* 1-5% DNA can be explained by a small number of interbreeding events. This means that interbreeding events were probably uncommon.

* Human and Neanderthal populations did not overlap completely, therefore not all humans encountered neanderthals or vice versa. This means any interbreeding that occurred was not widespread.

* Neanderthals evolved about ~600,000 years ago in Europe, conversely humans evolved about ~200,000 years ago in Africa. Humans migrated out of Africa and into Asia about 100,000 years ago. Humans and neanderthals only encountered each other in Europe from about 50,000-25,000 years ago. Thus neanderthals and humans had been evolving independently for thousands of years. Behaviourally Neanderthals and Humans were very different, even more so around the time when they first began to encounter one another. Humans were better communicators, better innovators, engaged in long distance trade, and were expanding into new environments as well as exploiting them in novel ways. In contrast Neanderthals were somewhat limited: they had a relatively stagnant tool culture and and their cultural expressions were not as complex as humans. Humans at the time were beginning to express themselves symbolically, whereas neanderthals seemed only to be able to make jewellery, possibly some cave art and possibly engaged in symbolic burials.

* We know nothing about the context in which the exchange of DNA took place...we don't know if it was consensual or not. This has important implications for how the two populations viewed each other. Were they hostile? friendly? did they compete over resources (archeological evidence suggests yes, they did) or did they cooperate with each other? These questions help us better understand the complexity of their social worlds and how we might delineate these two populations (separate species, subspecies or the same species?)

* We know that flow of DNA was in one direction. ""While modern humans share some nuclear DNA with the extinct Neanderthals, the two species do not share any mitochondrial DNA, which in primates is always maternally transmitted. This observation has prompted the hypothesis that whereas female humans interbreeding with male Neanderthals were able to generate fertile offspring, the progeny of female Neanderthals who mated with male humans were either rare, absent or sterile"". This raises questions about hybrid vigour, and questions the assumption that we were the same species. At the very least it appears as if we were speciating, given the level of behavioural separation which had already taken place.

What does this mean for other hominin species like *H. erectus*? We can't know with 100% certainty if modern humans or even ancient humans could mate with these other extinct species. However, given the low levels of breeding with Neanderthals, the extensive evidence which suggests we were very different behaviourally and the lack of support for strong hybrid vigour I would come to the conclusion that it is unlikely that humans, ancient or modern, could produce viable offspring with any other hominin species other than neanderthals.

TwizzlyHashtag,"There is also the issue of the theorized hormonal arms race between the fetus and the mother/host, wherein the fetus produces hormones that attempt to take over the host's resources, and the mother produces hormones to counter that.

However, a human woman from, say, 50,000 years ago would theoretically be too far behind in the evolution of said hormone production, leaving her to be overwhelmed and killed by a modern fetus, because the modern fetus will have been evolved to produce said hormones more aggressively.  Maybe.

Farnswirth,"I asked something along the lines of the second part of this question a while ago.  Here's what /u/schu06 (a virologist) responded with:

&gt;Life is thought to have begun as RNA in the primordial soup - chemicals coming together and forming RNA (just a hypothesis as have yet to properly prove it). 

&gt;It has been shown that there are RNA molecules that can catalyse reactions such as self-splicing and self-cleaving (take [Hammerhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_ribozyme) as an example). 

&gt;If an RNA can be be enzymatic it's not beyond the realms of possibility that it can develop function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and self-replicate. This self-replicating entity would just produce more and more of itself allowing evolution to kick in. Mutation would occur giving other ""species"" of the same RNA. Interestingly, it has also been shown that the same sequence of RNA can fold in two different ways to carry out two different functions (so will be able to do more than just replicate)...

&gt;It would get to a point where becoming compartmentalised from the outside world is advantageous to an individual RNA strand, so other molecules don't steal your enzymatic actions. This compartmentalisation could also be controlled if the RNA molecule has other enzymatic activities (as mentioned in the previous paragraph). Compartmentalisation gave the first ""cell"". Since this cell can replicate itself independently of anything else, it isn't a virus by any modern definition. So it then becomes a matter of semantics, would you call this self-replicating cell a bacteria? It isn't a virus because of self-replication

Basically, the answer to the second part, from what I've gathered is a matter of definitions and semantics.  As soon as something ""evolves"" from an RNA-based structure, it is no longer considered a virus, because by definition a virus cannot replicate without first infecting an existing cell.

This raises the evolutionary question of where did this transcription factor, that shares such homology with a viral protein, originate? 

It is possible that the gene was similar horizontally transferred. But another interpretation may hint at an ancient interaction between a phage particle and a single cell eukaryote, which may fit in your definition of something 'living evolving from a virus'.

It's really just about your frame of reference. In almost all practical purposes, light IS the event. As far as we understand physics, you can't outrun the light at all. No matter how fast you run away from light, light will still (from your point of view) be moving at the speed of light.

As an object approaches the speed of light, time is just measured differently for the object and a stationary person observing it.

Heritability isn't necessarily intuitive though. For example, the heritability of IQ is dependent on SES (http://pss.sagepub.com/content/14/6/623.short).

latent_variableZ,"Palmer, Schloss, and Sammartino (2013) stated as introduction to their study on human preferences in harmony: “although empirical research on aesthetics has had some success in explaining the average preferences of groups of observers, relatively little is known about individual differences in preference.” This about as true of a statement as one could make in regards to aesthetics. Neurobiologically, we can observe there is activity in “such and such area” of the brain when “such and such stimuli” are perceived. However, the variation in the subjective experience and idiosyncratic responses related to aesthetics do not lend them self to a “this is fact” statement of why we have different tastes. The best I can do with my background (I am a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology with an emphasis in forensic and neuropsychological testing) is tell you socialization and a person’s cumulative learning history appear to have the largest effect size. The interaction between nature (biology) and nurture (the environment) is complex and most likely leads to the variations we observe in aesthetic taste, learning literally changes the brain.  However, learning appears to be a very powerful factor in determining aesthetics.  Palmer and Griscom (2013) provide a good review of the topic and give examples of studies that demonstrate aesthetic differences according to age, gender, and cultural; the take away while some preferences may be innate (“infants have a bias toward looking at dark-yellow and light-red and a bias against looking at light-blue and dark-green, nearly the opposite of [western] adults”) learning appears to be a powerful factor in determining preferences.  Learning is also implicated in the differences observed between gender preferences (girs tend to like pink/boy tend to like blue), theories tend to overwhelmingly postulate this happens due to socialization.  Historically, records show it was not until the mid-19th century the blue pink dichotomy emerged and became so prevalent.

The electromagnetic field obeys the *principle of superposition*, which means that if you have the equivalent of two fields (either both electric or  both magnetic) in the same place, the resultant field is the (vectorial) sum of the two.  

For example, if you have two magnets, when you bring them close to each other you can imagine the two fields adding to each other in the space around them.  Depending on how you orient the magnets, you could make a stronger or weaker field in the common region.

Light is wave.  It propagates because as the electric field changes, it generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field, and so on and so on.  This is the content of [Maxwell's equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations) #3 and #4.  If you aren't put off by an appeal to mathematics, really squint at those equations and you'll conclude that if the fields obey superposition (E_total = E_1 + E_2), then the formulas do too.  That's not an *explanation*, of course.  Maxwell's equations were deduced to agree with experiment.  There exist different physical media that *don't* obey the superposition principle, rubber, for example, if the amplitude is very large.

It would be a very weird universe if EM fields did *not* obey superposition.  I could be watching a movie, and if someone shined a flashlight across my view of the screen, I would see distortion.

At the risk of adding confusion, there is a deep connection between superposition of EM fields, the bosonic nature of the photon, and causality.  I wish I could explain it, but it's a result from quantum field theory, and I don't know a simpler explanation.

So, fundamentally, your question is really, ""why does one photon not bounce off another photon"". The reason is because they are bosons and they carry no electric charge.

All quantum particles can be classified as fermions or bosons. Fermions (such as electrons), obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle which states that no two fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state at the same location at the same time. So when two fermions approach each other, they must eventually ""bounce"" off each other to avoid ending up in the same quantum state. But bosons, such as photons, do not obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle and *can* be in the same quantum state at the same time. This leads to interesting effects such as lasers, superconductivity, and Bose-Einstein condensates. It also means that two photons cannot directly effect each other. Instead, they just pass through each other. What determines whether a particle is a boson or a fermion is how it spins. Integer-spin particles are bosons.

Also worth noting is that photons themselves carry no electric charge, so they are not effected by each other. Even if a particle is a boson, it can still interact with others of its kind if it carries charge.

goatherder100,"Basically its like microwaves are pingpong balls (lower energy) and light would be basket balls (high energy). If I hit you with one ping pong ball, nothing. If I hit you with a basketball, you notice it. If I pelt you with 10million ping pong balls you will really notice it. Kinda the same thing. It is not the amount of energy EACH photon has to deposit, it is how MANY photons there are to deposit energy. A microwave creates a high density flux of a large number of lower energy photons that will each deposit all their energy into the substance causing the average kinetic energy of the substance to increase. That is what heats it up. ",null,0,cdii8a0,1r091o,askscience,top_week,5
myarlak,when molecules absorb microwaves it causes them to spin rapidly releasing heat due to the friction of the molecules rubbing against each other.  visible light cause electronic transitions which are not translated into motion thus do not cause friction.,null,2,cdij6qb,1r091o,askscience,top_week,3
king_of_the_universe,"&gt; Why can we use microwaves to heat our food, when microwaves have less energy than visible light?

But the light of your Zippo isn't as hot as the summer sun, while both are visible light. Yes, a microwave photon has less energy than a visible light photon. No, microwave light doesn't hence have less energy than visible light. Duration of exposure and amount of photons are important, too.",null,0,cdioxr2,1r091o,askscience,top_week,1
Weed_O_Whirler,"No. Instantaneous acceleration would require infinite force, and infinite force would cause all sorts of bad things to happen. 

So, what is actually happening? Well, you (and really, everyone) is a little squishy, so when you first get hit by the bus you slowly start to move, but moreso you start to deform- getting squished. Thus, you will ""slowly"" (slow being relative here, as it will still happen in a fraction of a second) move up to the speed of the bus. 

In fact, this speed is what matters. That is why if you were surrounded by a squishy ball, getting hit by a bus would not be as problematic, since that time it took you to speed up to the speed of the bus would be longer (and thus, you acceleration smaller)",null,0,cdiablh,1r086u,askscience,top_week,7
matts2,"You are a compressible being. So the force travels through you at different rates. Think of this: you are bruised on the side you are hit, not all through your body. What happens is that your are hit and there is force transference. Some of that force it too much for the local bonds and they break (broken blood vessels, broken bones, etc.) so moves though you and accelerates your body.",null,0,cdibs6x,1r086u,askscience,top_week,3
nonchalantkiwi,"No, not instantaneously. Someone getting hit by a bus is a great example of how Impulse works. Impulse is the force exerted on a particle (in this case, the bus exerting a force on a person) for a certain amount of time. Now with this collision, the time will be very small, but not instantaneous because if it were instantaneous then the impulse would be infinite, which is impossible.

Platypuskeeper,"Salt water is denser. As for how that affects buoyancy, that should be easy to figure out through [Archimedes' Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle).

Gargatua13013,"An subset of this problem is central to the study of the genesis of ore deposits associated to black smokers, namely what happens to the buoyancy of waters of grossly different salinities and temperatures when they interact. There is a seminal paper on this by Takeo Sato, (1972), ""*Behaviours of ore-forming solutions in seawater*"", Mining geology, **22**, 31-42.

Pressure is also an important variable. Turns out in the right circumstances, the brine plume will be denser than seawater and collapse to the seafloor where it may form a brine pool, which was observed in nature years after Sato's paper.",null,0,cdifh1g,1r084w,askscience,top_week,1
