Dreamwaltzer,"Sorta reminds me of similar joke.

&gt;Four Catholic men and a Catholic woman were having coffee.

&gt;The first Catholic man tells his friends, ""My son is a priest, when he walks into a room everyone calls him 'Father'.""

&gt;The second Catholic man chirps, ""My son is a Bishop. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Grace'.""

&gt;The third Catholic gent says, ""My son is a Cardinal. When he enters a room everyone says 'Your Eminence'.""

&gt;The fourth Catholic man then says, ""My son is the Pope. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Holiness'.""

&gt;Since the lone Catholic woman was sipping her coffee in silence, the four men give her a subtle, ""Well....?""

&gt;She proudly replies, ""I have a daughter, Slim &amp; Tall, 38D breast, 24"" waist and 34"" hips. When she walks into a room, people say, ""Oh My God.""",null,33,c69bb7x,zzqsd,jokes,top_all,159

Swiftfooted,"&gt;An out-of-work actor gets a call from his agent one day. 

&gt;""I’ve got you a job,"" says his agent. 

&gt;""That’s great,"" says the actor, what is it?"" 

&gt;""Well,"" says his agent, ""it’s a one-liner"" 

&gt;""That’s okay,"" replies the actor, ""I’ve been out of work for so long I’ll take anything. What’s the line?"" 

&gt;""Hark, I hear the cannons roar"" says the agent. 

&gt;""I love it"" says the actor ""When’s the audition?"" 

&gt;""Wednesday"" says the agent. 

&gt;Wednesday comes and the actor arrives at the audition. He marches on stage and shouts: ""Hark, I hear the cannons roar"". 

&gt;""Brilliant,"" says the director, ""you’ve got the job. Be here 9 o’clock Saturday evening."" 

&gt;The actor is so happy he got the job that he goes on a major bender. He wakes up at 8:30 Saturday evening and runs to the theatre continually repeating his line; ""Hark, I hear the cannons roar, hark, I hear the cannons roar, hark, I hear the cannons roar."" 

&gt;He arrives at the stage entrance, out of breath and is stopped by the guard. ""Who the hell are you?"" asks the guard. 

&gt;""I’m ""hark, I hear the cannons roar."" 

&gt;""If you’re ""hark I hear the cannons roar"", you’re late. Get up to makeup right now!"" 

&gt;So he runs up to makeup. ""Who the hell are you"" asks the makeup girl. 

&gt;""I’m ""hark I hear the cannons roar."""" 

&gt;""If you’re hark I hear the cannons roar"", you’re late. Sit down here."" And she applies the makeup. ""Now quick, get down to the stage, you’re about to go on."" 

&gt;He dashes down to the stage. ""Who the hell are you?"" asks the stage manager. 

&gt;""I’m ""hark, I hear the cannons roar."""" 

&gt;""You’re ""hark, I hear the cannons roar?"" Get out there, the curtain’s about to go up."" 

&gt;He tears onto the stage. The curtains rise, the house is full. Suddenly there is an almighty bang behind him, and the actor shouts ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?""

Only needs to be one priest on vacation.  Since the joke does not hinge on the two men ever talking to each other the extra priest doesn't add anything.

The second trip to the store doesn't make sense.  It was the same woman both days so changing outfits wouldn't keep her from recognizing him as the same guy.

Also, drop the cheesy 'topless' detail.  It makes the joke juvenile. 

I think the Joke would be better with the single priest appreciating how amazing the woman looked as she was walking by, his inner struggle between feeling guilty for ogling but not being able to turn away.

That way when she says ""Hi Father"" he can be ashamed and surprised and try to cover with the ""how did you know I was a priest?"".

I wonder if the joke would be funnier with the nun being the one watching some hot dude on the beach, playing volleyball, giving him flirty looks, etc,  whatever.  The punchline would be similar but could also toss in a ""I guess confession this week won't be a surprise""...

Two beggars are sitting on a sidewalk in Rome.  One is wearing a large cross, and has a picture of the Virgin Mary.  The other is wearing a kippah and tzitzit, and has a beard and side curls.  The first is getting tons of money, but the second is hardly getting any.  A priest comes to the second beggar, and says ""you know, you'd probably get more money if you weren't so openly Jewish.  People see the two of you, and choose to support their religion by giving to the Christian beggar.""  The first beggar turns to the second and says ""Hey, look who's trying to teach the Goldstein brothers marketing""

Here's another:

A man walks into a coffee shop in 1930's Berlin and sees his Rabbi reading Der Sturmer.  He's shocked, and says ""Rabbi, why on earth are you reading Nazi propaganda?""  He explains ""you see, when I read the Jewish press, we're having our rights taken away, our stores boycotted and broken into, and our kids kicked out of school.  But in der sturmer, we're in control of everything!  It's great!""

edit: I nearly forgot another classic:

An old Jewish man dying of a painful disease asks for a priest for a deathbed conversion.  His wife hears of this, and berates him: ""you've been an observant Jew your entire life, keeping Kosher, celebrating all the holidays, why would you convert now right before you die?""

so here it goes


An Islamic couple were preparing for a religious wedding, so they met with their Imam for counseling. The Imam asked if they have any last questions before they leave. The man asked,

Man: We realize it's tradition in Islam for men to dance with men, and women to dance with women. But, at our wedding reception, we'd like your permission to dance together.

Imam: Absolutely not. It's immoral. Men and women always dance separately.

Man: So after the ceremony I can't even dance with my own wife?

Imam: No, It's forbidden in Islam.

Man: Well, okay, but what about sex? Can we finally have sex?

Imam: Of course! Allah O Akbar! Sex is OK within the marriage, to have children!

Man: What about different positions?

Imam: Allah O Akbar! No problem.

Man: Woman on top is OK?

Imam: Sure, Allah O Akbar. Go for it!

Man: Doggy style?

Imam: Sure! La Ellaha Ella Allah! Allah O Akbar!

Man: On the kitchen table?

Imam: Yes, yes! Allah O Akbar!

Man: Can we do it with all my four wives together on rubber sheets with a bottle of hot oil, a couple of vibrators, leather straps, whips, gags, butt plugs, a bucket of honey and a porno S&amp;M video?

Imam: You may indeed. Allah O Akbar!

Man: Can we do it standing up?

Imam: No.

Man: Why not?

Imam: Because that could lead to dancing.

ApoChaos,"Jewish people only have the modern racial stereotype of being attracted to money and accountancy because centuries ago they were unable to own land and had to make money through lending and the likes. There were Christian mores against setting interest rates at the time (thus making the act of lending money something you would only do for a friend rather than for any financial benefit). Wealthy Christians had all sorts of avenues for money-making while they pushed Jews into a corner. But how do you break this kind of stereotype?

, race jokes, gender jokes etc that actually are completely wrong or extremely offensive in some manners, I suggest people to just grow up then and stop hurting others. Jokes like blondes are dumb or about black people or whatever falls in the same category. Something that you know will widely hurt people or widely will be offensive I suggest you don't make those. So once again jokes needs to stay fun and healthy for everyone even if its about someone religion however if a joke is offensive and you know it will be extremely offensive than those types of jokes shouldn't be said. If you accidentally made a offensive joke people should calmly tell you why it was offensive and the person who did made the joke then should realize. However two wrong doesn't make a right.

Islam = a perfectly fine religion, with lots of great things going for it.

Those who encourage, promise, or actually commit acts of violence against anyone saying anything potentially offensive to Islam's prophet can go fuck themselves.",null,12,c5wtm4y,ykzzw,jokes,top_all,5
Zubair_m1,"I didn't sent you death threats and I'm a Muslim. You need to understand that in Islam we are to respect everyone's religion and dogma. It states in the Qur'an translation ""if you do not want people to talk Bad about your religion do not talk bad about theirs"". However sending death threats to someone is totally in fact it provides a wrong message about your own religion. Matter of fact the ppl who you sent you death threats might not even know about their religion. there are over 400000 thousand hadith none of them says to send death threats to someone. The best thing would to do was send you explaining why you found that joke offensive in a calm manner. There are many hadiths that relates to this issue in none of those hadiths was hate used against someone who disrespected Islam or our prophets. Islam has a very big deal about respecting your own religion and the famous of people of it as well other people and their beliefs. People sending you death threats go against that. But I do believe you were wrong as well and everyone else who makes fun of someone else personal religion and dogma. Doesn't matter if its Islam or any other religion. Sometime its best not to make fun of other peoples religion thus knowing its a very sensitive topic. You can joke around in Islam but there are few jokes prohibited. Jokes about god dogma prophets and the Islams ancestors. Same about other religions. We are not allowed to joke about other ppls religions as well. Anyhow I hope people those who sent you wrong messages and people those who make religion jokes get some sense in their head. ",null,8,c5wjvbl,ykzzw,jokes,top_all,4

I had something similar actually happen to me.  

I was in the hospital for an appendectomy (which was bad enough), after the surgery, I calmly awoke in the post-op area.  Since I was out for who knows how long, my eyes were all watery. Maybe that was me crying.  I don't know.

The nurse comes to my side and catches me up to speed. Since my eyes are still watery, I ask her to ""wipe my eyes"" which she must have taken as ""wipe my ass"", and so she kept saying she couldn't do that now, and that once we got to my room we could.  I was dumbfounded. I insisted that she or someone else wipe my eyes right away. Eventually, another couple of nurses come in, and they start to turn me over.

So, this guy Jordan was like 2nd or 3rd generation Japanese-American and I ~~am~~ was a dorky white guy. We were both reasonably smart, we were smartasses, and neither of us liked working *too* hard - needless to say, we got along alright (I know, I know, at this point you're probably saying to yourself ""Wow, he doesn't fit the Reddit demographic at all!"" Weird, right?). 

Well, one day we were sitting in our chemistry class making jokes about stupid shit while other people were giving presentations on random chemistry/sciencey stuff. After a while this guy gets up to the front and starts talking about thermal expansion. At one point he pointed out that when you see people jumping out of the way of explosions in movies or on tv that that's actually impossible as the air heats up instantaneously (almost. whatever.). 

At this point Jordan looks at me and says in this jokingly smug tone, ""I bet I could dodge that with my 1337 Asian ninja skills.""

Without bothering to think about it, I instantly respond ""Dude, your people can't dodge explosions. My people proved that... *Twice*.""

His reaction was somewhere half between a slack-jawed stare of disbelief and choking back laughter. As soon as I processed what I had just said I think my reaction was about the same.

2 - Given the previously described color-vision-deficiency, I'm quite certain I'd never be able to distinguish 50 different shades of a single color. In large enough increments to be determinable, you'd get from white to black too fast.

Little Jimmy is eight years old, and, poor lil fucker that he is, he's been blind since birth. One day, Little Jimmy goes up to his Mummy in the kitchen and says; ""Mummy, when will I be able to see?"" To which his Mother replies; ""Well Little Jimmy, today is a very special day. We're going to the chemist this afternoon to buy you some special eye cream. In the morning, My Son, you will see.""

Well, understandably excited Little Jimmy hurries to get himself ready. Little Jimmy and his Mum go to the chemist, buy the special eye cream, go home, Little Jimmy has his dinner and bath and gets ready for bed. When in bed his Mum puts the cream on his eyes, wraps a bandage around his head, tucks him in and says. ""Okay Jimmy, you go to sleep now, and in the morning you will be able to see.""

Little Jimmy tries his best, but he just cannot sleep that night. Eventually, around six am, he stumbles out of bed, feels his way along the wall to his door, down the hall and into his Mum's room. He goes to her, shaking her lightly to wake her, while saying; ""Mummy, wake up! It's time! Time for me to see!""

His Mum rouses herself from sleep, gently unwraps the bandage, wipes the cream from his eyes and says; ""Okay Jimmy, open your eyes."" Little Jimmy opens his eyes and says; ""Mum! Mum! I'm still blind!""

FormattingLessons,"My friend, that's an excellent joke. It's a bit of a wall of text, though. *(EDIT: Okay, ""wall"" may be a bit of a strong word. Either way, I know it didn't come out how you typed it.)* I, for one, had a bit of difficulty reading it as it is.

I can see that you tried to insert a new line every time you had a line of speech, but unfortunately Reddit removes whitespace. You can get it to appear as multiple paragraphs, but you have to do it in a very specific way. Okay, actually, there are two ways:

First of all, you can simply press enter a second time. This will add a little extra vertical space, as you can see I've already done in this comment twice.

Second, if you add two spaces to the end of a line before pressing Enter, the text will continue on the next line, but it will continue the same paragraph. For example:

This sentence  
has two spaces  
after each line.

This sentence

has empty space

between each line.

Here is your joke again, with the added spaces so it looks exactly like the way you typed it:

---
Two statues, a man and a woman, are sitting in a park where they have been for years.  One day, an angel comes down from the heavens and gives life to these two statues.  
Angel: ""Ok you two, because of the limits of my power I can only grant you 20 minutes of life.  What you do is up to you, so go on and be free for 20 minutes.""  
Man Statue: ""Come on, I know exactly what we should do.""  
He grabs the female's hand and they run off into the bushes giggling.  
A lot of rustling of the bush ensues, and laughter.  The two emerge, sweaty, hair messy, and breathing heavily.  
Man: ""We are done Mr. Angel, we can return to the way we were.""  
Angel: ""Really, that's it.  What about the last 10 minutes of your life.""  
Woman: ""Ok, great.""  
She turns to the man and says, ""Come on let's go back for another round.""  
Man: ""Oh yeah.  Let's go, but this time, You hold down the pigeon and I'll shit on his head!""",null,71,c5fw7wi,wrps6,jokes,top_all,40

There was no answer. He asks again and there was still no response. Stalin is now pissed - he doesn't like being ignored. He orders the first row to be executed. He asks again, and no one answers... ""execute the second row."" Then a soldier in the third row raises his hand, shaking in fear, and says, ""It... It was me...

* The type of running shoe isn't important. The fact that it goes Nike, Reebok, pink is confusing and makes me think the joke is going to be about shoes even though I know the joke.

* The second chick should be hotter than the first. I'm trying to think of how anything could be hotter than a 19 year old who runs all the time and coming up blank. At least make her the second chick.

* The fact that the first chick introduces herself verbally, but then has a sign around her neck doesn't make sense. They should all introduce themselves and just say the words on the sign. Imagining 19 year old runner girl actually saying ""If you can catch me, you can have me,"" is much more titillating and allows the listener to identify more with the man in the joke.

pjhollow,"Needs to be way longer and more pointless. Here's Cracked's take on it in their most annoying jokes of all time. 

Annoyer: So, as everyone knows, two different species (flavors) of cheerios cannot mate, right? That is, if one is honey-nut and another is blueberry, they cannot mate. Anyway, there is this one normal cheerio that is in love with a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, he cannot mate with her. He can't even communicate with her because they are of different species. So, he invents a machine that changes all of his CNA (Cheerio DNA) into whichever type of cheerio that he wants. However, this machine performs a process that is extraordinarily painful, because that sort of thing would hurt. Anyway. He does it, and the normal flavored cheerio becomes a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, this girl cheerio hates him so much that she invents an identical machine and does the process on herself in order to become a cinnamon-apple cheerio, just so she can avoid this creeper. So, she does it. The boy cheerio is starting to get upset at this because he really wants her. So he tells himself that he will go through the pain for her, and becomes a cinnamon-apple cheerio. She then changes to a honey-nut cheerio! He decides that this is the last time that he will change cheerio type. He does it, and she changes one more time, into a normal cheerio - the kind he originally was. So he says out loud, ""Okay, this is really the last time. If she changes again, I will just stay back with my family."" So he becomes a normal cheerio again, and she doesn't change fast enough for him to put his moves on her. So, they start dating, and he finally asks her to the Formal Bowl (ahaha, get it, bowl instead of ball). Anyway, they get there and dance intensely for a few hours. Finally, they get tired and she sends the boy cheerio to the milk bowl (you know, since it's a cereal dance, they have that and punch). He gets there and stands in line for ten minutes. Finally fed up at the really long line, he looks over at the bowl of punch and realizes there is no punch line.

Annoyee: I'll give you a punch line.

*Annoyee punches Annoyer in the face, causing him to bleed. It will be months before he finds out that the cut on his face from the Annoyee's punch will leave a scar, forever giving him a ""punch line.""*",null,5,c55m7qc,vlg6r,jokes,top_all,47

mike413,"One day Jesus was walking down the street and comes upon a big crowd gathered around a woman.   He quickly realizes they are about to stone her and steps in front of her.

Jesus shouts at the crowd to stop, and says aloud ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone!""

Well, the crowd settles down a bit and people grumble and start to disperse until a small pebble flies out of the crowd and hits the woman.  Jesus is pushed aside by the crowd and the stones start flying.

Finally Jesus finds the pebble thrower and says ""C'mon Mom, I was just trying to make a point here...""

Zombie_Lover,"Robert , 85, married Jenny, a lovely 25 year old . . .Since her new husband is so old, Jenny decides that after their wedding she and Robert should have separate bedrooms, because she is concerned that her new but aged husband may over-exert himself if they spend the entire night together.

After the wedding festivities Jenny prepares herself for bed and the expected knock on the door. Sure enough the knock comes, the door opens and there is Robert, her 85 year old groom, ready for action.

 *He steps inside and disrobes. She is shocked to see the size of his equipment and as she stands in shock, he produces a huge condom, which barely fits. As he is approaching, she sees him put ear plugs in as well as a nose plug used for swimming. She looks at him and asks him why the ear plugs. He tells her that he loves sex, but hates to hear a woman cry. She asks about the nose plugs, and he admits that he hates the smell of burning rubber.*",null,42,c4bo6j6,s732v,jokes,top_all,292

Yaifrog,"A frog walks into a bank and up to the first teller he sees, who greets him with a strong Irish accent. ""Good day, sir, me name's Paddy, what can I do fer you?""

""The name's Michael, Michael Jagger Jr, and I'm here to apply for a loan,"" replied the frog through his enormous lips.

""Rightio, sir, I'll just need some indentification,"" said Paddy.

At this, the frog pulled out a small porcelain doll in his likeness. ""Will that do?""

This caused a bit of a hubbub, as Paddy didn't feel he could accept it, and tried repeatedly to tell the increasingly angry frog. Eventually, Paddy's supervisor's voice boomed down the hall. ""MACK! What's going on over there?""

""Mr. Jagger here wants to apply for a loan with only this as identification.""

Series_of_Accidents,"Reminds me of this one:

Once in a land far, far away there lived a group of people called Trids. The Trids were happy except for the huge ogre that lived on the mountain. The ogre would periodically terrorize the Trids.

The Trids tired of the ogre and sought to reason with him. They thought one of their religious leaders would be a good intermediary. So a group of Trids and their minister went up the mountain and before they could even say one word the ogre kicked them down the mountain. Not being dismayed the Trids thought that maybe the ogre was Catholic, so they sent another delegation, this time led by the local priest. But alas, as they approached the ogre he once again kicked them all down the mountain.

The Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the ogre was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they wrote to the people of another land and asked them to send a Rabbi to help them with the ogre. The Rabbi arrived and led a delegation of Trids up the mountain. The ogre saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain. The Rabbi, having been told of the previous expeditions, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the ogre. The ogre laughed and replied:

""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""

""Once while wondering the track I found a twenty dollar bill and came back here with cheap wine and drank with my pals""

The next man said 
""Last week when I was crossing the tracks I found a hundred dollar bill and came back here a with lots of liquor and got drunk with my friends"" 

The news reporter was shocked at how much money he found and asked the last guy what the best thing he has found, the man replied 

""Last weekend I found a beautiful women tied to the tracks so I untied her and had the best sex ever all day and night, we did all kinds of things""

&gt; Santa was very cross. It was Christmas Eve and NOTHING was going right.

&gt; Mrs. Claus had burned all the cookies. The elves were complaining about not getting paid for the overtime they had worked making toys, and were threatening to go on strike. The reindeer had been drinking eggnog all afternoon. To make matters worse, a few of the other elves had taken the sleigh out for a spin earlier in the day and had crashed it into a tree.

&gt; Santa was furious. ""I can't believe it! I've got to deliver millions of presents all over the world in just a few hours, and all of my reindeer are drunk, the elves are walking out, and I don't even have a Christmas tree! I sent that stupid little angel out HOURS ago to find a tree and he isn't even back yet! What am I going to do?""

&gt; Just then, the little angel opened the front door and stepped in from the snowy night, dragging a Christmas tree. The angel said, ""Yo, fat man! Where do you want me to stick the tree this year?""

A guy walks into a bar with a forlorn look on his face.

A regular sees him and says ""Hey guy, you doing alright?""

""I'm doing terrible"" the guys says ""I'm having money troubles and the only option I got left is to sell my beloved dog. So, I'm just traveling around town asking if anyone wants to buy him off me. He's in the car now.""

""I'm sorry to hear that"" says the regular, ""what are you asking for him?""

""500 dollars"" the man says.

""Whoa that's a lot of money for a dog"" the regular says

""Well, it's like that dog is a part of my family. He's the gentlest, sweetest dog you've ever seen. He never barks, unless there is an intruder, in which case he turns into the meanest SOB that ever lived. When he needs to go, he'll just nudge your leg once or twice and then sit by the door and wait till you're ready to let him out. My kids and wife love him, and are going to hate me for selling him, but I don't have any other options.""

The regular says ""well jeez, guy. If the dog is that good, I'll take him. I'd be happy to help you out""

A year later the man walks into the bar again.

This time the regular is there again, but he screams ""YOU! YOU SOLD ME THAT GOOD FOR NOTHIN' SON OF A BITCHIN' DOG. That dog does nothing but shit all over the house. He barks constantly, and tries to bite my wife and kids every chance he gets. I swear to god the day I bought that dog was the last good day I've had""

A man walks into a bar with a small dog under his arm and sits down at the counter, placing the dog on the stool next to him. 

The bartender says, ""Sorry, pal. No dogs allowed.""


The man says, ""But this is a special dog -- he talks!""


""Yeah, right,"" says the bartender. ""Now get out of here before I throw you out.""


""No, wait,"" says the man. ""I'll prove it."" He turns to the dog and asks, ""What do you normally find on top of a house?""


""Roof!"" says the dog, wagging his tail.


""Listen, pal..."" says the bartender.
""Wait,"" says the man, ""I'll ask another question."" He turns to the dog again and asks, ""What's the opposite of soft?""


""Ruff!"" exclaims the dog.


""Quit wasting my time and get out of here,"" says the bartender.


""One more chance,"" pleads the man. Turning to the dog again, he asks, ""Who was the greatest baseball player that ever lived?""


""Ruth!"" barked the dog.


""Okay, that's it!"" says the bartender, and physically throws both man and dog out the door and onto the street.


Turning to the man, the dogs shrugs and says, ""Maybe I should have said Joe Dimaggio?""

HouseMormont,"A guy walks into a bar with a forlorn look on his face. A regular sees him and says:

""Hey guy, you doing alright?""

""I'm doing terrible"" the guys says, ""I'm having money troubles and the only option I got left is to sell my beloved dog. So, I'm just traveling around town asking if anyone wants to buy him off me. He's in the car now.""

""I'm sorry to hear that"" says the regular, ""what are you asking for him?""

""500 dollars"" the man says.

""Whoa that's a lot of money for a dog"" the regular says.

""Well, it's like that dog is a part of my family. He's the gentlest, sweetest dog you've ever seen. He never barks, unless there is an intruder, in which case he turns into the meanest SOB that ever lived. When he needs to go, he'll just nudge your leg once or twice and then sit by the door and wait till you're ready to let him out. My kids and wife love him, and are going to hate me for selling him, but I don't have any other options.""

The regular says ""well jeez, guy. If the dog is that good, I'll take him. I'd be happy to help you out.""

A year later the man walks into the bar again. This time the regular is there again, but he screams:""YOU! YOU SOLD ME THAT GOOD FOR NOTHIN' SON OF A BITCHIN' DOG. That dog does nothing but shit all over the house. He barks constantly, and tries to bite my wife and kids every chance he gets. I swear to god the day I bought that dog was the last good day I've had""

The man looks at the regular and says ""Mister... you ain't ever gonna sell that dog if you keep talking about him like that.""",null,7,cddzt2r,1qjo4j,jokes,top_all,2

Sigismund__Freud,"In this joke, the horse or stallion straying from its owner represents an unbridled male sexual energy.  Repeated references to bars and the horses long ""face"", or head -- its identifying feature -- reinforce the phallic nature of the initial sequence.  The ""handler"" is eventually able to subdue the ""horse"" in the way a hand might subdue the male organ, but not before it spills its fluid and those of several other men.  The outwardly homoerotic nature of this public display is shamed by society, causing the horse to be cast out while the ""bar-tender"" (which we understand to be a closeted homosexual himself) attempts to sanitize his establishment and therefor his public image.

Forgiveness and understanding arrives in the form of jesus christ but, as the bar-tender has closed his door for the time being, he strays from his intended visit, encountering the receptionist.  This, as we know, is a traditionally female role.  Christ, being the illusory father figure and as such needing to retire, offers his metaphorical son the instrument of his destruction in exchange for a modicum of hospitality.  The receptionist, not recognizing the words of the lord but seeing the nails as miniature phallic symbols (given their shape and their ability to be used for both creative and destructive purposes), is further emasculated.  He expresses his desires meekly and without a voice of his own.  Christ, unable to make his message known, departs.

A duck, which is understood in many cultures to be a symbol of fidelity and sexual intimacy, has been questioning for some time whether the receptionist has any grapes -- an obvious reference to that part of the male anatomy in which seed is stored.  Today however, perhaps after witnessing the horse's literal outburst, he inquires after the size of the man's organ.  Ashamed and infuriated, he leaves for the place where he knows another man with similar self-doubts to be.  Unable to enter through the front,  he discovers and forces his way (albeit with some difficulty) into an ""alternative entrance.""  

Two other father figures, this time considerably less illusory and who presumably speak the language of these other gentlemen witness this impromptu sodomy and attempt to correct the situation, but in their eagerness follow the receptionist into the same shame.  The bartender who, in his attempt to remain clean in the eyes of society has found himself involuntarily penetrated by not one but three figures puts aside his chore so that he may wonder aloud at the supreme absurdity of the human condition.",null,3,cdde7ei,1qhuze,jokes,top_all,5

Mr_Mcshiny,"Explanation:

C, E flat (Eb) and G form a C-minor chord (technically a triad).
The interval between C and G is a fifth, or perfect fifth.
If you change G to Gb (G flat) the perfect fifth becomes a diminished fifth.
F is not high enough in pitch (sharp enough) to create an augmented interval.
D is the second note of the C scale (major or minor) and the interval between C and D is a 2nd. 
A is the relative minor of C, meaning that the A minor scale and C major scale are the exact same notes, they just start in different places. 
The interval between a C and a Bb (B flat) is a minor 7th. 
A ""rest"" is pause in the music. 
Diminished (diminution) and minor are both qualities of chords/scales, used here just as puns.
D.S. (Dal Segno) means ""go back from this point to the segno symbol and repeat."" 
A coda typically marks the end of a piece or movement. 

Feel free to critique, it's been a few years since music school.

Finally St.Peters shows him Berlusconi in the most magnificent hotel suite, a wonderful polinesian beach just outside the balcony, French champagne on ice, exquisite foods served , very pleasant music , lightning and decorations , and guess what ? , Jennifer

""Wow, Pete, THAT is what I want , show me no more !""

St.Peter shows the most shocking and surprised face for 1 or 2 seconds , then giggles and says :

""Oh, Obama, you got it totally wrong !! JENNIFER is who is on purgatory !""

1) Why don't women wear watches?  There's a clock on the stove.

3) If your dog is at the back door barking to be let in, and your wife is ringing the front door bell to get let in, who should you let in first?  Let the dog in first, because it'll shut its fucking mouth when you let it gets inside.

4) I bought a condom that said ""For Her Pleasure"", so I turned it inside out.

5) How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?  Feminists can't change anything.

6) What do you call the useless skin that surrounds the vaginal opening?  A woman.

7)  Why do women have such small feet?  So they can stand closer to the sink.

8) What's the best part about getting a blow job?  You don't have to listen to her talk the whole time.

9) How do you make sure a woman has an orgasm?  Who the fuck cares.

10) What's worse than a chauvinist pig?  A woman who won't do what she's told.

11)  If a tree falls on a woman, but there's no one around to hear it, does she make a noise?  It's a trick question because there's no trees in the kitchen.

12) Why don't women ski?  Because there's no snow between the bedroom and the kitchen.

They come upon an accident.  An ox-cart has been upset, the driver thrown and is quite dead as the startled oxen had stomped on this head and face.  He was unrecognizable.

The women were horrified but the first woman thought she recognized the man's clothing and began wailing that the dead man might be her husband.  

She decided to examine his penis. just make sure.  After opening the poor man's trousers and looking, she said ""No no!  This is not my husband.""

The second woman said ""You're right.  He's not your husband.""

The third woman said ""He's not even from our village!""

DrSAR,"My favorite ""Tribal Wisdom"" joke, copied from the Washington Post:

It was autumn, and members of a Native American tribe asked their new Chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was a new Chief in a modern society and had never been taught the old secrets of Nature, he looked up at the sky and had no clue what to do. To play it safe, he replied to his tribe that the winter could definitely be cold and that they should collect firewood early, just to be prepared. So, the members began gathering wood.

Being a practical leader, he figured he should also use the resources available to the modern society. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Will this winter be cold?""

""As of now, it looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the forecaster said.

So the Chief went back to his tribe and told them to collect even more wood. A week later he called the National Weather Service again and asked for an update.

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""based on incoming data, this winter is looking to be colder than we expected."" The Chief was surprised, but again went back to his tribe, told them that this might be a very cold winter, and asked them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

One week later, the Chief called the National Weather Service yet again, hoping for a new answer. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Positive,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""Really?"" the shocked Chief exclaimed. ""How can you be so sure?""

Sitting on the side of the road waiting to catch speeding drivers, a state trooper sees a car puttering along at 22 mph. ""This driver is as dangerous as any speeder!"", he thinks to himself. So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.

Approaching the car, he notices that there are five elderly ladies, two in the front seat and three in the back, wide-eyed and white as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, ""Officer, I don't understand. I was going the exact speed limit. What seems to be the problem?""

The trooper, trying to contain a chuckle, explains to her that 22 was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. ""But before you go, ma'am, I have to ask, is everyone in this car OK? These women seem awfully shaken.""

""Oh, they'll be all right in a minute, officer. We just got off Route 136.""

**At that point**, what appeared to be the youngest of the five women, Dolores, resumed rubbing her clit in the back seat using a tightly gripped novella. The officer couldn't make out the name of the book, the spine had cracked and the cover was folded back. Maybe that was a picture of Bucky Showalter on the rear floorboard. He couldn't be sure.

He suddenly realized he had been staring at the book, and picture, for quite a long time, and looked up to see all five women staring directly at him. ""Well"", he thought, ""this is nothing that is any of my business."" He waved them on and returned to his car.

He felt smaller, somehow, as he sat there, watching them pull away. And for a long time he thought about them, and their inability to read signs. Were they a danger to the public? Or were they just being girls? Did they need wood shampoos? Or just some flowers and a listen? The world truly was a mysterious riddle.

The radio squawked something indistinct, and he resolved to put them out of his mind.",null,14,ccut20s,1oqt44,jokes,top_all,2

Patient: ""My farts do not stink and you can't hear them. It's just that I fart all the time. Look, we've been talking here for about 10 minutes and I've farted five times.""
""Hmm,"" says the Doctor, as he picks up his pad and writes out a prescription.
The patient is thrilled ""Great doc. This prescription, will it really clear up my farts?""
""No,"" sighs the Doctor, ""The prescription is to clear your sinuses, it stinks like an elephant's arse in here. Next week I want you back here for a hearing test.""

Brownie82,"Or a similar one:

A woman goes into Bass Pro Shop to buy a rod and reel for her grandson's Christmas present. She doesn't know which one to get so she just grabs one and goes over to the counter.  A Bass Pro Shop associate is standing there wearing  dark shades.  She says, 'Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?'  He says, 'Ma'am, I'm completely blind; but if you'll drop it on the  counter, I'll be happy to tell you everything from the sound it makes.'  She doesn't believe him but drops it on the counter anyway.  He says, 'That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404  reel and 10-LB. test line. It's a good all around combination and it's  on sale this week for $20.00.  She says, 'That's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I'll take it!'  As she opens her purse, her credit card drops on the floor.  'Oh, that sounds like a Master Card,' he says.  As she bends over to pick it up she accidentally farts. At first blush  she's embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way the blind clerk  could ever tell that it was her that tooted.  She hands him her card and he rings up the sale and says, 'That'll be  $34.95 please.'  The woman is momentarily confused and asks, 'Didn't you tell me the  rod and reel were on sale for $20.00? How did you get $34.95?'  He replies, 'Yes, Ma'am. The rod and reel was $20.00, the Duck Call  was $11.00 and the Catfish stink bait is $3.95.

A boy and a girl were in a car and talking, the girl asks the guy if he knows what ""fingering"" is. He says, ""No."". She responds, ""It's where you use two fingers like *this*, and grabs his hand, makes the gesture, ""and then you stick them in me like *this*"".

The boy responds in shock but instantly takes to it, ""now push your fingers in and out"" she confirms. After a few minutes, the boy stops and pulls his fingers out. ""What's this!?"" he exclaims, his fingers dripping with a thick red liquid. ""That's the pizza sauce."" she says, ""Keep going."".

A few more minutes pass and suddenly there is a loud knock on the window and the girl jumps up and covers herself, the boy sits confused not knowing what to do. She rolls down the window and there is a police officer, ""*What are you two doing?*"" he demands. ""Nothing, sir."" the girl peeps. The officer looks at the boy, ""*What is on your hand?*"".

andrew21885,"This was the joke told when I was knee high to a grass hopper. It has been changed a little from the original version but the punchline is the same. 

Little Johnny and his little red wagon goes to the store and he asks the clerk ""do you have any bum?""

The clerk said, ""no you mean gum.""

Then Johnny asks the clerk ""do you have a fuck it?""

The clerk said ""no you mean a bucket.""

Finally Johnny asks the clerk "" do you have a cock and spank it?""

The clerk said ""no you mean a cocker spaniel.""

As Little Johnny goes home with all of his stuff in his little red wagon he suddenly forgot one more thing so he goes up to a old man and he said to him.

An egalitarian, is (for basic explanation) someone whom thinks that everyone should be equal.

A feminist is someone whom thinks that there is a patriarchy that needs to be battled. Not someone who wants equality. The best example of this is the male rape fiasco. Many radical feminists refuse to believe that men can be raped. They have protested and cause some serious issues over speakers whom believe this. Instead of increasing the care for people, ALL people whom have been victims of sexual assault they fight to hold male rape care down, and raise female rape care. 

That makes no damn sense, gain equality by lowering men. Why not gain equality by raising women up to an equal plat form.

I am an egalitarian (though i am subbed to mens rights, r/feminisms banned me for asking for their side of the story. I didn't want to just beleve one side without hearing the other side....) i am not an MRA, i am an egalitarian whom sees MANY different groups who need help.",null,15,ccfi0vp,1n3j0l,jokes,top_all,15

I don't have a problem with this one bit, but it sparked a thought into my skull. I was once in the ROTC at my university. For 2 years I worked with people and realized that people of color were treated special. They were given jobs that others were more qualified for because why? ..

      numbers. ""Equality"" is not fairness and when ""equality"" is shoved down our throats to this point that the ones who protect our country are given jobs not because they are the best but because they ""deserve"" what others have worked harder for, THIS IS THE REASON OUR COUNTRY FAILS. stop bitching and get work. We need to stop trying to group things by vaginas and penises and color just to get yourself a piece of pie that you truly do not deserve. 

tl:dr
I love people of all races and genders, and I love people of all countries. I don't even say these things because I want the US to be better than the next country.

The chief then said ""All of your lives may be spared if you can find ten of one fruit and bring them back to me.""

So after a while the first man returned with 10 apples. The chief then ordered him to stick all ten of them up his butt without making any expression at all on his face. He had a little bit of trouble with the first one and started crying while trying to put the next one in. He was soon killed.

Later, the next guy came in with 10 grapes. The chief soon ordered him to do the same as the first guy. After to the 9th grape, the man started laughing so hard for no apparent reason, and was killed.

The first two guys soon met in heaven and the first guy ask the second, ""Why did you start laughing? You only needed one more grape and you'd have gotten away!""

3 mice are sitting around drinking at a mouse bar and start talking about how tough they each are.

Second mouse says ""ahh, that's nothing,"" slams a shot, and proceeds ""I'm so tough that every morning, I go around the house and collect all the rat poison pellets and crumble them up and sprinkle that shit on my breakfast cereal.""  The third mouse just sits there quietly, drinks his shot, then starts to leave.  The other two look at him and pry ""well, what about you?  Not man enough to hang with us?""

You should spend hours upon hours per day delving into each and every link of Reddit AND the internet so that you can avoid rookie mistakes like this. People who post anything anywhere are expected to know whether or not it has ever been posted ever in the history of the web, ever. Never forget that. Also, you should always post jokes that ONLY YOU HAVE EVER HEARD and no one else. Multiple people hearing the same joke increases the likelihood of reposts happening over and over again over the course of several years and decades and we cannot ever have that. Ever. If you are the sole receiver of a joke it better be one that has never ever been told to anyone else ever in the history of humanity. If you post something original, be sure to create several links on various websites so as to claim full ownership of original content. Anything less than originality will get you hanged by your scrote. You have failed at the internet and must commence self destruction sequence.

Graymouzer,"Carter didn't lack courage. From the Wikipedia entry on him:

On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada's Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown. The resulting explosion caused millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building's basement, and the reactor's core was no longer usable.[17] Carter was ordered to Chalk River, joining other American and Canadian service personnel. He was the officer in charge of the U.S. team assisting in the shutdown of the Chalk River Nuclear Reactor.[18]

Once they arrived, Carter's team used a model of the reactor to practice the steps necessary to disassemble the reactor and seal it off. During execution of the disassembly, each team member, including Carter, donned protective gear, was lowered individually into the reactor, where he could stay for only a few seconds at a time to minimize exposure to radiation. They had to use hand tools to loosen bolts, remove nuts, and take the other steps necessary to complete the disassembly process.",null,9,cc7m87c,1mabka,jokes,top_all,13

-----


I hardly ever found myself in agreement with Reagan on any issue at any time, but he is the only U.S. President with whom I ever sat down to dinner, and that one meal told me a lot about the man that is being missed in all the eulogizing. Ronnie Reagan was a very funny guy.

One night in 1978, my friend John Austin, who had covered Governor Reagan for Time magazine, and I met for dinner in San Jose, California. The former governor wasn't even running for President yet, but was in town that day to give a lunch speech. Reagan's plane back to Los Angeles, where Nancy was waiting, didn't leave for several hours, so we kept him company. Over drinks and then dinner, Reagan never once mentioned politics. Instead he told an unending string of Irish jokes. Here is my favorite:

Two Irish ladies were at the wake for their dear friend. ""Poor Mollie,"" said the first woman, looking down at the body, ""she had such a hard life. First she married Mike, who gave her five crying children in six years. He beat her and never worked a day in his life. Then Mike up and died, and she married Johnny, who was even worse, giving her seven more children and not a penny of support. He was drunk all the time until he died, too. And now Mollie is gone, worked to death taking care of those 12 kids.""

""Well, at least they are together at last,"" replied the second woman.

""You mean together in Heaven?"" asked the first woman. ""But is Mollie together with Mike or with Johnny?""

""I was referring to her legs.""",null,4,cc4i1sc,1lzdak,jokes,top_all,23

The World Health Organization group went back to one village to check on things a year later, and the birth rate was higher than ever.

appropriate-username,"&gt;It is prejudice. Sharks do not circle in the water before they attack, it is simply their way of trying to form an image of what they are confronting in the water. According to my own numerous observations this motion is a sign of pure curiosity and not an incentive to circle its prey and feed. Most shark species must engage in permanent swimming maneuvers to breathe for they cannot pump water past their gills to extract oxygen as other fish with skeletal systems can. In addition, a swimmer or diver, in contrast to a shark, remains almost immobile, so the shark can only choose between two available forms of behavior, circling or swimming a figure eight - moving up and down around the object of interest. Circling has the advantage that the shark need not continually change the direction of swimming while being able to remain at a constant distance to the object. However, when the object is not located in open waters, for example in a reef, the shark cannot circle without risking the loss of eye contact. In such case, the shark has to swim a figure eight around the swimmer or diver, and in so doing will make sure to always keep his back towards open water.

iamthefrogprince,"A Royal Canadian Navy Sailor and a Canadian Army soldier were touring Mt McKinley. The sailor, in his Navy Staff car started up the single lane trail towards the top of the mountain. The soldier, having already ascended the mountain, began his track down the mountain in his army jeep. Slowly, inexorably, they made their way closer to one another until they both reached a particularly narrow part of the trail near the middle of the mountain.  The sailor seeing the Army jeep assumed the soldier would pull over to the side to allow the less manoueverable staff car to pass. The soldier, seeing the less manoeuvreable staff car asumed the sailor would pull over and wait for his jeep to pass so that the staff car could have the whole road to itself.
The crash left them both stunned momentarily, however both drivers recovered quickly and began to quarrel over who was at fault and who should have given way to whom. 
The argument became more and more heated. 
Just as it seemed that it would come to blows, the sailor threw up his hands and said 
""Stop, please, I can't stand it any more! WE're both professional military men. We're brothers in arms, and this isn't worth fighting over""
The soldier sheepishly agreed with the sailor and reached out his hand in friendship. 
The sailor reached behind the drivers seat of the Staff car and pulled out a bottle of Navy issue rum.
""I was saving this for a special occasion said the sailor, but this seems like as good a time as any"", and he cracked the top of the bottle and handed it to the soldier as a peace offering. ""Let's toast to our brothership in arms"" said the sailor.
The soldier polished off a healthy portion of hte bottle and handed it back to the sailor.
""Thank you brother"" said the soldier, ""that's very generous of you.""
The sailor smiled, said ""you're welcome"", and placed the top back on te bottle before carefully stowing it back in the trunk of the car.

An air force general, marine corp commandant, army general, coast guard admiral, and navy admiral are playing cards together arguing who is the toughest in the service.

Soldier, I want you to into this simulated enemy environment of monkey bars, run through those tires, and climb that 30 foot wooden wall!"" The soldier takes off, climbs the monkey bars, runs through the tires, climbs the wall and falls off splattering his brains everywhere. ""See, now that's the toughest man there is!""

The air force general says with a lisp, ""The airman is the toughest man there is! Airman, I want you to take this shammy cloth and go polish that F-16 til it SPARKLES!"" ""Sir, yes sir!"" And the airman polishes that plane til it sparkles. ""There's the toughest man you'll ever see!""

The marine commandant oafishly says ""Der marine is der toughest fighting man you'll ever find. Marine, take these chopsticks, run across that long beach and kill that enemy machine gun emplacement at the end"" ""Uh, yuh sir"" The marine sharpens the chopsticks into deadly killing implements and races across the beach to the machine gun, but it blown away after 20 feet. ""That's der toughest man you'll ever find!""

The coast guard admiral whinily says ""The coastie is the toughest man in the world! Coastie, I want you to jump off that stepladder into that kiddie pool and swim to the other side!"" The coastie climbs the ladder, puts his water wings on, bellyflops in, and doggypaddles to the other side in exhaustion. ""Toughest fighting man you'll ever find!""

The admiral smiles and says, ""The sailor is the toughest man you'll ever see. Sailor, take this knife, jump off that aircraft carrier and kill all of the sharks swimming below us"" The sailor looks at him and says ""Suck my dick, sir.""

"" Private! If you cannot play Reveille better then that, Then you better throw that Bugle overboard right now! "" 

To which the Private replied. "" SIR YES SIR! "" And with military precision threw the bugle overboard. It cost him a night in the brig and the price of a new Bugle but moral for the rest of the trip was back up :D ",null,13,cc03q5r,1ljxhw,jokes,top_all,64

{Courtesy of Today's TIL page}

""Stalin was also the man behind the most wicked practical joke ever played. Being a very private man he gave the order that no person should enter his bed chambers on pain of death. Later, while in his chambers he decided to test whether his guards had listened to this instruction. Pretending to scream in pain he called for the guards stationed outside the door. Fearing that their leader was in trouble the guards burst into the room. Stalin had them executed for failing to follow his standing orders."" 

This is a twist to this joke though...

""This little prank soon backfired, however, when Stalin suffered a seizure while alone in his bedroom. The guards were too afraid to enter, finding him hours later laid in a puddle of stale urine. He died three days later.""",null,0,cc0hmd8,1ljxhw,jokes,top_all,4

A man boards a SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Mumbai and takes his seat. 

As he settles in, he glances up and sees a gorgeous woman boarding the plane. He soon realizes she's heading straight towards his seat. Lo and behold, she takes the seat right next to his.

Eager to strike up a conversation, he asks ""Business trip or vacation?""
 
She turns, smiles, and says, ""Business. I'm going to the annual Sexologists Convention.""

He swallows hard. Here is the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen, sitting next to him, and she's a sexologist! Struggling to contain his excitement and maintain his composure, he calmly asks, ""What's your business role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she says, ""I use my experience to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really?"" he says, swallowing hard. ""What m-m-m-myths are those?""

""Well,"" she explains, ""one popular myth is that African men are the best endowed when, in fact, it's the Tamilian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, whereas actually it is the Bengali. However, we have found that the best potential lover in all categories is the Sardar.""

The-Dudemeister,"This is kind of like the opposite of the husband store:

A store that sells husbands has just opened where a woman may go to choose a husband from among many men. The store is composed of 6 floors, and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the flights. 

There is, however, a catch. As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building. 

So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. 

On the first floor the sign on the door reads: 

Floor 1 - These men have jobs. 

The woman reads the sign and says to herself, ""Well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what's further up?"" So up she goes. 

The second floor sign reads: 

Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids. 

The woman remarks to herself, ""That's great, but I wonder what's further up?"" And up she goes again. 

The third floor sign reads: 

Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking. 

""Hmmm, better"" she says. ""But I wonder what's upstairs?"" 

The fourth floor sign reads: 

Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the housework. 

""Wow!"" exclaims the woman, ""very tempting. BUT, there must be more further up!"" And again she heads up another flight. 

The fifth floor sign reads: 

Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak. 

""Oh, mercy me! But just think... what must be awaiting me further on?"" So up to the sixth floor she goes. 

The sixth floor sign reads: 

Floor 6 - You are visitor 6,875,953,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please.",null,28,cbwk1j5,1l6kf4,jokes,top_all,151

""OK well you're going to have to bend over so I can take a look.""

So the man reluctantly drops his pants and bends over.  To the doctors surprise, he sees a £10 note sticking out of his asshole.  Upon pulling it out, a £20 note appeared!  Frowning, he pulled the next note out, and another £10 note appeared!  This went on for quite some time, pulling out £10, £20 and the occasional £50 note while the man was bent over, wondering what was going on.  Finally, no more notes appeared.  The doctor told the man he could stand up and put his pants on.

After counting the money, the doctor exclaimed ""I don't know what happened last night, but you had £1,990 stuck up your ass!""

deely153,"Another Smart Blonde Joke:

A blonde walks into a very high scale bank in Manhattan and requests a loan for $50. Confused, the lenders at the bank ask her if she will put up collateral for the loan. The blonde then hands over the keys to her brand new Jaguar and asks if this is good enough.

As she leaves the bank, the lenders snicker at her and go to collect her Jaguar. They drive it into their underground parking lot and store it away until she comes back three weeks later.

The blonde walks over to the lenders and gives them back the $50 and asks for her keys back. The lenders comply but ask her why she would put up her new Jaguar for $50, to which the blonde replies, ""you find a better way to park a car for 3 weeks in Manhattan while you go on vacation"".

cat_herder_64,"Hey, I knew this guy! His name was Bob.

I remember that he entered the freestyle event at the high school swimming carnival.

All the swimmers were on the blocks ready to go, the starter's pistol went off, they all dived in, including Bob. But he didn't come up.

I was really worried about him so I jumped in and got him off the bottom of the swimming pool. When he finally got his breath back, I said, ""Bob! What happened?""

""Ah, fuck! I got cramp!""

Years later, I took him down to the pub. He bowls in and says to me, ""Put me on the bar! Now gimme a beer!"" He needed a straw for that....

He wanted to play darts next. Everybody in the pub wondered how he was going to pull that one off. Needn't have worried - he'd thought it through.

He said, ""Put the dart in my mouth - feathered end first!""

So I did.

Three professors (a physicist, a chemist, and a mathematician) are called in to see their dean. Just as they arrive the dean is called out of his office, leaving the three professors there. The professors see with alarm that there is a fire in the wastebasket.

The physicist says, ""I know what to do! We must cool down the materials until their temperature is lower than the ignition temperature and then the fire will go out.""

The chemist says, ""No! No! I know what to do! We must cut off the supply of oxygen so that the fire will go out due to lack of one of the reactants.""

The department of defense, in an effort to cut some costs decides to offer severance packages to some superfluous higher ranking officers. The offer is an honorable discharge and $100 for every inch between two points on their body of their choosing. 

A Navy admiral takes this opportunity and heads into the medical office to have his two locations measured. He picks the tip of his big toe and the top of his forehead. The doctor measures 77 inches and off he goes to enjoy civilian life. 

Next up is an Air Force general. He plans ahead a little better and raises his arm all the way up and stands of his toes and the doctor measures 99 inches. Out the door he goes nearly 10 grand richer and a civilian. 

The last one to take the buy out is an Army General. The doctor asks him which two points he'd like measured and he replies,""The tip of my penis to the base of my left testicle.""
The doctor is a little taken aback at this and reminds the man that no matter how well hung he is, he's probably short changing himself. The general assures the doctor that he knows what he's doing and would like to proceed. 

""Ok, suit yourself sir. Drop your pants."", says the doctor who kneels down with his measuring tape.
""Wait a minute! Where the hell is your left testicle?!"", exclaims the shocked doctor. 

""Heh, Vietnam.""

EDIT: Ok, I get it. The first two aren't too much money the third is ridiculously large. It's a joke, that's sort of the idea.

Later, when Laura had lunch with Hillary at her tour of the White House, she told Hillary how impressed George had been with his discovery of the fact that, in the President's private bathroom, the President had a gold urinal.

AntiMe,"An old gentleman lived alone in New Jersey. He wanted to plant his annual tomato garden, but it was very difficult work, as the ground was hard. His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament: 

Dear Vincent, I am feeling pretty sad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days. Love, Papa


A few days later he received a letter from his son.


Dear Papa, Don't dig up that garden. That's where the bodies are buried.  Love, Vinnie 

At 4 a.m. the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left. That same day the old man received another letter from his son.

Dear Papa, Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances.

of the Vancouver Hilton, and as he paid his bill said to the 
manager, ""By the way, what's with the Indian chief sitting in 
the lobby?  He's been there ever since I arrived.""

  ""Oh that's 'Big Chief Forget-me Not',"" said the manager.  

""The hotel is built on an Indian reservation, and part of the 
agreement is to allow the chief free use of the premises for 
the rest of his life.  He is known as 'Big Chief Forget-me Not' 
because of his phenomenal memory.  He is 92 and can remember 
the slightest details of his life.""

  The travel writer took this in, and as he was waiting for
his cab decided to put the chief's memory to the test.

  ""G'dye, myte!"" said the Aussie, receiving only a slight 
nod in return. ""What did you have for breakfast on your 
21st birthday?""

  ""Eggs,"" was the chief's instant reply, without even looking 
up, and indeed the Aussie was impressed.

  He went off on his travel writing itinerary, right across 
to the east coast and back, telling others of Big Chief 
Forget-Me-Not's great memory.  (One local noted to him that 
'How' was a more appropriate greeting for an Indian chief than
'G'dye myte.')

  On his return to the Vancouver Hilton six months later, he 
was surprised to see 'Big Chief Forget-me Not' still sitting 
in the lobby, fully occupied with whittling away on a stick.

The_Neckbeard_King,"Reminded me of one of my favorites:

A man is looking through the latest issue of his favorite cheap porn magazine.  He's sees an ad for ""The AMAZING singing blow job"" with just an address listed.  He thought to himself, ""What the hell is a singing blow job?""

Days go by and the man can't stop thinking about it and his curiosity gets the best of him.  He heads down to the address and it leads to a small bare office with a woman behind a desk.  The man says, ""I'm here for the singing blow job please.""  The woman replies, ""Great! That will be 500 dollars.""

500 dollars, that's ridiculous!!  But then he thinks to himself, dammit I have to know what this is.  He reluctantly pays the money and the lady tells him to go to the door at the end of the hall.  He slowly makes his way down with all sorts of fantasies bolstering his anticipation for what's to come.

He opens the door and see's a very attractive petite pixie looking blonde waiting for him.  The room is mostly empty with just a small couch and a little table next to it.  The man says, ""I can't wait to see what this is about.""  The woman replies, ""Unfortunately you can't see it, you experience it.  Please turn off the lights.""

The man was a little disappointed but he did what she asked.  The girl called him over and began to give him a blow job.  She was amazing, the man thought.  Easily the best one he ever had.  Then she began to sing.  It was the most beautiful and breathtaking voice he had ever heard.

The man couldn't believe or comprehend what was happening, but the experience was taking him to a place he never imagined.  But still, he had to know how she was doing this!

The second he finished the man desperately ran for the light, but the room was still pitch black.  He fumbled his hands on the wall for just a moment before finding the switch.  The lights when on and he quickly turned back to see.

The girl was gone, but there was a glass eye on the table.

Same joke:  
An Englishman, a German and a Frenchman are in Saudi Arabia sharing a smuggled crate of booze when Saudi police rush in and arrest them. The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia, so they are all sentenced to 20 lashes each of the whip.  

As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheikh announced: ""It's my wife's birthday, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.  

The German was first. He thought for a while and then said, ""Please tie a pillow to my back."" This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through. When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain.  

The Frenchman was next. After watching the German in horror he said smugly, ""Please affix two pillows to my back."" The two pillows withstood 15 lashes before the whip went through and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly.  

The Englishman was last, but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said, ""You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest. For this, you may have two wishes!""  

""Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful highness,"" the Englishman replied. ""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""  

""Not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave,"" the Sheikh said with an admiring look on his face. ""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish, what is it to be?"" the Sheikh asked.  

The Englishman smiled and said, ""Tie the Frenchman to my back.""",null,25,cb5ivap,1ikvz7,jokes,top_all,24

Mediumtim,"A beautiful young woman had had her heart broken so badly by her last lover that she had lost all will to live. She wrote her will, discarded all perishable food in her fridge, turned off the water and electricity.  


She took a handgun and placed the muzzle against the side of her head ... but lowered the gun again, thinking: I should not destroy my head, I want to leave a beautiful corpse.


So she took the handgun and pressed the muzzle against her chest, aiming for her heart. But against this too, she decided, thinking she shouldn't destroy her wonderful, firm breasts.


Lacking any decent knowledge of anatomy, she thought to kill herself by shooting herself up of her vagina. So she took the barrel of the gun and inserted it into her body. But then, she took it out again. Put it in again, took it out again. This went on for quite some time until she'd decided she was over her lost lover.",null,155,cb1syw7,1i7lgx,jokes,top_all,797

The lady looks the man up and down, he clearly doesn't have a lot of money.
""Sir, to see Natalie you will have to pay $1,000 for half an hour""

A wealthy man on his death bed called his three best friends-- his doctor, his priest, and his lawyer-- to make a final request. ""Who knows what I will find on the other side? Just to be sure, I am giving you each one hundred thousand dollars and I ask that you place an envelope with that amount in my casket."" All three took the money and agreed to fulfill his wish.

He died soon thereafter and at the funeral each friend slipped an envelope into the casket. After the burial, the three walked together from the grave. The doctor said, ""My friends, I have a confession to make; since the hospital was short of funds for treating the poor I only put 80, 000 dollars in the envelope and donated the other 20, 000 to our indigent fund."" The priest then said, ""I too have to confess that I gave 50,000 dollars to the homeless and only put fifty thousand in the casket.""

The lawyer looked both his friends straight in the eye and said, ""I am astonished and deeply disappointed that you failed to keep your solemn promise to our dear departed friend.

&gt; Speedbird 206: ""Top of the morning Frankfurt, Speedbird 206 clear of the active runway.""

&gt; Ground: ""Guten morgen!  You will taxi to your  gate!""

&gt; The big British Airways 747 pulled onto the main taxiway and slowed to a stop.

&gt; Ground: ""Speedbird, do you not know where you are going?"" Speedbird 206: ""Stand by a moment ground, I'm looking up our gate location now.""

&gt; Ground (with some arrogant  impatience): ""Speedbird 206, you have never flown to Frankfurt before?!?""

Over time, all of the systems the engineer installed break down, and Hell is as hot and dry and dark as ever. Then a brilliant mathematician dies and goes to Hell, and the Devil asks him to fix the air conditioning, wiring and plumbing.

The mathematician enlists millions of souls to help in the repairs, and there is a furious flurry of activity. They rip out everything the engineer installed within hours.

The worker stepped up and wondered if the priest was on to something. ""If it pleases you,"" he asked humbly, ""I would also like to die facing god."" So they placed him in the guillotine and the blade stopped short before reaching his neck. Marveled, the executioners let him go. 

The engineer was brought up. ""I see no reason to challenge my luck. Please place me in the guillotine facing up."" As they closed the guillotine around his neck he said ""Oh! I see your problem!""

Because Jesus died on the cross, his body was taken to a tomb, which was later discovered empty, and he subsequently turned up to chat with some old friends.

Kinda funny, but no. If I recall my catechism correctly, believers think abortion is a sin, and they think that Mary was chosen to bear Christ because she was without sin (other than the Original Sin)--hence her having an abortion would have stained her mortal record, leaving her unsuitable to bear the Christchild, even if she had been the perfect candidate before. Further--if God were truly omnipotent, then he would foresee Mary's choice and he would pick a different vessel for his seed, leaving Mary as just some other forgotten carpenter's wife and her fetus would never have been Jesus in the first place, just some other smut on the end of a coat hanger.

 The old rooster replies,' come on, you can't handle ALL these chickens. Look what it's done to me. Can't you just let me have the two old hens over in the corner?'

 The young rooster says, 'Beat it! You're washed up and I'm taking over.' The old rooster says 'I'll tell you what, young stud, I'll race you around the farmhouse. Whoever wins gets exclusive domain over the entire chicken coop.'

 The young rooster laughs, 'You know you don't stand a chance old man, so just to be fair, I'll give you a head start. 'The old rooster takes off running. About 15 seconds later the young rooster takes off after him. They round the front of the farmhouse and the young rooster has closed the gap.

 He's already about 5 inches behind the old rooster and gaining fast. The farmer, meanwhile, is sitting on the front porch when he sees the roosters running by. He grabs up his shotgun and BOOM!, he blows the young rooster to bits.

Grandy12,"I remember a similar one.

A monk, a priest and a rabbi enter a bar, but they have no money. The priest is not exactly a holy man, so he tricks the bartender, walking up to him and saying ""Barkeep, I paid for a drink half an hour ago and am still waiting."" the barkeep looks embarassed and gives him the drink, beleiving he had just forgotten the priest had paid.

The monk and the rabbi see that, and the monk waits a few minutes to try the same trick; he walks up to the barman and tells him ""Barkeep, just like my friend over there, I ordered a drink and am still waiting!"" the barman looks flustered and maybe even flabergasted at his own memory, and gives the monk a drink to make up for his 'mistake'.

The rabbi walks up to him and tells the same lie, ""Barkeep, you have forgotten my drink as well!"" the barkeep apologises, ""I am so sorry Mr. Finklestein, I don't know what is happening to me! Would you believe you were the third holy man I forget to serve this morning?""

It's a funny joke. I get it. Really.

Too many of these jokes, too many times seeing the same idea in movies. It's tiresome. And it is a way of communicating our barely hidden fear, confusion ond outrage at those trans* people who are so different from the rest of us.

zlap,"It reminds me of a joke about the CIA, the Mossad and the KGB.

A mummy was found in Egypt, and to determine its age and whatnot, three best forensic teams of the world decided to start a competition. 

The CIA went first. They studied the mummy for a year, and then came up with a result: the person lived around 1000 years BC, plus or minus 200 years. 

The Mossad goes next. They study the mummy for a month, and conclude: it was a pharaoh who ruled 1000 years BC, give or take 100 years.

The KGB team goes next. They hold the mummy for a week, and then come up with this: it was Pharaoh Ramenhotep the Second, born 1022 BC, became king after murdering his uncle, ruled for five years, on the third year of his reign the Nile flooded Luxor, on the fourth year the hittites attacked.

Everyone is perplexed: ""How did you find all this out?""

MortarMex,"Reminds me of the Military snake theory

he Differential Theory of US Armed Forces (Snake Model) upon encountering a snake in the Area of Operations (AO)

1. Infantry: Snake smells them, leaves area.

2. Airborne: Lands on and kills the snake.

3. Armor: Runs over snake, laughs, and looks for more snakes.

4. Aviation: Has Global Positioning Satellite coordinates to snake. Can't find snake. Returns to base for refuel, crew rest and manicure.

5. Ranger: Plays with snake, then eats it.

6. Field Artillery: Kills snake with massive Time On Target barrage with three Forward Artillery Brigades in support. Kills several hundred civilians as unavoidable collateral damage. Mission is considered a success and all participants (i.e., cooks, mechanics and clerks) are awarded Silver Stars.

7. Special Forces: Makes contact with snake, ignores all State Department directives and Theater Commander Rules of Engagement by building rapport with snake and winning its heart and mind. Trains it to kill other snakes. Files enormous travel settlement upon return.

8. Combat Engineer: Studies snake. Prepares in-depth doctrinal thesis in obscure 5 series Field Manual about how to defeat snake using countermobility assets. Complains that maneuver forces don't understand how to properly conduct doctrinal counter-snake ops.

9. Navy SEAL: Expends all ammunition and calls for naval gunfire support in failed attempt to kill snake. Snake bites SEAL and retreats to safety. Hollywood makes fantasy film in which SEALS kill Muslim extremist snakes.

10. Navy: Fires off 50 cruise missiles from various types of ships, kills snake and makes presentation to Senate Appropriations Committee on how Naval forces are the most cost-effective means of anti-snake force projection.

11. Marine: Kills snake by accident while looking for souvenirs. Local civilians demand removal of all US forces from Area of Operations.

12. Marine Recon: Follows snake, gets lost.

13. Combat Controllers: Guides snake elsewhere.

14. Para-Rescue Jumper: Wounds snake in initial encounter, then works feverishly to save snake's life.

15. Quartermaster: (NOTICE: Your anti-snake equipment is on backorder.)

16. C-17 Transport pilot: Receives call for anti-snake equipment, delivers two weeks after due date.

17. F-15 pilot: Mis-identifies snake as enemy Mil-24 Hind helicopter and engages with missiles. Crew chief paints snake kill on aircraft.

18. F-16 pilot: Finds snake, drops two CBU-87 cluster bombs, and misses snake target, but get direct hit on Embassy 100 KM East of snake due to weather (Too Hot also Too Cold, Was Clear but too overcast, Too dry with Rain, Unlimited ceiling with low cloud cover etc.) Claims that purchasing multi-million dollar, high-tech snake-killing device will enable it in the future to kill all snakes and achieve a revolution in military affairs.

19. AH-64 Apache pilot: Unable to locate snake, snakes don't show well on infra-red. Infrared only operable in desert AO's without power lines or SAM's.

20. UH-60 Blackhawk pilot: Finds snake on fourth pass after snake builds bonfire, pops smoke, lays out VS 17 to mark Landing Zone. Rotor wash blows snake into fire.

21. B-52 pilot: Pulls ARCLIGHT mission on snake, kills snake and every other living thing within two miles of target.

22. MinuteMan Missile crew: Lays in target coordinates to snake in 20seconds, but can't receive authorization from National Command Authority to use nuclear weapons.

23. Intelligence officer: Snake? What snake? Only four of 35 indicators of snake activity are currently active. We assess the potential for snake activity as LOW.

24. Judge Advocate General (JAG): Snake declines to bite, citing grounds of professional courtesy.

25. Signal: Tries to communicate with snake...fail repeated attempts. Complains that the snake did not have the correct fill or did not know how to work equipment a child could operate. Signal Officer informs the commander that he could easily communicate with the snake using just his voice. Commander insists that he NEEDS to video-conference with the snake, with real-time streaming positional and logistical data on the snake displayed on video screens to either side. Gives Signal Corps $5 Billion to make this happen. SigO abuses the 2 smart people in the corps to make it happen, while everybody else stands around, bitches, and takes credit. In the end, General Dynamics and several sub-contractors make a few billion dollars, the 2 smart people get out and go to work for them, and the commander gets what he asked for only in fiber-optic based simulations.

The final man drops his shorts and the devil cups his sack... and nothing happens. Hell freezes, the skies open, the angels blow their trumpets and one comes down to claim the lucky souls.

They talked to the owner of the barn and he agrees to let them stay the night so their van could get fixed as long as they don't look over the fence. They were very curious at this point and wanted to look but they knew they needed a place to stay the night so they agree. That night their curiosity got the best of them and they had to look over the fence. So they went to the fence and looked over. There were several severed penises and they started freaking out. What made it worse was the farmer was right behind them. Fearing for their lives they beg for him to let them go. He agrees as long as they tell him what their fathers did for work. Thinking they successfully avoided death the first responded with, ""My father is a lumberjack."" The farmer then proceeded to get a chainsaw he cut of the first mans penis and threw it over the fence. The second responds with, ""My father is a gardener of 16 years."" The farmer pulled out a pair of hedge trimers cuts of the second mans penis and throws it over the fence. At this point the third man can't stop laughing.

He opened the door, and came in, understandably surprising both his parents.

109. Seven on the Light Bulb Task Force Subcommittee, who report to the 12 on the Light Bulb Task Force, appointed by the 15 on the Trustee Board. Their recommendation is reviewed by the Finance Committee Executive of 5, who place it on the agenda of the 18 member Finance Committee. If they approve, they bring a motion to the 27 member church Board, who appoint another 12 member review committee. If they recommend that the Church Board proceed, a resolution is brought to the Congregational Business Meeting. They appoint another 8 member review committee. If their report to the next Congregational Business Meeting supports the changing of a light bulb, and the Congregation votes in favor, the responsibility to carry out the light bulb change is passed on to the Trustee Board, who in turn appoint a 7 member committee to find the best price in new light bulbs. Their recommendation of which Hardware Store has the best buy must then be reviewed by the 23 member Ethics Committee to make certain that this hardware store has no connection to Disneyland. They report back to the Trustee Board who, then commissions the Trustee in charge of the Janitor to ask him to make the change. By then the janitor discovers that one more light bulb has burned out.",null,4,c9zl05b,1edmd6,jokes,top_all,7

In a village deep in the African jungles there was a king who ruled over a moderately sized clan named Kwanda. Recently they had begun to start diplomatic relationships, trade agreements and the like, with other neighboring tribes.

One day Kwanda had an important meeting with another powerful leader to negotiate the trade of the precious stones Kwanda's tribe had in their posession. The throne of Kwanda was highly decorated with these stones, making their abundance in the area very obvious.

In order to get the upper hand in the trades and convince the other leader the stones were of supreme rarity he ordered his subjects to hide his throne away in the thick folds of the thatched foliage that made up their homes.

Soon the other leader arrives and they begin to barter inside Kwanda's home, but before long the throne dislodges and falls, crushing Kwanda underneath. The tribe learned that day, ""Don't stow thrones in grass houses"".",null,7,c9x7r47,1e61mt,jokes,top_all,17

kuqumi,"I like to tell this one as a shaggy dog joke about a man who becomes president. He's from a small town, the kind where everyone has a signature dish that they bring dinner when they're invited over. (You can go into great detail about the different dishes each family brings. If your audience complains, explain that the joke is worth it.) The most important one is that his mom makes an amazing fruit punch. Anyway he rises through all the different political offices, from Town Clerk all the way up to President. The first few promotions he gets together with the other folks from home. (You can add some more families and their famous dishes at this point if you like. At least mention his mom's punch and a few other dishes.) At some point, though, he gets too busy to participate in these gatherings. The fundraising, the press, the need to maintain a public image... use whatever reason suits your story.
So he has a successful run as president, and someone has the bright idea to invite his friends and family to the capitol building for a farewell dinner. (At this point you can list off all the families and what they bring, just make sure to mention his mother and her famous fruit punch.) So, he's at the party, he wants to eat and he especially wants to get some of that fruit punch, since it's been years and he has such happy memories. But as the president he has to shake hands, and greet the other politicians, and he can't get a minute to himself. So he steps away for a little while to clear his head. He resigns himself to the fact that he's not getting any punch, and heads back in to shake some more hands. But the dining area is clear! He sees his mom, standing by the punch bowl, with nobody waiting! How wonderful! There's no punch line!",null,0,c9pr6j9,1dejga,jokes,top_all,2

_________lol________,"As a society, we sometimes tell jokes about some of the most horrific events--mass murders, disasters, and so on. Often the jokes start within a day or two of the catastrophe, even before the dead can be counted. Perhaps we do it as a coping or healing mechanism, or perhaps it's our only extant type of transmitting oral history in modern times. I'm just not sure. Maybe no one is.

Like you, certainly, I've heard all kinds of jokes about the Holocaust, September 11th, and recent mass shootings. I used to wonder why I never heard a good joke about [Jonestown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown) more than *three decades* after the fact, but then I realized that it was because the punchline was too long.

Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, there’s a large limo line at the rental office, but he’s patient and gets the job done.
Finally, the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and there’s no punchline.",null,11,c9ppzvd,1dejga,jokes,top_all,5

TheDogwhistles,"A man bought a parrot for his wife's birthday. It cost thousands of dollars, but it was trained in seventeen different languages. The parrot had gone past pure mimicry, and could carry on a conversation with you in any of those languages.

The man comes home, and the parrot is nowhere to be found. He asks his wife where her birthday present is!

""Oh, dear,"" the wife replies. ""I thought you gave that to me so I could roast it in the oven! Not to keep as a pet!""

The man is dumbfounded. ""That parrot could speak over ten different languages!""

""Well, then why didn't he say anything when I put him in the oven, then?""

____

A man gets a parrot, but for some reason, it won't talk. He goes to the pet store, and the manager there immediately knows what's wrong.

""Parrots won't talk unless they have some sort of physical interaction. What you need is one of these here ladders that fit in the cage. He'll climb the ladder, hop around a bit, and then start to talk. Promise.""

But a week goes by, the parrot hops around the ladder alright, but still doesn't talk. The manager isn't quite so confident this time. ""But I'm sure that if you buy this little bell, the parrot will talk this time. He'll climb up the ladder, hop around on it, ring the bell, and then talk.""

Alas, the parrot still refuses to talk for a week. The man is getting kind of annoyed with the pet store, for wasting his money on silly toys that don't get the parrot to talk. ""Isn't there anything,"" he complains. ""That I can get for my parrot that he actually needs? I go home every day and tell him what the things I got for him at the pet store are for, but he refuses to talk.""

The manager looks very carefully at the company's guidelines for parrots, not wanting to lose a customer. ""Sir,"" he says after leafing through the book. ""I know exactly what to do. You need to buy a mirror, and put it in front of the bell at the top of the ladder. Your parrot will hop up the ladder, ring the bell, look in the mirror, and begin to talk because he thinks he's talking to another parrot. It's foolproof.""

The next day, the man comes back into the pet store. ""Well, my parrot died.""

The manager is shocked. ""And he didn't say anything the entire time he was alive?""

""Well, he did say one thing. ""Doesn't that pet store sell any parrot food?""""

____

A man gets a parrot for his son, but it has a terrible vocabulary. I don't mean to say that he speaks grammatically incorrect, but rather that the parrot would swear like a sailor every time someone passed his cage.

The man tried everything to get him to not use such foul language around his young son. He knew it would be a bad influence on him if the parrot kept it up, but it would also be detrimental to simply give away the parrot.

He begins by tapping the parrot on the beak with a stick every time he swears. Instead of conditioning the parrot against swearing, as he had hoped, the parrot swore even more after being hit on the beak.

So the man takes a handful of bird food away from the parrot every time he swore. But the hungrier the parrot got, the more he swore.

He calls up the pet store, and asks the manager what to do. ""It's simple, sir,"" the manager repies. ""Parrots are tropical animals. They don't react to the cold well at all. If he does something bad, just put him in the freezer. I have to warn you though, it might severely damage the parrot if you leave him in there for too long.""

The man takes the advice to heart, and tries his previous tactics to get the bird to stop cursing. But one day he snaps, grabs the parrot, and throws it in the freezer. He can still here the parrot kicking and squaking and cursing worse than he ever had while in the freezer, until the parrot abruptly stopped after a few minutes.

Somewhat surprised, the man opens up the freezer, and the parrot calmly hops onto his owner's shoulder and says perfectly calmly, ""I'm sorry about my foul language earlier, sir. I now realize the error of my ways, and don't need to be punished anymore.""

""Well, what caused you to have a change of heart so suddenly?""

""I saw the turkey in the freezer and don't want to end up like him, sir.""

Graphiite,"&gt;A priest hooks a huge fish. Helping him reel it in, a sailor says, ""Whoa, look at the size of that fucker!""  
""Hey, mind your language!"" says the priest.  
Embarrassed, the sailor thinks quickly and blurts out, ""Sorry father, but that's what this fish is called - it's a Fucker fish."" Accepting the explanation, the priest forgives the sailor and takes the fish back to church.

&gt;""Look at this huge fucker,"" says the priest, spotting the bishop.  
""Language, please! This is God's house,"" replies the bishop.  
""No, no - that's what this fish is called,"" says the priest.  
""Oh,"" says the bishop, scratching his chin. ""I could clean that fucker and we could have it for dinner"".


&gt;So the bishop takes the fish, cleans it, and brings it to the mother superior. ""Could you cook this fucker for dinner tonight?"" he asks her.  
""My, what language!"" she exclaims, clearly shocked.  
""No, sister that's what the fish is called - a fucker,"" says the bishop.  
Satisfied with the explanation, the mother superior says, ""Wonderful, I'll cook that fucker tonight - the Pope is coming for dinner!""


&gt;The fish tastes just great and the Pope asks where they got it.  
""Well, I caught the fucker!"" says the priest.  
""And I cleaned the fucker!"" says the bishop.  
""And I cooked the fucker!"" says the mother superior.  
The Pope stares at them for a minute with a steely gaze, leans back on his chair, takes off his cap, puts his feet up on the table, pours himself a whiskey and says, ""You know what? You cunts are alright"".

Edited for grammar and clarity.

Fantastic joke, nonetheless.

Two men and a woman are stranded on a lonely island after their cruiseship had sunk.

They think the worst, it could take a while before they can be rescued. They decide to settle. After searching through the debrie and exploring the island they found a fresh pond, many coconuts, made improvised weapons and builded a small shelter.

After a few days of settling, the men are feeling itchy and have urges. They decide to make a deal that they switch days for alone-time with the lady, starting from the next day. Because you know, everybody has urges and there are no people around too judge.
 
The first few days were great, the second week was *okay*, but after the third week it became unbearable and they eventually decided to burry her.

Kickmekicku,"I heard this like this.

This farmer bought A new rooster after his old one died. Well this rooster was fucking crazy right? He started going to town on these chickens and in 2 days every single chicken was pregnant. Well after the chickens wouldn't lay with him he went after the dog then the cows. And in a few days every animal on the farm was EXHAUSTED and just laid around breathing heavily.

Well the farmer went out one day to talk to the rooster and said. ""He man, if you keep going at it like this you're gunna kill yourself."" ""NAWWW ill be fine."" And he just fucked EVERYTHING. Well about a week later the farmer went to the barn and every-single animal was piled almost to the ceiling with the rooster on top, completely limp and with his tongue sticking out of his mouth. The farmer said ""we'll I guess he finally killed himself."" To which the rooster replied pointing into the air.. ""Shhhh, buzzards.""",null,2,c9i95x0,1cmqey,jokes,top_all,2

Jason wakes up at home with a raging hangover. He forces himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins and a glass of water on the side table.

He sits up and notices his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. Jason looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotless and clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins and notices a note on the table: ""Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to go shopping. Love You!""

He's mighty confused: why isn't he in trouble? He takes the aspirin and gets up.

When he gets to the kitchen, sure enough: there is a hot breakfast and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating.

""Good morning,"" Jason says. ""Son, what happened last night?""

His son says, ""Well, you came home around 3 a.m., drunk and delirious. You broke some furniture, puked in the hallway, and gave yourself a black eye when you stumbled into the door.""

Even more confused, Jason asks, ""So, why is mom being so incredibly nice to me?""

His son replies, ""Oh, that! Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your pants off, you said, 'Get your hands off me, bitch! I'm married!'""",null,11,c9gs9hn,1ch2y4,jokes,top_all,58

The flooding gets worse but the woman is still standing on her roof, now the water is up to her neck. A helicopter comes along, finds her, and offers to bring her to safety.

* The woman tells the man ""No thank you, I will be OK, God will save me.""

The woman dies on her rooftop in the storm and she goes to heaven. She asks God ""I was standing on that rooftop praying for hours, why didn't you save me?"" God says ""are you kidding? I sent you a televised warning, a truck, a motorboat and a helicopter.""

FisherKing22,"Here's a similar one:

A drunk white guy is driving along at night in the middle of rural Mississippi. By accident, he hits two black guys. One of them goes through the windshield, and the other bounces off the bumper and is sent flying down the road into a ditch.

And even after the 911 call, assuming he neglected to mention that his arm was off, when the officer arrived on the scene, he would have obviously noticed the missing arm and called for a paramedic before even talking to the lawyer.

He asks, ""What's wrong honey?""

Three friends decide they want to get into the Guinness book of records.

The first guy says 'Well, I can spit really far. Maybe I've got the furthest spit in the world.'

The second guy says 'My memory is pretty good. Maybe I can use that to get into the book.'

The third guy says 'Well, this is pretty embarrassing but my penis is really small. Like, really, really small. Maybe that will work.'

So they all head down to the offices of the Guinness book of records. The first guy goes in and half an hour later he's out grinning from ear ear.

'Yes! World's farthest spit! I'm in'

The second guy goes in. An hour later he emerges triumphant.

'Woohoo! Best memory in the world!'

Finally the third guy goes in. Fifteen minutes later he emerges in a foul mood.

'So,' his friends ask 'How did it go.'

'Who the fuck is goldenshower69?'

DameWigginsOfLee,"Three logicians walk into a bar.  The bartender asks, ""does anyone want a drink?""

The first logician says ""Yes!""

The second logician says ""Yes!""

The third logician says ""Yes!""

The bartender pours three beers. 

Then the first logician says ""However, it is not pursuant to these premises that such an individual is located in this establishment.""

[EDIT] Most commenters below appear to have misunderstood this version of the joke.  The bartender assumes that 'anyone' ranges only over the people she is addressing (as most people do in conversation).  However, the logicians have interpreted it as ranging over, well, anyone.

Gunswick, farsightxr20, EatingSteak and meshugga have all made the same mistake.  You cannot in fact deduce that the first logician wants a beer - only that he knows of the existence of someone who does.  Indeed, his final line strongly suggests that he, personally, doesn't want one.  Most of these commenters are correct though that the second and third logician may not want drinks, and may not previously have known of anyone who does.

Second one knows (because he's a logistician) that the first guy wants beer, knows that he, himself, wants beer, but still doesn't know what the third guy wants.

Third guy knows the other two would have said ""no"" if either didn't want beer, knows that he, himself wants beer, and now has enough information to confidently state that yes, in fact, all 3 men want beer.

The Concord had to make an emergency landing in Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. Two buddies were upon the wing refueling it when Frank notices a sticker besides the refueling hatch. It reads, ""Pure Alcohol Jet Fuel Only."" He asks his friend Rick, ""Aye, there's alcohol in this fuel! I say we take some and try later when we get home."" His friend Richard agrees to the idea.

About 10pm, the phone rings at Richard's house.
Frank: ""Hey Richard, it's Frank. I'm curious, but did you try that Alcohol Jet fuel yet?""
Richard: ""Yeap, I did.""
Frank: ""Well, what happened?""
Richard: ""Well, I took one drink and me arms started to go up.""
Frank: ""Yeap, that's what happened to me too. What happened next?""

IronOhki,"So the old farmer decided his son was of age. The brothel in town had a tradition that a young man could have his first evening with a lady for only $1. So the farmer gives his boy $1 and sends him to town. 

Well the boy makes it to the brothel. He gets welcomed by a talented older lady, pays his dollar and figures out what to do right quick. So impressed was the lady that she said, ""boy, tell you what. You do that again and I'll give you your money back!"" Considering it was a win-win scenario, the boy got right back to work.

After two rounds and a load of confidence, the kid wasn't ready to head back. In fact, word of the young man's talent had the whole house in an uproar. He went looking for more fun to have, walking in on a gorgeous young lady who was about to entertain an old prospector.  

The girl was about to ditch the prospector for the boy, but the older man wasn't having it. ""Look kid,"" he said taking him aside. ""I got a crate of ducks out there. If you leave this girl to me, you can take a duck back to your farm.""

So a few hours after setting off, the old farmer sees his son coming back with a duck under his arm. ""Boy!"" shouts the dad, ""I thought I told you to go get yerself laid, not go poultry shoppin'!"" 

The boy replies. ""Relax, Pop, I got a fuck for a buck, a buck for a fuck and a duck for ducking a fuck!"" ",null,33,c8w945m,1acnhn,jokes,top_all,115

The answer apparently satisfied little Johnny's curiosity for the moment, and they both went about their day.  
Later on, Johnny asked his mom, ""Mommy, can I see your little sponge again?""  As she was a little busy, she replied, ""I think i must have dropped it, Why don't you see if you can find it somewhere."" 
Now little Johnny was on a mission... he searched upstairs and downstairs, inside all the rooms, even the garage.  His search took him outside, and his mother was relieved to have some peace and quiet for a moment.
A few minutes later, a very excited Johnny ran into the house, up to his mother and shouted, ""Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! I found your sponge!!!"" She chuckled and said, ""Oh really?  Where?""

&gt;Two beggars are sitting on a sidewalk in Rome. One is wearing a large cross, and has a picture of the Virgin Mary. The other is wearing a kippah and tzitzit, and has a beard and side curls. The first is getting tons of money, but the second is hardly getting any. A priest comes to the second beggar, and says ""you know, you'd probably get more money if you weren't so openly Jewish. People see the two of you, and choose to support their religion by giving to the Christian beggar."" The first beggar turns to the second and says ""Hey, look who's trying to teach the Goldstein brothers marketing""

-

&gt;Two Jewish guys are walking when one notices a sign on a Catholic church that says ""Convert to Christianity, and we'll give you $100."" The one says to the other, ""should we do it??"" The other says ""NO!! Are you crazy?"" The first guy replies ""Hey, a hundred dollars is a hundred dollars... I'm gonna do it.""

George W Bush and Osama Bin Laden are sitting on the couch together, drinking some beer and watching television, when Star Trek: The Original Series comes on.

""Oh this is a good one! Y'ever seen it, 'sama? You'll love it!""

They watch a few episodes when Bin Laden turns to W.

""Hm... It is very strange, this ""Star Trek."" There is something I do not understand...""

""Well what's that UBL? They fly around all space adventury-like. Pretty simple."" replies Bush.

""Yes, yes... But you see, in this Star Trek, they have black people, yes? And they have white people, and they even have latino and Asian people, yes?""

""Yea, what's your point ye gosh dern terrrist?"" George asks.

""Well, why in this Star Trek, are there no Muslims?""

""Because,"" replies W, taking a sip of his beer, ""it's set in the *future.*""


************

George W Bush is hanging out with the Queen.

""Say, Queenie, ye sure run a tight ship 'round here, I'll tellya that. Howdya do it?""

""Well,"" replies her majesty, ""I only surround myself with the brightest minds. Come, I will demonstrate. Oh, Tony? Come here Tony.""

Tony Blair comes around the corner, and the Queen poses him the following question: ""Tony, if your father has a son and your mother has a son, but you have no brother, then who is it?""

""Why, my liege, that would be me.""

She turns back to Bush with a smug smile.

""Well I'll be derned!"" he exclaims. ""That Tony's one smart fella, ain't he? I gotta try that one on my own boys.""

Returning to the White House, Bush immediately calls on Donald Rumsfeld. ""Rummy! Get yer sorry butt in here you slimey bastard! Now Rummy, I gots a question for ya. Now, if your pappy's got himself a son, right? And your mama, she's got her a son too, but you see, you ain't got no brother, then who's the fuck is he?""

""Well, sure..."" replies Rummy, mumbling something about ""known unknowns"" before finally conceding he doesn't know. ""But I will get right on it, sir!""

He immediately calls a cabinet meeting, and they discuss it for hours. Finally, Dick Cheney raises his hand, ""I know! Let's ask Colin Powell, he'll know for sure!""

Everyone agrees, and they rush off to find Powell.

The Cabinet surrounds Powell in the White House Situation Room. ""Ok, Colin,"" says Rumsfeld, ""this is a matter of national security. Now, if your father has a child--a boy--and your mother does too, but you *don't have a brother,* then who is the boy?""

Colin takes a deep breath. ""*Sigh...* I really am surrounded by idiots. The answer is me, dumbass.""

Before he can say another word, the Cabinet runs off to find the president.

""Mr. President! I am pleased to report we have an answer for you,"" announces Rumsfeld.

""Well shoot, let's hear it then!""

""Ok, sir--if your father has a son, and your mother has a son, and you don't have a brother, it's.... Colin Powell!""

George Bush met The Queen, and he turns round and says: ""As I'm the

I'm thinking that it should be a Kingdom""

The Queen replies ""I'm sorry Mr Bush, but to be a Kingdom, you have to
have a King in charge - and you're not a King.""

George Bush thought a while and then said: ""How about a Principality
then?"",

To which the Queen replied ""Again, to be a Principality you have to be a
Prince - and you're not a Prince, Mr Bush"".

Bush thought long and hard and came up with ""How about an Empire then?""

The Queen, getting a little annoyed by now, replies ""Sorry again, Mr
Bush, but to be an Empire you must have an Emperor in charge - and you
are not an Emperor.""

you're doing quite nicely as a Country"".",null,5,c8qttgq,19ra3t,jokes,top_all,41

The first priest approached the window. ""Young lady, I would like three pickets to titsburg.""

He completely lost his composure and fled.

The second priest goes to the window. ""Young lady, I would like three tickets to Pittsburgh and I would like the change in nipples and dimes.""

Mortified, he too fled.

""Morons...."" the third priest mutters and moves to the window. ""Young lady, I would like three tickets to Pittsburgh and I would like the change in nickels and dimes. And, if you insist on dressing like that, when you get to the pearly gates, St. Finger's going to shake his Peter at you.""

I actually have more of a problem with fellow whites pretending they aren't racist at at all and condemning anything to do with it than I do with the fat dumb black lady that calls me a honky cracker to my face.

streetwalker,"this is a variation of  an old gag told by flight engineers. Prior to modern technology, there were runway markers that tell the pilot where, given the weight, payload, wingspan and other characteristics of an airplane, the optimal point to pull back on the stick is in order to take off. All this needed to be calculated before take-off, so the pilot knew which marker is the take-off point.  

The joke is, there is a new flight engineer in the jump-seat, and the pilot enters the cockpit drunk, so he can't fly. No worries, he has the best co-pilot. When, the co-pilot  turns around and smiles to say hello,  it becomes apparent that he is nearly blind with these thick, coke-bottle glasses on. At this point the person in the jump seat is pretty worried - how can he see where the marker is? but the pilot says to relax - he's the best co-pilot.  They pickup speed down the runway for talk-off, and as they pass the proper marker the pilot lets out an loud sucking gasp, and the co-pilot pulls back on the stick. 

You have to tell this joke in person, for the sucking-gasp sound to have effect, and it has to be told from the perspective of the person in the jump-seat.

This stereotypical hippy is just riding along one day when his bicycle chin breaks and he's forced along to the side of the road.

Along comes a nice man in a Porsche, who was recently just as poor. Wanting to pay it forward, he offers to help take the bike to the hippie's destination.

Of course, his tiny sports car doesn't have nearly the space for the banged up bike. The man things of a better idea though. 

""How about you tie your bike to the back of my car, and I'll give you a tow? If I go too fast, just honk and I'll stop.""

The hippy leaps at the chance, and they drive off for a couple of miles. 

The man pulls up to a stoplight, and right next to him is a troublemaker in a Lamborghini. They start revving their engines, and a race ensures as the light turns green.

They start reaching high, way high speeds of 80 mph, 90 mph, almost 100 mph, when they race past a copper.

The cop radios in to Dispatch: 

""Dispatch, you'll never believe what I just saw. A Porsche was racing a Lamborghini down Main Street at 100 mph, and a hippy on a bike was honking his horn trying to pass them!""

Topochicho,"I have heard it before, but slightly different. Here's a quick version of the joke since I am on my phone:
The bicyclist is an old man trying to pass the Porshe in the bicycle lane at a stop light, the driver is a dick &amp; is in the bike lane.
The cyclists stops his bike &amp; begins to straddle walk the bike past the car for fear of loosing his balance if he tries to ride by. The driver sees the cyclist as he gets to the door, &amp; not liking him so close,  honks his horn, scares the old man &amp; he loses his balance falling against the car. The cyclist &amp; driver start cursing at each other &amp; as soon as the light turns green the driver takes off like a bat out of hell.
Queue sequence of driver looking in mirror, seeing the cyclist, speeding up and looking in mirror again.
At 110mph the driver was really beginning think he had lost his mind, and the old man had decided that no matter what he was never ever going to wear suspenders again.
The cop that saw them go by, called it in &amp; told the station to send a deputy to the old folks home to arrest the staff, because he just saw a Porshe go by at 110mph &amp; old man Jennings was on his bike behind it flashing is little light and honking his horn to pass. So, whatever drugs they're giving those people up there can't be legal. 

5 minutes later when the cop caught up to the Porsche and the cyclist, he found them on the side of the road, 1 man performing CPR on the other man.
After the cop called for an ambulance the old man explained to him about his suspender being caught on the guys mirror. But, it all finally came to a stop after the long corner they had just gone around.
The driver was having a fit because the cyclist was keeping up, but when they went around the corner it had slung the cyclist really wide, &amp; the driver had a heart attack when he realized that he was being passed on the outside in a corner.

MeAndLazarus,"Imagine this joke being retold, but with one seemingly small factor changed: the big guy is white. Maybe it is equally funny to you and it's certainly possible that it's been told that way before. Yet for some reason, here it's not presented that way. It's not even presented in race-neutral language. Somehow, race has come to be *explicitly* mentioned here. Truthfully, if we wanted to tell this joke with two white characters, **race probably wouldn't even be mentioned at all**. We need to explicitly present the man as non-white in order to have us bring other races into these jokes. 

So now let's ask: why *is* he explicitly presented as black? Is it because black people are rumored to have larger penises? Or because we have an image from sports media of the physically impressive black man? Could be. But the big guy states his remarkable height and penis size anyway - either way he informs us that he's a large individual, and we have no trouble imagining abnormally large white individuals such as, to pick from popular culture, Andre the Giant. 

Is it, then, because black people have historically been presented as being oversexualized and animalistic (which has actually been part of the reason why, in addition to a longer flaccid penis, we even have the myth of the hugely endowed black man), because black people have long been feared as rapists (going back to times when white men felt the need to 'protect' white women from them), because black people have been characterized in the media as violent criminals and scary hoodlums, or **because it is easier identifying with a white person being so fearfully afraid of a black person**? This is not to say people of color wouldn't necessarily also tell this joke with the races constructed as such - most of us in the West, regardless of race, read the same newspapers, see the same movies, buy into the same advertisements, and hence belong to similar ideological backgrounds. This is increasingly so as the world becomes globalized. 

It *could* be a coincidence, but since it's ultimately about the (homosexual, interestingly) victimization of a white person by a hypersexual, monstrously-sized black person, I think we can argue that it might not be. This joke doesn't overtly present itself as being about race, and yet race is present. It's up to us as creators and consumers of culture to analyze our words, the small bits that whiz by, almost unnoticed, and to think: what are they *actually* saying?",null,40,c8kr6u4,193oue,jokes,top_all,66

Because of this, there isn't a universal claim being made about assholes, so the gentlemen is wrong to infer that this statement says anything about him in particular.

Abbott &amp; Costello organize the MTV music video library

Abbott: Look sharp, Costello. I had to pull some strings to get us this job organizing tapes in the music video library.

Costello: Some of these singers and songs today have pretty confusing names.

Abbott: That's alright, boy. I know the songs. You pull the videotapes, and I'll tell you which song each one is, and who does it.

Costello: And I'll write it down. Let's start with this Tracey Chapman video. Tell me the name of the song.

Abbott: Give me one reason.

Costello: I told you, so I can write it down. Now, tell me which Tracey Chapman song this is, please.

Abbott: Give me one reason.

Costello: We're 6 months behind on the rent. You need a better reason?

Abbott: I'm telling you man!

Costello: Hey, don't get mad at me. Forget this video, I'll save it for later. Here's a bunch of Alanis Morissette tapes, but they're all mixed up. Which song is this one?

Abbott: You oughta know.

Costello: I don't know the names of the songs. Which song is this!?

Abott: You oughta know!

Costello: But I DON'T know! What about this other Alanis Morissette video?

Abbott: It's Ironic.

Costello: It's ironic that I don't know the name of the video?

Abbott: You heard me, it's Ironic.

Costello: I don't think it's ironic!

Abbott: I'm telling you, it's Ironic!

Costello: Let's go back to the first Morissette tape.

Abbott: You oughta know, Costello.

Costello: Do you know the name of this Alanis Morissette song?

Abbott: Certainly.

Costello: Then plase tell me so I can write it down!

Abbott: You oughta know.

Costello: You say I ought to know, but I don't know. Now THAT'S ironic!

Abbott: No, that's the second Alanis video!

Costello: I got two videos, and I don't know either of 'em. Forget it. What's the name of this Mase video?

Abbott: What you want.

Costello: The name of this Mase song.

Abbott: What you want.

Costello: I want the name of the Mase song.

Abbott: What you want.

Costello: The name of the Mase song! You oughta know.

Abbott: Now you're talking about Alanis Morissette again.

Costello: Let me guess, it's ironic.

Abbott: Now, that's the first thing you've said right all day.

Costello: I don't even know what I'm talking about!! Can you hand me that tape next to you?

Abbott: Of course.

Costello: What song is on that tape, Abbott?

Abbott: I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

Costello: That tape there in your hand.

Abbott: I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

Costello: That tape there.

Abbott: I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

Costello: Why don't you look in your HAND? Okay. Forget the song, was that video made by a group?

Abbott: Of course it was.

Costello: And that group gets royalty payments from the record company, right?

Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not? They're entitled to it.

Costello: So, you know what group gets the royalty payments?

Abbott: Sure. U2.

Costello: Me too?

Abbott: U2, Costello.

Costello: I get the royalty payments?

Abbott: Of course not, you're not in the group.

Costello: I'm not in the group?

Abbott: No.

Costello: But you know what group gets the royalty payments?

Abbott: Certainly! U2.

Costello: I'm not in the group, but I get payments.

Abbott: You do not!

Costello: But you know who does.

Abbott: Of course. U2!

Costello: I'd really like to be writing some of this stuff down. Do you know the name of the group in this video here?

Abbott: No Doubt.

Costello: Oh, I don't doubt YOU know it, but I wonder whether I'LL ever know it. Can you tell me the name of the song?

Abbott: Don't Speak.

Costello: Don't speak?

Abbott: You heard me, Costello. Don't Speak. Ready for the next video? Costello? Costello!

Costello: You told me don't speak!

Abbott: That's right, Don't Speak. Ready for the next one? Costello? Why aren't you talking?

Costello: You oughta know.

Abbott &amp; Costello: Alanis Morissette!

Abbott: Why are you getting so excited?

Costello: Music affects me that way sometimes. I have a video here by En Vogue. Can you tell me its title?

Abbott: Never gonna get it.

Costello: Why am I never gonna get it? Give me one reason.

Abbott: That's Tracey Chapman, we're not talking about her!

Costello: I'm not talking about Tracey Chapman either. You oughta know.

Abbot &amp; Costello: Alanis Morissette!

Costello: Since we're naming so many female singers, can youtell me the title of this Sheryl Crow video?

Abbott: If it makes you happy.

CostelloL I would be ECSTATIC! Here's the last one. Which Spice Girls song is this?

Abbott: Stop.

Costello: I'm not sure we ever started!

Abbott: You mean you haven't written any of this down?

Costello: How could I write any of it down? I ask for a title, and you tell me it's what you want, and it's ironic I still haven't found what I'm looking for! Give me one reason! You too! Don't speak! Stop! No doubt I'm ever gonna get it if it makes you happy! Because you oughta know! -- ALANIS MORISSETTE!! -- Well, I've had it!I want you to quit playing games!

Abbott: What's that you just said?

Chaz_Eru,"It's a similar joke to the International Mime competition. Better told when you can act it out but I'll try to convey it here.

It was the finals at the annual international mime competition. The two nations represented were France and Canada (a Quebecer of course). The competition works as a conversation with pantomime only. If one makes any noise or takes too long they are disqualified.

The coin toss gave the Frenchman the first go. He held up one finger. The Canadian held up two fingers. The Frenchman immediately replied with three fingers to which the Canadian vehemently replied with a fist to the air. After a moment the Frenchman gave the ""okay"" gesture. The Canadian replied by making a wedge with his hands and pushed them forward. The Frenchman stopped ""uh"". A noise was uttered and the Frenchman lost.

Back in Paris the French are drowning their sorrows in wine. ""Pierre. How could you lose?"" ""Well I began with unity! So he replied with duality. I showed him the trinity. And he proclaimed Power to the People! I said that was an okay response. And then he did this"" Mimicking the winning gesture. ""WHAT IS THIS?""

Back in Quebec they're celebrating drinking their Molson ""How DID you beat that old Frenchman, eh?"" ""Well he said he'd shove a finger up my ass so I said I'd shove two up his. He upped it to three fingers in the ass so I said I'd shove my whole fist up his. He worried that his was too small. I offered to widen it a little.""",null,8,c8bph7i,184qb5,jokes,top_all,47

bakchodminator,"Actually this is not a Joke.

This is a true story; the actual conversation though was between:[Kalidas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa) a great Sanskrit writer and his wife to be Vidyotma.

In this case Vidyotma was learned one. 

**True Side Story**: Vidyotma was a princess, she was very intelligent and proud of it. When her age came her father decided to get her married. But she wanted she would only marry some one who is intelligent than her. 


So she created a marriage challenge that who ever will beat her in intelligence; she will marry him. 


Wise men from all part of the kingdom started their journey to visit the competition. There was a group of these 3 Pundits who saw this guy who was cutting a tree branch on which he was sitting. They asked him 'is he out of his mind he will end up hurting himself'; to which the he replied that it took him long time for him to climb this tree this is the fastest way he will come down. 


They all got an Idea. On the way they asked him to keep his mouth shut as he cant speak Sanskrit, they will do the translation. he did what they said.


[the joke part]


The princess was impressed and they got married. On the wedding night he saw a camel out side palace and starting speaking 'utra' how ever the correct Sanskrit is 'Ustra' seeing this he is not Sanskrit literate princess kicked him out.


Because of this Kalidas studied and worked hard and wrote 3 Great Epics which to this date are one of the best epics written in Sanskrit. 


When he returned to his house, his wife asked the following famous question, 



""Asti Kashchit Vaag-visheshaH?''
( asti = is; kashchit = when, as in questioning; vAg = speech, visheshaH = expert; i.e | ""are you now an expert in speaking''). (have you got the linguistics degree?)

In response to her question, Kalidasa wrote three works of exceptional literary beauty, all three poems -- starting with the three words of her question:

With Asti = asti-uttarasyaam dishi = Kumara-sambhavam (epic poem)

With Kashchit = kashchit-kaantaa = Meghdoot (lyric poem)

With Vaag = vaagarthaaviva = Raghuvansha (epic poem)


the three books starting with the 3 words:

with asti = asti-uttarasyAm dishi = Kumara-sambhavam ( epic) 

with kashchit = kashchit-kAntA = Meghdoot ( poetrय्) 

with vAg = vAgarthAviva = Raghuvansha ( epic)",null,8,c8buiac,184qb5,jokes,top_all,13

username-ugh,"One of my favorite jokes of all time. I almost posted it earlier this week. However, I heard it as Pope vs Rabbi (and think it is a bit funnier).

Here's the relevant part (of course this is a physical joke, that's what really makes it work).

The Pope makes a semi-circle over his head.
The Rabbi points at the ground.
The Pope raises one finger.
The Rabbi raises 3 fingers.
The Pope does the communion ceremony.
The Rabbi eats an apple.

Later the Pope's chief Cardinals and Bishops gather round. ""Father,"" they say, ""we got most of what happened, but can you explain the finer points."" 
""Certainly,"" says the Pope. ""First, I said this is the Vatican, home to all Catholics on Earth. The Rabbi reminded me that we must all deal with Hell which is below us. I then said that we believe in one God. And the Rabbi reminded me that of the three Abrahamic traditions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, we all believe in the same one God. Then I said, by using the Eucharist, that we believe in Jesus the Christ who died for our sins. But, the Rabbi reminded me that we must all deal with Original Sin. That's when I decided that the Jews could stay.

Later in a delicatessan across from St. Peter's the Rabbi was tucking into a nice pastrami with his chiefs and advisors. 

(now this next part has to be said in your best New York Jewish voice)

""Teacher,"" they said, ""What gives?""
The Rabbi shrugged and explained. ""The Pope said this is the Vatican. The Jews are outta here. I said we ain't leaving. He said you got one week. I said give us three. Then he ate his lunch, and I ate my lunch...""",null,2,c8c0xuk,184qb5,jokes,top_all,2

Kidding aside, nice joke.

EDIT: Got bored, decided to try my hand at updating it:

&gt; A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in Montana when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.

&gt; The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""

&gt; Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""

&gt; The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Macbook Air, tethers it to his Galaxy S3 and uses its built-in GPS function to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to a NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.

&gt; The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...

&gt; Within seconds, he receives an email on his Android that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Macbook Air, after a few minutes, receives a response.

&gt; Finally, he ~~prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer~~ simply opens the spreadsheet on his laptop, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""

&gt; ""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.

&gt; He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.

&gt; Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""

&gt; The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

&gt; ""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Bud.

&gt; ""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""

&gt; ""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter. This is a herd of sheep.”

&gt; “Now give me back my dog.”

Note: Galaxy S3 instead of iPhone 5, because the jailbreak (and thus tether) for the latter just came out yesterday.

EDIT 2: Hi guys and girls of reddit! I forgot that you can pay for tethering plans with an iPhone, which is probably what the Congressperson from this joke would do (spend as much tax dollars as possible). My bad! :)",null,67,c89rjd2,17xmbn,jokes,top_all,367

EatDiveFly,"LOL!  I love audience participation jokes.  Especially one that involves a mark.

Two variations on this:
1)

The joke describes pig fucking.  You go into detail about how you have to ride them first and you put small saddle on them.  You tie it tightly around the abdomen, then you jump on and you put your feet in the..um.. what are they called?  Usually somebody chimes in ""stirrups?"" to which you respond.. Oh, so you've done this before?

2)
This one tells the story of a (usually gay) couple playing a game where one has to guess what item is being pushed into his anus.  He goes to the fridge and gets a cucumber, puts it in, and the guy guesses ""cucumber"".  Yay, good for you. Lets try another.  He then pulls out a strawberry and tries that. same thing.  So then he goes back to the fridge and gets one of those small round things.. um.. what are they called.. ?  invariably someone will offer an answer (the funniest i heard was rutabaga) to which you respond, ""oh so you've played this before""

Now of course the more you embellish these jokes the better.  Really bring the audience in with details. Give the pigs names, describe the locations, describe the reactions of guessing the fruit/vegetable correctly etc.

Three flies are trapped in a jar, two female and one male, after awhile one of the woman flies asks the male fly how to get out and the fly says ""fuck me and I'll tell you"" she she does and he says ""you have to fly around the top of the jar, dive down, then pop, you are out"" so she does his exact instructions but smashes in to the jar and dies. After some time the second female fly asks in desperation ""how do I get out of here?"" the male fly says ""fuck me and I'll tell you"" she does and says again ""you have to fly around the top of the jar, dive down, then pop, you are out"" she follows his exact instructions and hits the bottom of the jar and dies.

Th4ab,"Years ago, a famous golfer was invited by the king of Saudi Arabia to play in a golf tournament. He accepted the invitation, and the king flew his private jet over to the United States to pick up the pro. They played golf for several days, and enjoyed a good time. As the golfer was getting on the plane to return to the United States, the king stopped him and said, ""I want to give you a gift for coming all this way and making this time so special. Anything you want. What could I get you?"" 

Ever the gentleman, the golfer replied, ""Oh, please; don't get me anything. You've been a gracious host. I've had a wonderful time. I couldn't ask for anything more."" 

The king was adamant. He said, ""No, I insist on giving you something so you will always remember your journey to our country."" 

When the golfer realized that the king was resolute, he said, ""Okay, fine. I collect golf clubs. Why don't you give me a golf club?"" 

He boarded the plane, and on his flight back home, he couldn't help wondering what kind of golf club the king might give him. He imagined that it might be a solid gold putter with his name engraved on it. Or maybe it would be a sand wedge studded with diamonds and jewels. After all, this would be a gift from the oil-rich king of Saudi Arabia. 

When the golfer got home, he watched the mail and the delivery services every day, to see if his golf club had come yet. Finally, several weeks later, he received a certified letter from the king of Saudi Arabia. The U.S. professional thought that rather strange. Where's my golf club? he wondered. He opened the envelope, and to his surprise, inside he discovered a deed to a five-hundred-acre golf course in America. ",null,3,c85s1b4,17i3f5,jokes,top_all,29

I'd rewrite it with keeping the buttocks out of the joke until the end. Just state in the middle of the joke that the doctor says the husband is a perfect match for the skin graft then move on to them post-surgery, waking up next to each other in adjoining hospital beds. 

As the wife is laying in bed thankful that her husband had made the sacrifice to donate his skin to save her face, she turns to him and says: ""Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.""

To which he replied, while laying on his stomach, ""My darling, think nothing of it. I'll get all the thanks I'll ever need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek.""

Your use of this joke was an accident and should not have been ""punished"" as it was. At the same time though, I don't think you appreciate the extent of the matter at hand. This has less to do with money and more to do with intellectual property. Sure, on reddit, this is routinely broken, but if this were to happen in the real world and the joke you used..reached high places, wouldn't it suck for the original person if everyone thought this OP made it? Again, I don't agree with most of the dicks who commented, but I hope you realize that intellectual property, no matter how trivial, should be respected (above that of piracy of original content which does not actually take credit for the work it steals).

Luke_I_Am_Your_Otter,"Since this thread has turned into a debate on racism, I just wanted to say that i think 90% of all jokes are prejudiced towards some group of people whether they're about gender, sexuality, race, religion, etc.  And I think there's a reason for that.  Joking about serious issues in society makes people feel better about it and like it doesn't hold as much power over them.  My husband is in the military and I don't think that landmines ambushing people is funny or ok, but when you make a joke about it, some of the fear I have goes away.  That's the point of jokes.  They provide you with an escape, even if for just a brief second.  I don't think that any topic should be off limits to joke about.

E1337Kat,"I really want this joke to be funny, but it isn't logically(though of course, no joke is truely logical). Allow me to explain why, as a trans woman this isn't all that funny.

First of all, one does not just go to a clinic to have the who sex change thing right then... at least not yet. It is a long and arduous process that take in the shortest amount of time, a year, but in most all cases it is a multi-year process.

Second of all, Trans* women are not ""new"" women. They have always been women since they have first realized what gender is, and it is not a mental thing, but a physical thing. I myself did not start transitioning till about a year ago, but I have always known I was actually a girl, but due to societal pressures and cultural notions toward the subject, I have always been too afraid to admit it to others, and myself at times.

Lastly, if the joke as written had been correct, those women(and men, cause they exist too!) would totally not have sex with you. You are just there for the easy lay, and these are women, the same as most all other women, would be disgusted with that kind of act... 

In conclusion, This ""joke"" follows too illogically in all of it's facets to be funny. It could not ever be a good sex tip, and isolates an entire group of human beings to be made fun of, and is on par with racism, anti-semitism, and other highly offensive forms of prejudices.

A man is driving penguins to the zoo and his truck breaks down on the highway. He has to repair it but it's hot outside and he knows that the penguins won't survive the 3-4 hours it will take him under the hot sun to repair the truck.

Luckily, he sees a farmer driving by with an empty truck that looks like it can fit all of the penguins. He signals the farmer over and says, ""Hey buddy, can you do me a favor? I need to take these penguins to the zoo and my truck broke down. Can you take them for me? Your truck looks like it can fit them. Here's $100 for your trouble,"" and the farmer replies, ""Sure thing!""

3 hours later the man is still repairing his truck on the side of the road when he sees the farmer coming back with all of the penguins still in the truck. The farmer pulls over and the man asks him, ""Why didn't you take the penguins to the zoo?""

The man replies, ""I did, but I had some of the $100 left over so now I'm taking them to the cinema!""",null,2,c7yxddm,16raua,jokes,top_all,17

GeekyCivic,"I heard a joke years ago that went something like this:

A priest, a lawyer and electrician are on a plane to a third-world country, upon arriving their identities are mistaken for criminals wanted for capital crimes. 

When disembarking the plane they are immediately detained by local authorities and taken directly to prison. The language barrier between the men and their captors makes it impossible for them to prove their true identities. 

Weeks pass, the men are disheartened and it is now their time for execution, death by electric chair.

First man to be executed is the priest. The priest is shackled into the chair, the spongy thing on his head is fastened down, the executioner throws the switch... but nothing happens! The priest proclaims it is by the grace of god he is saved from being wrongfully executed and the guards release him.

Next is the lawyer, he is shackled into the chair, same routine. The executioner throws the switch... again nothing happens! The lawyer declares his full faith in the law of the land was what saved him from a wrongful execution.

Finally, it's the electricians turn. He gets shackled into the chair, spongy thing fastened down onto his head, but before they got the hood over his head, he looks over and follows the power cord to the outlet and shouts, ""I found the problem!! The chair isn't plugged in!!!""

The first Welshman walks up to him and says ""St. George wore frilly pink knickers.""
""Interesting, I didn't know that,"" said the unfazed Englishman.
Flustered by his failed attempt at angering the Englishman, the first Welshman went back to his friends.
The second Welshman walks up to the Englishman and says ""St. George loved to take it in the arse.""
""Hmm, I had never heard that before. Quite interesting,"" said the still calm Englishman.
The second Welshman walks back to his friends, and the third Welshman approaches.
""St. George was Welsh,"" says the third Welshman.
The Englishman replies ""I know, that's what those other two cunts were trying to tell me.""",null,0,c7tim79,166eec,jokes,top_all,3

He's being very abrasive, asking they same question over and over again. ""do you see the women in the window. Do you see her. The women in the window.""

I'm going to kill her"", just sort of spills out of his mouth. It's going to be a 44-magnum pistol, he tells me.

""The way I see it"" the bear says ""is that you could pull down your pants and let me fuck you...or I'll tear you apart and eat you while you're still alive enough to watch me.""

The man turned around, pulled down his pants, and the bear had his way with him.

The next day the man was pissed.  He took his gun and limped off back into the woods, determined the find the bear.  Shortly after arriving, he spied the bear near a brook.  He took aim and, before he could shoot, the bear vanished behind a clump of trees.  A few moments later...tap tap tap.  The man turned and saw the bear behind him again.

""The way I see it"" the bear says ""is that you could pull down your pants and let me fuck you...or I'll tear you apart and eat you while you're still alive enough to watch me.""

The next morning the man was pissed.  He spent the night rubbing tucks pads on his ass, he had to use one of his wife's maxipads in his tightie whities.  He took every gun in the house and headed into the woods before sun rise.  This would be the day that he had his revenge.  He rigged wires to trap the bear, set bear traps in every location he could think.  He set them with steak and chicken.  As the sun came up, he found a spot where he would see if the bear came around.  Soon, he saw his foe.  Taking aim with his gun, he almost had a perfect shot.  Almost...and then the bear vanished.  Moments later...tap tap tap.

A grandfather was taking his grandson fishing one day. While driving to the lake the grandfather grabbed a beer out of the cooler and popped the top.

""Grandpa, grandpa, can I have a drink of your beer?""

""Well, let me ask you a question first. If you pull your pecker down is it long enough to touch your asshole?""

""No, sir.""

""Well you can't have any of grandpa's beer until you're old enough that it will.""

A little while later, grandpa takes out a cigar and lights it up.

""Grandpa, grandpa, can I taste your cigar?""

""Well, I'll ask you again. If you pull your pecker down is it long enough to touch your asshole?""

""No, sir.""

""Like I said before, you can't have any of grandpa's cigar either until you are old enough that it will.""

A few miles later, the grandson reaches in his pocket and pulls out some cookies in a ziplock baggie.

""Yes, sir.""

And what else did Pétain know? He had been the French commander at the Battle of Verdun, one of the most insanely deadly battles of WWI. Over 700,000 soldiers died for a town you'd probably never have heard of if it weren't for the battle, including nearly 380,000 French.

babyiknow,"Why Latvian jokes you ask? Because for many centuries Latvia (and Estonia to the North and Lithuania to a slightly lesser extent) was invaded and occupied by Germany, Sweden, Russia, hell even Poland.  They would come in, rape and pillage, then sit around and impose their will and culture.  Meanwhile all the poor Latvians ever wanted to do is go berry and mushroom hunting in peace! They are pretty depressed as a society from what I hear. But on the bright side I think all the raping made their gene pool awesome or something because they are BEAUTIFUL people along with Estonia.  More supermodels per capita than anywhere else.  And while they are not fighters, they found their strength in massive peaceful protests in the late 80's(or early 90's?). Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians once formed a chain of people singing and holding hands running almost the entire length of their countries North to South!

She agrees and looks several years younger.  After getting several ""you look so young"" compliments, she gets into a habit of getting people to guess her age.  So she walks into a video store and says, ""if you can guess my age, I'll give you $100.""  Everyone guesses and no one gets it right.  She repeats this again at a movie theater and no one guesses her age.  When she try's it at a McDonalds, a man says that he can tell a woman's age by touching her boobs.  She agrees and oddly enough he guesses her age.  When she asks him how he did it he replies, ""I was behind you in the movie theater.""

TL;DR man tricks woman into giving him $100 and to allow him to touch her boobs.",null,0,c7emijx,14ljrz,jokes,top_all,3

A man recently marries a woman who both claim to be virgins. The man is insecure about his penis size so everytime they have sex the man would request for the light to be turned off and he would use a dildo instead.

al0newestand,"Let's see if we can tweak this joke too improve it!  Let's take the first sentence.  ""A guy marries this woman.""  It's okay to be ambiguous and want to get to the punchline of the joke quickly, but this comes off as lazy!  Let's try something that gives this character some life and makes him real.  Let's call him Archibald.

A man named Archibald is ""celebrating"" his 49th birthday.

  Now, it's not necessary to flesh him out *this* much, but we've established a couple of things already just in that one sentence!  Archibald is a ""nerdy"" name, 49 is a terrifying birthday, and the use of quotation marks around ""celebrating"" lets us know that Archibald is not happy!  

A man named Archibald is ""celebrating"" his 49th birthday.  Well, he would be celebrating, but his idea of a celebration by now was a one man game of Russian Roulette.

Now what I've done *there* was bring in a darker sense of humor, and downplay it by informing you Archibald wasn't *actually* playing Russian Roulette.  Now, in practice I'd recommend going one route or the other.  You don't want anyone calling you a pussy for not sticking to your guns!  

Now, for this second sentence of the original post.  We're in comma splice territory here, but not only that, you don't want to just jump right into small dick town!  The biggest problem is that there's nothing joining these two ideas together.  A man can still get married if he has a tiny tallywacker!  This could be solved with specifying that his dick is too small *too satisfy her* or something more savoir faire like, ""unfortunately, he's unable to satisfy her in bed.""  People are smarter than you think, they get the idea!

Then, out of nowhere, Archibald hits the romantic lottery with the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.  The only problem is...

Then you need a teensie bit of build-up here.  Archibald and... Margarite go a year without sex due to Archibald's crippling fear of disappointing his new wife.  One day, he finds an abnormally large pickle in the jar and has a flash of inspiration.  For years, day in and day out, his wife just cannot get enough.  Archibald gets to make his wife happy, so he's happy.  Even if the two never actually have sex.

Now, ""what the hell is that, are you using a pickle on me.""  That's a statement.  She doesn't *sound* very shocked does she?  

Let's try... Remember now, it was a point to mention the two had never had sex... 

Archibald, I can't believe this!  All this time you've been using a pickle!?  How could you betray my trust like that?

Archibald opens his mouth to answer, but before he can get out a word, their children walk in.

That's simply the first thing to come to mind.  You could just keep the format the same but clean it up!  Good luck!",null,16,c7c4lo7,14cy4x,jokes,top_all,15
PoorJokeExplainer,"The punchline of this joke adds a new twist to a well-known setup by taking advantage of the fact that the English preposition ""in"" can have several meanings. The common interpretation of the setup is that of screwing a lightbulb *into* a socket. Here, the humor derives from the fact that ""in"" can also mean ""inside"", thus, two ladybugs are physically located *inside* of a lightbulb; add to it the double-entrende of ""screw"" (""to twist"" or ""to have sex"") and therein lies the joke.

drew870mitchell,"Same punchline, different setup:

A man notices his ten year old son doing his nightly prayers before bed and decides to look in and watch.  His son doesn't notice, and prays the usual yadda yadda yadda, but finishes with ""and goodbye, grandpa!  Amen.""  The man thinks that's sure unusual but he doesn't want to reveal that he was spying on his kid, so he doesn't say anything about it and just goes to bed.

The next day on his way home from work he gets a call from his wife:  her dad's died.  He takes off for his funeral, and consoles her, and it's just awful, but the thing he's most troubled by is how his son said ""goodbye Grandpa"" the night before.  But coincidences happen, you know.  He decides not to think anything of it, until a couple months later, he thinks maybe he should listen in again, since it's still nagging at the back of his mind.  He listens wide-eyed as his son finishes his prayer with ""Goodbye, Grandma!  Amen.""

The man is too shocked to say anything about the whole thing.  If it was possibly his parents, he might have, but they were already dead, so he decides maybe it's not even his place to say anything.  The next day, on his way home from work, sure enough he gets a call from his wife:  her mom is dead.

Months pass, and the man now nightly spies on his son praying, but can't bring himself to mention it to anyone.  This is scary!  On the night that he gets the nerve and decides he's going to say something, his son says, ""Goodbye Daddy!  Amen.""  The man just quietly backs out of the room as his face turns white as a sheet.

He struggles to sleep all night.  He doesn't dare mention it to his wife.  He would just look crazy.  The next morning, he's extra careful not to slip in the shower, or cut himself in the kitchen.  He drives to work 15mph under the speed limit, and while he's there, he cancels all his appointments and holes up in his office the whole day.  Finally 5pm rolls around and he starts making it back home.  ""Hey,"" he thinks, ""maybe I avoided the curse!""  Then he laughs, and realizes, ""stupid ol' me, there was no curse after all!""  He happily drives the rest of the way home and even picks up flowers for his wife.

When he gets to the door, he says, ""honey, I'm home, and you will not believe the day I had at work!""  Then he sees his wife and she's a wreck, again.  Oh no, what now?

SmorgasOfBorg,"I have to rate this joke as my favorite of all time. Not because it *is*, but because it gave me a moment to cherish forever. 

I saw this joke on Reddit last year for the first time. A week or so later, I drove the 250 miles to visit with my little brother at his home. I told him the joke, as we always did, by saying, ""Here's one I heard/read the other day"". 

You see, my little brother (aged 55 years) had just bounced back from near death from stage four emphysema. We thought he was gone for sure, but he stunned us in his recovery. He was doing 'well', as best that his condition allowed, when I shared this joke with him. 

Never have I heard him laugh so hard. I thought he was gonna break rib. 

And even a few days before he died (July 22), he would look at me and say, ""Dude...how much water did you drink?"" and give me a smile as he 'giggled' in his diminished breathing capacity. 

Yeah. It's now the 'best' joke I know. Thanks, Reddit /r/jokes. :-)",null,322,c78dmz8,13xy5i,jokes,top_all,1604

EDIT: Ok, want some examples?

First and foremost: you HAVE to know people, their intimate ticks, and the bits about them that are what others may call tells. For me this is kind of easy, it's my gift of sorts. (it makes subtle manipulation extremely easy). You then analyze your problem, i.e. what it is you want to be accepted, that would otherwise be ignored, and think of a situation that plays on their heartstrings, and which is terribly worse.
Then, you offer your potential set of circumstances and allow them to draw the conclusion you want as an alternative.

For my work: (I'm hesitant for my personal life): I've had a few bosses agree to my terms for various projects by sidewinding them with awful consequences out of their pocketbook (that wouldnt likely happen) and then spin, a bit begrudgingly (because they're dicks who dont like me) the option I'd rather happen, but in a way that seems as thought it's drastically more cost efficient.

Swagosorus,"I think the joke could be improved a bit by lowering the formality of the man's language. It would make it more believable and read better. 

A man walks into a bar and says ""Hey Bartender gimme a Less"" 

""I'm sorry, a what?"" Replies the bartender. 

""A Less, could you make me a less please?"" 

""I'm sorry sir, I don't know what a Less is. Could you tell me what's in the drink."" 

""Beats me. But the Doctor told me I should drink Less."" 

Also, I'm considering if it would be better if the man said ""The doctor told me I should drink it."" 
Thus making the listener figure out. Drink it? what? less? Drink less? oh. I get it.

A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a handyman-type and started canvassing a wealthy neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do.
""Well, you can paint my deck. How much will you charge?"" The blonde said, ""How about 50 dollars?"" The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, ""Does she realize that the deck goes all the way around the house?"" The man replied, ""She should. She was standing on the deck.""
A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money. ""You're finished already?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" the blonde answered, ""and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats. ""Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50. ""And by the way,"" the blonde added, ""that's not a deck, it's a Ferrari."" noooo, i mean its not a deck, its a porch, not porch, its a porshe.

The son goes up to his mother first. ""Mom, would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?

""For a million dollars, of course I would, but don't tell your father.""

The son goes to find his sister and asks the same question. She replies, ""Totally, I don't even need the million dollars.""

Finally, the boy asks his brother the question. He answers, ""Well, for a million dollars, I would.""

finnehenry,"Good one!

While we're on the subject of naked wifes, I have a joke.

A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbor.

Before she says a word, Bob says, “I’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.”

After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.
After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs.

When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…“Who was that?”

“It was Bob the next door neighbor,” she replies.

“Great!” the husband says, “Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”

Moral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.

A priest is tired of the paltry amounts of money he sees in the collection plate after a sermon, so he decides to try hypnotizing his congregation, to see if it will help. That Sunday, the priest swings his watch before the congregation, and at the end of his sermon shouts ""Give!""

It works like a charm. The collection plate is overflowing with ten and twenty-dollar bills! The priest is overjoyed, so the next Sunday he does it again, hypnotizing the congregation with his watch and telling them to ""Give!"" which they do in abundance.

The priest continues this for weeks, amassing an incredible collection plate each time, until one day, as he is swinging the watch, the chain breaks, to which the priest exclaims, ""Aw, shit!""",null,5,c6mp0oj,11hmah,jokes,top_all,25

PintOfGuinness,"[I seen a variation of this joke here a year ago, think this is better:](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/jsmsg/zoo_performer_joke/)

One day an out of work mime is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a street performer.
However, as soon as he starts to draw a crowd, the zookeeper grabs him and drags him into his office.
The zookeeper explains to the mime that the zoo's most popular attraction, a gorilla, has died suddenly. The keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off. He offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mime accepts.
The next morning, before the crowd arrives, the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage. He discovers that it's a great job. He can sleep all he wants, play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime.
However, eventually the crowds tire of him and he gets bored just swinging on tires. He begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his.
Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to the top of his cage, crawls across a partition, and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves it.
At the end of the day the zookeeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction as a gorilla.
Well, this goes on for some time. The mime keeps taunting the lion, the crowds grow larger, and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day when he is dangling over the furious lion, he slips and falls. The mime is terrified. The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind.
Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, ""Help, Help me!"", but the lion is quick and pounces. The mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says, ""Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get us both fired?""

He went through his spiel again to the farmer's wife who had answered the door, but said ""I no longer have anything to demonstrate with, but with this being a farm, perhaps you have some wheat or something?""  The farmer's wife found a sack of wheat, and he took a handful of it and threw it on the ground.  However, try as he might, the high-powered vacuum cleaner simply would not clean it up!  He got a little frustrated, then looked at the wheat and noticed it was a little damp.  He thought for a moment, and as he was thinking he noticed another sack that had been sitting by the radiator in the hallway. He asked the farmer's wife if he could try with that wheat instead.

She rolled her eyes, and said ""OK... but this is your last chance"". He took some of the wheat from the new sack, and poured it onto the floor, and the vacuum cleaner cleaned it all up without any issues! The farmer's wife was delighted and bought one right there!

They were fast asleep and aware of nothing but I was paranoid. Anyway while I was rubbing myself I felt another hand on me. I was shocked still for a second and still this other hand was rubbing on me. And it felt good.

A Pole, German and Russian were on the uninhabited island after ship accident. They had nothing to do, so they were drinking. Finally after month of drinking they found genie lamp. They rubbed it and genie pops out and tells them that because there are three of them, each of them gets one wish. So German guy says that he wants to get back to his family. Bam. Done. And then Russian says that he wants to get back too. Done. And then, Pole looks at all vodka they have left, shrugs and tells genie to get his drinking buddies back on the island. Bam.

King Julian is running happily through the jungles of Madagascar when he stumbles upon Melman, the giraffe,  rolling a joint.

Julian looks at the giraffe and says, ""my friend, why do you do this? Come. Run with me through the jungle! You'll feel so much better!""

The giraffe looks at him, looks at the joint, tosses it and goes off running with the lemur. Then they come across Marty the zebra doing coke.

So Julian again says, ""Marty my friend, why do you do this? Think about your health. Come. Run with us through the pretty jungle, you'll see, you'll feel so good!""

Marty looks at them, looks at his razor, mirror and coke, then tosses them and starts running with the lemur and giraffe. The three animals then come across Alex the lion, heating some smack on a spoon, about to shoot up.

""Alex my friend, why do you do this? Think about your health! Come. Run with us through the beautiful jungle and you'll feel so good!"" The lion looks at him, puts down his needle, and mauls King Julian.

The giraffe and zebra watch in horror and look at him and ask, ""Alex, why did you do this? He was merely trying to help you.""
