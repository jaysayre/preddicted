QVCatullus,"The Romans had indeed done precisely that -- breaking up barbarian nations and incorporating them into areas that were short on manpower. Sometimes they were left somewhat cohesive but transported far from home to limit their ability to side with their former countrymen against Rome -- hence everyone's favourite Sarmatians in Britain, for example. By the end of the empire, though, they had suffered tremendously in their ability to dictate terms; the best example of that would be the admission of the Goths into the empire under Valens and Valentinian that led, via brutal mishandling of the Gothic immigrants and poor handling of the situation in a military sense, to the battle of Adrianople. After that battle, the goths in particular were more or less a presence in the Empire that the Romans were unable to completely subdue, so it became necessary to treat with them -- consider that, after the fall of Rome to Odoacer, the Ostrogoths took over Italy, ostensibly on behalf of and with the consent of Constantinople, due largely to the fact that there simply wasn't much that Constantinople could or would do about it.

It's important to realize that after Marcus Aurelius, the shift of the role of the Roman army and the imperative of the emperors became much more, at most but not all times through the remaining history of Rome, about defending against other Romans than it was about defending from foreign foes. The collection of heavy forces into the comitatenses had a great deal to do with the emperor's ability to keep an eye on the troops, rather than a strategic imperative to have a strong centralized reserve. By the late empire, the emperors had reasonably effectively pinned themselves into defensive positions in Italy like Ravenna, and were more concerned with their fellow Romans and the threat of the the Vandals against the Italian interior than they were with whether the Franks were on a leash in Gaul. The Visigoth entry into Spain, for example, applied pressure to the Vandals, so very little was done about this by the Romans until Justinian I.",null,6,cdnqgw0,1rio7f,askhistorians,top_day,19
Jazz-,"Well the reliance was partly due exclusively to the urgency of the surrounding events. 

After the Battle of Adrianople the crisis of the incoming barbarians had become so large that Valentinians son Gratian panicked and made the son of his fathers Master of the Horse Augustus. This new Augustus whose name was Theodosius realized that something drastic had to be done to prevent even more tribes from moving into imperial territory. 

“Theodosius took a step which was to have grave consequences, though it was necessary at the time.. ” 

And of course as you already know, what Theodosius did was bring in barbarians to the army which will sooner or later transfer the power away from roman hands.

LDPotter,"Agree with QVC and also, the process of incorporation of tribal armies into the Roman legions occurred over many decades.  Stationed far from Rome, the local culture and the Roman culture were always in tension.  Moving troops meant moving entire communities - complex, expensive work - so incorporated tribes were left in their homelands and gradually Rome was absorbed, not the reverse as was the plan.  This was all exacerbated by the focus of Rome itself on maintaining the capital region, which was huge, rich and not particularly productive.  The focus of the worldview was extracting from the empire to feed the center. This didn't facilitate Roman leadership seeing the beggar picture.",null,0,cdnr8di,1rio7f,askhistorians,top_day,2
Grombrindal18,"It was mostly due to funding. The Roman Empire had a very large border to guard, from Hadrian's Wall to the Rhine to Mesopotamia, and needed a certain number of soldiers to man these defenses, which slowly became a higher and higher amount as the foes on the outside got more powerful. Say what you will about economic decline within, certainly that played a part as well, though I am not as familiar with the economic side. 

As Rome needed more soldiers, it was simply not possible to guard the border with primarily legionaries- they had to be paid more, had more significant pensions, and generally used more expensive equipment, so the balance started tipping towards auxiliary forces, which became the majority sometime in the third century. 

As for your statement about breaking up the armies of potential foes, this was done, at least initially, to provide the Roman Army with something it did not possess (especially cavalry). And in general, foreign warriors would be more likely to join the Roman army if they could maintain some semblance of their own culture- in units of their own tribesmen.

By the time that the Romans were relying on their allied kingdoms to supply most of their armies, it was already too late, the border too long and porous. ",null,1,cdnzjh7,1rio7f,askhistorians,top_day,1
Skolman,"Forgive me for the lack of citations and specific details as my materials on the topic are currently in a storage locker, but I shall attempt to give you the basic answer.

Yes, and no. By the final year of the war the south as a whole was in a state of near destitute as inflation was rampant and most of the labor force was engaged in supplying the confederate army, in manner similar to Germany and Japan in WWII. So yes, life was pretty bad as a whole. (This may just be my uninformed opinion.) But I believe there are two roots to the ""Yankee brutality/Lucifer's Legions"": first you have the major parts of states and whole cities that were pillaged by Sherman's March that were then burned to the ground as it's their citizens were still in their homes, but they're were other cities, towns, and villages across the south which suffered near the same fate; secondly you have the Prisoner of War Camps, such as the famous Andersonville, GA Prison Camp, which were filled over capacity and downright filthy and putrid places and claimed the lives of 56,000 soldiers, or approximately 12% who were sent to them (Approximately 1% died in German POW camps, and not by starvation, typhoid fever, etc.). But to simply stop there is to not pay the conditions of the confederacy the honor it is respected.

Sustaining the Confederate Army was no easy task when the majority of the Pre-1961 laborers were involved in the war themselves. The popular belief that most southerners owned slaves is a myth, rather the number is something like 1 in 10 families owned slaves and the average was 1 to 2 slaves, and that something like 1% of slave holders owned more than 200. Prior to the Civil War non-slave-holding white southerners, and even those who owned slaves, were often doing the same type of labor and living a slightly better life than that of slaves as 45% of the nation was in poverty. They were often sharecroppers and or practiced subsistence agriculture, meaning life was pretty bad. 

This life style only worsened as the war progressed when the men who didn't own plantations were drawn from their families and land to the battlefield. This often left mothers and women to try and run the entire household, so farming, even worse than their husbands often did, while simultaneously raising an average of 4+ children. 

As things worsened for the family, the confederacy as a whole suffered from what I'll term ""regional specialization"" (Correct me oh apathetic southern scholar if you would please.), that is there were distinct regions in which certain things were produced in each region, ie: cotton/rice/indigo/other stuff (if any extra was managed to be produced besides subsistence requirements) and often only those. As the War surpassed the expected end date of 1 year (may of been 6 months) these regions struggled to transition to support the needs of a nation instead of exporting it's products to the North and Europe. Combined with the Union Blockade and Egyptian/Indian Cotton providing Europe it's needs, the South had little to no economic capacity. Inflation thus grew steadily, with the help of speculators who would purchase and hold what wheat and grains were available until it raised in price even more, reaching near 5000% by 1864 after which it spurned to 9000% during the last year of the war. Yes those are thousand percent interest rates, and items such as coffee and bacon were quite literally at 9000% by the wars end. (Bacon was an important staple in 19th Century life because of it's fat content.)

Thus a vicious cycle was born: Families could often barely sustain themselves without the paternal figure of the household yet they were expected to produce sustenance for the Confederate Army. Those who did produce for the Army were then payed in sums which had no competition with the rising inflation, thus they had to try to sustain themselves all the while being worked, figuratively while sometimes literally, like a mule to the point of exhaustion and death. This cycle grew larger, faster, and more vicious each time it returned.

While the Southerners were being picked and prodded like cattle by the CSA Government, they were often at the whims of Union Armies and their smaller components. As with any war the invading Army often used the cities and towns they approached and occupied, often for months at a time, remember this was a slow war compared to modern wars. When Union supply lines were destroyed or running low they would often use what was in the house/town/city they were occupying as a their personal kitchen pantry and alcohol cellar. (Some commanders prevented this, some turned a blind eye, some instigated it.) This was a process that occurred throughout the war on both sides, but as the situation for food and supplies worsened the war also entered it's more southern phase thus putting the brunt of the Union Armies needs on families and towns which struggled themselves. I believe at one point near the end of the war, I believe it was some time near spring 1864, Generals and field commanders would instruct their soldiers to not leave anything that would be of use to the confederate war effort. This often entailed a complete destruction of grain stores, cattle, and anything such as guns and jewelry which the soldiers wanted. (I'm not informed of the nature of it, but I assume that there were instances of rape/murder among the occupied areas. 

Sherman's March is, well it's Sherman's March. There have been countless pieces written covering every aspect of it. Did Sherman sadistically burn most of his way to the sea while there were citizens inside? No. For the most part Sherman gave the towns/cities advance notice of their approach and informed the larger and strategic ones to evacuate because he was going to burn it down. I think he gave Atlanta two or three warnings and wait 3 days, but a CSA leader said not to evacuate the city was impenetrable or something similar. Georgians as a whole were told to stay put and fight, which made the situations worse upon themselves. Smaller towns and nonstrategic cities were often just pillaged as Sherman had no supply lines on the March.


An anecdote that should be noted as that both the North and the South participated in the pillaging process and the treatment of prisoners, so some of the actions taken were retaliatory; also of note is that the first phase of the war was initially fought outside the deep south, primarily border states and northern states so southerners often knew little of what occured and what the south did to the north, which was as equally disturbing.


Was southern life bad during the last year? No doubt, but as bad as some say it was? I'll let you decide.",null,2,cdnpoal,1rindw,askhistorians,top_day,11
seangt12345,"The South had a great deal of suffering because of their horrible economic conditions, which was then compounded when Sherman came through and committed ""total war,"" especially in Georgia and South Carolina. The stories of raping and pillaging had some truth to them, but they were greatly exaggerated in many cases. Sherman left many houses like the Henderson House in Dallas, GA stand along with many others. David Williams that teaches at Valdosta State University in Georgia wrote an article about women who rioted for food and supplies because inflation was so bad. The Confederate Government was also not reigning in the Planter class or speculation because those people ran the government. A judge from Paulding County named W.A. Foster wrote a county history for Paulding and according to the sources he used prices for boots, coats, and pants were into the hundreds of dollars. Meat was non-existent in markets. Bacon was $916 a pound. All in May of 1864. These prices would be absurd for us in 2013 so you can imagine what this looked like to the citizens in 1864. Now when Sherman came through he did burn and destroy a lot, and many people who had fled their homes to avoid the fighting came back to nothing heading into the winter of 1864. Citizens were suffering greatly but this was a combination of internal issues along with Sherman marching into the south.

l_mack,"I'm speaking from a largely Canadian context - and most of the literature that I'm familiar with revolves around the mining industry - but I think that there are some parallels that can be drawn between child labour in mining and child labour in textiles. Notably, I think I can address - to an extent - your main question regarding compensation.
 

Child labour in Canadian coal mines occurred extensively during the 19th century and petered out in the early decades of the 20th century. In Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, for example, they accounted for 16% of the mining workforce in the 1880s, 10% in the 1890s, and then 9% at the turn of the century. [1] Boys in the mines generally gave their pay to their parents to dispense with - this became less common as the boys grew older, but while they were living under their parents roof it remained common to contribute substantially to the family fund. That said, even young boys could often expect an ""allowance"" to be doled out by their parents out of their earnings. Children in the pits, often working alongside an older family member, could contribute to the family economy in non-wage related ways also. For example, a boy in the mine could work alongside an older family member - allowing for the allotment of an additional coal tub that the older worker could help to fill to boost their production of coal higher than normal and ensure greater compensation. These contributions - both in terms of additional wages and on-the-site benefits, ensured that children's contributions to the family economy was often substantial. For this reason, it would be economically - as well as emotionally - devastating to lose a child to workplace injury or death. [2]

Workers' compensation plans spread unevenly. In Britain, for example, the *Employers Liability Act* was introduced in 1880 to provide some modicum of support to bereaved families. Liability acts were also passed in several Canadian provinces in the late-1890s - but these were not ""compensation"" acts, they merely placed the possibility of liability for workplace injury at the feet of employers. Workers' families would still have to take the employer to court to receive compensation. In Canada, the first actual compensation act was passed in Quebec in 1909, while Ontario and Nova Scotia followed suit in 1914 and 1915 respectively. [3] In the U.S., this type of legislation began to spread throughout the states after 1910s. [4] 

In terms of child labour, until these pieces of legislation were passed the only recourse would be for the family to take employers to court. Unfortunately, social pressures would sometimes be enacted against families who opted to go for this option. Ian McKay writes: 

&gt;Those who had not understood the tight bonds tying families to the mines easily condemned the families who sought compensation for children killed in the Explosion of 1891 [in Cumberland County] or other mining accidents, inferring sordid profiteering from petitions more likely motivated by the desire of families to survive after the loss of an important breadwinner [5]

That said, sometimes these cases did go forward; Robert McIntosh describes the 1888 legal action between collier John O'Henly and the Acadia Coal Company regarding the death of O'Henly's young son. [6]

SplendourFalls,"I studied this in quite a lot of detail, so I'll be happy to answer.

**What was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of England?**

The political situation was tense. Following the Spanish Armada a hundred years before, England had become fanatically anti-Catholic, legislating heavily against the religion and generally subverting it until by 1688 it was a tiny minority - around 2% of the population. In the seventeenth century, your political allegiance was often pre-determined by your religion, and Catholicism was associated with absolute monarchy, whilst Protestantism became associated with parliamentary or constitutional monarchy and the rule of law (a lot of this is due to the propaganda surrounding the religious wars in Europe, and the fact that Members of Parliament were generally devout Protestants). I always like to use the analogy that 'Catholic' meant to an Englishman in 1688 what 'Socialist' meant to an American in 1960 - there was *very much* a 'Catholic scare'. So when James II, a Catholic, inherited the throne in 1685 and began *overriding* Parliament, going over their heads and using his royal powers to enact pro-Catholic policies without the consent of Parliament, things began to get ugly, and Parliament feared James was planning to implement a Catholic tyranny, an absolute monarchy of the type that had caused the Civil Wars a few decades earlier. *Even the Pope* was wary of what James II was doing and urged the king to be cautious. The tipping point comes when James II produces a son, a Catholic heir. Several high-profile figures conspire and sent a letter inviting James II's son-in-law (who would have become king had James not produced a son), the Protestant William of Orange, to take the throne with Parliament's blessing.

**How was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasion?**

James II had been allied to fellow Catholic, the King of France and archetypal absolute monarch, Louis XIV. When William is crowned king  England joins the anti-French bloc of states fighting in the [Nine Years' War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Grand_Alliance) in Europe.

**How was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasion?**

I don't know much about this I'm afraid. They had warred in the past, but James II did marry his daughter to William and they were big trading partners, and Parliament would hardly have invited someone hostile to take the throne. 

**Even if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England. Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes, England was actually conquered by The Dutch Republic?**

It would be very difficult to argue that. I certainly wouldn't recommend you make a statement like that in any academic work. It's best to see it as a coup that's was justified at the time by portraying it as a 'glorious' event. 'Conquest' certainly has far different implications and connotations that aren't suited to describing the events of 1688.

Now, this is the interesting bit. At the time, the British Isles weren't united under one crown, but were three separate kingdoms that *happened* to have been governed by a single person since 1603. 
Now, William didn't 'conquer' England in any meaningful sense, but he *certainly* had to fight for Ireland [in a war that lasted for several years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamite_war_in_Ireland) There was also no guarantee that the Scottish parliament would offer William the crown, though they eventually did in 1689, and should the Scottish parliament have refused him the crown William might well have had to conquer Scotland. 
 
At this point I should also explain a little about the term 'Glorious Revolution'. 'Revolution' only acquired its modern meaning (violent overthrow of authority) after the French Revolution of 1789, but as early as 1689 the events of 1688 were known as the 'Glorious Revolution' in England. It's because *revolution* in this context is more literal - it's a restoration in the 'coming full circle' sense. This is because those involved saw themselves as as restoring the ancient rights and liberties of Englishmen that came from Magna Carta in 1216, rights they believed James II was infringing.

I'm assuming this has answered the bit about why England didn't become 'a part of the Dutch Republic', but basically, that's easily answered by a quick look at the definition of a [personal union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union).

**How was the invasion successful with only 15,000 men?**

James II had *no support whatsoever* in England. In July 1688, before James produced his Catholic heir, the Royal Navy mutinied after a Catholic captain had Mass performed onboard his ship, and James had to pacify them in person, which emphasises the tension of the situation in England at the time. After William landed in England James was hesitant to engage the Dutch army and simply sat his troops in camp in the south-west of England, his men deserting in their thousands, having no intention of fighting for James. It was a total capitulation and the army dissolved almost without firing a shot. Interestingly enough the complete collapse of the royal army worked *against* William - he then had to spend months wrestling with Parliament for funds with which to build a new force to check the growing rebellion of James' supporters (known as Jacobites) in Scotland.

Hope this helps, hit me up if you have any more questions.

Also, a quick disclaimer: This is an incredibly Anglo-centric post and the events of the Revolution took on completely different dimensions in the other kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland, but you were specifically referring to England in your questions.",null,0,cdo27z3,1rik13,askhistorians,top_day,3
darth_nick_1990,"I'll just add my two cents:

**What was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of England?**

The British Isles had just faced the British Civil Wars/Revolution and Restoration. This period of twenty years, from 1640-1660, completely changed society within Britain. It had deep implications for the government, the monarchy and even the peasantry. James II was a Catholic king of England prior to the Glorious Revolution. There was widespread fear and disgust that he was taking influence in his rule by his Stuart ancestors as an absolute monarch. This would have undone all the ""progress"" made since 1640.

**How was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasion?**

The Glorious Revolution is largely seens as the only successful ""peaceful"" revolution. I say ""peaceful"" only in relative terms. There were some very minor military conflicts but when compared to other famous revolutions where regimes have fell or changed, there was very little blood shed. This was a very positive aspect of the Glorious Revolution and there was far less shock when compared to the earlier events of the regicide at the end of the British Civil Wars. William of Orange was generally accepted, partially due to his marriage with Mary, an English princess. This helped to legitimise their coup.

**How was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasion.**

The English and Dutch relationship was generally amiable. During the Dutch Revolts in the sixteenth century England offered help, unofficially. It was unofficial help in order not to escalate a war with the Spanish. Although the Spanish did eventually declare war on the English (think Spanish Armada) their was a concious attempt by the English to not officially escalate a war but also to help others which were politically and religiously alligned. After the coronation of William and Mary the Dutch Republic certainly became less of a priority to manage. This may be an offhand comment but it has been raised at other points in history, particularly with the coronation of James I/VI of England/Scotland. James I sought England as it was larger, wealthier and far more influential. A similar case could be made about William and Mary seeking England over the Dutch Republic.

**I read that a result of the invasion was that the dominance of world naval trade shifted from the Dutch Republic to England. How did this happen?**

I would disagree. Although the Dutch naval trade was very prosperous, so was the English. England had strong trade links to most of Europe. The addition of a further naval network simply benefited both countries. Although I am not a specialist in this area, I would imagine that this was simply a benefit to both countries, rather than an amalgamation of the two networks.

**Even if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England. Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes, England was actually conquered by The Dutch Republic? If so, why didn't England just become a part of The Dutch Republic?**

I completely disagree with this sentiment. I see it as the English parliament *allowed* William and Mary to take up the English throne. They were *invited* because: a) they had a legitimate right to the throne, b) they were protestant, c) they were malleable (compared to James II). Parliament could have raised another Civil War if they wanted to. There certainly was a similar level of distrust towards James II as there was to Charles I. Instead, they saw a different avenue they could take. I think your question relies very heavily on thinking the Dutch Republic had a superior military advantage, and that is how they succeeded.

**How was the invasion successful with only 15.000 men?**

Like the answer above, success depended upon the relationship between the English parliament and William and Mary. James II had little to no support. He could not muster a real defence. The 15,000 men were to mop up the small protest made against the Dutch and to parade down the Thames.

Hope that helps.

The mongols were very invested in meritocracy and were more than willing to allow vanquished foes to join their army.  As for their failures to actually directly control lands there are quite a few, Japan, Dai Viet, Champa, majaphit, Burma, Sultanate of Delhi, and many others actually survived.

Carol_White,"Well, one way we might answer this question could be by looking at a case study. In 1791 Benjamin Banneker sent a copy of his almanac and [a letter](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h71t.html) to one Thomas Jefferson addressing the very issue you raise. Banneker said that while popular opinion held that Africans were ""scarcely capable of mental endowments,"" the perceived lack of accomplishments on the part of the Black race was actually due to environmental factors, like ""groaning captivity and cruel oppression."" Banneker sucked up to Jefferson and hoped that his intelligence and humanitarianism would persuade him to admit to racial equality.

Jefferson's [reply](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h72t.html) was as follows: ""No body wishes more than I do, to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men; and that the appearance of the want of them, is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence, both in Africa and America. I can add with truth, that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced, for raising the condition, both of their body and mind, to what it ought to be, as far as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstances, which cannot be neglected, will admit.""

How should we read this? On the one hand, it's a rather progressive statement compared to his musings in 1781 that Africans were ""in reason much inferior"" to Europeans, and that Black men were more attracted to white women in the same way that orangutans are more attracted to Black women. Yet the words were not accompanied by any sort of advocacy. The best he could do as president was hope that the physical expansion of the United States would eventually cause the extinction of slavery.

Jefferson and his fellow men of the Enlightenment were on the fence about the intellectual capacity of Africans. They didn't have all the evidence. A generation later we'll have the rise of true scientific racism and the medical ""proof"" of Black inferiority.

ConanofCimmeria,"My personal favorite translation of the *Gesta Danorum* is the two-volume edition by H.E. Davidson, whom I just love unconditionally. It's a little old-fashioned but reads well and is very thorough.

You mentioned the Baltic crusades: *the* definitive book on this is imaginatively titled *The Northern Crusades* by Eric Christiansen. It's a very old-school work of history but a really great and informative read. William Urban also has a whole bunch of stuff on this, but I've not read much of his work. What little work has been done on these crusades (in English; there's a lively cottage industry on the subject in German and Russian) doesn't take anything like a national perspective, in part because they were a more or less international project, with various popes issuing papal bulls for them just as they would a crusade to the Holy Land, so settlers from Scandinavia, the German territories and in some cases even the British Isles took part.

This may be a problem you find throughout the literature, particularly because in the late Migration Age/early Middle Ages there's no such thing as a ""nation,"" so working from a national perspective is inherently anachronistic. Also, for whatever reason a great deal of our primary sources are more concerned with the west Norse (ie, Norwegians and Icelanders;) I don't really know a reason for this except that Sweden's Tre Kronor castle went up in flames in the late 17th century, destroying a large chunk of Sweden's earliest historical texts. Why there should be comparatively little to do with Denmark I'm not sure.

Sorry I couldn't give a more definitive answer. I am mostly interested in Swedish history (förlåt!) so I don't know that much about state-building in Denmark. If there's one particular aspect of Viking Age history you're interested in (eg, runes, mythology, material culture, what have you) I may be able to point you to some useful resources.

falafel1066,"Interesting question, complicated answer. A little history on both men could probably help illuminate the answer.

Let's talk Malcolm X first. Born into urban poverty, son of Garveyites, ex-convict, member of the Nation of Islam until the last year of his life when he converted to Sunni Islam, Malcolm Little (as he was born), had a deep hatred of racism, inequality, poverty, and the social conditions surrounding him. He lived mostly in the north, so the racism he saw was not necessarily Jim Crow, ""Separate but equal,"" but institutionalized racism through discriminatory housing practices, voting discrimination, etc. Therefore, he advocated a militant resistance to white racism and separation from whites. BUT, the Nation of Islam prohibited political engagement, so Malcolm X only preached it (until the last year of his life when he founded the pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity which worked to reach out and make connections to other similar organizations, like SNCC). The last year of his life, though, through his exile from the Nation of Islam, his conversion to Sunni Islam, and his international travels, Malcolm X's rhetoric and political advocacy turned more toward cooperation with the civil rights movement, though he advocated human rights (healthcare, housing, employment, etc) rather than just civil rights (voting, representation, etc). For more on Malcolm X, see Manning Marable's Pulitzer-prize winning biography, *Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.* 

Alright, let's talk Martin Luther King, Jr. Born into a religious family (his father was a reverend too), King promoted Christian love and non-violence as the answer to racism. Though King was critical of American politics, he ultimately believed that the road to freedom was through social organization that confronted racist civil policies, like segregation. Therefore, we have the Montgomery Bus Boycott as an example (whereas with Malcolm X, we don't only have one indication of him protesting publicly). King was willing to engage directly to bring attention to the issues. Towards the end of his life, King turned more radical, seeing how embedded racism was in the country (part of this was influenced by his travels north, where he didn't see the KKK or overt racism, but, like Malcolm X, became aware of institutionalized racism). He started to challenge underlying issues of racism, like housing and employment- issues of human rights, not necessarily civil rights. Sound familiar? 

Historians have recently noted how at the ends of their lives, King and Malcolm X seemed to approach an understanding of the deep roots of racism, and began to challenge the traditional ways of the NAACP or the NOI. Does this mean had they survived they would have agreed completely? Probably not, but identifying their late in life turns shows a remarkable similarity in ideologies. Yes, Malcolm X was a Muslim and King a Christian, but ultimately they found strength in their faith to fight the roots of racism in America. Here's what King wrote to Betty Shabaz (Malcolm X's wife) after Malcolm was assassinated:

&gt;""While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.""

So I guess I would encourage you to rethink the ""divide"" between these two men's ideologies. The history of African Americans' resistance to racism is often framed King vs. Malcolm X, non-violent vs. violent, when in reality, the truth is much more complicated (as it always is). But, if you want to look at factors that separate them, look at their personal history and religion.  For further reading:

The_Turk2,"Hitler was known for having a very loose management structure, much unlike Stalin in this regard. Hitler was bad with scheduled meetings, was sporadic, and left a lot of the actual governing work to his administration, and trusted Nazi officials. He gave the government direction, and government followed. He was always open to new ideas, and innovations in military technology and tactics. He gave his generals a surprising amount of autonomy compared to the French (case and point de Gaulle with the use of armour) and Stalin (pre-1942/3 about*...). 

Needless to say this had many benefits for the German military, and some downsides, such as Goering pushing to allow his aircraft to bomb and ""finish"" off the French/British at Dunkirk which he failed to do, rather than letting the army move in and crush them. You have to remember that Hitler was largely disliked by the Prussian military aristocracy that had been led by Hindenburg before his death. To make up for this, among other things, he gave a lot of autonomy to his generals, and as most military books were being written in German throughout the 1930's, he had a wealth of knowledge to choose from. 

This changed for Hitler on the Eastern Front, as the war against Stalin in Southern Russia began to stall (as Moscow was about to fall), he decided to take full command of all military operations in Operation Barborossa, in a mad attempt to secure the entire south, and the Baku oil wells, which failed spectacularly. Very famously he denied Guderian the chance to seize Moscow, but instead turn southwards. This allowed Stalin time to regroup, and push back against the Germans and her allies. 

At the same time might I add on the Eastern Front, Stalin began to relax his grip on the military, and allowed his generals, most importantly Zhukov to have a greater say in the running of the war, and battle plans. 

*Stalin gave in eventually, and decided to trust his generals, especially Zhukov. Can't pinpoint a date I'm afraid. 

TL;DR: How much autonomy a leader gives to his gifted generals, and its for sure a fine balance, can change a lot the outcome of a war. Foolish decisions for personal glory, usually end in vain defeat. Even Stalin had to swallow his pride, to allow Zhukov command. ",null,8,cdnrex8,1ribha,askhistorians,top_day,26
OiBoi,"You may want to consider tweaking your question just a bit, and replacing ""tactician"" with ""strategist."" In the modern military use of the word, tactics refer to troop engagements, battles or parts of battles. I'm assuming you mean more the ""big picture"" or the Operational and Strategic tiers.

There is some level of disagreement among historians about Hitler's ""brilliance,"" was he just lucky, or was there actually some genius behind his moves? That being said, I'm just going to outright support the former notion with my response until someone more knowledgeable shows up. 

Overall, Hitler made bold gambles at critical times which often paid off for him. His decision to march into the Rhineland, for example, seems like keen calculation in hindsight, but at the time Hitler could not have been assuredly confident that the French would yield so easily. Similar successful gambles that paid off were the annexation/occupation of Austria and the handling of the Sudetenland (first getting the Sudetenland at the negotiating table, and then essentially taking the rest of the country by force afterwards). People have a tendency to look at men who took big gambles, and won, as having genius (Caesar at the Rubicon, for example). When you consider the successes of some of Hitler's gambles, it's easy to understand where the myth of his genius comes from.

But not all of Hitler's gambles were successful; the failed Putsch in Munich and the invasion of Poland come to mind. The latter one ties in nicely with your question of advisers, as it was Ribbentrop (Germany's then foreign minister) who played a role in convincing Hitler that France and England would again try appeasement. Instead, WWII was started in earnest. 

The notion of Germany's success in WWII being largely due to the competence of the men who advised Hitler, or carried out operations under his general orders has some merit. German’s quick victory over France was largely due to the result of plans made by the German General Staff (primarily the Manstein Plan) in combination with successful implementation of Maneuver Warfare, aka “Blitzkrieg” (not unlike a doctrine practiced by the modern US Marine Corps).  The presence of a frontline commander of Erwin Rommel’s caliber should also be worth noting.

This brings us to the Battle/Miracle of Dunkirk.  By the end of May 1940, Several German tank divisions had roughly 350,000 allied troops trapped near the port of Dunkirk. But on May 22nd, a halt order was given to the encroaching Germans. Ultimately, the Germans gave the British an additional 4 to5 days to organize a mass withdrawal of some 300,000 men.  William Shirer stipulates in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, that Hitler gave this order under the advice of Hermann Göring, who wanted an opportunity for the fledgling Luftwaffe to annihilate the British and gain prestige.  It would later be revealed that the order to halt was initially given by Von Rundstedt, the German Commander, and was confirmed hours later by Hitler. However, even if Shirer’s point is ignored,  the mere fact that Hitler allowed for this delay and the escape of so many British forces, essentially keeping Britain in the war, is IMO at the very least strong anecdotal evidence that Hitler did not possess the military genius often misattributed to him.

Obviously, there are mitigating circumstances with Dunkirk, in particular the mechanical state of the German Panzers and whether or not the evacuation on that scale could have been reasonably foreseen.

I’m dead tired, so I’m going to stop here. My sources are primarily military history courses I’ve taken as a Military Strategic Studies major, and Shirer’s “Rise…” (I’m well aware of the faults people have pointed out in his work, but I don’t think his adherence to the Sonder Weg-theory much affects this question). Lastly, when referring to a “military genius” I’m using the term as defined Clausewitz.

vonadler,"I'll recap my [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16m1n3/how_was_hitlers_military_acumen/c7xa3a6) on Hitler's tactical and strategic acumen.

Hitler was not a great general, far from it.

His good sides;

1. He was prepared to side-step seniority and adapt a good and innovative plan when it was required. See for example Manstein's Fall Sißelschnitt plan for the invasion of France.

2. He was a risk-taker and would bet hard on small chances and narrow margins. Especially early war this paid off quite a bit. He bet that the French would take more than two months to assemble a serious offensive to relieve Poland, and defended the west with a motley collection of second and third line divisions that lacked much of their equipment. The campaign in Norway was also a prime example of this.

However, this is where his good abilities stop.

His bad sides;

1. He was unable to organise the high command and the war in a unified way, instead encouraging infighting between the OKH (Oberkommande des Heeres, High Command of the Armies) and the OKW (Oberkommande der Wehrmacht, High Command of the Armed Forces) and intriguing between officers for command, his attention and the spotlight, which gave them more resources. he had this fault when it came to politics as well, and encouraged infighting to ensure that noone fought him for the supreme position.

2. He was unable to take criticism, feedback or in any way take the blame for any failure. That way he would not learn and would not improve as a general. In the long run, it also meant that he appointed yes-men and commanders with political skill rather than skilled generals to conduct the war. All others were simply removed.

3. He was unable to see skill in defeat. Some German generals did miracles, kept their armies together and delayed the enemy and caused him massive casualties, but were eventually driven back - Hitler saw this as a defeat and would remove the general.

4. He was unable to keep himself from the details, losing overall focus and oversight. He would often study things in extreme detail and berate generals for not knowing where their battalions were exactly (which was the duty of the regimental or divisional commander, not the army commander) or industrial owners for not knowing details of armament. Generals soon had to spend hours reading up on the exact positions of individual small units under their command before a briefing with Hitler, time better spent on other things. Hitler would also place battalions and move them around, with no regard for the knowledge on the ground (the strength and readiness of the battalion, the local terrain, line of sight and enemy dispositions etc).

5. He believed in fixed defence and placed troops like they had been placed early ww1 - with all firepower to the front, preferably in fixed positions, to blunt an enemy attack directly. This is an amateur's view of war (as much firepower as possible) and in reality a flexible defence (with small outposts up front and most of the firepower further back) with a large reserve will allow you to blunt an enemy attack late ww1 or in ww2 much better. Line thinking, which goes back to the first village pallisade all through warfare until early ww1 was obselete - you needed to think along the lines of hedgehogs, outposts and large fields rather than lines, and Hitler could and would not.

6. He placed much too much focus on morale. Ordering that veteran tank crews that had been defeated should not get new tanks first, as they would be demoralised, so they should go to newly trained crews with high morale instead. In large area warfare, from ww1 and onward, morale was fed by food, sleep and getting arms and ammunition needed. Then the men used their training and fought for their comrades rather than consider any defeat or grandiose statements or ""signals sent"" by high command. Hitler believed in these grandiose gestures and morale and was heavily mired in late 19th century romanticist ideas of morale, nationalism and a national will. He firmly believed his ""not a step back"" order during the 1941-42 winter Soviet counterattacks saved the German army and that it was Napoleon's order to retreat that had doomed the French invasion of Russia. Most likely, if the Germans had used flexible defence, they would have lost less men and caused the Soviets massive casualties during the winter fighting.

Hitler was disregarded as a General by the German officer corps. He had not gone through officer school, he had not been a cadet, he had not been promoted to a staff position and done staff work, and he had not played any kriegsspiel (realistic board games the Germans used to play through potential battles at all levels).

I use a 4-rule guide to a general.

**Organisation.** Can the general organise troops so they fight welland the civil society to provide him with more troops, supplies and other things needed to fight. Can he keep himself involved only at a level above and a level below his own, to have focus on what he needs to do? Does he understand logistics?

Hitler was a lousy organiser. He inherited a strong officer corps and a good military tradition, and a fantastically organised army, but did nothing to improve it. Indeed, when it resisted his attempts at controlling it, he expanded his bodyguard (Waffen SS) to a full army, and that army was exceptionally crappy except for 3-4 divisions mid-war. He got involved at too much detail, concerned himself about 'signals' sent and much more.

**Tactics.** Can the general win battles under different circumstances, against differing and sometimes superior opponents? Can the general delay superior opponents and keep his forces together under dire circumstances? Can the general handle a guerilla insurgency as well as a line battle?

Hitler used amateur military tactics and early ww1 thinking, and refused to learn. He was a lousy tactician.

**Strategy.** Can the general see the big picture, can he use his victories to knock out enemies of the war, can he follow up on successes and not go headlong into pursuits where he will be stranded? Can he get allies and improve his positions without fighting? Does he have an understanding on how to undermine the enemy ability to fight?

Here I would actually give Hitler something. He was good at this. He knew the need for strategic terrain, knew the need for allies and knew the importance of raw materials. However, he lacked the planning for a long war, which brings him down from an excellent grade.

**Politics.** Can the general keep in position despite others trying to remove him? Can he get allies, can he work with those allies? Can he secure resources from himself, work with his seniors, juniors and equals? Can he drum warring tribes together against a common foe? Can he build a legacy that lasts? Can he appoint the right men to the right place and promote competent people?

Here Hitler fails again. He was unable to take criticism and removed anyone who opposed his ideas, filling the OKW with yes-sayers. He got into power and remained there, but that is also all he managed to do in this area. His legacy is destroyed and mere mentioning of it is an insult.

So, 1 good, 3 failures. Not a very good general, I say. If I would place Hitler anywhere, it would be as a Staff Major at an Army Command.",null,0,cdo0re0,1ribha,askhistorians,top_day,9

idjet,"Before answering this question I've reviewed the chapter to refresh my memory. It is very dramatic with multiple players speaking, like an episode of Law and Order.

We are very fortunate to have transcripts of actual inquisitions of this same time period and so we could go through a comparative analysis. But this would be fruitless: Umberto Eco needed to serve a story before anything. He made the choice to treat a session of inquiry, an *inquisito*, more like a trial for his dramatic effect. 

*Inquisitos* were not trials during the medieval period: they were question and answer between inquisitor and subject, mostly a dialogue that was lead by inquisitor. We have no evidence that there was neither some broad audience nor multiple subjects for these sessions: a lot of the transcripts have marginalia notations like 'ask so-and-so follow up question' and other manuscript indicators that suggest if there were other subjects in the room they might have eventually said *something* that would be recorded. So we gather the *inquisito* was inquisitor(s), scribes/notaries, perhaps noble(s) as secular witness to proceedings, perhaps Bishops, monks or other clergy watching and listening. Certainly we read stirring conversations: stunning displays of logic and argument; but not high theatrics.

Umberto Eco modeled his Bernardo Gui after the real Gui. Here is an example from Gui's own manual about dealing with subjects who attempted to double-speak or use the inquisitor's own language against him:

&gt;When one of them has been seized and is brought up for examination, he comes as if without a qualm, as if conscious of no wrongdoing on his part, and as if he felt entirely safe. When asked if he knows why he has been arrested, he replies 
quite calmly and with a smile, ""Sir, I should be glad to learn the reason from you."" When he is questioned about the faith which he holds and believes, he replies, ""I believe all that a good Christian should believe."" Pressed as to what he means by 'a good Christian', he answers, ""One who believes as the Holy Church teaches us to believe and hold."" When asked what he calls the Holy Church, he replies, ""Sir, what you say and believe to be the Holy Church."" If he is told, ""I believe the Holy Church to be the Roman Church, over which presides our lord pope and other prelates subordinate to him,"" then he responds, ""That I do believe,"" meaning that he believes that I believe this. [*Practica officii Inquisitionis heretice pravitatis* (Conduct of the 
Inquisition into Heretical Wickedness)], c1323]

Eco is a medievalist, a trained historian and philologist, and so his work would be accurate - he likes to put his medievalist knowledge on display in The Name of the Rose. His portrayal of Gui matches with what we know of him: smart, clever and a rigid, determined, dogmatic Catholic.

Qweniden,"In fact the oldest known archeological evidence of human alcohol production is from China.

Between 7000 to 5800 BC in what is now called Jiahu China there was a village where an alcoholic beverage was made.  Scientific analysis of pottery shards reveals a beverage made from rice, honey and either a grape or hawthorn berries.  We know its either grapes or hawthorn berries because those are the only types of fruits from the area that create a specific type of acid that was found.

Fermentable sugars would mostly have come from the honey but there are various methods to convert the starches in grains such as rice into fermentable sugar as well.

France was scared at this time and lashing out at anyone that was even tagently connected to royalists, so defending Louis would be impossible since the prosecution wanted him dead.

It must be noted that Louis wasn't a terrible king, he just wasn't the king France needed at the time. He let a financial crisis explode into a sociopolitical crisis and the people whom didn't have a voice had one, and they wanted to lash out at Louis for simply being born a king.

TheVitruvianDan,"The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England saw William of Orange overthrow the Catholic King James II and establish himself as William III. Hobbes was referenced quite a bit in discussions following James II's fleeing of the country.

The two broad political groups the Tories and Whigs tried to legally justify the overthrow of the king. The Tories (who tended to believe in Divine Right of Kings) maintained that by fleeing England James had, in effect, abdicated (he had left the throne vacant). Importantly for our purposes though, the Whigs began referencing Hobbes and Locke and others who espoused the idea of the social contract. They maintained that James II had broken his contract with the people through his attempts to destroy the Anglican Church (long story) and various other examples of his poor rule (mostly through ignoring Parliament and therefore the people). This then came to a close when the Convention Parliament declared James to have abdicated and listed all his failings as king and pronounced William and Mary (James' daughter) as King and Queen. This was later formalised as the Bill of Right. William, for his part, undertook to uphold the Protestant religion as King and to work with Parliament.

It is obviously difficult to trace Hobbes' exact influence on the settlement but we do know that he was one of the key thinkers referenced in the discussions.

The viewpoint you're mentioning here - that the Muslim conquests were the defining break with the classical world, not the fall of Rome - has become quite popular over the past few decades. Peter Brown is probably the best known proponent. Certainly Brown's ideas have been a needed corrective to some old cliches. 476 - the date when the last nominal Western Emperor was deposed - wasn't particularly important, as it was merely the continuation of a pattern of barbarian co-opting of imperial institutions that had been taking place for the better part of a century. And the popular notion that the Dark Ages were an era of total ignorance is nonsense. 

But personally, I'd side with Peter Heather and others in saying that , while Brown's ideas are insightful, they go too far in minimizing the upheaval that happened in Western Europe. 

Trade, population, literacy and the production of books, and large-scale construction all declined massively in the late fifth and sixth centuries. The change wasn't instantaneous and it wasn't uniform  (Britain was the most affected, Spain the least so; as late as the 630s Isidore of Seville was basically a old-school Roman intellectual), but it was drastic.  In the 3rd century an aristocrat could travel from Scotland to Mesopotamia without ever leaving a common cultural system, but two centuries later that unity was gone.

I'll post it here now and edit in a TL;DR when I'm done reading it.

Edit: as promised, TL;DR.

First off, we know that the original symbol for 50 was not L, but a three-pointed V, like a trident.  And we know that D was a D with a line through it (kind of like Ð).  And there are several early versions of M, including a circle with an X through it.  This will be important later.

There are many, many, many theories proposed over the years, some valid, and some not.  The one this guy is proposing involves set symbols for 1, 10, 100, and 1000, with 5, 50, and 500 representing those symbols cut in half.  

5: V is the top half of X.  

50: The original symbol for 100 (attested in Etruscan inscriptions) was an X with a line down the middle, which when cut in half becomes the trident thing, eventually simplified to an L.  

100: The X with a line down the middle was simplified to something like this: )|( Which ultimately became a C.

500: And the circle with an X through it, representing 1000, forms a Ð when cut in half, which became D.

1000:  The circle with an X lasted a good long time, and it wasn't until later that an M for *mille* became the convention.  (C definitely does not stand for *centum*, by the way, because the Etruscans used it first.)",null,1,cdnk753,1ri4qy,askhistorians,top_day,7

elijahsnow,"Well, yeah. Rome was established about 700BCE and began to expand out in the 4C BCE and Greeks had at this time occupied a portion of the Italian Peninsula south of Rome. 

 Their association went back further though considering their alphabet was derived from them before Rome's establishment under the Latin people. These people would have come from somewhere in Northern Europe (most likely) and have been at the very least before the establishment of Rome been conquered by either Phillip or Alexander of Macedon.

 A lot  of what we know today about Greece comes to us via the Romans. Things like Art and Literature and accounts of historical events are of fascination to the Romans. They would have been aware intimately of the myths and the real histories often collecting Greek memorabilia as antiques or as family heirlooms. 

They endeared themselves to The greeks somewhat and tried to make themselves more like them, even claiming they had descended from the original inhabitants of Troy. 

The histories of Greece will have been studied also by people such as Virgil and Cicero and heck even the Generals with regards to warfare. There is reference to these myths and events in Roman writing.

k1990,"Okay, so this answer is primarily to do with the chronology and strategic progress of the war, as an attempt to explain why there aren't really many examples of Allied and Soviet soldiers interacting. Links are generally to Wikipedia articles to provide a top-level overview, as I'm at work and don't have time to dig out better sources right now. So here goes:

The primary reason for the scarcity of accounts is simply that the US/Commonwealth and Soviet ground forces spent the vast majority of the war fighting on entirely different fronts, thousands of miles apart:

- the USSR didn't enter the war against Germany until [June 1941](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_barbarossa), and was preoccupied with the challenge of pushing a German invasion back through southern Russia and the Caucasus;
- by that point (ie. after [the Dunkirk evacuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation) in May/June 1940 and [the fall of France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_France) in late June 1940) the non-Soviet Allies are not engaged in ground combat in mainland Europe again until [the invasion of Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Italy) in September 1943);
- the non-Soviet Allied ground war from 1940-43 is focused primarily in north Africa ([the Western Desert Campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_Campaign)) against Germany and Italy and [against Japan in the Far East](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_war);
- the [entire Soviet ground war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_\(World_War_II\)) is a push towards Germany from Russia through the Caucasus, the Baltic states and Eastern Europe and parts of Scandinavia, so the US/Commonwealth forces and the Soviets are divided by pretty much the entire continent of Europe for the most of the war;
- in the Far East, the USSR did not declare war on Japan until [9 August 1945](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War_\(1945\)), so played almost no role in the Pacific War.

All of that strategic chronology is why the main examples of interactions between Soviet and non-Soviet Allied ground forces during the war come from 1945, when they essentially meet halfway after invading Germany from opposite sides (see [Elbe Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe_Day) for a brief overview).

The wild card, which I don't know enough about to speak of (but which someone else will hopefully discuss) is [the joint Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in the autumn of 1941](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran), to lock down the Persian oil-fields and secure a key east/west supply corridor.

At the macro/geopolitical and economic levels, and in the naval war in the Atlantic, there's a lot of very, very interesting interplay between the US, UK and USSR, but at a ground-based tactical/strategic level there just isn't very much fighting side-by-side. ",null,5,cdnh9he,1ri35i,askhistorians,top_day,13
Acritas,"There were several areas of interactions - mostly lend-lease operations.

In 1941:

UK and USSR troops took control of Iran, advancing from south and north respectively. Afghanistan was also controlled by allied troops. 

Prior to 1945, areas of contact were limited by lend-lease supply routes:

* Arctic supply routes 

* Persian corridor 

* Pacific Route

* Alaska-Siberia Air Route

In 1945

* direct contacts between fronline troops were quite common. 

Let me describe in details:

Arctic supply routes (PQ/QP convoys from Scotland to Murmansk, after 1942 - JW/RA; also aerial route) were dangerous. There were several instances when allied forces fought together to protect convoys against Luftwaffe and submarine attacks. Yes, interactions were quite friendly, although incidents and misunderstandings did happen. For example, the losses of  convoy [PQ-17](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_PQ_17) could be attributed to decision to scatter convoy (blame UK) and to unencrypted radio message about convoy (blame USSR).

Iranian corridor was quite safe. Since each ally controlled a separate part of Iran (North was USSR-controlled and South was US and British-controlled), interaction happened mostly at checkpoints and between lend-lease operators (e.g. soviet pilots, flying lend-lease planes)

For Pacific naval route there were several incidents when US submarines mistakenly fired torpedoes at USSR cargo ships. In total, 6 USSR ships were sank by US Navy and 1 by Japanese. And that was the safest naval route.

1945 encounters when unexpected and uncoordinated sometimes led to friendly-fire instances, but such incidents didn't give rise to any significant unfriendliness. And when coordinated, it usually was quite festive - see [Elbe day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe_Day). 

As an example of friendly fire, Ivan Kozhedub was attacked by a pair of american P-51s and had to shoot them down after they kept attacking . Later it turns out that they mistook his plane for FW-190 (Kozhedub flew La-7).

The Wampanoag heard the gunfire and thought that there was trouble in the colony. Perhaps the colonists were under attack, or perhaps they had launched an assault of their own. Either way, it warranted investigation. Massasoit Ousamequin, better known merely as Massasoit though that's his title rather than his name, led 90 men to colony to find out what was going on.

The future of a factory worker's son did not depend on his relationship with his father, who had no control over the factory and probably didn't even own the house the family lived in.

It should be noted that this is all a very Western point of view. But so is the question in itself, as concepts of marriage and dating still vary wildly from culture to culture.",null,8,cdnilve,1ri0sb,askhistorians,top_day,83

myrmecologist,"In understanding the tumultuous last days of the British Empire in India it becomes convenient to focus on specific personalities. The cult of Gandhi or Jinnah, the tact of Patel, the dynamism of Mountbatten --- such epithets may have some validity, but they are largely unable to help us consider the events leading to the break up of the Indian subcontinent.

The anti-colonial struggle was, at least at the height of Gandhian nationalism, primarily a political struggle. Jinnah's positioning for greater minority rights was not too illogical in such an environment. Ambedkar, too, was struggling to garner political representation for the backward castes. We have to thus be cognizant of the fact that the reach of the Congress, while expansive and entrenched, could not be totally representative of the whole of British India. There were far too many factions with many diverse demands that jostled for space in the anti-colonial movement of the 20th century British India.

The demands of the All India Muslim League (Muslim League in short) were largely couched in the language of electoral politics. The League's fundamental demand was for a more equitable presence in the quasi-representative measures that had been initiated by the British Government, particularly in the 1930s. The League purported to represent all Muslims in the subcontinent. But such a claim (just like Congress's claims of all-encompassing representation) was limited and extremely provincial. The League had a massive presence in Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) and a fair hold of Punjab. It's presence in the United Provinces too was sizable. Yet, it could not contend with the organizational might of the Indian National Congress. As such, the bargaining tools at the League's disposal were limited. And this is crucial --- most of the demands that Jinnah presented were *strategies of negotiation*. The demands were meant to garner a few crucial benefits for the Muslims. While there was legitimate concern amongst the Muslim community (and not just among those who identified with the Muslim League) about the extent to which their rights would be safeguarded or violated under a Hindu majority regime, 
there was no concerted effort to channelize those demands to the idea of a separate Muslim nation. 

As late as 1946, with the Cabinet Mission Plan about to be bludgeoned under the weight of contestations, the League had no idea what exactly it meant through its recurrent threats for a separate Pakistan. Jinnah too was a product of the nationalist politics which birthed Tilak, Gandhi et al. His faith in representative politics was steadfast, and there is not much in his actions for us to consider him directly responsible for the Partition. 

By 1946, in fact, Jinnah's hold over the Muslim League had considerably weakened. The absence of a definitive idea of what exactly it meant to want a separate Muslim nation is suggestive of the inchoate nature of the idea. Jinnah was the League's ideologue and he seemed to regard the two-nation idea as a mere tool to ensure the safety of the Muslims and better representation in administration. The ground reality, however, seemed more brutally in favor of the two-nation theory. The 1946 Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta seemed to, ironically, legitimize the idea of an unbridgeable divide between the two communities. As the historian Ayesha Jalal contends, there is enough evidence for us to doubt this hypothesis. What is more likely is that other divisive factors, like the divide between the zamindars and laborers, the animosity between traders and merchants and of course the presence of various Muslim petty gangs seeking to profit from the chaos, magnified the Hindu-Muslim divide of the riots. The Congress, safe in its hold over the government formed by the Cabinet Mission plan, quite likely overestimated the extent to which the League commanded power at the ground level. The majority opinion among many in the League too favored a break once it became clear that the Congress was less inclined to negotiate with them. Jinnah, one could argue, was stuck between an uncompromising Congress, a hesitant British Government and an impatient set of followers. Converting the two-nation idea into a veritable reality seemed the only way to break the deadlock.

Jinnah, thus, is to be blamed if we understand history from the lens of nationalist Indian historiography. He could be blamed for highlighting the societal fault lines of the Indian nationalist imagination. Jinnah could be blamed for stoking the fires of Hindu-Muslim animosity. Jinnah could be held accountable for the hundreds who were killed on the streets of Calcutta, or for the many millions who were butchered on both sides of Punjab. Jinnah could be blamed giving birth to Pakistan, for its illegitimate child of Kashmir, for making the subcontinent a nuclear war zone. The Quaid-i-Azam could be held responsible for all this. 

But if we do so, not only do we judge the man unfairly, we also accord him an influence much higher than what he wielded (For if he was indeed responsible for all the ills of the Indian subcontinent, he had to be man of immense influence, right?). Jinnah could be *blamed* for India's partition to the extent that we consider the demand for a separate Muslim state of Pakistan illegitimate. ",null,0,cdnv2wc,1rhz3e,askhistorians,top_day,4
XenophonTheAthenian,"Oh boy oh boy, naughty words. I think I'll share one of the nasty phrases I know, and it's one of the tamer ones. We find in Aristophanes' *Birds* the phrase ""He's gone to the crows."" That's an idiomatic expression that's difficult to translate into English. What's usually said is that ""Go to the crows"" means more or less the same thing as modern English ""Go to hell."" But it's not *really* that good a translation. ""Go to the crows"" doesn't have a meaning *quite* as strong as ""Go f\*\*k yourself,"" but it's not a very nice thing to say. To go to the crows implies death, and not just death, but that your body will be lying out in the fields for the crows to feast on. Maybe that's not a big deal to hear these days (although there still is the phrase ""Go die in a hole,"" even though its meaning has been pretty significantly blunted) but in the ancient world that's on *nasty* thing to say to someone. It means that not only do you wish the end of his existence, but by expressing that wish you're actually *cursing* him. Plus, you're cursing him with a death without proper burial and funerary rites, doomed to be the food of the carrion birds, cursing his soul to torment forever (since the Greeks, like pretty much everyone else, believed that lack of proper funerary rites led to various forms of netherworld unhappiness). Not a nice thing to wish for someone.

With curses in mind, let's also recall some of the Athenian curse tablets. Curses are a frequent feature of tragedy, and in Greece curses more or less take the form of an invocation of the god or an oath to the god that takes a negative form. So instead of invoking the god for the purpose of blessing you or allowing an action to happen, you're asking him to harm somebody else. The curses were written on lead tablets and read aloud. These curse tablets aren't insults *per se*, but a lot of them say some *very* nasty things about the victims of the curse and ask the god to do some pretty evil things to them. A lot of these have never been published or translated, but they ask the god to destroy people's livers and lungs and other organs, to inflict them with poxes, to chill their minds and spirits, to make them deaf, mute, and blind, to go die in various ways (including many tablets that have been buried under houses or just underground with the inscription, ""Here I have buried so-and-so, etc."" Sounds an awful lot like ""Go die in a hole you S.O.B.""). 

In a similar light we see that many of the graffiti inscriptions at Pompeii are pretty insulting. They rarely actually insult people with swears or anything like that, but they frequently point out very embarrassing things or make fun of people for certain things. So we find that there's a famous graffito that says (in polite terms) ""Lesbianus, you defecate here and write 'Hello everyone!'"" A similar graffito on a different building actually writes a curse out: ""To the person defecating here: Beware this curse. If you look down at this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy."" There are a lot of things about taking dumps in Pompeii, and the Romans were big fans of making fun of defecation (rather like the Greeks, who seem to have found farts and penis jokes extremely funny). We also get ones that say things like, ""Secundus screws boys"" and ""Phileros is a eunich!"" and funny things like that (just as a side note, my favorite graffito at Pompeii of those that have been published so far reads ""A person who buggers a fire burns his penis."" Wise words).",null,7,cdnfb65,1rhwm4,askhistorians,top_day,49
caffarelli,"Okay I’ll be game and start us off by explaining the two nouns in my post: 

* COXCOMB: More or less, this meant like an uppity dude, who struts around like a rooster, generally being a butt. 

I also have a minorly amusing story about this one. I first came to know this word from Charles Burney, who translated [a letter written by Metastasio, who was quoting Caffarelli who called a guy that right before challenging him to a duel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1g4bp9/tuesday_trivia_reading_other_peoples_mail/cagoeak) Now, if you actually go look at Metastasio’s original letter in the original Italian, Caffarelli called that composer something *much ruder* than coxcomb, he called him “cazzo,” which you can still shout with gusto on the streets of Italy, and probably could be translated to “cock” or “dick” in British or American English, respectively. So Burney censored history a bit when he translated that letter! There’s no way he didn’t know the full impact of that word, having spent loads of time in Italy, he had to clean Caffarelli up for publishing by putting the insult down as the rather limp “coxcomb” in English. But you can’t scrub the swearwords out of Caffarelli’s magnificent mouth for long, haHA! I have put them back. 

* BLUESTOCKING: I love this word! A bluestocking was an over-educated and frumpy woman, as the term was used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It comes from blue wool stockings being a practical, hardy choice of legwear over more fashionable options like black silk. It was also the name of a women’s intellectual club in the late 1700s with such notable members as Ava Lovelace and Fanny Burney (daughter of my friend above Charles Burney!) It’s also the name of a [modern gender studies magazine.](http://bluestockingsmag.com/)

Somewhat more surprising, to me anyway, was their statement that early American baseball rules were sometimes specific about which words could not be used on the field.

ScipioAsina,"Hello all! I've been pretty quiet here recently (drowning in school and work), but I thought I'd share a Sumerian insult I came across in my research. B. R. Foster comments: 

&gt; In Sumerian school debates... the interlocutors plied each other with elaborately artificed insults about each other's genealogy, appearance, and level of education, presumably with an eye to raising a laugh in the gallery. An example begins, **""He is spawn of a dog, seed of a wolf, stench of a mongoose, a helpless hyena's whelp, a carapaced fox, an addlepated mountain monkey whose reasoning is nonsensical.""** The parents of a Sumerian scholar who is failing in school invite his teacher for dinner. After a fine repast and a handsome present, the teacher discourses warmly on the youngster's talents and prospects. (""Humor and Wit in the Ancient Near East,"" in *Civilizations of the Ancient Near East* 4, ed. J. M. Sasson [1995], 2464)

I suppose someone today could still find this offensive, though much of the context would be lost. The same chapter also contains a curious political quip, which seems potentially insulting:

&gt; An Amorite nobleman allows himself a political joke in writing to the queen of Qatara, a city in northern Syria. Acknowledging her dispatch of a shipment of small fish, such as her own husband, the king of Qatara, esteems, he writes, ""Just as your husband Aqba-khammu has learned to appreciate 'little fish' when in Qatara and Karana [two small kingdoms], I myself have always had a liking for the 'big fish' in Shubat-Enlil, Ekallatum, Mari, and Babylon [capitals of major kingdoms].

yodatsracist,"Contemporary English lacks a [T-V distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction), that is, we just have one pronoun for the second person, formal and informal (and plural and singular for that matter).  While French has *tu* (informal singular) and *vous* (forma plural and singular; informal plural), German has *du* (informal singular), *ihr* (informal plural), and *Sie* (formal, singular and plural), Turkish has *sen* (informal singular) and *siz* (formal singular and plural; informal plural), etc.  English has just ""you"" for the whole kit and caboodle.  English obviously *used to* have an singular, informal pronoun: thou (as an object: thee, possessive before a constant: thy, possessive before a vowel: thine).  When the King James Version of the Bible says ""thou"", it is not being more formal but more *in*formal.  For example, the commandment ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" is ""Tu ne commettras point d'adultère"" in French.  The ""thou"" just became calcified, and as we forgot what it meant, some people began to assume it was more formal as it only appeared in the context of formal, liturgical language. (Also, isn't it kind of freaky that the commandments are in the singular?  You, yes, *you* shalt not commit adultery)

So how does that relate to insulting people?  If you've learned a foreign language that has a T-V distinction, you've realized that it is way easier to be rude in those languages.  I've made an ass of myself many times in Turkish by using ""sen"" for a boss, state employee, or old person when I should use ""siz"" (people are momentarily offended, but give me a pass as a foreigner), or using ""siz"" when I should use ""sen"" (""Yodats, you're so formal!  Chill out."").  In French and German, there are even verbs for speaking in the formal and familiar with someone.  You can *[vouvoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vouvoyer)* or *[siezen](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/siezen#German)* someone if you're being formal or polite, and you can *[tutoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tutoyer#French)* or [*duzen*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duzen) them if you're being informal... or condescending.

In English, the verb equivalent is ""to thou (someone)"".  This is where it gets awesome.  During the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, it is widely alleged that Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, declared his utter contempt for Raleigh by saying:

&gt; For a man who could not have children (whether due to impotence, sterility, age, etc.) homosexual relations may have been acceptable. One slang term for such a man seems to have been *kottrinn inn blauði*, or ""soft cat"" as reported in *Stúfs þáttr*, an epilogue to *Laxdæla saga*, in a conversation between the Norwegian king Haraldr *harðráði* and Stúfr, the son of Þórðr *kottr* (Þórðr the Cat): puzzled by the unusual nickname, Haraldr asks Stúfr whether his father Þórðr was *kottrinn inn hvati eða inn blauði*, ""the hard or the soft cat."" Stúfr declines to answer despite the implied insult, but the king admits that his question was foolish because ""the person who is soft (*blauðr*) could not be a father"" (Jochens 76).

It thus follows the time-honed tradition of using implied sexual submission as an insult. I personally think it's rather cute.

[Here's a bit of detail from the Alutiiq Museum](http://alutiiqmuseum.org/language-studies/the-word-of-the-week.html):

&gt;Among Alutiiqs, behaving like a big shot can be dangerous. Boasting is not only bad manners, it can poison your luck. A boastful hunter may offend the animals his family depends on and cause them to avoid his arrows. In the case of a bear, boasting can cause the animal to become enraged. A braggart can bring starvation on his family or get himself killed.

&gt;Despite warnings about boastful behavior, Alutiiq stories feature the raucous, boastful Raven, an obnoxious bird that does great deeds. In these stories, Raven lives in Alutiiq communities and can speak in Alutiiq, but he is arrogant, dirty, and impolite to his Elders. Yet despite his poor behavior, Raven is smart and keeps his promises, and he ends up succeeding where others fail.

&gt;In one legend, Raven lives with his elderly grandmother at the edge of a large village. Here, he is so disliked that he must live off refuse from the beach. One harsh winter, when hunting was impossible, the villagers began to starve. Raven, who was always able to scavenge enough food for himself and his grandmother, asked the village chief what he would give him if he were able to bring the chief food. The chief offered Raven his oldest daughter in marriage. Pleased with the offer, Raven ordered his grandmother to clean their house and pecked her until she complied. Then he scavenged a bundle of dried fish and won the chief's daughter. But the Raven smelled so bad that the girl refused to stay with him and went home to her father. 

&gt;The next winter, famine struck the community again. Raven sent his grandmother to the home of another young woman and offered her food to marry him. She agreed, and despite the Raven’s stench, she stayed in his home. Raven then captured a giant whale and brought it to the starving village to share with all those who had treated him poorly. They gorged themselves on blubber, eating so much that they soon died. Only Raven, his grandmother, and his faithful wife lived.

AnOldHope,"We all know that religious conferences are all about being pious, right? So how about a (pious) death threat on the floor of a religious conference?

As Poterfield has documented, doubt, after the fervor of the Revolution wore off, was pervasive in the antebellum period of the US. Religious groups moved from prophetic statements to considerably more conservative position. Methodist views on slavery was one of those positions that we can trace the genealogy from a *respectively* liberal position to a more conservative one. 

Welsey, the founder of Methodism, had originally been an outspoken proponent of antislavery. His 1774 pamphlet, *Thoughts Upon Slavery*, was reprinted a number of times, [including in the US.](http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/wesley/wesley.html) In the pamphlet, Wesley argues that black folks should be immediately manumitted. 

&gt;O, whatever it costs, put a stop to [slavery’s] cry before it be too late; instantly, at any price, were it the half of your goods, deliver thyself from blood guiltiness! Thy hands, they bed, they furniture; thy house, thy lands, are at present stained with blood.

&gt;Arise, and help these that have no helper, whose blood is spilt upon the ground like water! Are not these also the work of thine own hands, the purchase of thy Son's blood? Stir them up to cry unto thee in the land of their captivity; and let their complaint come up before thee; let it enter into thy ears! Make even those that lead them away captive to pity them, and turn their captivity as the rivers in the south. O burst thou all their chains in sunder; more especially the chains of their sins! Thou Saviour of all, make them free, that they may be free indeed!

Wesley would even go on to write Wilberforce, the British abolitionist, a letter in support. Nevertheless, questions should arise about Wesley and how important antislavery was to his cause. We only have one extant reference, in Wesley's journal, to him giving an antislavery speech. In fact, Wesley's whole system of theology was about the gradual removal of sin while working towards perfection. Wesley's system lends itself more to gradual emancipation, but emancipation nonetheless. Yet, American Methodism would change its view.

One can track the continuous walking back of the antislavery rhetoric through the *Book of Discipline* (BOD), which outlines the polity of the Methodist church. While Wesley called for immediate release, the first BOD  for the US (1784) allowed, under the section ""What Methods can we take to  extirpate Slavery,"" for slaveowners to become members. However, the BOD does make a caveat: slaveowners, ""upon notice,"" were to gradually emancipate their slaves; certain regions of the country were probably more apt than others to give (a quick) notice. Additionally, there was a method to their emancipation: ""And every Slave under the age of Twenty, [will be manumitted] as soon as they arrive at the Age of Twenty-five at farthest.” In 1838, Georgia Methodists would argue ""[i]t is the sense of the Georgia Annual Conference that slavery, as it exists in the United States, is not a moral evil,” and no rules concerning manumission were needed for slaveholding members. American Methodism was far afield of Wesley's original call for manumission.

But I promised you a death threat! And a death threat you shall have.

In 1836, at General Conference (a quadrennial gathering of the Methodists, like comic con but not as cool, to decide issues of polity) there was a particularly acrimonious debate. Rev. Orange Scott, an abolitionist from New York, had just implored the church to embrace abolitionism. Speaking against Scott was Rev. Dr. Andrew Smith. Smith hailed from Virginia. 

Smith denounced modern abolitionism as folly, and claimed that modern abolitionism makes slaveholders into criminals against God; it makes slaveholders unchristian. Scott rose to argue that, if Smith was referring to him, then Smith had misrepresented Scott's position. Smith tells Scott ""I have no more to do with that brother, than if he did not exist."" Smith hits his point home: ""I wish to God, he were in Heaven,"" and while his words were not recorded perfectly, Smith added with fire something along the lines of wishing all abolitionists in heaven right now. In other words, and this is a point Lucius C. Matlack makes in his retelling of the events, that Smith had wished all abolitionists dead.

Just a few years later, in 1843, Scott would lead an exodus from the Methodist Episcopal Church. He, along with Matlack, would found the Methodist Wesleyan Church, a small group of Methodist abolitionists. Scott presaged the coming split.

Sometimes the insults were a battle in themselves, sometimes the precursor to armed duels. You see it in the Illiad, but there are famous examples in Northern Europe, of Loki turning up to a party to insult all the gods, or the famous Scottish example of The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie in the 16th century where two poets take turns insulting each other.

XenophonTheAthenian,"Oh boy oh boy, naughty words. I think I'll share one of the nasty phrases I know, and it's one of the tamer ones. We find in Aristophanes' *Birds* the phrase ""He's gone to the crows."" That's an idiomatic expression that's difficult to translate into English. What's usually said is that ""Go to the crows"" means more or less the same thing as modern English ""Go to hell."" But it's not *really* that good a translation. ""Go to the crows"" doesn't have a meaning *quite* as strong as ""Go f\*\*k yourself,"" but it's not a very nice thing to say. To go to the crows implies death, and not just death, but that your body will be lying out in the fields for the crows to feast on. Maybe that's not a big deal to hear these days (although there still is the phrase ""Go die in a hole,"" even though its meaning has been pretty significantly blunted) but in the ancient world that's on *nasty* thing to say to someone. It means that not only do you wish the end of his existence, but by expressing that wish you're actually *cursing* him. Plus, you're cursing him with a death without proper burial and funerary rites, doomed to be the food of the carrion birds, cursing his soul to torment forever (since the Greeks, like pretty much everyone else, believed that lack of proper funerary rites led to various forms of netherworld unhappiness). Not a nice thing to wish for someone.

With curses in mind, let's also recall some of the Athenian curse tablets. Curses are a frequent feature of tragedy, and in Greece curses more or less take the form of an invocation of the god or an oath to the god that takes a negative form. So instead of invoking the god for the purpose of blessing you or allowing an action to happen, you're asking him to harm somebody else. The curses were written on lead tablets and read aloud. These curse tablets aren't insults *per se*, but a lot of them say some *very* nasty things about the victims of the curse and ask the god to do some pretty evil things to them. A lot of these have never been published or translated, but they ask the god to destroy people's livers and lungs and other organs, to inflict them with poxes, to chill their minds and spirits, to make them deaf, mute, and blind, to go die in various ways (including many tablets that have been buried under houses or just underground with the inscription, ""Here I have buried so-and-so, etc."" Sounds an awful lot like ""Go die in a hole you S.O.B.""). 

In a similar light we see that many of the graffiti inscriptions at Pompeii are pretty insulting. They rarely actually insult people with swears or anything like that, but they frequently point out very embarrassing things or make fun of people for certain things. So we find that there's a famous graffito that says (in polite terms) ""Lesbianus, you defecate here and write 'Hello everyone!'"" A similar graffito on a different building actually writes a curse out: ""To the person defecating here: Beware this curse. If you look down at this curse, may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy."" There are a lot of things about taking dumps in Pompeii, and the Romans were big fans of making fun of defecation (rather like the Greeks, who seem to have found farts and penis jokes extremely funny). We also get ones that say things like, ""Secundus screws boys"" and ""Phileros is a eunich!"" and funny things like that (just as a side note, my favorite graffito at Pompeii of those that have been published so far reads ""A person who buggers a fire burns his penis.""

caffarelli,"Okay I’ll be game and start us off by explaining the two nouns in my post: 

* COXCOMB: More or less, this meant like an uppity dude, who struts around like a rooster, generally being a butt. 

I also have a minorly amusing story about this one. I first came to know this word from Charles Burney, who translated [a letter written by Metastasio, who was quoting Caffarelli who called a guy that right before challenging him to a duel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1g4bp9/tuesday_trivia_reading_other_peoples_mail/cagoeak) Now, if you actually go look at Metastasio’s original letter in the original Italian, Caffarelli called that composer something *much ruder* than coxcomb, he called him “cazzo,” which you can still shout with gusto on the streets of Italy, and probably could be translated to “cock” or “dick” in British or American English, respectively. So Burney censored history a bit when he translated that letter! There’s no way he didn’t know the full impact of that word, having spent loads of time in Italy, he had to clean Caffarelli up for publishing by putting the insult down as the rather limp “coxcomb” in English. But you can’t scrub the swearwords out of Caffarelli’s magnificent mouth for long, haHA! I have put them back. 

* BLUESTOCKING: I love this word! A bluestocking was an over-educated and frumpy woman, as the term was used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It comes from blue wool stockings being a practical, hardy choice of legwear over more fashionable options like black silk. It was also the name of a women’s intellectual club in the late 1700s with such notable members as Ava Lovelace and Fanny Burney (daughter of my friend above Charles Burney!) It’s also the name of a [modern gender studies magazine.](http://bluestockingsmag.com/)

Military Court Martials, which painstakingly recorded everything, were particularly useful.

Somewhat more surprising, to me anyway, was their statement that early American baseball rules were sometimes specific about which words could not be used on the field. As baseball became less a men's club game and more of a spectator sport, they had to be stricter about the conduct of players on the field.

ScipioAsina,"Hello all! I've been pretty quiet here recently (drowning in school and work), but I thought I'd share a Sumerian insult I came across in my research. B. R. Foster comments: 

&gt; In Sumerian school debates... the interlocutors plied each other with elaborately artificed insults about each other's genealogy, appearance, and level of education, presumably with an eye to raising a laugh in the gallery. An example begins, **""He is spawn of a dog, seed of a wolf, stench of a mongoose, a helpless hyena's whelp, a carapaced fox, an addlepated mountain monkey whose reasoning is nonsensical.""** The parents of a Sumerian scholar who is failing in school invite his teacher for dinner. After a fine repast and a handsome present, the teacher discourses warmly on the youngster's talents and prospects. (""Humor and Wit in the Ancient Near East,"" in *Civilizations of the Ancient Near East* 4, ed. J. M. Sasson [1995], 2464)

I suppose someone today could still find this offensive, though much of the context would be lost. The same chapter also contains a curious political quip, which seems potentially insulting:

&gt; An Amorite nobleman allows himself a political joke in writing to the queen of Qatara, a city in northern Syria. Acknowledging her dispatch of a shipment of small fish, such as her own husband, the king of Qatara, esteems, he writes, ""Just as your husband Aqba-khammu has learned to appreciate 'little fish' when in Qatara and Karana [two small kingdoms], I myself have always had a liking for the 'big fish' in Shubat-Enlil, Ekallatum, Mari, and Babylon [capitals of major kingdoms].

yodatsracist,"Contemporary English lacks a [T-V distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction), that is, we just have one pronoun for the second person, formal and informal (and plural and singular for that matter).  While French has *tu* (informal singular) and *vous* (forma plural and singular; informal plural), German has *du* (informal singular), *ihr* (informal plural), and *Sie* (formal, singular and plural), Turkish has *sen* (informal singular) and *siz* (formal singular and plural; informal plural), etc.  English has just ""you"" for the whole kit and caboodle.  English obviously *used to* have an singular, informal pronoun: thou (as an object: thee, possessive before a constant: thy, possessive before a vowel: thine).  When the King James Version of the Bible says ""thou"", it is not being more formal but more *in*formal.  For example, the commandment ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" is ""Tu ne commettras point d'adultère"" in French.  The ""thou"" just became calcified, and as we forgot what it meant, some people began to assume it was more formal as it only appeared in the context of formal, liturgical language. (Also, isn't it kind of freaky that the commandments are in the singular?  You, yes, *you* shalt not commit adultery)

So how does that relate to insulting people?  If you've learned a foreign language that has a T-V distinction, you've realized that it is way easier to be rude in those languages.  I've made an ass of myself many times in Turkish by using ""sen"" for a boss, state employee, or old person when I should use ""siz"" (people are momentarily offended, but give me a pass as a foreigner), or using ""siz"" when I should use ""sen"" (""Yodats, you're so formal!  Chill out."").  In French and German, there are even verbs for speaking in the formal and familiar with someone.  You can *[vouvoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vouvoyer)* or *[siezen](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/siezen#German)* someone if you're being formal or polite, and you can *[tutoyer](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tutoyer#French)* or [*duzen*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duzen) them if you're being informal... or condescending.

In English, the verb equivalent is ""to thou (someone)"".  This is where it gets awesome.  During the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, it is widely alleged that Sir Edward Coke, prosecuting for the Crown, declared his utter contempt for Raleigh by saying:

    I thou thee, thou traitor!

Riagu,"The Norse had rather creative insults concerning masculinity or the lack thereof. As relayed by the [Viking Answer Lady](http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/gayvik.shtml):

&gt; For a man who could not have children (whether due to impotence, sterility, age, etc.) homosexual relations may have been acceptable. One slang term for such a man seems to have been *kottrinn inn blauði*, or ""soft cat"" as reported in *Stúfs þáttr*, an epilogue to *Laxdæla saga*, in a conversation between the Norwegian king Haraldr *harðráði* and Stúfr, the son of Þórðr *kottr* (Þórðr the Cat): puzzled by the unusual nickname, Haraldr asks Stúfr whether his father Þórðr was *kottrinn inn hvati eða inn blauði*, ""the hard or the soft cat."" Stúfr declines to answer despite the implied insult, but the king admits that his question was foolish because ""the person who is soft (*blauðr*) could not be a father"" (Jochens 76).

It thus follows the time-honed tradition of using implied sexual submission as an insult. I personally think it's rather cute.

[Here's a bit of detail from the Alutiiq Museum](http://alutiiqmuseum.org/language-studies/the-word-of-the-week.html):

&gt;Among Alutiiqs, behaving like a big shot can be dangerous. Boasting is not only bad manners, it can poison your luck. A boastful hunter may offend the animals his family depends on and cause them to avoid his arrows. In the case of a bear, boasting can cause the animal to become enraged. A braggart can bring starvation on his family or get himself killed.

&gt;Despite warnings about boastful behavior, Alutiiq stories feature the raucous, boastful Raven, an obnoxious bird that does great deeds. In these stories, Raven lives in Alutiiq communities and can speak in Alutiiq, but he is arrogant, dirty, and impolite to his Elders. Yet despite his poor behavior, Raven is smart and keeps his promises, and he ends up succeeding where others fail.

&gt;In one legend, Raven lives with his elderly grandmother at the edge of a large village. Here, he is so disliked that he must live off refuse from the beach. One harsh winter, when hunting was impossible, the villagers began to starve. Raven, who was always able to scavenge enough food for himself and his grandmother, asked the village chief what he would give him if he were able to bring the chief food. The chief offered Raven his oldest daughter in marriage. Pleased with the offer, Raven ordered his grandmother to clean their house and pecked her until she complied. Then he scavenged a bundle of dried fish and won the chief's daughter. But the Raven smelled so bad that the girl refused to stay with him and went home to her father. 

&gt;The next winter, famine struck the community again. Raven sent his grandmother to the home of another young woman and offered her food to marry him. She agreed, and despite the Raven’s stench, she stayed in his home. Raven then captured a giant whale and brought it to the starving village to share with all those who had treated him poorly. They gorged themselves on blubber, eating so much that they soon died. Only Raven, his grandmother, and his faithful wife lived.

AnOldHope,"We all know that religious conferences are all about being pious, right? So how about a (pious) death threat on the floor of a religious conference?

As Poterfield has documented, doubt, after the fervor of the Revolution wore off, was pervasive in the antebellum period of the US. Religious groups moved from prophetic statements to considerably more conservative position. Methodist views on slavery was one of those positions that we can trace the genealogy from a *respectively* liberal position to a more conservative one. 

Welsey, the founder of Methodism, had originally been an outspoken proponent of antislavery. His 1774 pamphlet, *Thoughts Upon Slavery*, was reprinted a number of times, [including in the US.](http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/wesley/wesley.html) In the pamphlet, Wesley argues that black folks should be immediately manumitted. 

&gt;O, whatever it costs, put a stop to [slavery’s] cry before it be too late; instantly, at any price, were it the half of your goods, deliver thyself from blood guiltiness! Thy hands, they bed, they furniture; thy house, thy lands, are at present stained with blood.

&gt;Arise, and help these that have no helper, whose blood is spilt upon the ground like water! Are not these also the work of thine own hands, the purchase of thy Son's blood? Stir them up to cry unto thee in the land of their captivity; and let their complaint come up before thee; let it enter into thy ears! Make even those that lead them away captive to pity them, and turn their captivity as the rivers in the south. O burst thou all their chains in sunder; more especially the chains of their sins! Thou Saviour of all, make them free, that they may be free indeed!

Wesley would even go on to write Wilberforce, the British abolitionist, a letter in support. Nevertheless, questions should arise about Wesley and how important antislavery was to his cause. We only have one extant reference, in Wesley's journal, to him giving an antislavery speech. In fact, Wesley's whole system of theology was about the gradual removal of sin while working towards perfection. Wesley's system lends itself more to gradual emancipation, but emancipation nonetheless. Yet, American Methodism would change its view.

One can track the continuous walking back of the antislavery rhetoric through the *Book of Discipline* (BOD), which outlines the polity of the Methodist church. While Wesley called for immediate release, the first BOD  for the US (1784) allowed, under the section ""What Methods can we take to  extirpate Slavery,"" for slaveowners to become members. However, the BOD does make a caveat: slaveowners, ""upon notice,"" were to gradually emancipate their slaves; certain regions of the country were probably more apt than others to give (a quick) notice. Additionally, there was a method to their emancipation: ""And every Slave under the age of Twenty, [will be manumitted] as soon as they arrive at the Age of Twenty-five at farthest.” In 1838, Georgia Methodists would argue ""[i]t is the sense of the Georgia Annual Conference that slavery, as it exists in the United States, is not a moral evil,” and no rules concerning manumission were needed for slaveholding members. American Methodism was far afield of Wesley's original call for manumission.

But I promised you a death threat! And a death threat you shall have.

In 1836, at General Conference (a quadrennial gathering of the Methodists, like comic con but not as cool, to decide issues of polity) there was a particularly acrimonious debate. Rev. Orange Scott, an abolitionist from New York, had just implored the church to embrace abolitionism. Speaking against Scott was Rev. Dr. Andrew Smith. Smith hailed from Virginia. 

Smith denounced modern abolitionism as folly, and claimed that modern abolitionism makes slaveholders into criminals against God; it makes slaveholders unchristian. Scott rose to argue that, if Smith was referring to him, then Smith had misrepresented Scott's position. Smith tells Scott ""I have no more to do with that brother, than if he did not exist."" Smith hits his point home: ""I wish to God, he were in Heaven,"" and while his words were not recorded perfectly, Smith added with fire something along the lines of wishing all abolitionists in heaven right now. In other words, and this is a point Lucius C. Matlack makes in his retelling of the events, that Smith had wished all abolitionists dead.

Just a few years later, in 1843, Scott would lead an exodus from the Methodist Episcopal Church. He, along with Matlack, would found the Methodist Wesleyan Church, a small group of Methodist abolitionists. Scott presaged the coming split. The next year, the center could not hold, and the Methodist Episcopal Church split along regional lines, north and south.",null,0,cdnqb93,1rhwm4,askhistorians,top_day,4

Nrussg,"edit: after looking at /u/idjet and /u/qed1 's responses I wanted to modify this comment, I put the edit at the front so people see this before reading the passage and retained the wording of the original post to maintain the record. But, I was a bit hasty in writing this and didn't pay close attention to the period being specifically asked about. My response should be viewed as a later evolution of the evolution of the system described by the two others, rather than an argument against what they said (as it was originally intended.) 

/u/qed1 's answer is slightly misleading regarding how the inquisition actually functioned. While part of the function of the ""Spanish Inquisition,"" which was actually two separate branches of a larger system, did have a mandate to convert and later expel Jews and Muslims in the Iberian peninsula. However, this was only one facet of what inquisitional courts did (this makes more sense when you look at the other larger inquisitional courts in Venice and Rome, which didn't have the same religious diversity as Iberia.) In truth, inquisitional courts were just courts that handled religious issues at the allowance of the secular power in the region. They're strength and mandate were variable, for example, in the Kingdom of Castille (central Spain basically) the inquisition did not handle cases of sodomy, while in Aragon (think Barcelona) the inquisition did handle cases of sodomy. 
Going over what specific cases were handled by the inquisition would be too much, but Christians were prosecuted.

Now for the why. Inquisitional judicial systems were based off a different, divergent idea of how courts should work. We are generally use to the broadly English derived legal system (huge simplification, but this is the type of court with defendants, witness, prosecutors, etc.) Inquisitional justice was based on confession as the primary way for establishing if the accused was guilty, and confession at times necessitated torture. In truth, threat of torture was way more common than actual torture (they'd kind of just show them the devices as an implicit threat) but at times torture was used (the rack, thumb screws, and leg screws were most common along with water torture, anything else was rarely or never used.)

Torture as part of inquisitional cases is well documented, sense the inquisition took fantastic notes and their trials serve as great (if biased) primary sources. (They also liked to spy on people in their cells and write it down, seriously useful.)

However, if you are referring to the ""Inquisition"" (note that there was no such thing as a capital ""I"" inquisition in the middle ages), then the short answer is that they didn't. Medieval inquisitors were specifically interested in dealing with heresy, particularly among the general populous. As such, they were specifically not interested in Jews and though Muslims were sometimes construed as Christian heretics, there were very few Muslims in Western Europe.

Tiako,"Unfortunately the historical sources are confused and *far* too late to allow us to use them as a guide towards the sixth century political order with any confidence. Generally, the most fruitful analyses attempts to see Rome within the context of an Iron Age climate of political multiplicity and loose vertical bonds within a community (basically, the elites would not feel themselves particularly tied to lower orders in a community). This allows us to structure a series of useful comparisons to better understood societies, such as Archaic Greece, certain Central Asian groups and even Medieval Europe, although that carries a series of complications.

Basically, the idea is that these ""kings"" were more the leaders of diverse and noncommunal war bands who could form and serve as a result of endemic regional conflict. Particularly succesful warbands could even take over cities, not unlike Francesco Sforza in Milan.",null,0,cdnn71l,1rhv7u,askhistorians,top_day,1
Forgotten_Password_,"Now is my big chance! Well historically, Costa Rica always prided itself on having ""More teachers than soldiers"". The war itself, lasting during the year of 1948, pitted Jose Figueres (with the support of old coffee elites) against the Teodoro Picado Michalski regime, who was the successor of the former president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia. In between all of this was a radical thinker by the name of Manuel Mora Valverde, whose marxist beliefs blended into the local economic and social situation of Costa Rica into something he coined as ""criollo Comunismo"" or ""Tico Comunismo"".


Valverde's Popular Vanguard Party supported both Calderón and Michalski's government and in doing so, had some political influence when it came to social and labour policies. In fact, many of Costa Rica's current social policies, such as social security, go back to Valverde's political advocacy. However, his leftist ideology and clear influence made him unpopular with the coffee growing elite, who controlled the biggest bank in the country at the time. They saw the reforms of both regimes as detrimental to their own political power by promoting unorthodox reforms. Enter Jose Figueres, a somewhat questionable character who was kicked out of Costa Rica in 1942 because he created ""a possible threat to national security"". However, by the end of WW2 and the rise of the Cold War, Figueres realized the support he could gain by becoming an Anti-Communist, fighting the Calderon-Communist political alliance.




Eventually, by 1948, Figueres trained an army and launched his insurrection amid an election crisis when Calderon's party annulled the presidential election results (With the support of the Congress). The fighting eventually led to a potential final stand off in San Jose, between what was left of an already small Costa Rica army, combined with political supporters of Calderon (PVP militia and Vanguardista militia), and Figueres rebel army. 


However, the fight for San Jose didn't end in bloodshed and instead, political negotiations occurred with a set of treaties/pacts. Among which included the Pact of Ochomogo (Conserving social reforms, labour laws, and maintaining the legality of unions) and the Pact of the Mexican Embassy, explicitly stating the end to conflict. 



Now, the constitution of 1948. It must be noted that Costa Rica already had a small army to begin with since it began to decline in the 1900s. The last major battle that utilized the armed forces occurred during the war against William Walker in the 1850s, which eventually led to the famous story of Juan Santamaría, burning a barricade amid the second battle of Rivas. Basically, when the constitution disbanded the army as an institution, what was left of it had already been disbanded amid the civil war by the War Minister in order to prevent the victors from installing themselves as a military junta. Now for the sources:

Snickerdoodled,"Crime and Punishment in Eighteenth Century England by Frank McLynn has a chapter on women that addresses this.  In short, for capital crimes other than murder, women were reprieved from execution much more than men. Also, women were more likely to have charges lowered and  less likely to be sent for transportation than men for non capital larcenies. 


McLynn's explanation is that women were generally perceived to be less dangerous to the community/authority/social order, and the deterring effect of the death penalty didn't work so much for women, as ""the hanging of a women was more likely to excite pity for the victim than reinforce confidence in ""law and order""""

Also the concept of coverture might relate to your topic. Since a *feme covert*'s legal standing was eclipsed by her husband's, a married women who committed crimes with their husband were assumed to be acting at their husband's behest. On the flip side of this, wives who killed their husbands were not guilty of murder but petit treason, which was a more serious offense and was punished with burning.

Interestingly, The rates of execution for people indicted for willful murder were the same for men and women, about 1/5. Women charged with homicide were more likely to be accused of murder as opposed to manslaughter than men, which may relate to the higher chance of a women's murder victim being an intimate rather than a stranger.",null,0,cdnpxpt,1rhum8,askhistorians,top_day,3

akyser,"First, to slightly correct the myth, at least as told by Virgil: Aeneas' son Ascanius founded Alba Longa, and then roughly ten generations later, Romulus and Remus found Rome.

Despite Heinrich Schliemann's supposed ""Death Mask of Agamemnon"", none of the characters of the Trojan War cycle have been identified as being based on real, historical people.  Roma was one town out of a number of Latin towns.  They wound up conquering the whole Latin people, including Alba Longa, and spreading out from there to the other people on the Italian peninsula.  There is no evidence of this Trojan foundation, either in modern times or in ancient.  Livy, the greatest ancient historian of the early history of Rome, tells us the whole myth of the foundation, but even he admits he just likes the story, and it probably isn't true.  However, it's really hard to do this sort of archaeology, given that they're looking for a really small town underneath what has been one of the great cities of the world for the last ~2300 years.

However, the Greeks *did* come to Italy to found colonies.  They founded cities all over the Mediterranean, but there was such a concentration in southern Italy that it was known as Megale Hellas, Magna Graecia- Great Greece.  Ancient Greece may have started within the modern political borders of what we know as Greece, but the cities of southern Italy and western Turkey (Troy, Philadelphia, Ephesus) could make claims to be as impressive as Athens, Sparta, Corinth, or Thebes. Naples, as a city name, doesn't sound Greek anymore. But the adjectival form shows its roots better: Neapolitan, nea (new) polis (city).  There was also Tarentum on the southern coast and Syracuse on Sicily, to name a few of the major ones.  But this colonization of southern Italy happened around 8-700 BC, several hundred years after the probable dates of the Trojan War, after the Greeks went into a ""dark age"" without writing and then got it back again, adapting the Phoenician alphabet.  There are a couple places in southern Italy that still speak (a very different dialect of) Greek, though it's debatable if that really had its origins in Great Greece or in Byzantine times.

These large Greek city states so close to Rome during its foundational period are probably why the gods map so closely, but have different names.  The early Latin religion appears to have been animistic, and largely based on contracts with these spirits.  If you didn't get what you wanted from the gods, you must have broken the contract in some way.  The god or spirit of motherhood, for example, was Juno, and all of Hera's stories and traits were mapped on to the name Juno.  ~~But there was no overarching sky god to be in charge of everything.  So they adopted Zeus whole, only adding ""father"" after the name.  Zeus-pater -&gt; Jupiter.~~ See koine_lingua's correction below!

So the Greeks did come to Italy to found cities, but it almost certainly wasn't Rome, and it was centuries too late to be Aeneas or anyone else from the Trojan War, if they existed at all.",null,4,cdnftcr,1rhtyy,askhistorians,top_day,23

It is assumed that the Aeneid, by Virgil, was written to connecy the people of Rome to the Greek Gods and the Roman version of these.

ssflanders,"The question seems to imply that before recorded music there was only classical music. Pop music before recording technology was much closer to what we call ""folk music"" today -- it was played and spread around by everyday people, not the elite orchestras in grand concert halls. Think of the songs everybody knew like Yankee Doodle Dandy or Swannee River, the songs that slaves sang in the fields, etc.

The idea of a ""professional musician"" was not unknown, but certainly very unusual in most people's experience. Usually you just performed it yourself, or listened while friends and neighbors performed it. With the growth of a prosperous middle class in the latter half of the 19th century (speaking of the U.S. here, although it was true elsewhere), a piano become something almost everybody had in their home, and the ability to play piano and sing was very widespread. The predecessor of recordings was printed sheet music, and sheet music publishers were the first wave of what we know now as the Music Business, and a song's popularity was measured in sheet music sales.

The first blockbuster pop hit was the sheet music of Alexander's Ragtime Band, a composition by Irving Berlin which borrowed heavily from traditional black folk music (a pattern which, incidentally, would continue through almost every form of pop music up through the present day).

Recording and broadcast technology essentially ended the practice of mass musical ability, beginning with the player piano, then wax disks and radios, and finally vinyl, TV, 8-track, cassette, CD, and mp3.

caffarelli,"Okay, the modern classical canon. Who actually listened to this stuff back then? 

* Was it a prerogative of the rich?

By and large, yes. Art takes money, rich people funded and kept most baroque/classical music going. Opera houses made their money a couple of ways, one was subscriptions (rich family would rent a box for the season), and then the floor seats which would be sold ad hoc to merchant class people. Here’s an interesting consideration -- if you bought a floor seat ticket, it was just benches, no assigned seats with numbers, so you’d customarily send a maid or manservant ahead of time to go physically save your seat. If you even went to opera on the CHEAP you probably had a servant or two. 

Rich patrons (right up to royalty, so state sponsorship almost like modern NEA grants!) would both fund opera houses, and directly patronize singers and composers. Lotsa rich people. 

But here was a way to get yourself some live music on the cheap if you were poor -- go to church! Organs, famous composers, real live castrati, quality music making all around. 

* Was going to operas expensive? 

Once again, by and large, yes. If you have access to Jstor check out [Patronizing Handel, Inventing Audiences: The Intersections of Class, Money, Music and History](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3518970?uid=3739656&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102794966243) which is a great breakdown for opera's unaffordability in 18th century England. I'll quote the choice bits with nice numbers: 

&gt;Households with family incomes above £200 comprised a tiny 3-4 per cent, some 53,000 families in all, of which perhaps 5,000—6,000 lived in London year-round or for the season. An income of £200 was probably too low to support regular attendance at the Italian opera and oratorio, given the high ticket and subscription prices for those entertainments. Raising the minimum to £400 reduces the potential purchasers to a minuscule 0.82 per cent nationwide (12,670 families in 1755). The labouring and destitute poor, among whom £20 annual family income was considered subsistence level, constituted the vast bulk of the population (84 per cent). Today's more egalitarian distribution of income (and therefore access to, for example, classical concerts) is in striking contrast. [...] It is apparent from table 3 that tickets for Italian opera and oratorio were 2.5 to 4 times the cost of those for ordinary dramatic productions [...]

* Were there cheaper copycats in cheaper theaters? 

Sort of. Not really knock offs, but there was staged music going on contemporary to opera that was more geared towards the middle class. *The Beggar’s Opera* was a “ballad opera” in English (not a “proper” opera because it doesn’t have recitative) that was EXTREMELY popular in its day, which was making fun of opera conventions. It’s still popular, it even has a later “remix” called *Threepenny Opera* which gives us the jazz standard “Mack the Knife.” But doing a knock off opera seria would have kinda sucked, the main draw was the famous celebrity singers and the lavish stagecraft, not the music. Comedy was usually a better seller. 

* Aliens? 

No aliens, unless you mean “foreigners.” Opera was very much an Italian export and therefore associated in the 18th century English mind with all sorts of negative foreign things like decadence, fashion, and “buggery.” All the eunuchs involved in the music business didn’t help it’s reputation much either. ;)

This is kinda a quick and dirty overview, but it’s hard to lump all the entire NPR Classical music station together in one comment! Add to that not all opera we call operas now were considered operas back then, like *Magic Flute.* If you have a question about a particular work I can probably tell you what classes might have originally consumed it.

Resurrecting these old traditions and mindsets is quite different from transmitting a living culture. Much of this idealisation is rooted in its literature, and at its focal point is the Welsh language as a protector of Classical and Christian traditions.
Gwynfor Evans sums up the importance of the Welsh language in Nationalism:

For many centuries the Welsh language has been under attack and under siege. Its survival is the crowning glory of Welsh history.

A narrative of historical injustice has been cultivated to justify contemporary political nationalism and its aims. This promotes links between historical 'injustices' and contemporary 'wrongs'.
One such example is the link made between the Acts Of Union 1536-1542/43 leading to 20th century political impotence, meaning a decline in the Welsh language, and economic decline.

Overall the rivalry has developed over time due to popular narratives becoming part of Welsh culture. Dr Ceinwen Thomas suggest the idea that the duty of the Welsh is to restore the heroic past of Wales. But by doing so should be aware that, as a subject nation Welsh history has been interpreted for them by their conquerors (the English) and those who have been educated in their schools.

BentNotBroken,"They were never really considered ""bomb shelters"" but rather ""Fallout Shelters"".  Properly stocked, you could hold out as long at your stocks held out and your water supply lasted.  There was no convenient bottled water at the time so the usual fall back was to be a cistern either in the shelter structure or under a sheltering structure for that purpose nearby.  All of this took money, tme and a great deal of forethought and constant upkeep to have a successful outcome.  Nature was included into the equation because it was expected that the first rain after the event(s) would wash away some of the fallout.  One did not want to have contaminated rain water to flow to the cistern so some provision had to be made for diversion of flow in the immediate aftermath of any hostile event.  

Holding out?  For what?  If the major cities were destroyed and the usual flow of commerce depended on the cities, the surviving population was then back to ""hunter/gathering"" or subsistence foraging. 

""Bomb Shelters"" were the opiate of the people at the time.  There was a bluster having to do with a ""bring it on to the rude bridge that arched the flood"" mentality.  ""We have our guns"".

restricteddata,"The technical goals of fallout shelters were two-fold:

* To help protect people from the effects of blast and fire. This would require advance notice of impending attack and would rely on the shelter itself not being too close to ground zero. Civilian shelters were _not_ designed to withstand a direct nuclear detonation, certainly not of the yields that became common in the later Cold War. (Even military/presidential shelters could only take so many megatons directly.) This sort of thing becomes more important in the suburbs than it does the areas of direct targeting — i.e. in the vast regions where the blast effects are enough to collapse civilian structures and break windows (e.g. 1-5 psi overpressure) and the thermal effects are enough to burn flesh or start small fires.

* Protection from radioactive fallout. Nuclear weapons that detonate on or near the ground mix with debris and dirt and the result is that highly-radioactive by-products ""fall out"" of the nuclear cloud within a few hours to a few days of detonation. The initial radioactivity of these by-products can be _very_ high — enough to kill you, give you radiation sickness, or dramatically increase your lifetime cancer risk. However things this radioactive do not stick around long. The more radioactive something is, the shorter its half-life, and the less time it sticks around. The consequence of this is that for the first week or so, the area immediately downwind of the blast can be incredibly radioactive and dangerous. If you stay inside for that amount of time, then you avoid most of the radiation. After a week or so, the radiation drops to levels safe to travel through (though not necessarily to live in). Note that airbursts, which are used against ""soft"" targets like cities, do not create the same level of contamination at all.

Fallout shelters were never intended to save everyone. What they were intended to do was to increase the total survivability of the population. Even just making sure people don't walk through the contaminated areas in the first week or so can (in various simulations and models) save hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives. 

Now one can look at this and say... well. You've saved several million people, but we're still talking about many many millions dead. That doesn't seem like a great success to me. And there is something to that. On the other hand, if you are a government bureaucrat, and your options are ""don't do anything to try and save lives"" versus ""do what you can, even if it is inadequate,"" you can see why they went with the latter approach. And hey, a hundred thousand or a million saved lives is nothing to sniff at. 

I will note that my reading of the FCDA files indicates that most of them were boring, hard-working bureaucrats assigned a kind of impossible job under terrible conditions (including the fact that they were not cleared to know a lot of weapons effects information or information about the composition of the US or Soviet stockpiles). I have never seen anything that indicated to me that they were really trying to hood-wink the public or anything like that. Whether that was an inadvertent or inevitable consequence is a separate question, but the notion that these people were trying to pull a grand shuck doesn't seem right to me. 

The reason fallout shelters get such a bad rap is that their purpose is often misunderstood (they are not meant to protect you from a direct hit, they are not meant to be inhabited for months or years), and because survivability is a grim business. Civil Defense in general is easy to criticize. There is something to the notion that a nation that thinks it can ""survive"" nuclear war might be more eager to get into one, but I've never seen evidence that US civilian officials were actually was that keen on getting into a nuclear war. A lot of the criticisms of Civil Defense, however, are just rooted in a criticism of the broader Cold War nuclear context. Which, of course, one gets. But given that ""everybody just play nice and get rid of nukes"" was never really on the table in a realistic sense, I don't really see what that gets us, either as an understanding of the past or a prescription for the present.

thebullfrog72,"TL;DR Structural Engineering, Sources are fairly non-existent, I go through a pretty fringe argument at the end - it is useful in that it draws on common similarities and allows me to address each in turn. 

The pyramids that are so widespread are the Step Pyramid variety, which were built throughout the world. Although overshadowed by the Pyramids of Giza, Step Pyramids were the predecessor for these massive structures. 

Short answer, similar to why arches became ubiquitous; it's the best way to build large and tall structures that don't fall down, and remain stable over a long time. Without access to lighter building materials that would allow for greater vertical height, such as wood and metal, Step Pyramids were by far the most feasible, tall structures to build. The more ambitious Great Pyramid of Giza remained the tallest structure in the world until a new 150m spire was added to the Lincoln Cathedral in England, although that spire did collapse after just over 200 years. 

I'm not sure if you've tried to do any research on this yourself, but you will find yourself quickly in a realm of pseudoscience and pseudo-history that has come to dominate the topic. I'll go through one below.  

[This piece argues](http://thegreaterpicture.com/pyramids.html) that the pyramids around the world were built to honor aliens, using as evidence these common characteristics, some that are very common when looking at pyramid pseudo-science, and are the ones that on the surface make a connection seem clear:

&gt;The triangular form with a square base
&gt;

Engineering, like above, the best way to build a sturdy structure, one that is also as tall as possible. Having a cube structure would require more material for less height. 
 
&gt; The sides face the cardinal directions precisely

This claim only works with the Mayan step pyramids and the Egyptian Great Pyramids, it falls apart when dealing with the Temple of the Moon in Mexico and Borobudur in Indonesia. Both the Mayan and Egyptian cultures placed importance on solstice/equinox days, and worked to align their major, large-scale religious structures accordingly. 

&gt; They lie around the ""celestial equator"" (16) (the line that would be &gt;our equator if the Earth' axis wasn't tilted)

The Jared Diamond hate is mostly justified, but it was the place I encountered the counter-argument to the Europe-centric theory of geographic determinism, whereby a country's success is greatly affected by its distance from the equator. Prior to European advances, the reverse holds just as true, with numerous vast empires arising on this 'celestial equator,' closer to the equator than geographic determinism would account for. The climate allows for substantial agriculture, and the pseudo-science would extend to Mesopotamian and South East Asian civilizations, if they worked with the arguments. 

&gt; They contain all types of corridors and chambers

They were religious buildings, with the exception of Egypt meant to be used regularly, and Egyptian mythology provides the explanation for why large chambers, filled with supplies, would be necessary in their construction.  

&gt; They are made of stone (though most Chinese pyramids are made of &gt;a type of hard earth and some are even made of iron)

See available building materials above, various types of stone were used as they were around and provided durable structures. 

&gt; They are built the same way, on a base of large, uneven stone blocks &gt;that fit together seamlessly. This ground plane is extremely resistant to &gt;earthquakes

This point argues that they all build a strong base, and, without pointing to the Inca, touches on the idea of mortar-less structures. Although I'm a layman in engineering, mortar degrades and is still a major cause of old buildings being destroyed in earthquakes. Considering that earthquakes were a part of Egyptian mythology prior to the construction of the great pyramids, at the very least part of a god's attributes (see [Geb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geb)), it's not unlikely that the design of buildings which took over 20 years to build, involved tens of thousands of laborers and were made as tombs to their rulers and gods-to-be would take into consideration such destructive forces.   

&gt; Underground passages link the pyramids with each other

The Pharaoh's pyramids were linked with the similar so-called Queen's pyramids, not with each other. As these were tombs, rather than temple complexes which easily explain the use of tunnels between structures, it is a popular point. 

&gt;They are oriented on star(sign)s, especially Orion, Sirius, the Pleiades and Cygnus (Swan)

This comes off as similar to the argument that inter-empire contact must have necessary because of the ubiquity of sun/moon worship. Features of the sky, particularly when they represent in the mythologies of these empires the heavens, would make sense. 

Further, much of the arguments behind the specific alignments and the importance to Egypt of these star constellations has been debunked. Drawing parallels to constellations that come from another civilizations understanding of the night sky have no bearing on the way the Pyramids were constructed. [This argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_correlation_theory) revolves around the relationship of Orion's belt and the Pyramids at Giza. The concept of perfect symmetry doesn't hold up when the authors invert the maps in their own book.

MarcusDohrelius,"Medieval Europe borrowed exclusively from ancient medical precedents and intermixed these with spiritual causations like sin, fate, and other supernatural powers. The most prominent source was the ancient Greek, Hippocrates. He is where modern medicine gets its ""Hippocratic Oath."" He was the first to synthesise and record (despite there being earlier references, like the Egyptians) the idea of the four humours. These four humours were the cause of health. 

The four humors of Hippocratic medicine are black bile (Gk. melan chole), yellow bile (Gk. chole), phlegm (Gk. phlegma), and blood (Gk. haima). These are to be kept in balance or else sickness occurs. Increasing and decreasing these four elements was a central component of medieval, European medicine and some Islamic medicinal theory as well. Avicenna would be the most prominent amongst the Islamic medical theorists; he borrowed heavily from another ancient Greek, Galen. The four humours corresponded with the four states of hot,wet,cold, dry. Theophrastus, who was a successor to Aristotle in his school, would attribute the humours to aspects of character, thus one with too much blood was ""sanguine"".

An interesting medieval character to look at, though later than your stated dates(*The Canterbury Tales* are late 14th century), would be [Chaucer's Physician.](http://www.librarius.com/canttran/genpro/genpro413-446.htm).

lukeweiss,"It is absolutely the case from as early as we have reliable history. The Han conflict with the Xiongnu saw much mixing along the northern borders of the imperium, but was not the first such ""northernification"" (my term, just thought of it!). In fact, we are pretty comfortable with the image of the earliest ""dynasty"" (not an appropriate term for them, as they weren't ruling over an empire of any consequence), the Shang, as that of a semi-nomadic (or at least peripatetic), horse dependent chiefdom. This characterization is more like the later northern non-han peoples than that of the Han. So, and the work of Victor Mair, among others, has especially driven this point home, the influx/mixing of northern peoples with ""han"" peoples strikes to the very roots of chinese society.  
Flash forward to the post Han dynasty period, and we have a north dominated by invading northern peoples for the better part of 400 years. This period was capped off with the Tang Dynasty (618CE onward), a dynastic household of not-so-thinly-veiled mixed blood. The Li family were  clearly of mixed ""barbarian"" decent, but worked extremely hard both to hide that fact, and to legitimize their ancient family creds. They did this in two major ways:  
1. By literally re-writing the list of great families. A list that formerly gave primacy to the old guard families of the Shandong area. The power structure of the Tang was wrapped up in this change, as the Tang were eager to shift the familial power structure to the northwest, from the center/east. It is not clear how seriously the change was taken, but no matter the answer to that question, both sets of aristocratic groups wouldn't survive the Tang.  
2. Aligning themselves with that great ancient philosopher, Laozi. This was an astute move, the old master sharing the surname Li with the imperial house gave them instant credibility as potential holders of the mandate of heaven (a tenuous grip that could always be relinquished). Again, it is not all that clear how seriously this was taken, but the early Tang rulers drove home the connection time and again.   
After the Tang we see another influx of northern semi-nomadic peoples, this time upping the ante significantly. Chinese historiography for generations tried to minimize their importance - for example, the period is known as the ""Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms,"" a title that gives credit only to the areas ruled mostly by Han chinese. It ignores the significance of the northern regions under the Khitans, Shatuo Turks, and Tanguts, who all held power pretty solidly until Mongol expansion a few centuries later.     
These regions were full of Han chinese, and the new states of the Xi Xia and Khitans clearly modeled themselves politically after the Middle Kingdom. Many adapted and adopted new official scripts, that their imperial edicts could be read far and wide - a very chinese thing to do!  
So the mixing continued and continued. The Mongols tried desperately to maintain their non-Han status, but this only isolated the upper strata of the Mongol power structure. F.W. Mote mentions, in his history of middle period china *Imperial China 900-1800*, that the Mongols in Han China became destitute by the 14th century, because they had no official status, and a shrinking share of the imperial booty. Isolation was therefore bad for longevity.   
The Qing brought a massive influx of Manchus, who also tried to maintain cultural isolation. But again, this wasn't sustainable, and many mixed in with Han China. A small group, mostly those closest to the imperial family, remained ethnically isolated, and were on the long train back to Manchuria in 1911.   
So, TL:DR - Mixing of northern ethnicities with Han chinese is as old as chinese civilization itself. It only increased as time went by. Interestingly, it seems the only successful invaders NOT to stay for a while and mix it up in China were the Tibetans, who's 9th century invasion did not involve sticking around for breeding.

skyanvil,"Ethnic mixing happened far more often in Chinese history, particularly in Northern China, than most people think (more than even some modern Chinese think).

The short answer is, YES, Northern Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the North.  Even before that, Western Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the West.  And Southern Chinese also mixed with various tribes of the South.

Ancient Chinese maps indicated that China was surrounded by Barbarian tribes in North, West, and the South.  Border region people mixed a lot, and the Chinese had no prohibition of that.  Indeed, early Chinese partly spread out on the concept of ""civilizing"" the Barbarians by mixing with them, and attempting to IMPRESS the Barbarians with Chinese culture, Chinese agricultural technologies, Chinese customs and virtues.

When China was occupied by Barbarians, and even subsequently when China overthrew those dynasties, Han Chinese encouraged mixing with the Barbarians, which formed mixed-ethnic vanguard troops and mercenaries for the Chinese to guard their frontiers.

For example, after Ming Dynasty overthrew the Mongol Dynasty of Yuan, Ming Emperors employed vast numbers of Mongolian mercenaries, by promising them stable salary, and land for them to settle in China.  (This was very attractive offer to the Mongols, who traditionally only got paid well when they managed to take spoils in battle.  And in contrast, the Chinese were willing to pay them well to be on guard duty.)

So, slowly, the Mongol mercenaries settled in China, and mixed into the Chinese population.  Those who didn't settle in China, remained Mongolian nomads.

Bottomline:  1 of China's strengths is the ability to attract non-Chinese to mix into its population, with its riches of culture and technology.

MarcusDohrelius,"In 494 in the Early Roman Republic there was a *secessio plebis* or plebian revolt as part of the ongoing ""conflict of the orders"" with the patricians, who at the time were still closely related to the advisors of the recently deposed monarchy (509 B.C). Slave debt was a big issue, where, in a simplified explanation, Roman farmers who were full citizens would have their farms fall into disarray during wartimes and they would be forced to be indentured servants to pay it back. There was sense of honouring the veterans. So in 495B.C soldiers were exempted from this practice. That eased some tensions, but outrage at underrepresentation and exploitation amongst the plebeians was on the rise. 

[This map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Roman_conquest_of_Italy.PNG) is phenomenal and shows Rome's neighbours and its expansion during the Republic. The Volscii were a particular threat and in 494 the Plebs seized the opportunity and retreated to the *Mons Sacer* and refused their military service. This caused a panic and their demands were met with the creation of the sacrosanct office of the Tribune of the Plebs. 

Another revolution to check, led by Tribunes, would be the grain reforms of the Gracchi brothers in the late Republic. 

All of the accounts of the Plebian Seccessions can be found in Livy, *Ab Urbe Condita* and Appian on the Civil Wars for the Gracchi.

This came all at the time when the book *[A General History of the Pyrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_General_History_of_the_Pyrates)* came onto the scene.  

The book embellished quite a bit, and spoke a lot about Blackbeard, painting him as a larger than life figure, it was said that when Maynard (actually a random unknown, but Maynard gets the credit for killing him) cut his head off and tossed the body in the sea, it swam around the boat several times before sinking away.

pharmaceus,"There are two separate problems here. 

If you are referring to the famines in the Soviet Union it wasn't just the result of collective farming (which in itself can be sufficiently efficient as seen in the kibbutzem ) but the fact that the collectivization was - besides ideological reasons -  a method of centralizing all agricultural products in one place and then expropriating it for further redistribution and export. Also it was an efficient tool of subjugating unruly peasants in Ukraine.

If you are referring to inefficiency of collective farming then it is an economic problem that has roots in how work is organized in a collective arrangement without even symbolic price systems.  An interesting take on a historical example can be found in *Conceived in Liberty vol.1* by Murray Rothbard who referring to the Thanksgiving legend put the causes of famine in American colonies on collectivist ideas and the ""miraculous""improvement on simply returning to more rational method of management.  Right now I can't think of a ready-made historical example but essentially it boils down to this: If a farm is run this way it puts the whole incentive system for really hard work upside down and agricultural production being very labour-intensive (and even more so in the past) is very easy to fail if everyone is not doing their best.",null,1,cdndrc2,1rhelo,askhistorians,top_day,2
HeloRising,"The issue tends to be with expectations rather than the farming system itself.

It's a problem seen in places like North Korea today; the government sets a target for a particular farm to reach and that target is nowhere near what that farm is able to produce. The target is arrived at with a formula that basically says this much land + this many people = this much food except farming is almost never that precise. This leads to farms inflating how much they've actually grown to meet quotas and a huge overestimation of the food supply.

If you're talking about an authoritarian government they may be ordering people to do jobs for which they lack the skills for. China made this mistake during the Great Leap Forward when it commanded collectives to melt everything down to produce steel in their backyards. Except very few people actually knew how to make steel and most of it was garbage.

The actual system of collective farming can work very well, as /u/pharmaceus pointed out.

It's difficult to point to an exact moment at which we can say that the empire 'split up' -- we do so in retrospect and with the benefit of hindsight, but it is less effective to make such claims from the point of view of the people living at the time.
Important thing to consider -- there had been multiple emperors ruling Rome simultaneously long before we would consider the empire divided; for example, Marcus Aurelius actually ruled alongside Lucius Verus until Verus died. Diocletian famously established the Tetrarchy, which established four simultaneous emperors of different status and with different zones of control, perhaps laying the foundation for a theory of multiple empires, but his system lasted about as long as he did; Constantine reunited the empire. 
Thus, the relationship would perhaps be best described as one in which the two parts of the empire saw each other as parts of the same ""nation"" -- a loaded word -- but with separate, and often rival courts. Two simultaneous emperors would often work against one another, and many of the major battles of the empire were fought by Romans against Romans, rather than foreign nations, so that doesn't mean that they always cooperated well, and it suggests that we ought not see competition and strife between the two 'halves' as suggesting that they viewed themselves as separate nations.

You are correct that many in the Third Reich were Catholic, but you may not know that those individuals tended not to vote for Hitler and the Catholic churches often denounced the Nazi party fairly publicly. In the early 1930s, Hitler promised he would not silence other political parties or the churches. However, what would soon occur is now known by many historians as **Kirchenkampf** or the Church Struggle.


Kirchenkampf follows a clear chronological timeline. In regards to Catholics specifically, here's what happened:

1. Early 1933: Catholic political parties are dissolved. Hitler installs Ludwig Müller as Reichsbischof, or Reich Bishop, a man who would control the new conglomerate of Germany's 28 regional Protestant churches. There is no Catholic equivalent to this. 

2. Late 1933, early 1934: Continued Gleichschaltung, or coordination, which meant the dissolution of other organizations in favor of one unified state-run Nazi-based organization. This meant that Catholic Youth Leagues were totally dissolved, and Catholic children are forced into Hitler Youth programs. Meanwhile, a Protestant opposition has formed called the Confessing Church, led in part by Martin Neimoller. During the Night of the Long Knives, several Catholic leaders were targeted and assassinated. Hitler appoints anti-Catholic men to high-ranking positions with the Nazi regime, who go out of their way to persecute Catholics, albeit sporadically.

3. Late 1934 to early 1937: Hitler forces the removal of crucifixes from schools and bans daily religious periodicals as well as begins censoring weekly periodicals. The Nazis continue to dominate the Protestant church and replace Müller (who has failed to accomplish that goal conclusively) with Hans Kerrl. The Confessing Church protests loudly, and they are often violently silenced. This includes mass arrests of opposing pastors.

4. Early 1937 to 1939: Pope Pius XI issues Mit brennender Sorge, or With Burning Concern. It is smuggled into Germany and read in every Catholic church on one Sunday. In this, the Pope denounces Nazi ideology and criticized Nazism for contradicting Catholic dogma. It strongly condemned racism and even protected baptized Jews. The Gestapo visited nearly every Catholic church and took any copies that they found. Anyone who had a hand in the printing or publication of the paper had their business attacked and shut down. Indeed, the Pope's speech only seems to have provoked the Nazis, because from early 1937, Hitler *hated* Catholics. He went out of his way to make sure that they were persecuted. He began ""immorality trials"" which often suggested lewd and horrible behavior and actions from clergy, who would endure false trials and receive outrageous punishments for crimes that they did not commit (such as sexual perversion and homosexuality, among others). In the summer of that year, the Confessing Church is formally banned, and Martin Niemöller is arrested.

5. 1939–1945: There is all out war between Christianity and Nazism in the Third Reich. Countless clergy of both Protestant and Catholic denominations are arrested and put in concentration camps (so many that Dachau had ""The Priest Barracks"" - 95% of them were Catholic). Against their will, many clergy were drafted into the military services. Publications and sermons were restricted, censored, or even banned outright. Services were increasingly dissolved or banned from occurring. 

Whew. **tl;dr** - Yes, Catholics were singled out among the Christian denominations, which is not to say that Protestants had it any easier. However, Hitler did particularly dislike Catholicism, especially its separate organizations and its radical priests and nuns.

Pramoedya,"I am definitely not an authority on this, but I did a project on the symbolism behind the swastika a few years ago and looked into this a bit (I was interested because I have Indian heritage). 

Essentially, Hitler (etc.) viewed the contemporary Aryans in India as not fully Aryan. That is to say, they are descended from Aryans, but their 'purity' was diluted into the general south asian/ dravidian population. By the term 'Aryan' he was referring to the ancient, white, proto-european conquerors that settled/invaded the sub-continent and much of asia. Although as far as I am aware they originated somewhere near Iran(?). I always thought it was weird that Hitler always banged on about Aryans and then in the same breath held blonde hair and blue eyes in such high regard. This was because all the people I had met who identified as Aryan were south asian (i.e. black-dark hair, darker skin, etc.). 

However, I think the problem is in the semantics. By 'Aryan', Hitler meant the old school horse-riding peoples from east europe/west asia who bandied around conquering and settling much of europe and asia. Whilst, many south asian people, or people who are more familiar with that culture than western culture view the word 'Aryan' as denoting a current population, who (through years of intermingling) became largely intertwined with the indigenous population. In contrast, Nazis viewed the european breed of Aryan and pure-blood.

I think the one thing both Hitler and Indian people can agree on are that the Aryans were fair skinned. In hitlers mindset I think this translated into the blonde hair, blue eyes thing, whilst in the Indian mindset this translated into simply a fairer complexion in comparison to other ethnic groups in India (such as the darker Dravidians) - a skin tone similar to, say, Iranian people.

What I think is interesting is that in both cultures the notions of being Aryan is linked with superiority. Whilst we are all very familiar with Hitler's ramblings, it is important to also note that skin tone is very important in India, with society having a preference for lighter skinned people. Hence, this translates into people of Aryan descent (them being fairer skinned) as being seen as superior. A cousin of mine, when I asked her why she prefers men with lighter skin, even said it is because it makes them look more european... when you actually think about the implications of that view its pretty fucked up. Sometimes I think India is having some kind of post-colonial withdrawal issue. :/

Anyhow, in conclusion. Hitler's opinions of the Aryans in India was probably not very good. He would have been aware that the Aryans settled and colonised vast swathes of the asia and europe.    The Nazis viewed themselves as pure bred Aryans while they saw the Indian Aryans as being simply descendents of Aryans. 

To be honest, it is very difficult to think of any objective rhyme or reason for any extremist view, and if you try to find one you will probably be looking for a long time. Extremist philosophy and politics is steeped in biased views of history, and unscientific science. Hence, its not surprising that Hitler's views on who the Aryans were/are end up equally as hodge podged.

[Central heating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_heating#History) is just one of ways to provide uniform temperature in a building - the other being a source of heat such as ceramic or iron stove. While I agree that Roman technology that many Imperial officials brought with them was both superior to anything people used Britain or much of Europe for that matter (with exception to certain monasteries) and effectively lost to general populace as an advancement I would seriously debate that someone who was able to put a stove in every habitable room and provide for servants to maintain them had it sufficiently worse than a person with central heating. On the continent stoves were in use as far as into 1950's and 1960's and they only went out of use because of the work that needs to be done - especially if you're living in a multi-story building in a city.

However Churchill might simply relate to the fact that because of English climate many people would not bother with having a stove everywhere and just rely on two fireplaces in main rooms to dissipate the warmth (which would be very ineffective). So it might be simply the case of tradition rather than technology or affordability.  In Russia stoves in every room were used by any person that could afford it as far as XVII century.

diana_mn,"Japan set a fairly unique course in its interactions with Western nations from the start. Even before Japan's famous ""opening to the West"" in 1854, they had observed a succession of Western powers militarily and economically defeating and humiliating China. Their main fear in their own relations with the West was that they might suffer a similar fate. 

Their initial interactions with Western powers seemed to confirm these fears, as a succession of nations forced acceptance of treaties granting themselves access, trade, and certain extra-territorial rights for their citizens within Japan itself. While military encounters never broke into open war as they had in China, the threat was persistent, and Japan's leaders were keenly aware that they were in no position to conduct a full scale war with Western powers in its current state.

The failure of the previous government (the Tokugawa lead shogunate) to resist the Western powers soon lead to its overthrow, under the popular rallying cry ""sonnō jōi,"" (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians). However the new government resisted a reactionary approach in ""expelling barbarians."" Instead they undertook a thorough study of the Western powers in order to understand what made the world's great powers so successful. 

The prime symbol of this effort was a famous around-the-world expedition lead by Prince Iwakura Tomomi. The Iwakura Mission had two main objectives. The first was to gather information about the modern world to inform Japan's own decision making about necessary reforms. The second was to renegotiate the unequal treaties Japan had been forced to accept under the prior regime. 

The mission was a huge success in meeting its first objective. The information brought back and the relationships forged with Western nations fired the imagination of Japan's reform-minded leaders, and gave many examples in technology, government, education, and commerce upon which to model their efforts. 

However when it came to the second objective - renegotiation of the unequal treaties - the mission utterly failed. It was such a failure that certain leaders within the mission were blamed for having even attempted such a thing before Japan had sufficient leverage at the negotiation table.

The insight that Japan gained from this failure was that Western powers like the United States, United Kingdom, and France did not view them as an equal power. Until Japan established itself as a peer to the world's great powers they would forever be treated as an inferior. The motivation to correct this was the overarching goal of Japan's policy for the next several decades. It not only fueled helpful reforms like democracy, universal education, industrialization, and free markets, but also lead Japan in an increasingly aggressive militaristic direction. 

So, to recap, Japan embraced Western ideas about modern government, economy, and technology as a direct response to Western intervention in Asia in general, and Japan specifically. Their relations with Western nations were hugely affected by their desire to be seen as an equal to Western powers, understanding this to be the key to being treated as an equal in diplomatic affairs. The wrenching changes required were in large part palatable under Japan's reform-minded Meiji government because the prior regime (under the shogunate) took the blame for getting Japan into its unequal mess in the first place.

Second: No, actually it's not safe to assume naturalism (realistic representation of observed visual reality) was any ancient artist's goals. Think of Christian icons, which are highly stylized and governed by strict protocols in representation. Greek sculpture excelled at naturalism. In the Renaissance, studies of optics and the development of receding perspective in drawing (not to mention use of the camera obscura) allowed for increased naturalism.

The art you linked to heavily relies on photography as a tool. Through photography, humans could see details, for instance at high speeds, that cannot be observed with the naked eye (such as the water splash in the cup with lemon slices). Conventions such as cutting images off with the edge of the picture plane only developed after the introduction of photography (as in the image of strawberries).

The introduction of photography in the 19th century freed painters from the need to represent observed reality, ushering in the many movements of the Modern Era. Photorealists of the 1960s and 1970s embraced representation, not of observed realities, but of the photographic surface.

Muskwatch,"Questions of matriarchy are tied up in questions of authority.  Within a western context when we think of patriarchy or matriarchy it's often with the idea of male or female leadership, with significant authority to give orders, make important decisions, and so on.  Within most Indigenous North American cultures this view doesn't really hold water entirely. Many of the nations in my area of North America (British Columbia) are matriarchally organized, so in that sense at least, matriarchy was commonly practiced.  However, that matriarchal organization might not have the same sort of power that you might think.  Power - the ability to influence others, at least in this area was heavily tied in to obligations developed through the potlatch system.  You cement connections with people, you build up your name, and as a result build up influence.  The matriarchal nature of your community would determine who you saw as relative, who your primary obligations were to (and there were often separate father side obligations as well as mother side).  Women did have a lot of power, they often controlled a lot of wealth, territory, rights, but it did not match up to the idea of a political leader as we might see it today or as it is sometimes portrayed.

Muskwatch,"Questions of matriarchy are tied up in questions of authority.  Within a western context when we think of patriarchy or matriarchy it's often with the idea of male or female leadership, with significant authority to give orders, make important decisions, and so on.  Within most Indigenous North American cultures this view doesn't really hold water entirely. Many of the nations in my area of North America (British Columbia) are matriarchally organized, so in that sense at least, matriarchy was commonly practiced.  However, that matriarchal organization might not have the same sort of power that you might think.  Power - the ability to influence others, at least in this area was heavily tied in to obligations developed through the potlatch system.  You cement connections with people, you build up your name, and as a result build up influence.  The matriarchal nature of your community would determine who you saw as relative, who your primary obligations were to (and there were often separate father side obligations as well as mother side).  Women did have a lot of power, they often controlled a lot of wealth, territory, rights, but it did not match up to the idea of a political leader as we might see it today or as it is sometimes portrayed.

rosemary85,"No! This is a modern myth.

The story that irrational numbers were a source of horror to the ancient Greeks seems to come indirectly from a book published in 1892, John Burnet's [*Early Greek Philosophy*, page 117:](http://archive.org/stream/burnetgreek00burnrich#page/116/mode/2up)

&gt; For the present, the incommensurability of the diagonal and the square remained, as has been said, a ""scandalous exception."" Our tradition says that Hippasos of Metapontion was drowned at sea for revealing this skeleton in the cupboard.

Hippasos is known from other sources to have been an important Pythagorean in the 5th century BCE. 

Burnet's use of quotation marks around ""scandalous exception"" suggests that he may have got this from a still earlier source, but I've not been able to isolate it by searching for that phrase in Google Books prior to 1892. Anyway, the more responsible online science writers that discuss Greek attitudes to irrationals cite Burnet as their ultimate source. I've also seen the same myth come up in very non-scientific contexts, like William Messner-Loebs' wonderful (but very inaccurate) *Epicurus the Sage*.

Unfortunately for all these people that cite Burnet as their authority, Burnet simply got it wrong. He himself, in a footnote, attributes this story to Iamblichos, *Life of Pythagoras* (§34) 247; but it's just not what Iamblichos says. In charity I'll assume that he misremembered it, rather than supposing that he never actually bothered to look at the text of Iamblichos. In Iamblichos, the story has nothing to do with irrational numbers, and Hippasos doesn't get murdered by his fellow Pythagoreans. Instead, Iamblichos says, 

&gt; Some say that a divinity took vengeance on him for making Pythagorean teachings public. For he perished in the sea, on the grounds of being impious, for revealing the the structure of the eikosagon -- that is to say, the dodecahedron, which is a single solid composed of five-sided shapes folded in a spherical manner.

So in other words, Hippasos drowned in a storm or shipwreck, and some people with vivid imaginations attributed it to divine vengeance. Burnet misremembered this story as being about irrational numbers, and compounded his error by adding the ""embellishment"" that Hippasos was deliberately drowned by his companions.

Long story short: there's no basis at all for supposing that the Greeks thought irrationals were a thing of horror. That misconception only comes from John Burnet having a brain-fart in the 1890s. Ancient mathematical writers that discuss irrationals treat them as any other mathematical problem. It's much more realistic to regard the discovery of irrationals as the *greatest achievement* of the Pythagorean school!

Beck2012,"I am afraid that the core of your question is against this subreddit main rule - history starts 20 years ago.

As for the historical relations between Vietnam and China - well, they've been historically quite hostile. Vietnam, quite succesfully, has been able for centuries to oppose Chinese effort to conquer it by military means. Sure, cultural influence of China on Vietnam is tremendous. But the war of 1979 was one of many.

Diffrence between Vietnam and Korea in a larger scope (not only 20th century) is that Korea was more welcoming of Chinese hegemony. Which was pretty much symbolic and China wasn't very eager to support its (de iure) vassals. INtervention in Korea-Japan war in late 16th century was crucial for China - they were protecting status quo in the region, Japan wanted to take the position of China as a regional hegemon.

As for intervention in 1979 - Vietnam was an ally of China's biggest rival (or even enemy) - USSR. Also, China was the only country close to Kampuchea (calling them allies, especially in 1979, would be exaggeration; even Chinese communists were pretty negative towards Pol Pot's politics and economic ideas - but they had no other choice than supporting them and, from time to time, scolding for idiotic ideas; remember that since 1978 China takes the route of liberalization under the rule of Deng Xiaoping, so agrarian state of Saloth Sar was far from the new economic policy of CPC).

Kim Il Sung was very crafty politician that was able to balance between USSR and China. And both countries needed him as a leader of a frontier nation of communist states (rivals to the position of leaders of communist movement in the world but still joint enemies of capitalist world). In the sino-russian split he decided to remain neutral but other countries had to decide - as I've written, neither of those powers could allow themselves to stop supporting NK, because one of the pillars of the East Asia strategy of both China and USSR was to keep the status quo and not to let the South to attack North Korea. Neither China, nor USSR could afford another Korean War, which was a catastrophy for Chinese economy.

Also, war of 1979 wasn't a full-scale war - again, china didn't want to spent to much resources on it, they just wanted to show Vietnam where its place is. They didn't succeed, forgetting that Vietnamese soldiers were one of the most exeprianced and best equipped in the world at that time - geography was also on their side. The main goal of Chinese army was to quickly break Vietnam and crush its imperialist ambitions. Remember, that the decisions in Cambodia came from Hanoi till the late 1990s (and some say that the influence is still enormous, Hun Sen was for years Vietnamese puppet, but now he changed his priorities to China - yesterday came a shipment of 12 Chinese helicopters to Cambodia, btw).

estherke,"No, because his premises were unscientific, his methods questionable and his experiments haphazard.


First, many of the experiments were based on peculiar Nazi racial theories about who was ""Aryan"" and who was not. The issue of the existence of distinct human races is problematic and controversial in and of itself. Certainly, no contemporary scientist will agree that there is such a thing as the Aryan race. Obviously, which such a flawed premise, it is hardly surprising that the experiments yielded no results.

&gt;in 1944, he began his own project on twins, [...] **Were there reproducible racially determined differences in serum following an infectious disease?** [...] Dr Mengele infected identical and fraternal twins, Jewish and Gypsy twins with the same quantity of typhoid bacteria, took blood at various times for chemical analysis in Berlin, and followed the course of the disease. According to [Jewish inmate doctor and forced assistant) Dr Nyiszli, he also worked with tuberculous twins. [...] Dr Mengele's letters and reports to  [Nazi research physician] Professor von Verschuer were probably destroyed by von Verschuer [who went on to pursue a successful academic career after denazification]. [...] Right up to the last moments of the war, Professor von Verschuer was still hoping for a major breakthrough. [...] **Dr Mengele and Professor von Verschuer did not solve their problem**. (Benno Muller-Hill, *Murderous Science*, 1998)

For more on the tuberculosis study in particular and why it was scientifically flawed for other than racist reasons, see Benno Muller-Hill, [*Genetics of susceptibility to tuberculosis: Mengele’s experiments in Auschwitz*](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~piecze/MengeleBennoMullerHill.pdf) (Nature, Vol 2, August 2001, pp 631-634). Essentially, Mengele and his supervisor **clung to an outdated theory**.

Mengele also used the twins in (extremely painful) experiments to try to change their eye colour, but failed. This was an attempt at research on phenogenetic eye pigmentation and eye colour heredity. A particular Nazi focus was to find out **whether the structure and colour of the eye could be used to determine the ""race""** (Jewish or Aryan) of the subject. (Benoît Massin, *Mengele, die Zwillingsforschung und die „Auschwitz-Dahlem Connection""*. In: Carola Sachse (Ed.): *Die Verbindung nach Auschwitz. Biowissenschaften und Menschenversuche an Kaiser-Wilhelm-Instituten. Dokumentation eines Symposiums.* Göttingen 2003)

Secondly, many ""experiments"" seemed to have sprouted from an impulse of the moment and were not part of an integrated study as were the two experiments described above. No original paperwork survives on the other experiments, we therefore rely on a great number of eyewitness testimony. Some of these bizarre experiments were: sewing twins together to create conjoined twins, surgeries such as organ removal, castration, and amputations.

A symposium uniting experts from the field of law, history and medicine was held at the University of Minnesota in 1989 to discuss the Nazi human experiments. It had this to say about why Mengele's research was useless:

&gt;The experiments were carried out under circumstances that were scarcely representative of the normal human condition. The debilitated physical conditions of many of the victims most certainly confounded results from the experimental procedures.  [...]    
The absence of sound scientific reasoning or theory underlying the experiments. (Nancy L. Segal, *Twin Research at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Implications for the Use of Nazi Data Today*. In: Arthur C.

EATCHEX,"One major factor, and the basis for the Nazi stock term ""Judeo-Bolshevism"" or ""Jewish Communism"", was the fact that many prominent communist revolutionaries were Jewish. Trotsky, ally of Lenin and creator of the Red Army that would eventually capture Berlin, was born Lev Brohnstein, and was ethnically Jewish; Lev Kamenev, first Soviet head of state and later acting Premier as Lenin was ill, was mixed Jewish-Russian (born Rosenfeld). Zinoviev (head of the Comintern), Uritsky (People's Commissar of the North Commune), Sverdlov (Chairman of the Secretariat RCP), and Sokolnikov (Commissar for Finance) were all Jews with high positions in the Soviet Union's leadership. 

Hitler pointed to this as evidence that the Jews had conspired to overtake Russia and pull her out of a war, and then asserted that they had infiltrated Germany with the same intentions, and had made her weak. Germany was humiliated following the end of WWI, and many Germans were more than happy to find someone -- anyone -- to assign blame to. Jews, as 'outsiders in our midst', have long been easy scapegoats and targets for outrage and panic, and they became so again.

In reality, Jews made up ~7% of the Bolshevik membership under Lenin, and ~20% of its leadership. This *is* disproportionately high on both counts, but that's not evidence of a Jewish conspiracy, it's evidence of the fact that socially oppressed groups are more likely to agitate for radical change, and that people who join because their ethnicity/identity is discriminated against are more likely to be educated (and thus reach leadership positions) than people who join because of their work conditions in the mines and factories.",null,0,cdn56m9,1rgw7e,askhistorians,top_day,5

Tahkoxi Menatay is the name for North America in the Lenape language. Turtle's foundational role in establishing a homeland for the people of the Eastern Woodlands is widespread, though the details differ from place to place, and so the local equivalent of Tahkoxi Menatay is also widespread.

BeondTheGrave,"Im having a little trouble understanding your question? I think youre asking why people stop being incensed by atrocities. Or maybe why do conquered peoples eventually assimilate? 

The answer to the first question is simple: who still cares? Take the Carthage example, youll be hard pressed to find a Carthaginian whose incensed about those Italian upstarts. And those Italian upstarts have been conquered and reconquered so many times that their ancient culture has been virtually annihilated. So why would I get upset about it?

As for why cultures seem to assimilate (instead of carrying that ""beef"" with them forever), is one day it becomes better to be a (say) Roman than a Carthaginian. Your country was destroyed, you certainly cant rebel, the Romans will discriminate against you if you self-identify as Carthaginian (or if *they* identify you as a Carthaginian), so at some point it just becomes too hard for the common person to resist. And children especially, who are taught by the conquering culture, taught in a foreign language, raised with foreign children, eventually see *themselves* as a ""foreigner"". Its just natural. 

But these are ancient examples. I think if you look more recently, youll find that these acculturation processes take many generations. Look at the American Natives, some have assimilated, but an equal number are still angry about their conquest. And the Russians, they still celebrate the ""Great Patriotic War"", their expulsion of a conquering German army. So there are a lot of these passions still boiling in modern society which many people still have not forgotten and are still outraged over. (Armenian Genocide, Bay of Pigs, American Revolution, US Civil War, World War One, and the other aspects of World War Two, just to name a few hot button issues). 

The subtext here Im picking up is a general question as to why people arent more outraged by wars, especially older ones. And, aside from the previous comments on conflicts in cultural memory, I would like to point out that war is natural. We humans, for whatever reason, really like to kill each other. Weve been doing it a while, and were getting quite good at it. So the process of conquering, and being conquered, is fundamentally part of human experience. The people of the past understood this a lot better than we do now (assuming you are American or European), given our prolonged period of peace. So on a fundamental level, its hard to get upset over somebody being conquered. Its a natural fact of life, and it has gone on millennia (its even in the Bible!). In fact Id bet itll go on for millennia more.

snickeringshadow,"Excuse the laziness, but I'm cannibalizing earlier posts I've made on this topic. 

This is a very complicated topic and your question doesn't have a simple answer. There's a nugget of truth in this relating to events described in the primary sources, but popular perception of what happened has been heavily distorted in a way that bares little resemblance to the truth. Essentially, a number of factual events, misunderstandings, and outright myths have been confused with each other over time. This has ultimately produced this elaborate (but largely inaccurate) story that Cortés was an incarnation of Quetzalcoatl.

**Mesoamericans calling Europeans Gods**

There's a common tendency for European conquest sources to describe the natives referring to the Europeans as gods. Most of the Spanish accounts just take this for granted. The only first-hand account I've been able to find that seems to hint at what the natives might have actually thought is this quote from Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Bit of context, Cortés had just told the local Totonac people to imprison an Aztec tribute collector. They explained this was effectively a declaration of war, to which Cortés replied that he would take responsibility for it. The Totonacs were shocked:

&gt;The act they [the Totonac nobles] had witnessed was so astonishing and of such importance to them that they said no human beings dared to do such a thing, and it must be the work of teules. Therefore, from that moment they [natives] called us [Spanish] teules, which means gods or demons.

After this, the conquistadors start calling themselves ""teules,"" and the natives apparently do too.

There's a few issues with this though. First, ""Teule"" isn't a word. ""Teotl"" is, but it isn't a word in Totonac. It's a Nahuatl word. The Totonacs translated their word into Nahuatl, and then from there it was translated to Mayan, and from there to Spanish, where it was rendered as ""gods or demons."" It's hard to know what the original context of the phrase was because we don't know how it was used in the Totonac language. When later people continue calling the Spanish teotl, it's unclear if they actually thought the Spanish were divine or if they're just calling them that because the Spanish are calling themselves that.

**Possible Meanings**

The other problem comes with different concepts of divinity. The Mesoamerican concept of a ""teotl"" is not the same as the Grecko-Roman concept of a god. It's probably closer to the idea of a kami in the Shinto religion, in that it's not necessarily omnipotent or immortal. To put it another way, if you were to try to translate the major figures of the Christian religion into the Aztec world view, God, the Devil, all of the saints, all of the demons, all of the angels, and all of the prophets would be rendered as ""teotl"". For that matter, so would elves, goblins, fairies, or other creatures of Germanic folklore.

So when the natives were calling the Spanish ""teotl,"" they could have meant gods, or they could have just meant non-human. Or they could have meant that they were human, but simply had the backing of supernatural powers. For all we know, the Totonac lords could have meant it sarcastically. We only have the interaction recorded in Spanish, so there's no way to know. Either way, the Spanish thought that the natives thought they were gods and they began claiming divinity.They continually referred to themselves as 'teules.' When the Spanish arrived in Tenochtitlan, Motecuzoma put a stop to this immediately (Diaz del Castillo 2003 p207):

&gt;[Cortés], I know very well that these people of Tlaxcala with whom you are such good friends have told you that I am a sort of God or [teotl] ... I know well enough that you are wise and did not believe it but took it as a joke. Behold now, Señor [Cortés], my body is of flesh and bone like yours ... that I am a great king and inherit the riches of my ancestors is true, but not all the nonsense and lies that they have told you about me, although of course you treated it as a joke, as I did your thunder and lightning.

It doesn't take a PhD to see that while Motecuzoma is talking about himself here, he's also talking about Cortés. He's letting Cortés know that he knows he's just a human being, so he should stop claiming to be something else. Now, during the early colonial period the Spanish didn't have the nuanced understanding of this that we do now, and this ""Spaniards as gods"" thing was accepted as historical fact for a while.

**Cortes as Quetzalcoatl**

After the conquest, this myth got conflated with another myth: the returning god-king Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin. Some time (likely in the 13th century AD) there was a king of a city called Tula named Ce Acatl Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl. (IIRC, he was probably a real person as his name is carved on a pillar at the site of Tula, but much of his story has obviously been mythologized.) He was basically like a Mesoamerican ""King Arthur"" and is closely associated with the god Quetzalcoatl for whom he is named. (Often the two are equated with each other. Mesoamerican concepts of divinity are complicated and it wasn't uncommon for kings to associate themselves with gods.) The story goes that his nobles were jealous of his power, and so they tricked him into disgracing himself and forced him into exile. Before he left, he cursed those who betrayed him and vowed one day that he would return to reclaim his lost kingdom. He then got on boats and went east across the ocean. (If the story is true, he likely went to the Yucatan Peninsula, which is due east from the coast nearest to the Basin of Mexico.)
During the Early Colonial period, this story got conflated with Cortés. Supposedly the Aztecs believed that Cortés was a reincarnation of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin - supposedly because he arrived in the year One Reed. One Reed was the calendrical portion of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin's name (Ce Acatl). However, most modern scholars (for example, Mike Smith, Matthew Restall, etc.) consider this to be one of these post-hoc prophecy attributions. Cortés does not mention it in his letters to the King of Spain, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo only makes vague references to a prophecy about ""white men with beards"" who would rule over Mexico. However, Diaz del Castillo was writing decades after the fact, when this legend of Cortés-as-Quetzalcoatl had already been established. It seems more likely that the prophecy was attributed to Cortés after the conquest as a means of explaining what happened.

**EDIT**: As others have pointed out, the attribution of the Quetzalcoatl prophecy to Cortés is discussed by Sahagún, who is writing decades after the conquest but largely pulling the account from indigenous informants. However, as Restall (2003:112-114) demonstrates, this version of events was popularized by Christian missionaries like Motolinía in the late 1520s as a conversion tactic - it helped if the natives saw the conquest as divinely ordained. And as /u/400-Rabbits pointed out (referencing Brumfiel), many of Sahagún's informants were Christian Nahuas, who would have been influenced by these early missionaries. So yeah, just because it's mentioned in a colonial era source doesn't make it true.

snickeringshadow,"Excuse the laziness, but I'm cannibalizing earlier posts I've made on this topic. 

This is a very complicated topic and your question doesn't have a simple answer. There's a nugget of truth in this relating to events described in the primary sources, but popular perception of what happened has been heavily distorted in a way that bares little resemblance to the truth. Essentially, a number of factual events, misunderstandings, and outright myths have been confused with each other over time. This has ultimately produced this elaborate (but largely inaccurate) story that Cortés was an incarnation of Quetzalcoatl.

**Mesoamericans calling Europeans Gods**

There's a common tendency for European conquest sources to describe the natives referring to the Europeans as gods. Most of the Spanish accounts just take this for granted. The only first-hand account I've been able to find that seems to hint at what the natives might have actually thought is this quote from Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Bit of context, Cortés had just told the local Totonac people to imprison an Aztec tribute collector. They explained this was effectively a declaration of war, to which Cortés replied that he would take responsibility for it. The Totonacs were shocked:

&gt;The act they [the Totonac nobles] had witnessed was so astonishing and of such importance to them that they said no human beings dared to do such a thing, and it must be the work of teules. Therefore, from that moment they [natives] called us [Spanish] teules, which means gods or demons.

After this, the conquistadors start calling themselves ""teules,"" and the natives apparently do too.

There's a few issues with this though. First, ""Teule"" isn't a word. ""Teotl"" is, but it isn't a word in Totonac. It's a Nahuatl word. The Totonacs translated their word into Nahuatl, and then from there it was translated to Mayan, and from there to Spanish, where it was rendered as ""gods or demons."" It's hard to know what the original context of the phrase was because we don't know how it was used in the Totonac language. When later people continue calling the Spanish teotl, it's unclear if they actually thought the Spanish were divine or if they're just calling them that because the Spanish are calling themselves that.

**Possible Meanings**

The other problem comes with different concepts of divinity. The Mesoamerican concept of a ""teotl"" is not the same as the Grecko-Roman concept of a god. It's probably closer to the idea of a kami in the Shinto religion, in that it's not necessarily omnipotent or immortal. To put it another way, if you were to try to translate the major figures of the Christian religion into the Aztec world view, God, the Devil, all of the saints, all of the demons, all of the angels, and all of the prophets would be rendered as ""teotl"". For that matter, so would elves, goblins, fairies, or other creatures of Germanic folklore.

So when the natives were calling the Spanish ""teotl,"" they could have meant gods, or they could have just meant non-human. Or they could have meant that they were human, but simply had the backing of supernatural powers. For all we know, the Totonac lords could have meant it sarcastically. We only have the interaction recorded in Spanish, so there's no way to know. Either way, the Spanish thought that the natives thought they were gods and they began claiming divinity.They continually referred to themselves as 'teules.' When the Spanish arrived in Tenochtitlan, Motecuzoma put a stop to this immediately (Diaz del Castillo 2003 p207):

&gt;[Cortés], I know very well that these people of Tlaxcala with whom you are such good friends have told you that I am a sort of God or [teotl] ... I know well enough that you are wise and did not believe it but took it as a joke. Behold now, Señor [Cortés], my body is of flesh and bone like yours ... that I am a great king and inherit the riches of my ancestors is true, but not all the nonsense and lies that they have told you about me, although of course you treated it as a joke, as I did your thunder and lightning.

It doesn't take a PhD to see that while Motecuzoma is talking about himself here, he's also talking about Cortés. He's letting Cortés know that he knows he's just a human being, so he should stop claiming to be something else. Now, during the early colonial period the Spanish didn't have the nuanced understanding of this that we do now, and this ""Spaniards as gods"" thing was accepted as historical fact for a while.

**Cortes as Quetzalcoatl**

After the conquest, this myth got conflated with another myth: the returning god-king Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin. Some time (likely in the 13th century AD) there was a king of a city called Tula named Ce Acatl Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl. (IIRC, he was probably a real person as his name is carved on a pillar at the site of Tula, but much of his story has obviously been mythologized.) He was basically like a Mesoamerican ""King Arthur"" and is closely associated with the god Quetzalcoatl for whom he is named. (Often the two are equated with each other. Mesoamerican concepts of divinity are complicated and it wasn't uncommon for kings to associate themselves with gods.) The story goes that his nobles were jealous of his power, and so they tricked him into disgracing himself and forced him into exile. Before he left, he cursed those who betrayed him and vowed one day that he would return to reclaim his lost kingdom. He then got on boats and went east across the ocean. (If the story is true, he likely went to the Yucatan Peninsula, which is due east from the coast nearest to the Basin of Mexico.)
During the Early Colonial period, this story got conflated with Cortés. Supposedly the Aztecs believed that Cortés was a reincarnation of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin - supposedly because he arrived in the year One Reed. One Reed was the calendrical portion of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin's name (Ce Acatl). However, most modern scholars (for example, Mike Smith, Matthew Restall, etc.) consider this to be one of these post-hoc prophecy attributions. Cortés does not mention it in his letters to the King of Spain, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo only makes vague references to a prophecy about ""white men with beards"" who would rule over Mexico. However, Diaz del Castillo was writing decades after the fact, when this legend of Cortés-as-Quetzalcoatl had already been established. It seems more likely that the prophecy was attributed to Cortés after the conquest as a means of explaining what happened.

**EDIT**: As others have pointed out, the attribution of the Quetzalcoatl prophecy to Cortés is discussed by Sahagún, who is writing decades after the conquest but largely pulling the account from indigenous informants. However, as Restall (2003:112-114) demonstrates, this version of events was popularized by Christian missionaries like Motolinía in the late 1520s as a conversion tactic - it helped if the natives saw the conquest as divinely ordained. And as /u/400-Rabbits pointed out (referencing Brumfiel), many of Sahagún's informants were Christian Nahuas, who would have been influenced by these early missionaries. So yeah, just because it's mentioned in a colonial era source doesn't make it true.

rosemary85,"A book that adequately covered the literatures of *all* ancient cultures would be quite a sight! Let's see, if we set a cut-off point at, say, 400 CE we've got Sumerian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Ugaritic, Hittite/Hurrian, Greek, Israelite, Indian (Sanskrit, Tamil, and Pali), Chinese, and Roman. Some of these are much more copious than others: we've only got a few snippets in Sumerian; by contrast, we've got far more Greek literature than any of the others (though it isn't all literary), followed -- I think -- by Sanskrit and then Latin. If you extend the date a bit closer to the present you get lots more, like Syriac, Armenian, and so on.

Comparing them: how can you compare the literatures of a dozen cultures, when each culture's literature has a story of its own, with huge variation in styles and content? I wouldn't dare. A few comparative efforts have been made: Erich Auerbach's classic *Mimesis* (1946) devotes the first few chapters to comparing the styles of Greek, Israelite, and Roman literary works; a couple of recent books by Bruce Louden try to compare the Homeric epics to Israelite literature, though without any historical basis (*The Iliad: Structure, Myth, and Meaning* [2006]; *Homer's Odyssey and the Near East* [2011]).

Much more sane is the developmental approach that tries to isolate specific tropes and trace their development through many cultures' literatures and mythologies back to a hypothetical archetype, often Sumerian or Indo-European. This includes linguistic approaches, like Gregory Nagy's *Comparative Studies in Greek and Indic Meter* (1974) and Calvert Watkins' *How to Kill a Dragon* (1995), and mythological/typological approaches like M. L. West's *The East Face of Helicon* (1997) and *Indo-European Poetry and Myth* (2007). The good news is that, unlike the books I mentioned in the previous paragraph, studies like these are on pretty firm ground methodologically.

The bad news is that they also tend to be rather technical and forbidding. They deal with minutiae, rather than with grand things like ""world view"". I doubt very much that there is *anything* useful to be said about a monolithic world view: does the Hesiodic *Theogony* have more in common (in terms of world view) with Thucydides or Euclid than, say, with the *Ba'al Cycle*? I rather think not. The literature of a culture is just too variegated for it to be meaningful to compare it with another, as though they were single entities.",null,0,cdn6ouz,1rgrp4,askhistorians,top_day,4

MarcusDohrelius,"They did. There is much more of a link in cultural migration and origins between Graeco-Roman cultures. But later interactions, especially after the Roman annexing of Egypt, show a deep appreciation.  Of course there is Julius Caesar's famous interaction with Egypt. It is a mixed bag of admiration and superiority. He led the Egyptian queen Arsinoe IV through the streets in chains, but he also borrowed the Egyptian calendar. Lucan even goes so far as to attribute Caesar's stint in Egypt as his reason for seeking autocracy. But equally interesting is an incident with Vespasian. Many Egyptian deities would make their way into the Roman pantheon. Vespasian seems to accept the Egyptian god Serapis as his patron deity, even believing he has a vision and is given powers to heal. This is telling as the cult of the emperor as deity was more an Eastern and Egyptian precedent. Here is an excerpt from Tacitus' *Histories*


"" This deepened Vespasian's desire to visit the holy house of Serapis, for he wished to consult the god on matters of state. He had everyone else excluded from the temple, and went in alone, fixing his mind on the deity. Happening to glance round, he caught sight of a leading Egyptian named Basilides standing behind him. Now he knew that this man was detained by illness far from Alexandria at a place several days' journey distant. He inquired of the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple that day. He also inquired of those he met whether he had been seen in the city. Finally he sent off a party on horse, and ascertained that at the relevant time he had been eighty miles away. Thereupon he guessed that the vision was a divine one and that the reply to his query lay in the meaning of the name Basilides.""",null,0,cdn1v9m,1rglly,askhistorians,top_day,4

Why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man? Why? If a black man can't move his store into a white community, you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community. The philosophy of black nationalism involves a re-education program in the black community in regards to economics.

i_330,"A lot. For our purposes, we'll begin with the Russian Civil War. There were understandably some people who were sort of upset about the abdication of the tsar and the events of 1917. Those people are known as the Whites. The Whites put up a pretty good fight, but the Bolsheviks ended up defeating them. The Bolsheviks were now running the country out of Petrograd (which became Leningrad in 1925, after Lenin died) and the USSR was beginning to (sort of) be recognized as a legitimate state abroad.

In the meantime, it had been discovered that state ownership of the means of production was causing severe economic hardship, so Lenin developed the New Economic Plan (NEP), which allowed for limited private enterprise and, pretty crucially, mostly left the peasants alone (collective farming was a really unpopular idea, but I'll talk about that in greater detail once we get into the 1930s under Stalin). Basically, NEP held the Soviet Union back from famine, economic collapse and open revolt for most of the '20s. 

But in 1924, Lenin died, and a power struggle ensued. Stalin managed to come out on top, abolished NEP in 1928, and embarked on a very ambitious, destructive plan to bring the entire Soviet economy under state control. Chaos ensued. Stalin started by taking everything away from the peasants and establishing massive collective farms. The peasants were really, really not into this, to the point where they start slaughtering their livestock rather than surrender them to the state. At the same time, Stalin was on a ruthless campaign against kulaks (wealthy/wealthyish peasants) around this time, most of whom were shot or exiled to Siberia. Collectivization was also one of the factors that contributed to the Holodomor, a famine in Ukraine that killed somewhere between 2 and 5 million people. 

So that's what was going on with the agricultural sector. There was trouble afoot in other spheres of Soviet life, as well: Stalin was embarking on a massive campaign of executions known as the Great Terror. That went on on roughly from 1934-39, although there's a lot of disagreement on that. It's almost impossible to overstate how absolutely nuts the Great Terror was. There's an apocryphal story about a man who put his coffee mug down on a picture of Stalin's face in the newspaper, leaving a wet ring that a passing KGB officer happened to notice and arrested him on the spot for. That particular story is probably not true, but it gives you a sense of the prevailing tone in Soviet life during that period. Everyone was listening to/informing on everybody else. Forced ""migrations"" of ethnic minorities (Tatars, Kalmyks, Volga Germans, and many others) were happening on a massive scale. People were being arrested for literally nothing, tortured, forced to sign confessions, and either executed or sent to the gulag (an enormous system of prisons spanning the entire country--we're still not completely sure how many there were). People usually never came out of the gulag, but some people did and lived to write about it (the most famous is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, but the work of Varlam Shalamov is also highly recommended if you're at all curious about the gulag). Basically, what Stalin was doing was using a climate of paralyzing, all-encompassing terror to consolidate power at home. It was effective. Devastatingly effective. I'm doing my thesis on the legacy of Stalinism in Russia, and I'd argue that it still informs contemporary Russia in a MAJOR way, but I digress.

I gather from your question that you're primarily curious about domestic developments in Russia, but there is one foreign policy thing that I should probably mention: the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which is signed in 1939 and guarantees mutual non-aggression between Germany and the USSR in the event of another European war. In 1941, Hitler completely breaks this treaty and invades the Soviet Union, and that takes us up to the beginning of Soviet involvement in WWII.

That was a very long-winded and simultaneously simplistic account of what happened. Stalinism is far more complex and horrifying than can possibly be expressed in a Reddit post, but I think this more or less covers the major events. If you're curious, I can point you towards some further reading on this period.

* The Soviet-Polish War happens between 1919 and 1921. The Poles are able to fight them to a standstill, and it ends in the division of disputed Belorussian territory. This is important because it ends the idea of global revolution and makes the Soviet Union into a belligerent power expanding for its own sake.

* After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviets started to reach out and take control over their sphere of influence. They invade Finland in the Winter War, are stopped by winter and fierce resistance, and only win by having the bigger army. They take some disputed territory and a naval base, but I'm not sure if they thought they'd take the whole country. The Union's weak performance in the Polish and Finnish war contributed to Hitler's belief that it would quickly collapse when the Axis invaded. The Finns would fight again after the start of Barbarossa in the Continuation War, which they planned together with the German action.

* Russia gives an ultimatum to the Baltic States to accede to the Union. They give in, and Moscow later demands that Romania cede a region called Barbarossa. This, and the earlier Vienna Dictate which forced it to transfer Transylvania to Hungary, brings about a right-wing coup. Romania joins the Axis and participates in Barbarossa. 

* While the Pact was in effect, there was a lot of Soviet-German economic cooperation. The Russians would provide oil, ores, and grain in exchange for technical information and industrial and naval hardware. 

* There were a series of border clashes between Soviet Union (and its puppet Mongolia) and the Empire of Japan (and its puppet Manchukuo) in what is now northeastern China.

i_330,"A lot. For our purposes, we'll begin with the Russian Civil War. There were understandably some people who were sort of upset about the abdication of the tsar and the events of 1917. Those people are known as the Whites. The Whites put up a pretty good fight, but the Bolsheviks ended up defeating them. The Bolsheviks were now running the country out of Petrograd (which became Leningrad in 1925, after Lenin died) and the USSR was beginning to (sort of) be recognized as a legitimate state abroad.

In the meantime, it had been discovered that state ownership of the means of production was causing severe economic hardship, so Lenin developed the New Economic Plan (NEP), which allowed for limited private enterprise and, pretty crucially, mostly left the peasants alone (collective farming was a really unpopular idea, but I'll talk about that in greater detail once we get into the 1930s under Stalin). Basically, NEP held the Soviet Union back from famine, economic collapse and open revolt for most of the '20s. 

But in 1924, Lenin died, and a power struggle ensued. Stalin managed to come out on top, abolished NEP in 1928, and embarked on a very ambitious, destructive plan to bring the entire Soviet economy under state control. Chaos ensued. Stalin started by taking everything away from the peasants and establishing massive collective farms. The peasants were really, really not into this, to the point where they start slaughtering their livestock rather than surrender them to the state. At the same time, Stalin was on a ruthless campaign against kulaks (wealthy/wealthyish peasants) around this time, most of whom were shot or exiled to Siberia. Collectivization was also one of the factors that contributed to the Holodomor, a famine in Ukraine that killed somewhere between 2 and 5 million people.

Oxen_boxen,"&gt;What started WW2?


A number of things. The *formal* event was Germany and the USSR partitioning off Poland. Western allies didn't necessarily *like* the Soviet Union, but they still had contractual obligations and treaties to fight with Poland, and Germany was the new kid on the block- I think everyone at the start of WW2 figured that if they had to fight anyone, it'd be the Germans and not the Soviets that would be easier to deal with.


But you need to go a lot deeper than that. 


First, you need to appreciate WW1. Now, where most countries funded the war by taxes, Germany took the unusual route of paying it off via loans. Which wasn't traditionally a *bad* idea. Countries don't go bankrupt in a conventional sense- Once Germany took itself off the gold standard the value of it's currency was in effect a guarantee to German *labor* rather than a concrete concept like *gold*. 


But then the Germans lost the war. Which both stuck out as bizarre to the Germans- not one set of enemy boots stepped into German territory- and insulting. They were made to look like the *bad* guys when they were fighting on behalf of allies who were dealing with states who were endorsing *terrorism*. Archduke Ferdinand had been assassinated by a state funded terrorist organization. Not to say Germany wasn't looking for an excuse to flex it's military muscles- it had already thumped more than one state who reasonably should have been doing the thumping, not being the thumpee, but Germany wasn't in a position where it could just sit on it's laurels- it was late to the colonization party. *Too late*. North America was colonized, South America was colonized. Asia had been colonized. Africa too. There was essentially nothing *left* to claim. What's more, it'd take *decades* to roll out a fleet that'd stand up to the likes of the British empire, or any other major players. If Germany wanted to prosper, it would essentially have to be on the corpses of it's European rivals. 



*At any rate* after this huge humiliation in WW1 which felt like it was more a consequence of grossly incompetent politicians domestically, and vindictive ones abroad, they got handed down the Treaty of Versailles. Aside from asking that a ludicrous amount of money be paid in reparations- most estimates have it being more than the country was even *valued* at- they were still out for the debt accrued to pay for the war in the first place. And the way the reparations would be payed would be a flat rate, plus around 25% of the money they profited off exports. Essentially Germany was wedged between massive war debt, war reparations, and their export economy, which they were obviously dependent on, got slapped with a 25% tax. 


So three things happened- Germany went *off* the gold standard, the quality of goods took a nose dive because no one wanted to pay a premium for something which fundamentally hadn't *changed*, and the value of the Reichmark imploded. Hyperinflation ensued because Germany had to make good on it's reparations and debt, but couldn't afford to cover it on the gold standard. Once off it, everything became a self-perpetuating cycle. As Germany spent money, the value of it decreased, which caused them to print more. Eventually it got to the point where France and Belgium threw up their hands and said, ""enough!"" German currency was beyond worthless at this point (people would express money in logarithmic functions rather than write out 16, 18, 20 zeros) and demanded raw goods. When Germany could make good on these (there does seem to be an argument that some elements in the Wiemar republic did this on purpose) France then occupied sovereign German soil. For reference on just *how* inflated reich marks would get, look at the wikipedia article on German hyper-inflation. 



So now we have Germany with a crippled economy, worthless currency, and with foreign soldiers occupying sovereign German territory in the Ruhr. 



Now, we'll add in the other terms in the Treaty of Versailles. First, Germany had to turn over land to Poland. Whom they hadn't lost to, and hadn't really fought either. In fact, Poland hadn't even existed! Despite being a state which had been constantly traded between the Russian Empire (historically), the Austrians and the Prussians, it was only Germany who really got stung by this. 



Additionally, the Germans were basically told they couldn't maintain an army, *at all.* This'd become a major player in Hitler's early propaganda to justify action in Poland and the Battle of France- while being told to disarm, no one really bothered following through. The Treaty of Versailles told everyone to take their hands off the trigger for the guns they all had pointed at each other, but in all reality their other hand behind their back was doing something else *entirely*.



So WW1 was kind of a swift kick in the nuts for the Germans, and they were reasonably aggravated by it. They were the victims of rival nations in Europe, and subjects of what they saw as incompetent politicians domestically, and it was *their* quality of life that was getting obliterated as a result.



And then Hitler shows up. To be certain, while he was popular, he wasn't *that* popular. Hitler didn't get elected into office, so he kind of had to browbeat his way into it. ""Cheat"" if you will. He tells everyone it wasn't really their fault. He throws out the treaty of Versailles. He modernizes the German army (ok, lets be frank: The panzer 1 and panzer 2 were awful designs and the Germans had a poor understanding of forecasting where tank development would go, while dramatically over-spending to fight what would come from it) and goes after the ""real"" enemies within and restoring German dignity abroad- Hitler actually got Chamberlain to balk at the idea of standing up to Germany! But there was an eventual end to Germany being able to politic their way around things. 



First, there were the Bolshiveks who were ideological opposites to the Nazi party, who'd now basically thrown out any pretense of republic and democracy. Hitler wanted a nation that chose a sort of middle path- not pawns of capitalism, but not mindless cogs in a grand communist machine either. Furthermore there was that whole issue with Poland- while it may very well have been political rhetoric to keep folks at home happy, Polish leaders had said a couple of times they weren't going to stop with just the land they won from Versailles. Hitler used this as pretense to war- which he'd further use to justify fighting France and the British. You'll notice the French and British declared war on Germany, but not the Soviet Union. It's not like Germany took all of Poland- some of it went to the USSR, under a treaty no less! 



In other words, the short answer is that WW2 started because Nazi Germany needed something to ""colonize"", and needed political fodder to justify itself. The state wouldn't have been self-sustaining under Socialism without making value come from *somewhere.* A lot of this was extracted from minorities and whomever they happened to conquer. 

&gt;why did the Nazis really hate the Jews?

As for the bit about Jews, its *complicated.* The were a victim of circumstance and convenience. Hitler needed to sell his concept of the German monoculture, and it just so happened that either through willful disinterest, or ostracism, Jews weren't a part of that. And a number of wealthy Jews happened to own some compelling businesses. Jewish bankers helped fund the allies in WW1. Jewish media (This was a feature of Germany's propaganda, I don't know to what extent the Jews owned media rings in the early 20th century. In short, the Nazi party wanted to ""call out"" the Jewish media for being a bunch of spin doctors, turning a country like the US which still was fairly distrustful of states like Great Britain due to their large populations of Irish and German immigrants) helped draw the US into WW1 and portrayed the Germans as monsters where they were previously just fighting another European war. Hitler basically sold Germany the idea that the Jews were ruled by some sort of hive mind, and that the actions of one Jew, or a group of Jews in the US was doing was the sin of the *whole* race / religion. 


It's a classic miss-use of correlation and causation being misunderstood. The Nazi party could plausibly demonstrate that some Jews happened to be in positions where they could fund efforts to make sure Germany lost the first world war, ergo *all* Jews were a problem for the state. Add some pseudo-science making them see sub-human, and boom, public enemy number one. 


When you hide a lie or two behind a truth or three, your average person is never going to know the difference. If you dig *far* enough you can make *any* group look bad. 


This'd only be further fueled by a willful disinterest in establishing *what* to do with the Jews. Krystallnacht had been orchestrated by Goebells (Goerning?) to impress Hitler. At some level initially the Nazi party had even talked of simply deporting all Jews to Palestine. The *reasoning* behind what is probably the most *core* reason behind all of this is actually in how they proposed to *pay* for it- the Nazi part was to seize all property of these Jews and compensate them in machinery. Which of course would be done at a rate that favored the State. 


Basically the Nazi party needed a political scapegoat to justify themselves, they needed money because the ghosts of war's past still haunted the German economy, and it just so happened that if everyone hated an entire minority (or several groups) they would be *far* more willing to turn a blind eye when they get shipped off to labor camps. Making the Jews a band of minority villains covered *all* three bases.

In short, fascism is a radical, authoritarian, rightist response to Communism and liberalism.  A fascist regime will espouse a fervently ideology in its political culture, bordering on a religious zeal.  This zeal is espoused by a charismatic leader that reinforces his (really has to be a man) extreme nationalism with romantic symbols.  The regime will enforce this ideology with a mass mobilization and militarization of the population, leading to an emphasis on masculinity and the vibrancy of youth.  

Fascism emerged from the Italian futurism of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.

depanneur,"The fundamental roots of ideological fascism lay in the changes caused by industrial society on traditional hierarchies and social institutions. It was philosophically based in a 19th century critique of liberalism and positivism, as well as the writings of Gustav Le Bon and George Sorel, who wrote of the importance of mass movements led by a leader and myth which would direct man’s chaotic tendencies into constructive avenues through some sort of dynamic activism.  The assumptions of these authors were based on a widespread ‘fin du siècle’ attitude towards the challenges imposed by an industrial society which alienated man; on one hand, their individuality was robbed by industrial society but at the same time they sought an avenue to assert this individuality. 

Fascism was consciously constructed as a response to the theories put forward by Le Bon, Sorel and others and was meant to not only expunge industrial alienation through mass participation in an organic society, but also to provide a quasi-religious alternative to Marxism which would overcome the inherent dichotomies of industrial society (individual v. society, private v. public etc.) through a powerful state. Fascism's solution to industrial alienation was mass participation in an organic state led by a charismatic leader. Mussolini believed that a totalitarian state would be able to multiply an individual's abilities and creativity if he submitted to its authority.  It was also an open-ended ideology which allowed it to attract a whole spectrum of dissatisfied individuals, from conservative anti-Bolsheviks to more radical socialistic corporatists. It must be emphasized that the aims of fascism were meant to produce a sort of national rebirth, and was thus inherently nationalist. Paradoxically, because all fascisms are tempered by their nations' historical and social particularities, there can be no monumental fascism, just a 'fascist minimum' that has to be generally defined. It was necessarily brutal as well because fascist activism took on a militaristic aspect due to the fact that most members of fascist squads were veterans of the First World War, their leaders were frontline officers during the war and both viewed the post-war world embodied in liberalism, socialism and sometimes conservatism as an enemy to be destroyed. Fascist activism could take the form of rural anti-socialist campaigns in Italy, SA streetfights with communists and arguably the SS' role in the attempted eradication of European Jewry. 

On less philosophical level, fascism was a movement of the bourgeois class meant to protect traditional hierarchies from social revolution and also to organize societies in ways which would continue its social advancement.  Indeed, fascist traditionalism always coincided with bourgeois values and prejudices; fascism always thought of itself as a cultural rather than socio-economic revolution, which made it attractive to the upper classes.  Fascism was an outlet for bourgeois frustrations and anxieties that would simultaneously protect their treasured hierarchies and private property. Corporatism, fascism’s sole contribution to economic thought, was meant to reorganize economic and social relations into guild-like structures of workers and bosses that in practice amounted to a façade which hid a complex system of public and private bureaucracies.  Fascists believed that society and the economy should transcend class divisions (perceived as a Marxist invention) and be organized into a collection of corporatist bodies united under the all-embracing state.

Fascism, as has been described, was fundamentally anti-socialist because of these bourgeois prejudices. In Germany and Italy, both regimes came to power largely because of their physical anti-socialist campaigns and because conservative elites wanted to eliminate the Left in parliament who had institutionalized their power through the recognition of union rights, not because of their ambitious plans for cultural revolution.  As well, fascism’s anti-liberalism had no small part to play in its popularity. Liberalism, during the inter-war period, had become associated with Wilson’s Fourteen Points and consequently the results of the Paris peace treaties, which gave resonance to the ideology in revisionist countries like Italy, Germany and Hungary. Fascism was also anti-Conservative in the context of a generational conflict between old (conservative) and younger (fascist) reactionaries. In reality, fascists always cooperated with conservatives to some extent, and fascist leaders, most notably Hitler, preferred conservatives to other fascists.

In short, fascism is a radical, authoritarian, rightist response to Communism and liberalism.  A fascist regime will espouse a fervently ideology in its political culture, bordering on a religious zeal.  This zeal is espoused by a charismatic leader that reinforces his (really has to be a man) extreme nationalism with romantic symbols.  The regime will enforce this ideology with a mass mobilization and militarization of the population, leading to an emphasis on masculinity and the vibrancy of youth.

Most of the citizen brought over by the French were prisoners or very low class people, without the capital to purchase slaves.  The colony was kind of a backwater and neither nation could really control the smuggling and extralegal activities that were the colony's primary source of profit.  There were certainly slaves, but the underpopulated areas of the territory gave them plenty of room to develop their own lifestyles, relatively free of interference.  This led to a very African creole culture.

Furthermore, as Catholic nations, Spain and France shared many cultural similarities regarding their slaves.  Free people of color and manumitted slaves were both more common in French and Spanish colonies than in English colonies.  This high proportion of free people of color persisted after the US took over, but it slowly decreased over time until the Civil War.  Before the Civil War Louisianians often kept the distinctions between the various degrees of ""blackness"", such as quadroons and mulattos.  After the Civil War, the ""one drop"" way of looking at African-Americans began to dominate, though former slaves and free people of color frequently ran into friction between each other.  

We've also come to realize, when looking at slavery in the western hemisphere, that the laws that the imperial power passed bared little relation to what was happening on the ground, most of the time.  Both Spain and France passed laws that were pretty nice to slaves, but slave owners rarely obeyed those laws.  Slaves in the area may not even know that the territory had changed hands for a good while afterwards.

Joining the Community Party USA in the 1930s was not like registering to be a Democrat or a Republican, it was signing up to be an active member in a revolutionary sub-culture. Members would be expected to be actively participating in meetings or other events almost every night, and in some areas (especially in New York), there was almost a separate Communist infrastructure in place for those who wanted to partake of it (shops run by Communist Party members, Communist Party newspapers, even Communist Party summer camps).

brennabru,"I suppose you're asking about women at court. For richer women who were inside, maybe a silk or cloth slipper (A bit like a ballet slipper) or a shoe that came to the ankle with a strap across the foot, probably again made of expensive and not hard wearing cloth. Rich women in towns would wear shoes with built up heels to keep their dresses out of the filth in the streets. London was one only three or four big towns at the time, so it's possible they would have worn these to go out, or boots for riding.  
Other rural women may have simple leather shoes that came to the ankle. Think the sort of shoe with a buckle strap across the foot for wealthier women, or for poorer women just a plain closed shoe, still leather that was simple and stitched together and hardy. Of course there were some who went bare foot. I believe that the strap and buckle sort of shoe was popular across England as seen here, styles and decoration would have varied according to class. I hope I could help! http://revival.us/luxurytudorshoe.aspx P.s- don't trust The Tudors on costume! As lovely as they look, I don't think they were particularly historically accurate.
Oh I forgot about men. Not too sure, I'm less sure about this. Probably more closed shoes for lower classes, not the buckle and strap. It's possible clogs (Made of wood and leather) would have been popular for working men, but generally more closed shoes would have been worn. Also, shoes like slip on leather loafers with much of a heel. I know the king would have worn the strap and buckle shoe too, like women, but with more of a flat front. Different materials would have varied. I'm pretty sure they generally wore shoes over boots (Boots for riding), and to us they may have seemed quite slipper like in comparison to the shoes we wear today, but the were only for the floors of court. 

I am a history student hoping to specialise in domestic history from the early modern period (1450-1750). I also used to dress as a tudor for a week each summer for a museum re-enactment, and I wore shoes in that time.

gwenever,"Heels first arose during Elizabeth's reign and were worn by both women and men.  Style was largely influenced by Italy during this time period, and Venice popularized a platform shoe called a chopine.  This site has some great original shoes, but they really demonstrate [extreme examples](http://blog.lulus.com/fashion/lady-gaga-meets-her-match-the-chopine-shoe/).  There could be some fashion competitiveness in court and if fashion could be taken to the extreme, you could bet at least a handful of flashy nobles would try to acquire the finest materials, or tallest shoes.  Elizabeth, it is said, was fond of her small feet and as a result had the hems of some of her dresses shortened in order to show off flashy, bejeweled heels.  It was not common prior to Elizabeth for noble women's footwear to be visible.  

While Elizabeth encouraged the nobility to consider elevating foot fashion, her father Henry VIII was interested in more northern regions.  Henry VIIIs great pride were his shapely legs.  In the Tudor dynasty well muscled but elegant legs were a highly desirable trait for men, and young Henry had sexy gams.  He frequently wore hose or tight fitting breeches and wore leg garters to tighten his legwear and accentuate his legs.  It's very likely that his obsession with leg garters contributed to the leg ulcer that became a debilitating issue later in his life.  But Henry's most interesting contribution to fashion was probably the tremendous size of the codpiece, which reached its zenith during his reign.  [This pic](http://www.backtoclassics.com/gallery/hanstheyoungerholbein/henryviii/) shows Henry rockin the leg garters and codpiece that he made popular.  You can also see his shoes, which are the turnshoe style mentioned by brennabru.  [Here](http://oxthepunx.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/img_1446ed.jpg) we see Henry's armor, with impressive codpiece on display.  

During Elizabeth's reign the codpiece fell quickly out of fashion and reduced greatly in size.  Elizabeth had far more of an influence on bringing changing shoe fashions to England.  The first heeled incarnations were similar to clogs, with a wedge heel, and eventually evolved into what we think of as a heeled pump or court shoe today.  The shoes would be made out of any fabric, with wealthier citizens having elaborate embroidery and extra high tongues (a display of wealth since they could afford the extra fabric and decoration).  

Boots were worn for practical reasons, like hunting, and could be any height from ankle to hip.  Tall boots might have a slashed and bloused top, be folded, crenelated or other decorative styles.    ",null,0,cdn670p,1rg195,askhistorians,top_day,2
