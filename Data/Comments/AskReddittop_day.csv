JohnBoxer,"My neighbor had been constantly but slowly taking random items from my home when he was over for parties or cook outs. When confronted he denied any involvement, but I knew he was lying. One day he was not home so I snuck into his garage that he keeps unlocked. I found my items strewn around his garage. Keeping notes of the items, I left and continuously checked back every time I had a get together that he attended. Then he stole a dinner plate that was where my grandfather placed the engagement ring for my grandmother 50 years before. Furious, I waited in rage for him to leave the next morning. As soon as he pulled out of his driveway I ran and collected the 20+  miscellaneous items and the plate. I held a cook out 2 weeks later and placed all the knick nacks on the plate in the middle of the food table. He walked in and I looked him right in the eye. ""No involvement, huh"". I was so mad, but it was worth it to see his face beat red. He sprinted away and later apologized. It was heart felt, yet it felt better to see him squirm. TLDR: Neighbor stole objects that I ended up shoving in his lying face later.

About 3 months in I got pissed off and refused to buy anymore (I had a secret stash in my closet).  I found out how resourceful these 2 fuckers were.  Roommate #1 fully utilized his gym membership and made the local LA Fitness his poop headquarters.  Roommate #2 (we'll code name him ""Piglet"") decided he didn't want to leave the house and any time he went into the bathroom for more than a couple of minutes, the shower would turn on shortly there after.

Mexico is another thing.  While Canada is a well functioning country, Mexico is not.  An invasion could be done saying it was for humanitarian reasons.  Mexico has oil, lots of oil.  It also has lots of other resources.  It could be beneficial to conquer it, not just overthrow the government, but take it.  A few problems.  Mexico has a lot of Mexicans in America, millions.  Second Mexico is big, 115 million people, ranked 11 in the world, size ranked 14.  Lots of urban areas, densely populated, which would be lots of dead Americans.  Their military is not that bad, American trained.  A quarter million strong.  Which is not a big issue.  The big issues is they could put 90 million peole in military functions.  90 million fit for service, not a good number to go against if it lasts a while.  Another, while they did not make nukes they have been making weapons grade nuclear materials for years.  They recently turned it over to America, but would you turn it all over or save some just in case.  It would easily be the largest war in American history.

fightinscot,"My first vivid memory happened when I was around 4. Since my parents worked during the day, my grandpa was retired and my grandma worked for a school so she had the summer off, I spent most summer days with them. My grandpa was far and away my best friend at that age. My uncle was as well, but there was something special about my grandpa. He owned about 15 acres at his boyhood home that he kept a garden of corn, tomatoes, green beans and peppers. The majority of this area was an apple orchard. I can still remember one mild summer day where he loaded me up on his old Case tractor and we rode up into the orchard. We sat around, ate the newly ripened apples, talked about whatever my 3 or 4 year old mind could come up with and he talked about how he remembers coming up here as a boy and how he brought my mom and uncles up here when they were little. We rode back and shortly after getting back to their house, my mom picked me up.

A few months later his brain tumor would return and within 6 months he lost his ability to speak, care for himself and eventually move. He was gone about 13 months after that day in the orchard. That is where my memory becomes better as I can remember the day he passed since his mom, my great grandmother died (20 minutes apart), the wake and burial and the weeks of me crying myself to sleep, sometimes with my mom joining me.

das7002,"The oldest I can really remember is when I went to the pound when I was 3. I remember vaguely that I asked multiple times for a dog and I guess my parents wanted one too.We went to so many different shelters looking at the dogs and I never saw one that I liked. We did eventually go to one where we found the perfect dog. I remember the dull red brick walls, the high fence gates for each kennel and all the dogs barking, except for one.The one dog on the end wasn't barking, he just lifted his head up and looked at me and put his head back down. It was almost as if he felt like he'd be ignored again. It was right then and there I knew that was the dog I wanted. I ran right to it and remember saying I wanted that dog. I had to have the one dog that wasn't barking. My parents did decide to go with that dog and after what felt like an eternity (hey everything feels like an eternity when you are 3) we got to take him home. He was so incredibly happy that he wasn't locked in a cage anymore. That big hairy fur ball never wanted to leave my side for the ten years we had him. He never wanted to leave my side and was always close by.He did hate socks though, he'd very carefully take his front teeth and pull your socks off very gently. He never did anything else with the socks though, he just didn't like anyone wearing them.I loved that dog more than anything in the world. ",null,0,cdnq0wf,1rinm0,AskReddit,top_day,1
SammichHQ,"I've told this tory before, but hell, it works here: 

My grandmother was sort of my idol. At 80, she still had her license, wasn't your typical ""old lady"" and was pretty damn tough. (Had lived through breast cancer twice, double mastectomy, and choosing divorce and single motherhood in an era when you didn't do that.) We were in the grocery store together when I was about 10, so that would have been mid 90's. There were three other people in line ahead of us, a very obvious gay couple couple of guys, and a big, tough, bodybuilder type, and then us. And the body builder guy is just spewing all the hatred he can. Gay guys are totally trying to ignore him, which is just firing him up more. Finally, my grandmother, a very tolerant woman, taps the body builder on the shoulder, and says, ""They aren't hurting you, Leave them be."" To which he answers, ""What they are doing is disgusting and they shouldn't be around normal people."" My grandmother stares him dead in the eye, deadpan expression, and says, ""Sir, I know you don't agree with me or them, but a good assfucking might lighten you up."" 

You could have heard a pin drop. The cashier froze, I froze, the bodybuilder froze, the gay guys froze. My grandmother just held eye contact. After about 10 seconds, he dropped his eyes, and everybody there realized they were seeing a sort of crushing of his soul. He quietly stepped out of line. My grandmother never said another word about it, except when we got to the car, she looked over at me and said, ""Being a grown up bully is a sad thing to be."" 

The guy could have squashed her like a fly. I was never able to look at her the same anymore. She was an even more mystical type of figure after that. ",null,1262,cdnwpbx,1rinhm,AskReddit,top_day,3368

gchrisdean,"I was in high school and behind my friends house there was some farmland. One day for whatever reason 4 of us decided to go out there and build a fort. It ended up turning out awesome, and we decided to spend the night in it. We filled up an empty water bottle with his parents vodka and built a fire out there. The owner of the property must've saw the fire and didn't appreciate us trespassing so he called the cops. Around midnight about 5 or 6 cops surrounded us. We were all underage, and we tried to convice the cops we weren't drinking. It worked, because we hadn't really started drinking much of the vodka yet and the cops didn't think to open our water bottle. So the cops tell us as long as we put out the fire and take down the fort we wouldn't get into any trouble.

My idiot friend says ""Okay officer we'll just go ahead and put out this fire and be on our wa-."" And dumps the bottle into the fire.

I was swinging left and right when they jumped me, and one of them pulled a knife. Cut my hand and took the ring, then they all ran away.

Fast forward a couple of years, this was my grandpa's ring. Shit was amazing, high quality gold, an inscription and everything. I wanted that ring back. I was putting fliers up for it, I had my buddies looking for it, and a couple of my employees knew about it too and they asked about it anytime they went anywhere. So, I finally hear about it through this guy that came in to my place of business, said he had it but he lost it in a bet. What a total asshole, right? So I ask him who has it. He only got a name and where the guy lives. So I sent my buddy out to the area, and he came back emptyhanded.

Fast forward another three years. I'm minding my own business, when all of a sudden, two midgets come in. One of them has my ring, I can see it dangling from his neck! So I sent my employees to go get him, but he tossed it into Mount Doom and escaped on a giant eagle, him and his fat friend.

They were loving and inseparable.  Best friends. Soul mates Id say. Ive never seen two people treat each other with that amount of respect.  

In 2001, my grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease. It was heartbreaking to watch. Near the end, he would carry around their wedding photo asking where his wife was, refusing it was her. She endured the heartache and took care of him until it became difficult. Due to the disease, he became violent and frustrated. He would get lost and lash out. Even when he went into hospice care, not speaking, she sat by him and was strong for us. For him. For herself.

In 2004, he passed away. During the funeral, we were all a wreck. I remember trying to fight through tears to see my grandmother as she walked up to the casket. She leaned down to kiss him, promising to see him soon. When they gave her the flag, smiled and looked as proud as could be.

rickyrhea,"My kid.  So he was born with some limb differences--missing bones, clubbed hands, 3 fingers instead of four because one finger had to be made into thumbs.  Was looking forward to having a boy who was into sports, but figured that just wasn't gonna happen.  Didn't think he could hold a baseball bat or throw a ball straight, etc.  Figured soccer or running, if anything, would be his thing.

When he was 2, he was really into hockey.  I figured, ""Eh!  He's 2!  It will pass!""  Nope!  Little shit learned to skate in diapers, but had a hard time holding the stick.  Wrote to a bunch of hockey glove manufacturers, and Reebok had just bought CCM (or the other way around), and they made him custom gloves.  They didn't work, but it was still really freaking cool they did that.  Kiddo got the FIRST pair of RBK gloves in the world.  

Anyway, so he turns 4 and wants to play t-ball and soccer, and gets older and tries lacrosse, all the while playing hockey.  I figure he'll give up because he won't be very good at those things, but he is.  He is actually decent at soccer, baseball, lacrosse, basketball, golf.....you name it!  Not a star, clearly, but good enough to contribute to the team.

So he turns 8, and his older buddy from the neighborhood is a hockey phenom.  Gets invited to be on all these AAA summer teams, so my kid wants to do that.  Well, he can contribute to the team, but he's nothing like this kid.  I let him try out for a new team in the area, but they don't get enough kids for his birth year.  He tries again next year, same deal.  They take a couple kids from his birth year and put them with the next older group, but not him.  So the third year he makes the team, and improves immensely, but this team isn't that great, being a new team and all.  So he decides he's going to play in the NHL, and to do that he has to play Div I hockey, and to do that, he wants to get a scholarship to a prep school near here, and to do that he needs to make a higher level AAA summer team.  Kid has it all planned out.  

So I tell him, ""Look.  Crazy talent like Crosby or Gretzky doesn't come along all that often, so teams still have to fill their rosters, but there's a lot of competition, and if you want to make it to that level, YOU have to put in the work to get there.""  This team he wants to make is ridiculous money, even in hockey terms, and I tell him if he wants to play summer hockey for fun, that's no problem, but if he wants to play on the expensive one, I am going to need to see him working hard.  No asking to skip practice, etc.  I'm willing to pay if he's willing to put in the work.  I said nothing else.  He's 11 at this time.  Wouldn't you know the little shit put in the work and made that team.  

So now he's 12, and he's got scouts coming to games and invitations to play in tournaments and special camps are coming in.  He's been schmoozing the nearest juniors coach, and one night he raced a bunch of the players on the team (ages 17-20), and kicked two of their asses (one of them being 6'5"" tall to my kiddo's 5'4"")!  Coach tracked me down and told me he was saving a spot for my kid on his team.  

He's gotten himself TV interviews, articles in the newspaper, and spots on teams by being charming, good looking, polite, and by being a hockey player who works hard and is coachable and puts the team's needs before his own, and sometimes over players who are a tad better skill-wise than he is.

Jaytinga,"I worked at an electronics retailer two years ago. One day, a middle aged farmer, and I mean farmer, complete with overalls, boots and straight-billed cap, came into the store looking for a cell phone. I immediately sold him the simplest, easiest phone we carried, going unto great detail on every feature, including the camera, sending text messages and every imaginable part of the phone's hardware and software. 

The next day, the same guy comes in and I immediately think that he's having phone trouble and resign myself to an hour of explanation. He asks for an external hard drive, because he wants to move his custom kernel of Linux to his new computer (I can't remember the exact details, I was totally floored by his request). He then spots my textbook on international political economy (my boss was very forgiving of me studying in slow times) and asks me fifteen minutes of in-depth questions on one of the main contemporary theorists in the field (Karl Polanyi), beyond even what myself and my classmates had asked (the class was graduate level).

We push up to the flag and are pinned by a vicious volley of vivid viscera. Naturally, I am scared shitless and hunker down.

EightMile,"TL;DR Kid seemed like a total douche, was actually SUPER cool and humble, and is now one of my best friends.

I know that Reddit isn't very fond of fraternities, but hear me out - I'm in a business fraternity. We have a very lucrative pledging process that teaches the pledges how to hone their professional skills, such as resume building, interview question answering, and delivering effective speeches.

There was a new pledge, ""Josh"". I was a member at the time, and I was convinced that he would quit very soon after. He looked like a huge stoner, had (has) a pretty dumb-sounding laugh, seems like an arrogant asshole, barely met the minimums our national chapter sets, and just all around didn't look like he would fit in or be able to complete his tasks as a part of our process. I grew to really disliking him in a very short amount of time, for no real reason at all.

It all happened in the course of a few days.

I went to lunch and saw a blind man walking through the parking lot of the restaurant. I then see Josh approach him, talk to him, and guide him into the restaurant.

*Yeah, whatever. One good deed doesn't make him a good person.*

I went to my classes in the afternoon, and then went to teach a short lesson to the pledges about giving a good speech and presentation. I gave some pointers; most of the pledges were ignoring me and texting. Josh was listening. Intently.

*He's just being nice because no one else is listening to me.*

Time for the pledges to give a small run-through of what they've learned and give a 90-second speech. Everyone's speech blew dad dick, and then Josh got up. He used every tip I offered, and we (myself and a few other members) came to the easy conclusion that Josh's was the best.

*Alright. Everyone wins sometimes.*

I'm leaving the room. Josh stops me, and asks if there is any way he can improve, because he feels like he can do better. I give him a few more pointers, and he writes them down in his notebook.

*Hm. That's pretty humble of him.*

I continue to exit the room after speaking with him. Josh catches me again. He tells me that he really liked how calm I was able to keep myself when speaking in front of others. Josh tells me that he has a huge presentation to give in his class tomorrow, and asks if I have time to ""coach"" him on it.

*I've got time. Hell, he's asking for my help; it's the least I could do.*

We practice his speech for about three hours, into the early hours of the night. We say our goodbyes and depart. The next day, I'm walking through the hallways and someone literally puts me off of my walking path via bear hug. Guess who? Josh has got tears in his eyes. He shows me his scoring sheet for his speech. 98%. He told me he's always been too nervous, and has never gotten above a 70% on any speech, ever. He didn't mention it the night before. He profusely thanks me, hugs me again, and practically skips away.

*...Fuck. I was... so wrong...*

dirtymoney,"probably a highway zapper. They were kits maybe in the very early 90s. And one company (The edge company) assembled and sold them. Otherwise you could buy the kits from another company and you would have to assemble it yourself. I bought mine from the edge company already assembled for $50 (it was a catalog order). The kits were discontinued by request (subtle threat) from some governmental regulatory agency. Funny note: The Edge company had bought the kits and never paid the maker for them (stiffed them)

Basically what the device did was set off radar detectors (the X band I think). 

Here is what one looks like... [see the first pictures in the search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=highway+zapper+edge+catalog&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS523US523&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IzuVUt6-EenS2wXonoCIBQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=727&amp;bih=458#q=highway%20zapper&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch)

Mine has a green LED instead of a red one that are seen in the pics. I didnt like the pushbutton switch and I changed it out to a small toggle switch.

Years ago I set up an automatic search on ebay for one and only was alerted to one being sold on ebay.  Just one in all those years.

I still have mine and it still works, but not many people use radar detectors like they used to and when they do... they usually ignore the x band because the xband is set off by other things like automatic sliding doors on the front of stores like walamrt.... and because practically no police agency uses xband any more. I think they use laser.

It WAS fun as hell when some jerkoff sped past me on the highway and I could see a red light on his dash as he passed. I'd follow him and use my zapper on him. He'd hit the brakes and I could sometimes see his radar detector light up. Then after a mile or so he would speed up again and I would hit him again with the zapper and he would slow down. I'd do it over and over. Sometimes I would keep it continuously on, he'd slow down and then I'd blow past him. Making him wonder why the police wasnt chasing and stopping me. Or when we would get to a red light I'd pull up next to him... get his attention... hold up my zapper and flip the switch and his radar detector would light up like a christmas tree. 

Good times... good times.

edit: the last time I used it was maybe 5 months ago. I was sitting behind a guy at the BK drive tru and he had his radar detector under his rear view mirror. I sat behind him and lit it up over and over. He eventually turned it off because it was making so much noise. Every once in a while I will still have a chance to use it on the highway, but rarely do I get a response (the person hitting the brakes).",null,0,cdnt7tm,1rimln,AskReddit,top_day,2

I82manycookies,My dad was a paramedic when I was a kid. One time he got a call for a lady who fell off her toilet and couldn't reach anyone for four days until her neighbor came to check on her. She was laying there covered in her own filth with nothing to eat when they found her. ,null,0,cdnm5ke,1rimgy,AskReddit,top_day,2
CMFW,"Paramedic here:

Walked into a house for ""Suicidal Party."" The lady hadn't harmed herself yet (thank god) and didn't seem to be in physical distress. Her walls were covered in writing of all different bibles. She had drawn Jesus being crucified, pentagrams, the UU chalice, everything. The cops pulled a steak knife out of her purse and questioned why she had it there. ""Never know when a delicious steak comes your way.""

Went to a nursing home for an older lady with vaginal pain. My female partner inspected her vagina and then told me I needed to see for myself (she was an EMT Basic and figured ALS might be required.) she was popping out of her vagina. She had an ulcer that ate through her intestines and uterus. Why she had her uterus still I don't know. 

Went to the jail once for a diabetic inmate. One the way up the security guard told us our guy was shot in the foot. We met the guy and he was not shot. Nobody was shot. His blood sugar read ""high"" which is at least 500+. The nurse couldn't land a 22G needle (infant size) in him and tried multiple times. I obtained a 16G (ropes for veins) easily. On the way to the squad he started throwing up and the guard jumped back and demanded to know where the infection was. Security guard didn't know what was up at all. 

Had a guy high on meth tackled by the cops start to spit blood at us. I gave home 5mg Valium, which would put me out (I'm 150 pounds/approx 80kg) and he was smaller than me. Didn't calm him down one bit. Still spitting blood. Gave another 5mg. Still nothing. Call hospital and ask if I can give more. They were pissed I already gave 10 because that really is too much, but the told me to be ready to intubate if he loses his ability to breathe and to give five more milligrams. I did so and it just made him calm, but didn't put him out. The gave him 10 more at the hospital. He's in jail now. 

I've pronounced two of my high school friends dead (I also volunteer at my local fire department in the town I grew up in) and I had to perform CPR on my partners baby (died of SIDS.) 

I walked into a house once for a lady having a hard time breathing. Walked in and the neighbor (who is a nurse) was doing compressions on her, holding her up at 45° angle so she could also receive an Albuterol treatment. I had her stop compressions and checked a pulse, she had one. We began to breathe for her and this nurse starts compressing again. I throw her off the patient and tell her to knock it off. I touch the patients eye lashes and they flick - a sign that the patient is still conscience. I deem the patient is faking. The cop on scene tells the family not to follow us through red lights and I tell them we aren't going lights and sirens. Then I tell the officer that the patient is faking. Our lady then wakes up and states she isn't faking and her neighbor revived her. That was fun. 

I've delivered two babies. First lady was having her 5th child and walked me through. Second lady was having her 2nd child and was very Asian. As her baby was coming out she shouted ""Ooooo I going to pee on yuuu."" 

I'm on mobile and my thumbs are tired. Hope you enjoyed those.

temporal_parts,"I was an Aussie girl living in Dahab Egypt as a dive instructor in my early 20's. To get to work every day I had to pass one of the locals who had taken a liking to me. He was quite aggressive in his advances to the point where he had started to talk about me becoming his wife and I knew I had to get out of town. I was staying in a little hotel by the beach run by the most wonderful man who agreed that I had to leave and got me on a bus very late at night to Cairo. 

When I went to the bus however the other man was waiting for me. He told me that he had stopped the bus and it would wait for me while we went for a drive. Even though I tried to protest he steered me by the neck to his 4v4 and we were soon driving, out past the bedouin village into the middle of nowhere. 

At this stage I was very scared and not able to hide it, asking him very nicely to take me back to the bus as it was going to leave without me. He tried to reassure me that it would not but was starting to get angry at me, becoming quite aggressive and swearing. When we were about 30 minutes away (the bus was supposed have left 20 minutes ago) he stopped the truck at the top of a large hill. By this stage I was half crying and terrified. He was extremely angry at this stage and told me to 'get out of the fucking truck' and I thought I could very well die here, or disappear and no one would ever know.

As I got out of the truck and moved to the edge of the hill I saw the lights of Dahab from a distance. This is what he had bought me to see before I left. After about 5 minutes in silence we left back for the bus which was indeed still waiting for me. 

I have always been a trusting traveller and am not proud of the way I reacted but it made me think of what 'could' have happened and taught me to be more cautious. Funny thing is, Egypt always felt safer at 2am in the morning than London ever did. ",null,0,cdnpyzm,1rimcy,AskReddit,top_day,7
Unpopped-Cherry,"I climbed a mountain in India alone. I saw a few houses near the top and thought to myself I should go up there and check it out. It took me about an hour to get there, a few steep slopes and huge rocks but it was all manageable by foot. When I got there, I saw 2 young guys in their 20s. They were happy to see me and invited me in for a cup of tea. (now I didn't mention that this mountain is surrounded by weed plantations, It was just growing everywhere) I got in the house and introduced myself, we had a chat...everything was okay, their english was abit rough compare to mine but we understood each other. 

And this is where it starts to get weird. A few older guys came in, they looked scary....redish eyes, covered in tribal tattoos (really badly done). The room I was in was just a bunch of clothes thrown to one side and a mattress, there was a brand new flat screen in there aswell (I have no idea how it got up there) we got talking, asked where I was from and what I do for a living. It was just small chat until one of the guys pulls out a bag of heroin from his underwear. ",null,0,cdnmh8v,1rimcy,AskReddit,top_day,5
SousukeS,"I was on a yacht, about two weeks ago. Going through the bay of Biscay, force 9 gale, 10 meter swells, middle of the night. Me and my watch were on at the time, 5 in total. For some reason, 3 were below deck, making food/ getting ready to go on deck/ making hot drinks.

In the interest of safety, when it's nighttime, everyone has to ""clip on""- which means attaching themselves by the centre of their lifejacket to a Jackstay, a bit of wire that runs from stern to bow. I'm just coming on deck, and there's one guy, lets call him Steve on the helm. Steve isn't so great at helming. He manages to get fucked by a wave, then the wave behind it. To correct this, he turns into the wave, putting the yacht nearly sideways.

Poor old me however is not clipped on, and with the sudden movement I lose my grip and fall OVER THE SIDE. By some magic I managed to get my arm caught in the guardrail, so only have my bottom half dragging through the sea, Steve hasn't noticed and I can't pull myself up. I can't shout man overboard loud enough to be heard, so cling for what felt like a lifetime to the guardrail.

asthmaticshroom,"I was about 13 when this happened, very thin, not very strong, female. I was skiing way, way out of bounds one day in the middle of January after about a 10 foot snowfall in the last two days. I'd been hiking for about an hour to get to the top of this ridge, and strapped on my skis to take my glorious, well-earned ride down. I had a digital camera with me that I was holding in one hand so that I could film my run, and shoved off. 

A ways down, my ski hit a branch and I start to lose it. I try to keep my balance, and glide a fair bit down the slope before I crash. I right myself, and realize that I only have one ski... I take off my remaining ski and stand it up in the snow, but I've sunk shoulder deep into the power. I'm feeling around, trying to find my other ski. I can't find it. I can't find it anywhere. I start trying to slog my way up this steep mountain, shoulder deep, trying desperate to find my ski. It's been about an hour now. I have no reception on my cell phone, I'm getting cold, I'm in the middle of nowhere, my dad is waiting for me somewhere far, far away. I start yelling for help. I feel like I'm literally drowning, I'm sure anyone who has ever been in deep snow or something similar can relate. You can't move or swim, plus I'm in seriously heavy gear that restricts my movement, and heavy boots that are dragging me down. It's been two hours now. Fuck my life. I am totally lost at what to do...and then it occurs to me. The camera!

Basically, I scroll through my film and find the moment when I lose my ski (a good 50 yards at least). I fight my way back up to that spot and start looking for it, pounding my hands down through the loose snow. I'm really starting to freak out now, because it's getting dark. Eventually I find it and make my way down, and everything was fine. But I seriously thought I was totally going to die.

miltonmille,"So a quick back story about this. When I was younger me and my friends used to hang around near the woods by our houses. In the woods there was a cabin, with a road leading up to it so cars could drive in. Anyways, we had heard that the guy that was living there was ""crazy"". Every town got a crazy old dude. So naturally we wanted to see for ourselves. We usually stod with our bikes behind a tree or a big rock pretty far away and just looked. 

So one day when we were there ""spying"", this car comes up behind up. we stood on the road this time. The car starts to accelerate towards us. This scared the shit out of me and my friends so we started to peddle as fast as we could. I turned to the right and got away but my friend almost got hit (like 2,3 feet away from the car). He ran his bike next to a stone so the car stopped. This scared us a lot but we still kept spying on him. So a few days later we're there again, this time behind a tree. We started throwing rocks at the cabin, which I now realise was a bad idea. Well the old came rushed out of his house carrying this big ass knife. The big kind you usually chop vegetables with. One of my friends screamed ""HE GOT A KNIFE"" and jumped on his bike. I thought for sure I was going to get stabbed. Being the nervous little kid I was I jumped on my bike and was shaking like crazy. Me and my friends cycled a good bit from the cabin. I almost fell a few times due to the shaking. A time later we threw our bikes over a fence, a good distance away from the cabin and biked hom in silence. We never spoke of it again.

We later heard the old guy had actually tried to kill som kid for ""spying"" on his cabin. The police took him and when they searched his house they found drugs which had made him go crazy. Thinking back at it I'm real happy I got away, it could have me who got stabbed.

SweetestScience,"I was hanging out with an older guy for a job interview who was a far more experienced kayaker than myself and we were planning on hitting the water the next day. I'm comfortable in class 1-3 rapids and this would be my first class 4. He had paddled the Grand Canyon (with a permit) and competed in the Green River Narrows (an insanely dangerous whitewater kayak race). I have no idea why but we spent the evening swapping stories about kayakers drowning - he had seen several people die. His wife tells me that she nearly died on the section we were planning on paddling. She flipped on a rapid and got sucked into a hole - a spiraling undercurrent of death that is impossible to escape. It was not until the moment she accepted death and let her body go limp that it miraculously spit her out and she lived to tell the tale. I barely sleep knowing I'm in way over my head but I very badly want them to think I'm brave and can handle this because I really want them to hire me. 

Fast forward to the next day and we are headed up to the rapid that almost killed his wife. Like a good guide he pulls me to the side of the river and tells me in detail how to shoot the rapid and then off we go. My heart is practically in my throat I'm so nervous - it's way bigger than I expected, really long, and starts with a 5 foot drop which I've never done before. You already know what happens next - I hit the rapid at a bad angle and flip on my bad side. I try for a few seconds to roll my kayak back up with no success so I bail. I think the seconds I spent trying to roll saved me and I floated over the hole but I didn't know that at the time. I'm wearing a helmet and life jacket but my boat and paddle are gone and I'm frantically bobbing down this huge rapid. All I can think is to keep my feet up and in from of me (under water rocks and branches can snag your legs and break them or trap you until you drown). ""I DON'T WANNA DIE"" is screaming on repeat in my head. To make matters worse it's March and the water is ice cold. 

It took several terrifying minutes to get to calmer water. The guy tried saving me earlier but the water was too rough so he got my boat and paddle. A pair of guys on a big raft finally pulled me out and gave me a lift to shore. I had some scrapes &amp; bruises and was freezing but was otherwise fine.

Prufrock451," In a century, most steel and concrete will have dissolved, books and plastics burned or mouldered or powdered. In 10,000 years, perhaps a weathered remnant of Mount Rushmore will retain the shape of human workmanship. One or two brass statues might remain, the Statue of Liberty resting silently on the ocean floor under a crust of oysters. There will be curious traces of radioactivity in the atmosphere. A few strip mines will retain steeply graded walls. The Pyramids will be a string of weathered and pitted lumps. 

In a million years, there'll be nothing left of us but fossils and a few stray molecular artifacts. Our lasting legacy will be the genetic bottlenecks future observers might discover, invasive species settling into equilibrium with the environments that arise in our absence. 

Even the transmissions we have been blasting into space will attenuate and dissolve. By the time our broadcasts reach Alpha Centauri, they have washed out into the background static of the universe.

As your doctor said, it's different for everyone. I've heard of people feeling ""off"" on their medication, disoriented as you said. I tried a few anti-depressants before I found this medication and they did nothing (good or bad).

So, be open to trying new things and try to give them a chance to work through your system.",null,0,cdnloka,1rikkp,AskReddit,top_day,2
banaltram,"I know this is going to be the most frustrating answer ever, but she's right, only you will know if they're working or not. It's almost impossible to tell you if it's working or not because everyone will experience the medication differently. I was on 200mg Zoloft for a long time, and it was alright, but one of my friends was on the same amount of Zoloft and had a terrible reaction to it making things worse instead of better.

I've been on half a million different meds - anti depressants, anti psychotics, anti anxiety, and various other meds to counter the side effects of what I was taking. I think I went through almost every anti depressant available before finding one that was tolerable. Generally you won't know if it's helping or not until you've been taking it for 6 weeks or more, they aren't instant like Ativan,  Zopicline, Xnax or other anti anxiety meds that work almost instantly.

I can't honestly answer the question of side effects. I was on so many things at so many times that I have no idea which side effects belonged to which medication and which ones were caused by the interactions of those medications.

Most importantly though, don't just stop taking them. Make sure you talk to the doctor and taper off (if necessary). I have taken myself of all of my meds at various points in time and it almost always made things much worse.

I feel like I'm probably missing something in your question so if I haven't answered something, feel free to ask.",null,0,cdnlvhg,1rikkp,AskReddit,top_day,2
SeafaringGentleman,"The first AD I tried just didn't do anything, even at the max dose. The second made me feel numb to everything, I was never happy but I never really felt down either; it was like I didn't exist. The third made me feel more normal, like I could recognise that my moods were more stable but the side effects were horrendous. With the fourth it took a while to settle in my system but once it did I just felt better. Side effects were minimal, I had my sex drive back, I was less anxious, sleeping better, able to concentrate.

I would say if the side effects are hard to deal with or just don't feel right taking that particular AD then don't be afraid to try a different one. It can take a while to get the right one so don't be put off.",null,0,cdnly23,1rikkp,AskReddit,top_day,3

A couple hours after we ate we were all in my back yard sitting around the fire pit in food comas talking and just enjoying each others company. Then my uncles friend excused herself to go use the restroom. She was gone for about 15 minutes and then she finally wandered back outside with a look of terror on her face. Embarrassed, she said the toilet wouldn't flush and asked if I could go and try to fix it because she didn't want to bother my parents who were busy cleaning up the kitchen. She assured me that she only went pee so she didn't know what could have caused the toilet to act up. The inch of shit covering the entire bathroom floor determined THAT was a lie...

Theungry,"I think it has to do with the fact that you have to make a choice to invest in one or the other, and that choice tends to be pretty personal based on what you value most (cost, associated brands, ease of use, first to market, performance etc).  That comes with a bit of a tendency toward excitement for your purchase and then you run across someone who made the opposite choice, and has just as much excitement.  You both feel like the other chose wrong by your assessment, and most people can't help explaining why they thought their choice was a no-brainer which causes a pointless argument about whose values are more valuable.

Over time you start to internalize the choice into your identity ""I'm an Android user"" or ""I'm an iOS user"" and you start having emotional reactions of loyalty or disgust to the very logos attached to the brand, and dismiss anything identified with the brand you rejected and support everything about the brand you chose because you're committed and to admit your brand is inferior in any way feels like an admission of gullibility on your part.

As soon as you are grouped with others (whether by choice or otherwise) you identify yourself with that group and you start thinking that your group is better than everyone else and you begin to develop ideas that bolster why your group is better.

Marketing plays on this and forces people to take sides. They realize that if they can get their customers to take sides, then the customers will form a bond with each other and the product.

BornToClaire-ify,"My uncle had just married into the family. My grandparents (his in-laws) are very strict, quiet people. Military household. 

We're all having dinner and one of the kids asks him to pass the ketchup. She starts to shake the bottle side to side and he says, ""No, that's not how you shake it. You do it like this...""

Then, thinking it was a screw-on cap, he grabbed the bottle by the bottom and swung it in a circle...

The cap popped open and we had a line of ketchup across the table, on the walls, and on the ceiling.

Bakgon,"My uncle joked about how my grandmother used to ride on velociraptors to catch her turkey dinner back in the old ages.  Well my grandmother was well into her handle of vodka and decided to teach my uncle by jabbing him in the hand with a fork, except instead of a light jab she full on stabbed this fork through his hand.  He screamed and stood out of his chair knocking over my brother who was bringing the turkey to the table.  Of course the turkey skyrocket into the air and landed on my little cousins lap.  Luckily for me I was in the far corner so I was able to watch this whole scene play out before my very eyes.  For some reason I remember it in slow motion, which is great.  As all of this was unfolding everyone was completely silent until the turkey came crashing down.  My little cousin started crying and that brought everything to life. The waterworks really started to show, relatives were screaming at each other, the little kids were crying and my uncle was just holding his wrist with his injured hand in front of his face silently gazing at it.  His eyes slowly moved up and looked into mine and for some reason we both burst into a hellish fit of laughter.  I practically fell over as I walked over to him to escort him to the car.  When we got back to the house from the hospital a few hours later (his hand was mostly fine, luckily no major nerves were damaged, the fork got him close to the meat of the thumb) everyone was just sitting in the living room silently.  They all looked up as we entered and there was an awkward lapse of words until my uncle whipped out the fork and said ""fork you mom!""  Laughs were had all around.  We joke about this every thanksgiving.

I work with a bunch of very stiff engineers. I'm a raging extrovert, and I'd like to think of myself as respectful, polite, and skilled listener.

This used to drive me NUTS but now I find it just makes everything ten times funnier.

So I'm out at this farewell lunch for my coworker and I noticed there's an Ipad at the table. As we're casually chatting (albeit, mostly awkwardly) about it, one of my coworkers says, ""yeah Kelpbites, go on Justin's facebook!"" 

I calmly decline and tell her ""we don't want to pull that thread."" When I was asked why, I replied, ""Because if we go on Justin's facebook then we'll go on my facebook, and then I'm fired.""

Xuis,"My pocket knife.  
I never knew how much I would appreciate carrying one until I made it a daily routine.

#For things I carry on my person, I consider three things:  

* How often do I use it?
* How easy is it to carry?
* How bad would it be if I didn't have it?

I use my pocket knife often, and it goes farther than just opening packages and breaking down boxes.  

#Things I've used my pocket knife for recently:

* Removing a tab of uncomfortable fabric from my new shoes.  
* Popping the metal shielding off of an old bearing.  
* Reaching for my credit card when it fell under a cabinet.  (Hand wouldn't fit underneath)    
* Cutting a bagel.  
* Picking under my nails.  
* Removing old tape off my workbench.

Even if I didn't use my knife so often, I would still carry it.  It's so unobtrusive to carry around, that I often forget that it's in my pocket or waistband.  

Finally, having a knife handy saved me from a possible bout of hypothermia while hiking once, and I wouldn't be surprised if it saves my life in the future.  Maybe I'll need to cut a jammed seat-belt to get out of a car, or break a window to get out of a building.  It's a tool that I would rather have and not need, rather than need and not have.

I'm surprised that more people don't carry a pocket knife.  It is my favorite versatile tool, and carries great value to me.",null,0,cdno6pu,1rih36,AskReddit,top_day,3

I dropped out after switching schools and my transcripts not accrediting for the previous year putting me a grade behind where I should have been on a technicality.

I got a GED instead, worked several jobs, I now went back to that same job, I got married, moved and have a great resume for a 23yr old. It's just a checkbox on a job app called GED/diploma. They never ask you which.

My advice though, stay in school and work hard. You won't ever regret building your work ethic or gaining the life skills/experience that school can teach you if you let it.

Now I am 23, I am doing better than most everyone I went to school with, without a mountain of debt. The years they spent in school, I spent starting my life and I would consider that I have a life comparable to people ten years my senior.  

That being said I would get paid better if I had a degree I am sure, but I feel it's okay to earn that money through experience. That is, after all, the point of education, gaining knowledge and experience in the field you want to make a life with. 

I would also note that if a company is willing to pay me to go to college I will go back to school but for an actual diploma, not a high school diploma.

Eepaman,"I'm only 15, and from Sweden. 
We're kinda late with internet trends and stuff, but thanks to fj, reddit and older brothers I was kinda early with them. 
Things that I did before friends did:

Use memes, and know what they are. 
I've hung on funnyjunk (no hate) for 3 or 4 years, but my friends all started with 9gag. 

Listen to the song thrift shop. 
I shared the song with my friends sep 2012 and they hated it. 
In jan 2013 they all loved it.
Same thing happened with gangnam style and Harlem shake, but with those it was just a couple of weeks or so. 

Have a cap/hat that's folded so it's smaller, and were it more on top of your head, instead of around (if that makes sense). 

I also fold up pants, wear second hand and find new stuff. 

Because of me listening to underground music, wearing different clothes than other people and discover Internet trends way faster than they do, my friends call me hipster...

Even though I might qualify as a hipster, I don't like the term as it's now mainstream to be hipster which doesn't make sense. 

tl;dr i discovered Internet trends, new clothes and music way before my friends and is therefor called hipster.

Edit: also got ( with the help of some friends) the whole school to start playing League Of Legends. 
I started playing it the second week of s2 I think.

adenzerda,"Basically, you're going to need to do two things very well: make people *want* what you're making, and earn their *confidence* that you have the skills and the drive to follow through.

 - Promote, promote, promote. Constant awareness is the biggest thing you can do to get people wanting your product. Find out your 'killer features', your big selling points, and just hammer on those as much as you can (and make sure they're *clear* and *relatable*). Get hype. Enthusiastically answer any and all questions. Spread that Kickstarter page link *everywhere*. You can't just plant an initial seed and then drop off the grid. People are lazy, and they usually need things brought to them.

 - See if any websites in your field will interview you for an article (e.g. if you're attempting to fund a videogame, contact Polygon, IGN, indie gaming sites, gaming blogs, whatever). No target is too out of reach; worst they can do is tell you 'no'. And if they do, ask yourself why they did so. Is your product not remarkable, innovative, or of high enough quality? Are your killer features not as fleshed out as they could be? Taking the videogame example, how did you make it seem fun to play? Did you provide great screenshots that show creative art direction and attention to detail?

 - Try an AMA in a relevant subreddit here when you start out. If there are multiple relevant subreddits, do multiple AMAs or promote the main AMA in the other subs. Then do another one a couple weeks later, near the end of your funding period (you've made progress since then, right?).

 - Have a roadmap of what you're going to be doing at least a half year out, longer if possible. If you've already been working on this project previously, give people a simple timeline of your accomplishments so far. The more history you have, the better.

 - Avoid falling into the trap of trying to get peoples' money via sentiment or sappy stories (e.g. 'my wife and I quit our jobs to make our dream possible'). It might be worth mentioning, but it's not a central selling point. However, *do* be personal. Who are you? Why do you want to make this happen? What about you specifically makes you exceptionally suited to see this through?

 - Be confident. Don't beg people for their money; instead, show them why you are worthy of their investment. People want to know that you know what you're doing. You need to be a rock that people can count on.

 - Get a good designer for your public-facing images and website. If you have a logo, does it look professional? If you have labeling, does it look like something you'd feel confident spending money on in a store?

And always remember, even if your pitch fails the first time around, assess where you fell short. Was it not enough communication? Needed more clarity when talking about your killer features? Didn't have a proof-of-concept? Whatever it was, work on it. Then you can try again a few months down the line.",null,0,cdnlg5u,1rifih,AskReddit,top_day,3

We went to the Wild Life Park, but the moose was hiding, and sadly we could not see/find him. So naturally we decided the logical thing to do was hop back in the car and head for Cape Breton...CB has lots of moose, surely we would see one there, and it's a beautiful drive and we had nothing better to do. Once again, we were disappointed and saw no moose. By that time it was kind of late, so we decided to just stay on the island for the night, so we let their dad and my mum know we were in CB and would return the next day.

The next morning we discussed our disappointment about not seeing a moose...which brought us to the logical conclusion that the only obvious thing to do was go to Newfoundland. Once again, the 3 of us hop in the car and head for the ferry...once again it had gotten late, and there was no way in hell we were going home that night, so we called home again to let people know that we would not be home that night as planned, but would probably be home the next day or the day after.

mromano90,"Wouldn't say this is the best road trip but certainly entertaining...

Me and my two buddies planned a trip to toronto from nyc via bus. I alerted my bank ahead of time knowing they would cancel my card if it was used out of country. First beer I try to purchase gets rejected. My bank mistakenly canceled my card for the weekend. I proceed to leech off my two friends for the following two days. Sunday morning comes and we miss the first of two busses out. The next one is not until 11pm. Check out of the hotel at noon and drink for the next ten hours in a local bar. 

The rest starts to get blurry...walk to the bus station late with a bottle of gin and tonic mixed. Attempt to ask passengers to rearrange their seating so my and my buddies can sit together. They weren't having it. I remember sharing my drink with a stranger and eventually pass out. Next thing I know the bus is pulled over on the side of the highway and two cops are walking to the back of the bus to drag us off. Apparently we were causing a commotion. Cops dropped us off at the boarder instead of taking us to jail and basically told us good luck. After arguing with boarder patrol we decide to walk over the Rainbow Bridge into the US. Broke and without the use of my credit card where else would we go but the Casino. Mind you we're 19 years old. I give my fake ID to an attendee outside a room with card tables who immediately knows what's up. 20 minutes later two detectives show up at the casino telling me I'm under arrest. They went through security cameras to see if I was gambling in the casino. Luckily I didn't have access to money and wasn't able to gamble. Cops eventually let us off the hook after hearing how terrible our night has been. 

Eventually some friends from SUNY Geneseo (80 miles away) came and picked us up and drove us back to their apartment. Few hours later they drove us to Rochester which was the next stop back to NYC from Toronto.

I guess it wasn't that crazy; everything just happened so quickly. Waking up the next morning in NYC and realizing we had been in South Carolina a day earlier was pretty hard to wrap our heads around.

masterjedirobyn,"I lived in a small town with several hiking trails, and one such trail was perfect for walking dogs. Most of the hikers have dogs with them, and there is kind of an understanding between everyone that dogs can be off the leash if they behave reasonably and are friendly. Granted, I'm sure they're technically supposed to be on the leash by some obscure state law, but this is a small town where everyone knows everyone else's dogs, and when two dogs run up to meet each other on the trail, it's usually just a little tail wagging and butt-sniffing, and a short 'hello, enjoy your hike' between the humans. 

I had just gotten a new puppy, a small cuddly golden retriever named Sunny who wouldn't hurt a fly (This is him: http://i.imgur.com/6skvmjT.jpg ). I was walking on this trail with him off the leash and he plodded up to a lady walking. He wasn't sprinting, just sort of ambled up, wagging his tail the entire time. I called out 'don't worry, he's very friendly' and this lady yelled 'get away from me!' and kicked Sunny with full force. He flew several feet away, crying and whimpering. He couldn't walk for a few moments and I thought for for a second he might be dead. This was the scariest moment of my life- he wasn't ok and needed vet care, but I was also more angry than I have ever been. I have never wanted to simply erase someone from the face of the earth that much. What kind of human being has it in them to kick a puppy who is obviously non-threatening? And to top it all off, she started yelling at me as I was tending to Sunny by saying 'About time these dog owners get taught a lesson.

I first saw them in 1988 and it was great.

I saw them again on their ""Pump"" tour in 1992 and that was the end for me.  They were filming footage for videos, namely ""The Other Side"".  As a result they lip synced several songs during the concert.  It's pretty easy to tell when every note matches the album and the song fades out at the end.

I don't pay to see bands lip sync.  So I never again bought another album from them or went to another concert of theirs.",null,0,cdnk5ff,1rieh2,AskReddit,top_day,2

Septaphobe7,"To answer this question first we must define what we mean by ""The Worst Kept Secret"". 

For something to be secret, it must be known by at least one person, and not known by at least one person. That's the first hurdle a fact has to pass before it can be a secret.

A secret must also be actively hidden. No one knows I had two cups of coffee today, but I'm not hiding that fact. Quite the contrary, I'm posting it on Reddit. Even though there are people who will not find out, the fact that I am publicly posting this means that I am not keeping it a secret. It might be a secret if I was only publicly posting it because I knew the one person who can't know I drank two cups of coffee doesn't read Reddit, but there is no such person, so not a secret. For it to be a secret, I would have to expend at least a small amount of effort to keep the information hidden. If Billy Bob of 123 Fake St doesn't know that 4 out of 5 doctors recommend chewing Orbit, that doesn't make it a secret, because no one is actively keeping him from finding out. So a secret must be actively hidden.

The fact also must be interesting. Nobody but me knows that I had two cups of coffee today, but nobody cares. Nobody would bother to commit the fact to memory if they did know, and therefore I would have no interest in keeping the fact a secret. So a secret must be interesting. 

Now we've determined that for a fact to be a secret, it must be known and unknown each by at least one person, it must be interesting, and it must be actively hidden. So the best kept secret would be the one which was the most covered up, and known to only one person, which was interesting. On the contrary, the worst kept secret, would be that which was the least covered up (while still an attempt was made to cover it up), known to all but one person, and was still quite interesting. By this criteria, it would be the fact that your mother is a slut. Sorry you had to find out about it this way, but it's not worth the minimal effort to keep the information from you anymore. And yes, everyone but you knows.",null,12,cdnkj7t,1rie19,AskReddit,top_day,35

Also the one leading up to that [where he's fine entrusting his car to a teenager because, more importantly, **he's intrusting his kids to the same teenager**](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/dont-you-hate-it-when-you-get-your-blades-of-chaos-tangled-in-an-adamantium-ribcage)

[He understands behavior modification without extreme or even substantial punishment, just minor negative reinforcement.](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/win-and-fail-are-also-prohibited).  The Epic Jar is later used to buy the kid an X-Box as well, allowing for positive reinforcement due to the kid's growth.

[He is encouraging without being belittling of strange or unusual preferences.](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/thats-a-couple-days-of-not-shaving-for-ya)  And [nonstandard people, for that matter](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/every-rose-has-its-thorn).

He allows for his kid's creativity [to shake the norms by creating something he knows is probably unhealthy, but is willing to try it just to see how it works out](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/cant-knock-it-until-you-try).

[He respects things that can be taken at a glance to be unmanly or effeminate, even before fully understanding the reason behind them.](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/im-not-sure-cyborgs-are-supposed-to-be-drinking-beer)  There's no insults, belittling, simply a statement of fact that he observes.

And lastly, [he is unwilling to destroy something bizarre and interesting](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/give-me-the-fattest-headed-pigeon) simply because it is weird and nonstandard.

Dude's a walking macho stereotype, yet completely accepting and understanding of people who aren't.  And he never loses his temper with his kids or his intern because he understands they are inexperienced and simply don't know better in many cases.

Maybe it depends on what kind of college student you are. Are you focused and able to buckle down? Then you'll be able to get some job and get out of the folk's house. Are you a slacker who is too lazy to find and hold a job? Then your life is gonna suck but you""ll always have the option to bring yourself out of it, if you have a supportive family who put you through college. Which I assume by default if you're a slacker. Either way, if you are already above the poverty line then it's only gonna suck if you decide it sucks.

If you have a group of other young professionals to hang out with I think it can be as enjoyable as college, so long as you sufficient time off to do fun stuff.

Based off of Ubisoft's popular series ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon,"" it is an online FPS that is cover-based.

This has to be the best free-to-play FPS in terms of tactics, fairly balanced with the exception of a few guns, and the most important thing, graphics.

Unfortunately, the game has become somewhat pay-to-win, with paying for a category called ""consumables"" in game results in a complete buff over other players (such as grenades which you have to purchase, inserts to make your armor better, and stronger ammo).

Well when my dream self knew that I was in a dream I was at a deli counter buying ham or something. Realised I might be in a dream so I pinched myself, nothing. Looked at a clock on the wall, looked away for a moment and looked back, time was out, I was in a dream, awesome! What did I do, no I didnt get to go fly with dragons or leapfrog buildings, I got my dream friend beside me to speak Polish to the deli lady. Seemed like legit Polish although I have no idea. Then I woke up and never lucid dreamed again.

blik36,"TL;DR: I thought my girlfriend had crashed and ended up in the hospital.

I've had a couple. The worst was one where I dreamt I had woken up and sent a good morning text to my girlfriend. This is something I do everyday through whatsapp, but the response I received that time was different from the other ones. This time I received a text from her mom telling me that my girlfriend had been in a wreck on her way to work and was in the hospital. I asked her which but there was no reply. When I woke up, I was depressed beyond belief. I stayed home and looked through my texts and didn't see the one from her mom, but i still didn't feel like it was a dream it felt too real. I couldn't call her phone because we live on a border town (she's in Mexico and I'm in the U.S.). It wasn't until 3pm that she came over to my house and told me she lost her phone. It was 7 hours of thinking she was in the hospital with no answer from anyone as to where she was. I felt like the world had been lifted from my shoulders when I saw her.",null,0,cdnk2ha,1rid3h,AskReddit,top_day,1

ChevronCat,"I had a dream that I was asleep in my bed and that I was dreaming I was getting ready for the day. Then I woke up in my dream from that dream and realized I wasn't actually out of bed. Then I woke up from my actual dream and realized that I could carry out my dream in reality now. Easiest dream come true ever as I promptly got up and got ready for the day. 

Another dream I had was a bit more iffy. I believe it's called sleep paralysis (does that still count? my eyes are open, but my mind is still dreaming) I opened my eyes, but I couldn't move. I heard my housemate calling me to get up. I felt a slight pressure, similar to a cat kneading the bed, near my neck. A strange warmth formed near my neck, and I started to freak out. I couldn't scream or move. I heard a whisper close to my ear, telling me I have to get up. That seemed pretty damn real to me. When I was finally able to move, I was too scared to even get off the bed.",null,0,cdnqypx,1rid3h,AskReddit,top_day,1

GUTTERbOY001,"I have prepared a handy [visual aid](http://i.imgur.com/gx3Tzq8.jpg) to help everyone understand this story. That picture is a rough floor plan of the bottom floor of my high school girlfriend's house. Now, said girlfriend lived only with her mother, whereas I lived with both my parents, so statistically it made a lot more sense to go to her house when it was time to get it on.

Generally speaking, said sexytime would take place upstairs in her bedroom, but on this particular occasion, we didn't make it upstairs and were just going to town on the living room floor. Despite my significant distraction, I had no trouble hearing the very disturbing sound of a key entering the front door lock and turning. Oh shit, her mom is home way early!

At this point, an amazing thing happened. As best I can determine, my SO somehow teleported directly off of my penis and upstairs to her bedroom. I'm serious; I have no recollection of her running out of the room, it was just like once second she was riding me and the next I was lying naked and alone on the living room floor, watching the front door begin to open.

And the worst part was the due to the location of the stairs, I had no hope of a quick escape. I'd have to run directly towards the invading mother to reach the stairs, and I'd surely be seen. And not being seen was at the top of my priority list at the moment; for some reason, I thought that if I could just get upstairs, somehow we could find a way out of this mess, despite the living room floor being covered with discarded garments.

So with my primary path of escape cut off, I had to rapidly improvise. I decided that my only hope of escape was to go through the kitchen, around the front room, and then up the stairs. That would put me behind her mom and hopefully I could escape upstairs. It was a long shot to be sure, but it was all I had. Time to get to it.

As I began to sprint out of the living room, I snagged a pair of jeans off the floor, hoping they were mine. On my way through the kitchen, I tried to pull them on. I was just comprehending that they were not my jeans when I came face-to-face with her mom. She had gone through the front room to the kitchen instead of down the hall, and my master plan has in fact resulted in this awkward standoff, her with a bag of groceries and a shocked expression, and me with a pair of her daughter's jeans halfway up my legs and my junk still wagging merrily at half-mast.

EggAtix,"Freshman year of college I was living with an extremely russian roomate. I'm talking straight out of Vladivostok Russia (thats the bit above Korea). He had, as one might expect, a whole bunch of holes in his cultural makeup. One of the holes was the subtle, universal sign of leaving a sock or a rubber band on the door handle to warn when intercourse is being performed in the room.

Well it was my birthday, and my girlfriend was giving me the best of gifts: birthday sex. I was, at this point, bare-assed on top of her, interfacing my genetalia with her breasts in what the kids have taken to calling ""titty fucking"". It was amazing. I was enjoying myself immensely, taking my time. I'm getting pretty close to finishing when I hear a clicking sound from behind me. The door is to my back, but I look up in time to see the reflection of my roommate in the doorframe. He's looking wide-eyed at my sweaty, bare ass like a deer caught in the highbeams. We make eye contact in the window's reflection, and at that moment a few things happened in quick succession:

* Vlad exclaimed, as one would expect ""Oh Jesus. Oh my god.""

* The adrenaline surge from the shock hits me and tips me over the edge, causing me to ejaculate while making unblinking, shocked eye contact with Vlad

* The surprise causes my girlfriend to instinctively try to sit up, moving her face into the path of my cum, and catching most of it with her nostrils, causing her to being choking violently.

None of us ever talked about it again. I left him one of my birthday cupcakes as a peace offering, and I try not to think about it very often.

I wake up to the soft 'uhn, uhn, uhn' of his girlfriend. The party had stopped, and the rest of the house was quiet. I didn't move in fear of making the situation worse. I wanted to leave so badly, yet I was frozen by social normality paranoia. 

They finish their dubious act, and I'm hoping that they just go to sleep so I can quietly slink away, and never mention this again. Ever. Nope. Pillow talk. OH GOD THE PILLOW TALK. Is this how fucking goofy I sound after sex? Fuck.  I'm screaming internally. Then this happens.

""Am I a good lover, babe?"" I. Fucking. Lost it. Both of them sit upright as I bust up laughing.

My boyfriend and I were very innocent and virginal when we began dating, and therefore, we were both pretty stupid about some things. He shares a room with his sister, and one night I ended up crashing at his place for some reason. His sister was asleep, and according to our horniness-impaired logic, if we were just really quiet while we hooked up, she wouldn't wake up. I gave him a handjob and he fingered me (we didn't feel comfortable having sex yet since we were both virgins), and we whispered the entire time and tried to minimize our movements, but apparently, that was not enough. The next morning, his sister could barely look us in the eye. Turns out she had heard everything—all the dirty things I had whispered to him about how much I wanted his cock, and how wet I was, and so on and so forth. All three of us wanted to fall through the floor and die. We never did that again, and I still feel horrible about it, nearly three years later.

We're out on the futon, and we start getting into it before my roommate gets home. She wants me to tie her up, so I do, on the futon, in the living room. The futon is against the same wall as the front door, and there is a chair in between the door and the futon.

As I'm getting ready to insert, I hear the door unlock. ""DOUG NOOOOO!!"" My girlfriend and I scream at the door, while I simultaneously kick the chair in front if the door, so he can't open it. ""WHAT THE FUCK, MAN!? LET ME IN!!"" He yelled back. ""JUST WAIT A GODDAM MINUTE!"". 

I try to untie my girl, but the knots were too tight. So instead, I throw some pants on, run back to my room, grab my comforter from my bed, throw it over the girl, and tell Doug to come in, and go straight back to his room for a minute or two while I try to untie her.

Mom was at work me my gf and brother were at the house. He was suppose to do lookout in case mom comes home during sexytime. He decides to get in the shower.

A while later he comes in the room (we had just finished) saying moms home. I leave to walk gf back to work, when I get back I go ut on the back porch where mom is reading the paper. Proceed to make small talk like nothing happened when she folds the paper down looks me directly in the eye and says (dont you ever let me see that.... cocksucking whore in my house again). I was speechless first mom doesn't cuss and second I realized while my brother was In the shower mom walks in the kitchen (bedroom door is right off of the kitchen) to see the youngest of her natural kids recieving an great blowjob.

That was the day mom found out I was sexually active.

2 and 3 are basically the same find a not so well known (widely known by the cops) spot for sexytime in the car. Cop walks up and after getting a good eyefull of hot young teen girls ass and tits. Knocks on window, checks I.Ds, confirms she is willing then goes down the the hill to let us finish. (Cool cop) 

With the second cop busting us she gets arrested for a bench warrant leaving me to drive home and finish alone (semi cool cop).

My gf and I got to his house a bit earlier than anticipated and he is 30-40 minutes late 99% of the time anyways. She decided a blow-J was in order while we wait. Sure enough, he gets back early and walks up to the car and knocks on my window just as the deed was coming to a close (tinted windows prevented him from being aware of the activity's fullest extent). She panicked when he knocked. I blew my load on a majority of the exposed surfaces. He saw her silhouette pop up and lost his shit laughing hysterically. Pretty sure his neighborhood became well aware of the situation. She got out of the car and shook his hand while I waited for my pocket rocket to disarm.

dr481,"It was a dark and foggy night. Denise was having trouble staying awake and the road was slick. Her anxiety level was not helped by the fact that she was running low on gas and didn't know where the next town was. Finally, just as she thought she would have to pull over and sleep till morning on the side of the road, a tiny gas station appeared — very rundown, but a gas station nonetheless. She pulled in. The attendant made his way around the car and seemed to be very distracted as she asked him to fill it up, and even seemed to be making faces at her. He finally agreed to get the gas, but then asked her to pop the hood of the car because it ""smelled like trouble."" Her anxiety from being on the road was starting to flare up again, she was all alone in a creepy gas station out in the middle of nowhere and an attendant was finding reasons to keep her there. He asked her to come look at the engine, he had to ""show her something"". Not knowing what else to do, almost as if in a daze, she did as he asked, all the while wondering why she didn't scream. As she rounded the front of the car he grabbed her arm and said, ""This car needs a tow, you'll have to come with me into the office."" Then he put his hand over her mouth and forced her into the office. She began to bite his hand once they were inside and he let her go and said, ""I'm sorry, but there is a man crouched down in the backseat of your car and I didn't want him to know that I'd seen him."" 

They called the police who came to arrest the serial killer who, unbeknownst to Denise, had stowed away in her car and was waiting for the opportune moment to add her to his list of victims.

He got blamed for Columbine for no reason other than that the kids wore black.  Wearing black in those days (and even today) meant you'd get slapped with the Goth label, and the media found the ""scariest"" one to point the finger at.  

[This article](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624) he wrote for Rolling Stone is worth the read if you are interested in what he had to say about the situation.

In addition to the Columbine drama, his imagery has drawn a lot of hate from Christians and paranoid parents.  When the zealots get going, they come up with a lot of crazy shit.  I've heard so many rumors about him, none of them true.

- He didn't get ribs removed so he could suck his own dick.

- He didn't shoot heroin into his pupil and have the iris go blue, it was a contact lens. 

- He doesn't buy Mexican orphans, throw them into the crowd, and refuse to play until their dismembered bodies are thrown back on stage.   

He's just a guy, a very intelligent guy actually, who happens to express himself creatively with decidedly dark imagery.  I don't want to be one of those people who says ""Ugh, No one understands him!!! He's so deep!""  But really, many people just never gave him a chance because of the aura of negativity that surrounded him for much of his career.

Then I decide to continue Redditing, this time on my laptop. The laptop is on my desk, and *just* out of my reach when I'm leaning off of the bed, which means I have to get out of bed, pick up the laptop, and then get back into bed and try to find the part of the bed that isn't cold.

I'm not very happy at this point.

Now that I have my laptop, I try to boot into Windows. Guess what shows up on my screen?

Guess how many of [these](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/error-apport.jpg) I get? 11, that's how many. Steam won't open, and neither will Chrome.

Bad thoughts are going through my head now.

At this point, I decide to pick up my tablet and play *something* to get my mind off of the horrible state of my other devices. The tablet was also out of reach from my bed, so I have to get out of bed *again*, pick up the device, and then get back into bed once more. Right before I get back into bed, I realize that I should pick up the charger for my tablet, so that I don't end up running out of battery life and breaking things. As I turn back towards my desk, feeling moderately clever for remembering the charger, I stumble, and then I end up slamming my right foot into my [*heavy wooden chair.](http://commercialsupplydistributors.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Heavy-Duty-Wooden-Chair.gif)

grownupbraces,"I just told this in another thread but I suppose it will fit here as well:


I used to have a recurring nightmare when I was little that there were a bunch of police and ambulance at the end of my street because there was a psycho killer on the loose, and he had attacked people at the end of my street. Every time I had this dream, he would be closer and closer to my house. The last time I had it I was around 13ish and I ""woke"" (but was still asleep) to see a crazy man in a scary clown mask standing over my bed, and he darted into my little sister's room. Then I heard her scream and jolted awake, to find she actually WAS screaming in real life. I ran into her room and she was wide awake sobbing in bed saying she had a nightmare that a man in a scary clown mask came in her room and started stabbing her.

I never had the dream again after that. 20 years later and it still freaks me out to think about.


**edit:** I am seeing some consistencies in the comments questioning the validity of my story. I swear to you this is 100% true. While I obviously cannot prove a dream, I will try to clear a few things up. 

 - My sister was about three at the time, and still in a toddler bed. I did not ask her about the dream because she was so scared; my only desire at that point was to calm her down. We lived in a split level house so our rooms were upstairs while mom's room was downstairs.

 - Up until this last time I had the dream, I had never seen the creepy clown-mask guy. All previous dreams were just about how there was a psycho killer on the loose and he was getting progressively closer to my house with every dream. So while it is possible she heard me telling our mom about *those* dreams, there is no way that she could have heard me telling mom about the clown guy, because I only saw him that one time, in the last dream.

 - My sister and I have about a decade between us in age, so we were never really *that* close growing up.  We were sisters and loved each other, but we didn't act like best friends. Now that we are older, we are pretty close and we are able to ""communicate"" with each other just through subtle facial expressions. It comes in handy when we are making fun of someone in the room.

 - As far as I know she did not continue having the dreams after they stopped for me. I asked her a few years ago about that night and she had no memory of it. ",null,3719,cdnmtpl,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,6413
TheMediaSays,"I was really, really young (like, five or six) so my recall is a bit fuzzy. But I was on vacation with my parents in Massachusetts (we were living in upstate New York at the time) and we wound up going to some sort of street fair. I remember eating a candy apple, pestering my dad about getting some sort of stuffed animal, and stopping by a friend of my parent's apartment for a bit. That's not the creepy part. 

When we left to go back to where we were staying, we got on some sort of bus (I'm pretty sure -- regardless, it was some kind of public transportation). I had a window seat and was looking outside when I saw, walking past, a kid who looked *just like me* down to the haircut and everything. I lowered the window a little bit (just a crack) and shouted ""HEY!"" 

The kid stopped and looked up at me and immediately got this shocked and surprised look on his face, confirming to me that he, too, saw the uncanny resemblance. At that moment, though, the bus pulled away and I never saw him again.

I had a few good friends that lived right down the street from me. We lived out in the country. My address was literally 169^1/2 ______ Road. Middle of nowhere. So we'd hang out at my buddies place, or we'd go up this hill for about half a mile until we reached the burn pile and cabin at the top.

It really was a basic cabin. Outhouse. No lights. Nothing. We'd hang out there, use it as a fort for Nerf battles, manhunt, CTF, etc. Well one night my friend invited a few of his friends/cousins up to the cabin so we could roast marshmallows and play manhunt.

Around 11 pm we were in the middle of a game and two of my friends had hung back with me because we were the fast ones. We realized that there were only three of us left on our team and that we hadn't captured anyone from their team. We tried to make a jailbreak and lost my friend (We'll call him F). It was just myself and another friend that we'll call ""L."" 

L and I were ~100 yards from the other team and they had 3 of our 5 players now in their ""jail."" They began to press our side more and mess with us until one of them told us we were cheating. L and I looked at each other unable to figure out why. Our side had about 1/4 of it covered heavily in trees. The other side was about the same, with both wooded areas near the back of the sides.

At one point when we were chasing someone off our side I saw L and I running in the same direction and someone on the other side of L. I quickly cut behind L and intended to surprise the other person and nab them on our side (I was probably the fastest person there and I didn't want to be on the team to capture nobody). Once I emerged from behind L's trajectory (we were both running) I saw absolutely no one. Nothing, no trees, no scarecrow, absolutely nothing that I could have mistaken for a person.

I surmised that there had to be someone from the other team hiding behind our lines waiting for us to cross over and then tag us there. Well, the game ended up dwindling down to us with two left and the other side with 4. We capped one person and then all parties were exhausted. I asked the other team (mostly L's cousins) who was behind the line waiting to cap us? No one claimed responsibility. I figured it was someone trying to mess with us.

Back at the cabin we start cooking hot dogs and marshmallows over a fire. We were all 10-13ish with one person being maybe 15 (older cousin), so we we're drinking soda and not beer. Note: If this had been beer and I'd been older, I'd just chalk this up to booze. All 10 of us are around the fire when we saw someone coming up the hill. It's hard to see outside in teh dark when you've been staring at a fire for a while, but at least 4 of us had seen the person so we figured it was one of the people who left coming back, or someone new. 

After about half an hour no one came up. We went and looked and found no one. Being the intelligent young kids we were we decided to investigate further. It's summer, after 12 am, and we're out playing with fire and flashlights looking for a mystery person. Yeah, we were not honor students. We went to the path that led down the hill and could clearly see my friends house in the distance (they left the outside lights on for the dogs), and no one in between. 

Someone was trying to mess with the group so they ran into the woods and came out directly on top of us scaring the crap out of everyone. After we all changed our pants and regrouped we headed back to the cabin only to see someone on the very far side of the clearing. There were three of us with flashlights, and all of us attempted to illuminate this person, but we were too far away to get a good look; as soon as we lit him/her up he/she disappeared into the woods.

OK then, now a few of us are freaking out. Six people decide to go down to my friends house to spend the rest of the night where ""the ax murderer from hell"" won't be able to get them. Since they have 6 and the 4 of us who decided to ""rough it"" are only 4 the group of 6 got two flashlights. I was the only one left with one.

We decided to figure out who this was. L had an uncle who was only 10 years older than him who we figured was just fucking with us. We knew his place was less than a mile from where we were (big extended family, large family plot of land). L, F,one of L's cousins (gonna call him ""C""), and myself began to walk across the clearing. Once we were about 40 feet from the edge of the woods we could hear someone moving around in the brush. Not stomping or anything, but very carefully moving through the fallen sticks and underbrush trying to make as little noise as possible. We figured it was L's uncle, we'll refer to him as ""Uncle J.""

So we split up again and two people waited in the clearing (F and L's cousin) and myself and L went into the woods to try to flush out Uncle J. We figured F and C could see OK from the clearing, and to be honest they actually could. L and I eventually were about 50 feet INTO the woods (further than we thought we'd need to go) when we heard this low rumble noise. This is one of those times when I regretted trying to act macho. L and I kinda looked at each other to make sure it was neither of us ""rumbling,"" and basically just stopped dead in our tracks.

I shined the flashlight up in the direction of the noise (directly away from the clearing and the fire) and couldn't see anything. There was just nothing there. It was, to this day, one of the most eerie noises I've ever heard. Like a noise a Halloween decoration would have made, but real. We stayed about 50 feet into the woods, never venturing much further in, and searched the general area. Never found anything.

After about half an hour of this (it's now past 2 am) we heard a noise just at the edge of the clearing and both of us turned around. I had expected it to be F and C coming to figure out what the fuck was taking us so long. But instead, I see one person basically hiding halfway behind a tree looking at us. I've never not wanted to shine my flashlight on something before that moment. If it was dark, I wanted to see what it was. But in the distance, well past the shadowy character, I could see F and C milling about by the fire. I had this awful feeling that there was no way Uncle J was being this creepy. I didn't want to see who it was, and I really just wanted to get away from this person. I mean the hair on the back of my neck stood straight up.

L must have seen it too because he started slowly backing FURTHER into the woods. We moved in as wide a circle as we could around this shadowy person and managed to make it back to the clearing. We got back to the cabin and grabbed F and C and began to make our way back to L's place. When we were about 100 yards from the cabin we heard it's door slam and we fucking bolted.

When we made it back to L's house near the bottom of the hill, we debated what to do; should we call 911? Was that a trespasser? Or was that simply a family member messing with us. L went to notify his parents who we figured would be overjoyed at the premise of being woken up around 3 am by a bunch of sweaty terrified 11 year olds. 

They weren't home. Apparently L's grandfather had a heart attack around 10 pm. None of us had cell phones as it was 1998, and so no one had been notified except for L's 19 year old step cousin (I never really figured out this relationship TBH) who had drank himself near blackout drunk as soon as the adults left him in charge of all the younger kids up at the cabin. Seriously, he got reamed the next day by basically every adult in attendance. That meant that uncle J, and basically every other of L's family members who could have been messing with us were at the local hospital with the patriarch of the family who'd had a mild coronary.

At 4:00 am we knew sleep wasn't an option and began to watch and wait for the shadow guy to show up at the bottom of the hill. Less than 10 minutes later I hear a sound coming from upstairs...only problem is...there's no upstairs to L's house. There's something (someone?) on the roof. L grabs his pellet gun (cause that's going to be super effective) and we go outside (cause, you know, we're smart and stuff).

We shine ever flashlight straight up at the roof and see a completely black silhouette jump off the far side of the house in a mad sprint. The way L's roof was shaped the part he (it?) jumped off of was over 25' high; there was a huge vaulted ceiling in the back room of the house and the roof was even taller to accommodate for the attic. We watched it run away from the hill and towards the creek (10' wide maybe 2' deep) and we followed it until we realized how much faster it was than us.

Once it reached the edge of the creek, it stopped and looked back at us. This rumble thing came back and it jumped the creek, and we lost it.

The next day we told L's parents and they informed us that the cabin was being torn down. A cow had been killed and dismembered IN THE FUCKING CABIN early that morning, presumably after we left. It could have been a panther (cows weren't uncommon on that part of the property, but they tended to avoid the people), it could have been a bear, but fuck, we never went back up that hill at night. No way, no how. Never saw that thing again. Might not seem like much, but to 11 year old me...I had a new face for fear.",null,719,cdnnila,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,2380
Cats_in_Outer_Space,"I was 13 at the time and trying to go to sleep at a reasonable hour as it was a school night and trying to get my full 8 hours, and it was what all the cool kids were doing. However, as the night drug on it was impossible for me to relax; I felt so anxious and I was wide awake for hours. My room was very dark, but I resolved that if I closed my eyes and turned on my side maybe I could calm down. 


The instant I shut my eyes I felt someone touching my arm, brushing my hair, and stroking the side of my face. It was the most real thing I had ever felt, I could feel the soft, warm pads of someone's fingertips moving across my arm, I could hear my hair rustling and moving as I felt my hair being stroked. I was terrified--I couldn't bring myself to move, more than my legs to confirm no, this was not sleep paralysis.  Despite everything potentially awful about this situation I lost the sense of fear I had originally, and more than anything else it was comforting. I think this mysterious but very real sensation of someone stroking my face went on for more than half an hour until I built up the courage to turn around and look for the source of this strange happenstance. I really, truly expected to look around and not see anything but instead my eyes focused immediately on a person leaning over my bed. I saw a dark outline of a man standing on the side, I felt we locked eyes but everything so so dark but we looked at each other for several minutes, and became very distraught and sad for reasons I could not explain. Then he was gone. I was barely breathing out of terror, but throughout the entire time a sense of calm had permeated into the room. I sat up and pulled myself out of the bed and into the hallway. I needed to go see my parents to tell them, even though I had no idea what I would say or what even happened.


Suddenly a great commotion came out of my parents bedroom--the lights were all on, my mother is screaming and my father is yelling and I hear shuffling in their room. I run down the hallway thinking there are intruders in the house, and what I saw in my room is somehow connected. I fling the door open and see a strange picture of absolute chaos although absolutely nothing had changed. There were no ax murderers, no tornado, but my parents were a wreck.  I soon gather that my parents had received the phone call that my older brother had died unexpectedly only a little while earlier. 


I never believed in the paranormal and still don't; however, I would like to think our sibling wavelengths were always so intune my brain kind of freaked out a little when it lost that connection. Other very strange stuff happened after that I can only guess was something along the line of my brain being out of tune for a bit. Whatever it was, it still kind of freaks me out every now and then to remember how real it seemed. 


Edit: Unexpectedly not Unexpectantly ",null,689,cdnl3u9,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,2265
jdpatric,"2:00 am this past July. It's a twofer. I've posted this before, but it still weirds me out thinking about it.


My one year old wakes up screaming. Not terribly uncommon. I go in and try to console her. Give her a bottle...nothing. She is freaked the fuck out. It happens. She'd been doing this ""night terror"" thing lately where she just woke up terrified (presumably from a nightmare).


My wife takes her shift and tries to calm her down. Nothing. So around 2:30 I decide it's time for a car ride. We have two cars and we took my wifes Yaris. We load the screaming baby into the car, back out of the garage and are on our way. I know a nice ~30 minute drive into the ""country."" We live in a pretty big ""town"" so we had to drive a little to get out of it. The roads are empty at 2:30 am so I wanted to get a good long drive in to make sure the baby stayed asleep.

Once we're ""out of town"" I head down a long stretch of basically middle of nowhere road. I hang a right onto an even smaller road (45 mph speed limit) and after about a mile down this road I see something strange. There are ditches on either side of the road filled with water ~3' deep. I've biked the road myself before (I do a 25 mile loop) and I know that there isn't much shoulder room.

Up ahead I can see traffic cones blocking the road off. No signs for roadwork. No warnings. No light at all, the cones just block the road. Wat. So at this point I'm expecting to be a victim of a highway robbery. My wife and I kinda look at each other a little nervous and I realize I need to make a quick 3 point U-turn.

Now, I want to preface this part with the fact that I was pretty creeped out to begin with, so this could have been my mind playing tricks on me, but I'm pretty sure that I saw what I saw. I slow the car down at the last possible second, begin to make the turn and as my headlights pass over the ditch on the left side of the road I see the silhouette of a person standing on the other side of the water. My wife was looking the other way to make sure no cars/psychos with chainsaws came from the other direction, so she didn't get as good a view as I did. As soon as I got that car straightened out I went from 0-60 in...well...it's a Yaris (like a step or two up from a Geo) probably not terribly fast, but I had that fucker floored. We got the hell out of dodge and went straight back home.

We get home and we go to put the (now) sleeping baby back down. As we enter her room we notice that her closet door is open. We make it a habit of closing the closet door because we (well, mostly I) think it's creepy for her closet door to be open at night. Did we leave it open? Maybe. That's not the end of it though. My curiosity now piqued I decide to make sure the remainder of the doors in our house are shut and locked. The front door wasn't locked. Did we forget to lock it? Maybe. Why was the baby crying? Cause she's a baby? Maybe.

I ""slept"" the rest of the night sitting in a chair in the living room with the TV on, while hugging the thick end of a two piece pool cue.",null,468,cdnoxew,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,1913
The_Dalek_Emperor,"OK, when my daughter was 2 she started talking about a man who lived in her closet. She said he would come out at night and wake her up and talk to her. He said he lived in a hole in her closet and would take children down the hole. She said he had black eyes. 

This went on for about a week with me trying to shrug it off, I really don't believe in the paranormal. But man, she was consistent. 

The whole thing ended when I woke up one night to her screaming bloody murder. I ran into her room (other side of the house) and she told me the man with the black eyes said that I (her mother) was dead and would she come down the hole with the man. He said she had to say yes so he could take her. She said no and whatever happened next (I could never get that out of her) made her start screaming and crying. When I got to her room, I will say that the closet door was wide open and I shut it every night because of her nightmares. That freaked me out a bit too. 

I moved her into my room and wouldn't let her back into hers. We moved out of that house a month later anyway, so I just had her sleep with me from then on. She stopped talking about him. 
I wrote several paranormal investigative groups to see what they would say. I never actually went back to check their answers because she stopped talking about it.

Whether it was all in her head or not, it is the single creepiest thing that has ever happened to me. 

She's 7 now and still remembers him. ",null,592,cdnm2dr,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,1975
limsical,"When I was 16, this guy called my house asking for a ""Mark"". I politely told him that there was no Mark living in the house, and he had the wrong number. He continued talking to me. He said, ""You have such a beautiful voice!"" ""You are so funny"" etc. I wasn't even saying anything to him, except ""You have the wrong number..."" and ""You sound drunk."" etc. I hung up on him about 5 minutes into the creepy conversation. I thought that was the end of that, but I was wrong.

A week later, this *guy* showed up at my house, asking to see me. My sister called me down, and I went outside to talk to this man. (I should add, he was about 30 years old). He said, ""Do you know who I am?"" 

Me: No...

Him: We talked on the phone about a week ago. Wow, you are so beautiful up close.

Me: Up close?

Him: *crying* I love you so much!

He tried hugging me but I punched him in the ""area"", ran inside, and said, ""fuck you! Go away before I call the police!"" He didn't leave, so I called the police.

Turns out this guy had been stalking me for about two months. He called me to try and start some sort of relationship, but since it didn't work, he went crazy and came to my house. He didn't try touching me, besides the hug. He did spend a little time in prison, and was put on medication. Eventually, he apologized to me saying that his wife left him for his best friend. He went to the park to get some air, which is when he saw me. Apparently I looked a lot like his wife, and became obsessed with me. He is doing good now, and actually is extremely ashamed of what he did. It's still the creepiest thing that ever happened. To know that someone was watching your every move for a whole two months... it's weird.

Edit: I DO NOT STALK MY STALKER. My lawyer keeps tabs on him to make sure whatever he is up to isn't involving whatever I'm doing. She often updates me on how he is doing. Him and his wife got divorced, and he now has a girlfriend. He's extremely involved in church, and does a ton of community service. I really feel awful for the guy. He went through such a tough thing, and I guess seeing me sparked that ""crazy"" part of his brain. Anyways, he is doing better.

Everything shifted. He looked completely like an average college student. Just another guy on the street. But then I looked closely into his eyes and something was just... *off*. 

I laughed nervously. ""Well, indirectly! I mean, I work for the university!"" 

He nodded with total conviction. ""That's true. That's absolutely true."" He grabbed my shoulder tighter. ""You should work for the government."" 

I slapped him on his shoulder, in a friendly gesture that incidentally got his hand off mine. ""Dang!"" I said. ""I think I'm actually waiting for the wrong bus, I'm going to head off. Bye!"" 

I got all the way across the street before he shouted.

WeightLiftingLulu,"Creepy and simply unsolved. Had a roommate in college, that I met a week prior to moving in thru a posting on one of the school boards. We met each others families and they helped move us in, we rented one side of a twin house with some stairs so the help was needed for the bedroom furniture. We had our own bedrooms, and we were the odd couple, she had a messy room with clothes, books, etc. everywhere, and I was simple. About a month in, she started complaining about having a tough time sleeping, something was keeping her up, and she had a few weird bruises and scraps on her back, we didnt know where they came from, she didnt have a boyfriend or anything, we were both nerds and studed or watch movies, no sports. 

Then one night, I came home from the library around 11pm. My roommate was home watching a movie. I said goodnight and went to bed. 

Woke up at 7am for class. 

Walked by her room and her door was open. As I walked by I looked into her room as I walked by. Her entire room was empty. She was gone. No note. I called the cops, and they didn't believe me that I had a roommate and left, even after showing the cops her parents checks then send for rent. I called her cell, disconnected. Called her parents, disconnected. Asked around campus, no record of her. To this day I have no idea how she moved all her stuff out between 11pm and 7am without me hearing anything and waking up (I'm a light sleeper) and as of 11pm no one was in the house to help her. 

To this day I can't explain it, hence, its the creepiest thing that has ever happened in my life. I moved out a week later. 

TL;DR Moved into house with roommate I hardly knew, everything seemed ok. She couldnt sleep, weird brusies and scrapes appeared. Roommate Disapeared. 

Edit: Ok, this is getting some attention from people, and it's actually pretty cool therapy for me to talk about it with strangers from all over that can share their experiences. I am seeing some /nosleep and other comments about the paranormal part of it, please keep in mind i am a rational person but what i am about to say, i dont even understand what to think and again i just passed it off. Figure people want more details so whatever, i mentioned early i left a few weeks later, one of my classmates actually asked about housing and i mentioned i just movted out of a place, and i told her it was up for rent since i peaced out, didnt get into the details of course. My classmate ended up moving into the twin, she and two her best friends. About a month later my classmate came up to me out of no where and told me her roommate/best friend pack up all her stuff and moved out telling my classmate if she ever asked why she was leaving she would never talk to her again, this girl's best friend was in the same hardwood floor room my roommate slept in and also complained of not getting good sleep and bruises an scratches. Believe it, don't believe it, but that's what happened and it doesn't make sense hence the creepiest/unexplainable thing that's ever happened

Anyway, I tore ass back to the door yelling ""GET THE FUCK INSIDE, GET THE FUCK INSIDE, IT'S SOME STEPHEN KING SHIT"". I'm thinking it was some animals fighting, but at the time I was 100% convinced that A: Monsters were, in fact, real, and B: I was gonna get dragged into the woods and eaten.

NapalmBeat,"The day after my Dad died I found myself alone in our now empty house. As I was brushing my teeth I could hear some really softly muffled music. Our neighbors were having construction done, I figured it was the workers listening to radio. When I got downstairs into the kitchen, the music was louder... I couldn't tell what was playing but it sounded creepy as fuck. Like a soft folksy depressing woman singing. Looked out the window, it was raining so no construction. I opened the basement door, it seemed to be emanating from down there. I went downstairs into our partially unfinished basement. The music was loud, it was a woman repeating ""I won't see you tomorrow"" in some kind of Celtic dirge. There are four rooms in my basement and the one furthest from the stairs is the laundry room. I went in there my heart beating so loudly in my ears, the music was literally BLARING. It was coming from an old clock radio that was above the washer. Maybe Dad had set an alarm? I go to turn it off, and it wouldn't. It was then I noticed it was soaking wet. I went to unplug it, to my surprise, it was not even plugged in. No combination of buttons would turn this horrible music off. I also noticed the area and wall behind it were not wet at all, I couldn't find a source as to how it got so wet. I turned it over and checked for batteries... It didn't even have a battery compartment. How could it be playing music and blinking 12:00? It was overwhelmingly loud, In anger and frustration I screamed and threw the radio at the wall. It broke into pieces, but it did stop playing. I will never forget this one.    Also on a side note, I tried to find that song online, tried to research what the song was, I had it in my head for days....

I steered home the next day, nothing unusual at home... **Until** I lay down in bed to chill and watch some Hannibal on my TV. When I noticed something really, really weird above my pillows in the head area.. I took a closer look and got a fucking heart attack. On the wall, just above my pillows were a hand mark made by FUCKING BLOOD, sliding across my wall.. 

I ran to the kitched, grabbed a knife and phoned a friend while searching every wardrobe and other hiding area, found nothing/none. 

I have a photo of it, stil not sure what the fuck happened. There was blood drops (yes, drops, not marks) on random spots on my floor in all the rooms. I have no cuts or anything on either my hands or feet, nor was it any blood IN the bed or on the sheets. And it wasn't there when I left my apartment before going to my friends.

hereyagoman,"I was into a regular running routine back when I lived in Florida.  One of the paths I used to run went through some local neighborhoods and led to a sort of running trail that was about 3 miles long.  On one side was thick swampy woods and on the other was an open field with retention ditches.  Half way through the 3 miles was a small tunnel that led under a local road and was usually where I'd hit my runners high before that me and my buddy would just casually chat about life and whatnot.  Anyway, it's pitch black on this trail and we had just finished the neighborhood portion and started trotting along towards the tunnel.  There's only one street light and it's one of those aesthetic ones that makes for a poor quality light source but it's enough to see the trail and a little bit into the woods as it was on that side of the path.  The street light is a bit away from both the tunnel and the road we just turned in from. 

Anyhow, we're mid sentence and about 300m from the street light when I see what looks like a small child or something crouched down by the base of the lamp not moving and looking our way.  As soon as I locked eyes with it my heart lurched and felt heavy as led, with dread.  My buddy hadn't seen it but noticed I stopped talking (however still jogging forward) and looked to see what I saw.   He immediately stopped, so I stopped.  We looked at each other then back to this shadow.  We walked a little forward not talking and as we made our first step, after we had stopped, it arched it's back and let out the loudest and most high pitched ""SCREEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"" sound I'd ever heard.    Well fear and adrenaline got me going in a dead sprint back towards the road.  ""holy.... shit... what the... fuck"".  We get to the road after sprinting a mile and stop in the street light. We're both rational people and we both know Florida wild life so we start to ask the obvious questions.  Did you see that? yes.  Do you know what it is? No.  Did you fucking HEAR that? YES.  What the fuck, we're both puzzled and still scared but decide we're being ridiculous so we continued our jog casually through the neighborhood.  After about 2 or 3 minutes of jogging I politely point out, that, obviously since it was some sort of animal it probably has predator instincts. We sprinted home, still no idea what the hell that was but years later we've concluded it was some silly midget with a scary voice who had nothing better to do than scare joggers on a bike path.",null,93,cdnmy8j,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,489
Y_Me,"I went on my first road trip with my best friend. We were 18, just graduated from high school and headed to Oregon. We were ready for a driving break and went down some random road that followed a river. We didn't see anyone for miles and just picked a turn out. There were turnouts ever 100 yards or so, I assume for fishing. We got out of the car and spend over an hour wandering up river, skipping rocks etc. We made it around the bend to a bridge, out of sight of our car. When we decided we were ready to head back and continue the drive, we opted to walk back along the road. As we come into sight of the car, we see an old pickup truck parked right behind our car. I'm suspicious due to an older sibling who had a stage where she read all about serial killers and convinced me that that should be my main concern. 

Anyways, I'm wondering why this guy parked here since there were plenty of unoccupied spots for miles. I figure maybe it's a favorite fishing hole or something. Realizing that we are 2 18 year old girls on a road, alone for miles, I suggest that we quietly get into the car and get out, just because. Well, shutting doors makes noise but I'm not really worried. I'm in the drivers seat and my friend is in the passenger seat, looking towards the river. The car had been having issues for a while and when I tried to start it, it made a loud, screeching sound. This was common problem for this car and if you waited and tried again, it usually started right up.
So, when the car screeches, I start laughing because we were trying to sneak out and failing miserably. Suddenly my friend starts screaming ""Oh my God, he's naked! Go go go! Lets get the fuck out of here!"" I turn to look and sure enough, there was a naked guy down by the river bank and he is running straight for us! Thankfully the damn car started and I got us out of there as fast as that car would go. I could see him running down the road after us for a little while. 

We laughed at first, but the more we thought about what thought process would have been involved for that guy to do all those things, we were kind of freaked out. Listened to my intuition ever since.",null,88,cdnoek5,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,456

TheFapman,"Finding out that someone was hiding in my house for two hours as I thought was home alone.  Just thinking about what could have happened if I found him. 

*I was at school when I wrote this and did not want to type it all out on my phone so here is the full story.*

I came home from University for Easter.  I was home alone so I spent most of my day at my grandmas.  After supper I decided to drive home.  I lived on a farm about 4 kilometres out of town and since I was on a farm I never locked my doors.  

After getting home I decided to just plop down on the couch and watch TV.  I ate wayyyy to much delicious Scottish food (mostly shortbread) at my grandmas and needed a nap.  I was laying on the couch for about 10 minutes when my buddy called.  He was in town visiting his girlfriend, but arrived early (about 8) and she did not get off work till 9.  He asked to come over and chill for a bit and of course I obliged.  I hadn't seen him in a while.  

He came over and we sat on the couch and talked.  Nothing special just catching up.  It was getting close to 9 and my girlfriend called me and asked me to come watch a movie at 9:30.  This worked perfectly so a 9 my buddy left and I was just cleaning up a bit.  I put my parents puppy that I was taking care of in her kennel where she was very calm.  I went out to my car and was just starting down my driveway when my girlfriend called and said she would pick me up and was on her way with one of her friends.  I was thinking ""great! less driving for me.""  

So I went back inside the house and the puppy was whining.  It was like a sick whine that made me feel terrible.  I thought that she saw me and believed that she was going to get out of her kennel.  I felt guilty so I decided to stand outside.  Out on the deck my newfoundlander came on the deck and I was petting her.  She was a beautiful dog and the nicest dog I had ever met.  I had never seen her get aggressive before, until now.  

As I stood there I noticed how her hackles were up and her mouth was open.  I was thinking to myself that she has some big fucking teeth.  She then started growling as she stared into my house through the large stained glass window in my house.  I turned and looked and saw a figure move across my kitchen.  I couldn't see much detail through the stained glass.  

Now my heart was racing!  My fight or flight response kicked in and sadly I ""flighted"" (if that is a word!).  I ran toward my car and waited for my girlfriend to get to my place.  She pulled in my driveway and I ran toward her car and jumped in and told them what happened.  The two of them got scared since they believed it was a ghost.  I can see the argument because my house is pre World War One, but I knew it was a real person.  My girlfriend pinned it in an effort to get away from this ""ghost"" and as she drove I could see him peeking out from behind the blinds in my bay window watching us drive away.  I will never forget that look.  

It took me about 5 minutes to convince her to turn around and I called my neighbors and they came with guns and bats.  We searched that house top to bottom and he was gone, luckily for him.  I wish we wouldn't have left while we knew he was in the house.  

So he was in my house for about 2 hours as I layed on the couch.  I do not know where he hid.  It was a two storey house so I assume he was either in the basement or upstairs.  Luckily I did not stay long enough to have to go to either of those places since our only bathroom was upstairs and most of our food was in the freezer downstairs.  Truly terrifying experience.  

The worst part though was that nothing was moved.  Everything was exactly where we left it.  I am not sure how long he was their before I came home, but I hope not long because if he was then he had no intentions of burglary.  ",null,66,cdnykie,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,324
MedicsOfAnarchy,"1988.

When my daughter was around 2 years old we moved to a (new to us) 4-bedroom house.  Bedroom #1 was for my wife and me, #2 was her room.

Soon after moving in we noticed that after putting her to bed for the night, we'd hear her talking and laughing long after she should have been asleep.  Peeking in after about the third night of this we found her standing at the end of her crib, chattering away with the closet door about 5 feet away.  Typical new parents, we'd tell her to lie down and go to sleep.

This continued for many nights, and then we noticed she was actually holding *conversations* - talk a little, listen some, answer ""yes"" or ""no"" or ""I don't know"".

When we asked her about it, she said she was talking to the lady in the green dress.  This continued sporadically but eventually died down to where if she was continuing the conversations, we weren't catching them.  When we asked what she talked about, she either said ""stuff"", or ""School"" (daycare) or ""I don't know.""


Time passed, her little brother was born.  After the initial baby-in-the-parent's room phase, we moved them together into the room.  When he could stand on his own, pulling himself up on things, the same thing happened.  We'd hear him babbling, and peek in to see him doing the same thing - standing at the end of the crib, talking to the closet, his sister fast asleep in her bed.

Again, continues sporadically, slows, stops.

Three years go by.  Two boys now, so Big Sister gets her own room and the two boys share The Room.  Same behaviour from the youngest.

We have no way of knowing if they discussed this among themselves, but each described a ""lady in a green dress"".  In asking them separately, one might mention ""she has long hair"".  Son might say ""She has black hair"".  If asked if it's long or short, curly or straight, he'd say ""It's long"".  And so on in many details.  When we heard a new detail from one, and gave a multiple choice for that detail to the other, they'd always agree - belt or no belt, color, shoes, white lady/black lady/indian lady, whatever.  At this point though, we're thinking they could all be remembering the same picture from a story book or something, so... meh.


Then weird stuff starts happening.

Now, the wife and I were both smokers, and the rule was one could smoke outside, or in the bathroom upstairs (which had a ceiling exhaust fan) but nowhere else in the house.  One fine cold evening, too cold to go outside for just a smoke, I used this rule.  I'd put the youngest to bed, the two older children were downstairs watching a movie.  Suddenly I hear them yelling the youngest child's name and running through the house.  This makes more sense if you know the downstairs came up into the kitchen; go right and you're in the dining room; go right and you're in the hallway; go right and you're in the living room; go right and you're back in the kitchen.  The older two were running this circle and yelling the youngest's name in an exasperated way.

So I stub out my smoke and exit the bathroom just as the older two were making the circuit again.

""What's going on you guys?""
""We're chasing (youngest).  He's supposed to be in bed!""
I peek into the bedroom.  ""Yes, he *is* in bed.""
""No he's not.  He just went into the kitchen again.  We heard him on the stairs and just saw him run up.  He's not supposed to be awake watching movies now so we tried to tell him but he kept going around the corner so we ran after him.""

So, basically, they glimpsed someone on the steps and chased the figure.  Every time they turned a corner in this circuit, they caught *just a glimpse* of the figure turning the next corner, and continued the chase.  My youngest was truly asleep.

Turned bedroom #3 into a study.  It was downstairs.  One day I'm home in my study, wife at work, kids at school.  Someone is pacing the floor above me.  A slow walk from one end of the living room directly above me, then back again.  Since I know no-one is home I guess it's my sister-in-law, who has a key and a penchant for dropping by from time to time unannounced.  I go upstairs, doors are all locked, nobody there.  Could be street traffic?  But it was *exactly* the sound of someone walking above, that one squeaky floorboard and everything.

I mention this to my wife.  ""Oh, you heard The Walking Man.  When I stayed home sick that day last month I heard it all the time.  Someone walking back and forth in the living room, but nobody ever there when I checked.""

Okay, so we got that going for us, which is nice.  I'm wondering how to enlist this character to push a vacuum cleaner while he's at it.

No more Green Lady chats; no more phantom kids running around the house.  The Walking Man is heard from time to time but I've learned to ignore him.  He doesn't answer to questions or anything like that.  We've left out pen and paper, nada, okay, we're cool, he's cool, whatever.

2000.

We're moving - just need a bigger house.  The realtor assures us we don't have to mention the other residents to prospective buyers, so that's nice.  Most of the stuff is packed up, moved into storage so the house ""shows"" well.  Someone buys it and we start packing the last of everything so we can move later in the week.  With the ""shows well"" it just looked... roomy.  Now it actually looks like a place someone is leaving.

My oldest son (still in the #2 room, the Green Lady room bedroom, where he shares bunkbeds with his younger brother) gets up in the night to use the bathroom.

In the living room, clearly visible down the hall, is a tall man standing and staring at the wall, his back to my son.  My son said he knew instantly it wasn't me.  This tall figure begins to turn slowly towards my son.  My son changes his mind about using the bathroom and runs back into his own room, where there's a woman sitting on the floor.  In her lap is a small child.  They're both looking at my son, who at this point is screaming his head off and running into our room/bed/covers.

So we check, and there's nobody else in the house of course.

For the next couple of nights, just 'cuz, we set up a video camera in the corner of the living room that would give the most coverage.  We don't have motion sensors, and the tape runs 8 hours or so on lowest quality, but in the two or three nights we taped after bedtime nothing happened, at least nothing caught on tape.

And we moved, and that's it.

Except -

We never really noticed until the move, but when you walk into a house and there's nobody home, you somehow *feel* that.  ""I'm home, and I'm the first one home, and I'm the only one home"".  We realized that we had never felt that since 1988, only in the new house.  My wife also said it felt ""lonely"" being the first one to come home to the new house.  So at some level, maybe we all sensed something.

Mind you, this a mix of her personal account and what I've read in the press through all these years (this happened in 2003, if I'm not wrong).

My mother used to work at a hospital in a posh part of Madrid as a clerk, helping carry patients or moving beds around or delivering X-Ray results.

One day, she was going on about her daily working routine when she heard screaming a floor below. She's always too eager to help (maybe too much, I must admit) and she instantly assumed someone was having a stroke, which is not all that uncommon. She ran downstairs.

What she found was a completely empty hallway, except for a man who was lying on the floor. She walked on to him to help him, but then saw a woman, a doctor, running towards her from the other end of the hall. **She was carrying a bloody knife**.

She went straight to strike my mother, and she covered herself on instinct with her forearm. She has now a quite ugly scar as a result, from the elbow right to the wrist. Then my mother started running down several flights of stairs, and all the while the doctor didn't stop pursuing her. It took a male nurse and another clerk to restrain her. My mother always comments that one of her rescuers's name is Salvador (which means ""saviour"" in Spanish).

She then got taken care of and always complains that her wedding band got lost when the nurse removed it so that she could properly stitch her up.

The man my mother found lying on the floor was already dead when she saw him, as were another two people, one of them was another doctor. One of the most horrifying accounts heard at the trial was that of **a fellow clerk who hid from the killer doctor inside a bathtub but was found by her and repeatedly stabbed** (the doctor actually thought she was dead and thus left her there). She has been severely crippled, both physically and psychologically, ever since.

This murderer of a doctor suffered from schizophrenia and had been displaying disturbing behaviour for a while already. She had persecution complex and was convinced that she was being routinely watched and that there was some conspiracy against her among her co-workers. She wasn't taking her medication. One day she brought with her a kitchen knife to work and the rest of the story I've already told you. Her weird behaviour was well-known. The only reason she hadn't been 'put aside', so to speak, was that the doctor's family had friendship ties with the managers of the hospital, which is privately owned.

It was heart-breaking watching the killed doctor's boyfriend say that this was all known and nobody ever said anything that could prevent the tragedy and that all the co-workers had witnessed her weird treatment of patients and her downright disturbing actions, most notably **writing on her computer... while it was off**.

My parents tried to hide what happened from me at first, which worked for about half an hour, because when we turned on the TV there wasn't talk in any channel about anything else.

**Noelia de Mingo** is her name. Look her up, I'm too lazy right now, but I think there aren't too many English-language sources on her. She's currently at the psychiatry wing of a prison in Eastern Spain, but has been allowed recently to spend days or even weeks outside. She actually has been known to travel all the way to Madrid (several hundred kilometers) all by herself.

ramboy18,"Worked at Dollar General and while I was showing an older gentleman where the shampoo aisle was. He tried to start small talk. I was busy running the cash register, but he just kept talking. So I though I would be nice and entertain him until someone walked up to the register. He then asks where something else is which happens to be in the back of the store.

Keep in mind this is very early morning and I'm the only one in the store. I walk to the back and start looking for it's exact location. I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with him, and as I spot the item and point it out he begins to rub my back, while saying thank you. Which didn't bother me at first until he kept rubbing my back and tried to keep up the small talk. I pretended that I heard someone at the register waiting to be checked out and noped the fuck out of there.

I still remember that awkward look on his face as I rang him up at the register and he left. I still get heeby-jeebies everytime I think about it. Did I mention I am a male.

Special_KAD,"I had an experience when I was about 11 or 12 that I don't have any explanation for, besides it being a ghost. I woke up for school in the morning and turned over in my bed to face the doorway. I was on the top floor of the house and my room had a closet directly to the left of the doorway with stairs leading downstairs right outside of the doorway. I watched as a little boy, younger than myself, wearing a red backpack and blue jeans (typical) walked from my closet out my door and down the stairs. He didn't look at me or acknowledge me at all, just slowly walked. I laid frozen in bed for a minute or two trying to process what just happened. I decided to go downstairs to my parents bedroom and tell them what happened. My parents room was arranged with the bed in the middle and my dad's favorite recliner chair on the far side of the room next to the window. The chair was aligned in a way that you couldn't see it until the door way fully opened. So I open the door about to wake my parents and tell them what I saw and the same little boy is sitting in my dad's chair staring directly at me. I freaked the fuck out and ran away screaming. Neither I or any of my family members saw anything like it before or since. My parents still live in the house and it was built by my grandfather. No one has ever died there to my knowledge. 

I'm not sure whether I believe in ghosts or not but that was the only explanation I could come up with. Freaky shit. ",null,49,cdnlwn9,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,219

AbbyRoses,"I had a check up with my ""joint"" doctor (I have arthritis). He said that he recommended I take these shots. They were to go directly in my joints and I was going to be put under. I was a little nervous. I never really like being put under but I knew this was safe and that I would feel a whole lot better. This procedure, however, would be the scariest moment in my life. Just thinking about it now is giving me the shivers. I hope I explain it well because it was so weird. Anyway, I was put under with laughing gas. I then awoke abruptly. It took me a second to realize what was happening. For some reason, I was crying and screaming. There were doctors trying to hold me down and comfort me. And then, for some reason, I blurted out, ""Did I die?"" followed with me screaming, ""Oh my God"". Now the weirdest thing about all of this is that I felt like I was trapped in my mind, having no control of what my body was doing or saying. All I could think was what in the world was going on. After I screamed ""Oh my God"", my body struggled in the hands of the doctors and I felt myself zooming towards the wall, but I wasn't even moving. Imagine it like in the movies where the spaceships go into hyperspeed and the stars start zooming past them. Then a flash of black and the whole scenario from every detail happened again. This got me thinking, oh my gosh, did I really die and am I trapped in this forever? This is when I started to panic. But then I actually woke up and was balling. I called for my stepmom, my dad, who ever was there so I knew I was ok. My stepmom came in because she was the one who drove just us to the hospital. I was so glad to see her and cried in her arms. The procedure still had to be done so I reluctantly went back and finished. To my relief, it didn't happen again.

acydetchx,"I've experienced [sleep paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis) a few times. For those too lazy to click, basically your mind wakes up before the rest of most of your body, so you're awake but can't move; it also often comes with auditory and/or visual hallucinations.

The first time it happened was the creepiest thing I'd ever experienced. I didn't know this was a thing that happened, so I was absolutely terrified. Here's what happened:

I woke up with a start from some nightmare and my eyes snapped open. I felt a moment of relief, having woken from a nightmare. The relief quickly faded when I went to sit up, but couldn't move anything at all. I was on my stomach, trying to turn over, but my body wouldn't respond to any command at all.

Right freaked out, I tried to call out for help, but found that I couldn't speak. Instead, the scream remained in my head, stuck as internal monologue I suppose. It built as I kept trying to scream, turning inhuman, like in a movie when hell opens up, and there's the sound of thousands of tormented souls screaming. As the scream built, I saw shadows moving around me unnaturally, like darting, furtive creatures, sneaking closer and closer to me.

I don't know how long it lasted, felt like hours but I did later realize it was probably a minute at most. As soon as I could move, I darted out of bed, and hopped online to try to figure out what the hell just happened to me.",null,30,cdnm9e8,1riazr,AskReddit,top_day,136
BossCalzone,"i remember being a teen and going for a drive with my friends. we drove down this rocky side road for the fun of it and were just having a chat. i noticed one of the mailboxes had the name callahan on it, so i pointed it out because our math teacher was named mr callahan and he was kind of pedophilish, so we called diddlers callahans.

we continued down the street and every mailbox had the name callahan on it. we thought it might have been a brand name for mailboxes but they all had it written differently, sometimes in letter stickers other times handwritten. there were probably about 10 or 15 houses all with callahan as the mailbox. it was like a huge family all bought houses in the same neighborhood. and all the houses were dark, not as single light on in any of them, and there were no streetlights

suddenly the road got bumpier and bumpier and then it just stopped. dead end. right in front of us was this nasty broken down house with like four speedboats in the giant driveway. and a callahan mailbox. they were the only house with any lights on. we could see they were having a bonfire or something out in the back yard too.

we were kind of buggin out so my friend storks started to back up with the intention of turning into a driveway to get going back the other way. as soon as we started to back out, we saw a couple of big guys come out from behind the one lit up house. they all had big bushy beards and were dressed kind of gross, like hillbillies. they were pretty intimidating looking so storks backed out quick and popped into the driveway to the left. then more people started coming out from the back of the main house, but from the other direction so they were kinda close to us. as storks pulled the car back we saw there were about 10 guys and a couple of girls slowly walking towards our car

storks got into position and took off. now the road was crazy narrow, no more than a single car could have fit without basically crashing into bushes and trees (unless there was a space for a house) so storks was being cautious. before we got away from all the callahan houses we saw this huge pickup truck coming our way, high beams on. there was not a lot of room, so storks did his best to pull to the side so the truck could get by

but the truck stopped. two huge guys got out of the truck and started coming towards the car. storks floored it and was just barely able to make it around the truck and get past. he knocked the right mirror off his car and it was scratched up as fuck, but we made it out and got away

not sure what we stumbled upon that night but we sure as shit never went back

ZebraZealot,"My grandmother passed away several years ago due to injuries that caused her to bleed out on the way to a hospital.  Her home was very old and the plaster ceiling broke out and fell onto her head, which knocked her down.  While falling she hit her head again on the corner of the oven.  I am not sure if one of those blows to the head or both caused the bleeding, but that is what ultimately killed her.

Following her death I went up to help my father with clean up, she had been his mother so he was very distraught about it and considering some of his choices with her (she lived about 5 hours from where we lived, and we did not see her often, also, she was a window since '88 so was alone in the house).  Because of what he was dealing with I did a lot to help out, which included cleaning the blood from the kitchen.  It is very different from movies, there was just so much everywhere.

The town she lived in has a population of about 700 people and didn't really have a hotel so we stayed in the house.  She lived on the corner of a small block, and on the corner of the block across the street was a large grain mill and four silos.  Trucks carrying grain to and from the place drove right past the house and caused the whole house to shake.  Lying in bed, looking up at the same ceiling that fell in on her, mixed with the shaking of the house and the blood I had cleaned made it a very creepy place to sleep. Adding to that was the fact that she had been a bit of a shut-in, so whenever I did see her she was always in her house, with her gone the place was just so empty, cold, and vacant.  I had never been in that house without her there, and now she would never be back.

*Edit, I did type Window, and I'll leave it as there are several comments about it.  However, I did mean widow, which I'd hope most people understood.  Does inject some levity to the story though.

Princess_Honey_Bunny,"I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch.
But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ""heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks."" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting.
And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe.
He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.

This was in the Lazy thread but I forget who wrote it :/

ShinjukuAce,"I didn't see regular web sites until 1994 - Yahoo, ESPN, and the New York Times were some of the first ones I ever got on.

I remember the first time I found an actual video online - it was a 30-second video of sumo wrestling, and people in the computer lab gathered around me to watch it.

From 1990-1993, there were BBSs (Bulletin Board Services).  A BBS was like a primitive website, but you had to dial each one individually on your phone line - you couldn't link from one site to another.  They had files for download, text-based games, and email (which someone wouldn't see until they logged on to that site).  You could spend 15 minutes downloading a low-resolution picture of a woman in a bikini if you wanted.

There was also Usenet before 1994.  Usenet was kind of like Reddit - it had different discussion boards on various topics - I used rec.travel.europe, rec.sport.soccer, rec.gambling.poker, among others.

DkPhoenix,"For chatting there was IRC (Internet Relay Chat), in the early 90s it was just EFnet, Undernet and DALnet came along in the mid-90s, because EFNet was kind of... unregulated.  All the channels (chat rooms) were user created, and sometimes there were wars where a group of people (or one individual running bots) would take over a channel from the regulars.  This was possible because a channel ceased to exist when no one was in it, and the first person to enter said empty channel would recreate it, and therefore own it.  To connect, you'd log into one of many servers, most of which were maintained by various universities around the world.  Sometimes these servers would lose their connection to EFnet, or become so lagged that they'd effectively be disconnected.  That was called a netsplit, and that was the opportunity to take over a channel.  You'd connect to a server that you knew was split or desynched, or one that you knew was likely to split (some were notorious for that),create your channel, and wait for it to reconnect.  If all worked as planned, you'd come in and your bot or script would immediately remove operator (moderator) powers from everyone else, kick them out, and make the channel private, pissing off all the channel regulars until the next netsplit, when they'd attempt to take it back.  People would also try social engineering type takeovers, where they'd come in using the nick(name) of a channel regular, hoping someone would op them without looking at the hostmask.

DALnet and Undernet introduced channel and nick servers, so you could register them and thwart the most common takeover methods, but they didn't eliminate netsplits, and the hilarity that could sometimes follow when chanserv de-opped and kicked an entire room.

IRC was all text.  You could chat in the open channels, send private messages, and also do DCC (Direct Client to Client) chats and file transfers, that weren't affected by netspilts.  The file sharing didn't really start happening until later on, though.  At 9600bps (or less) sending even a large text file could be painful.",null,0,cdnr5ed,1ri9xe,AskReddit,top_day,1

The female body part of punctuation,
So tiny, yet able to arouse such aggravation.

The comma slips in under the quotation,
Tells you when to pause for reflection,
Then plunge ahead to the period’s conclusion.

Neglect it at your peril: accusations,
law suits, wars. Nations fall.
 
Pretend it doesn’t exist at all? Risk condemnation.
Treat it right for absolution.

That’s right, put it there: Yes, oh, yes . . . satisfaction.

razzmatazz18,"Made an account just to comment here. Even if it gets lost, it's therapeutic to talk about.

My parents lied to me about moving to another continent and I only found out a week before the move.

I was born and raised in New York suburbs, but Egyptian by blood. We started selling our house when I was 10. My mom said we were just moving to another part of the neighborhood, like 10 minutes away, and 10-year-old me believed it. She even drove us around sometimes to look at houses in other neighborhoods and talk about how nice they'd be to live in, and I'd point out the ones I'd like to live in and she'd verbally consider them.

Fast forward to a few weeks in, my dad is showing around some potential house-buyers and they ask where we're moving to. He says, ""Oh, you know, we're moving back to Egypt.""

Um, what?

I had to call my closest friends and awkwardly tell them I was moving away with no time to see anyone. Granted, I was a pretty awkward kid myself, and I'm no longer in contact with any of them, but I was about to switch from elementary to middle school and had made all these awesome plans and was so excited.

Changing schools was hard, changing cultures was even harder. I got more in touch with my Egyptian side, can speak Arabic better now, and changed my personality around, but it made me grow up to resent this country. I'm 20 now and graduating college (was forced to stay at college here, but that's another story), and I'm going to leave and never look back.

* What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?  
* Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker and how you handled that situation.  
* Where do you see yourself in 5 years?   

What's more important than the answers though, is how they answer them. I especially like the strength/weakness question for this.

tinysideburns,"I once worked at a sandwich shop. The place was severely understaffed and there would be only three people on shift during the lunch rush, and the owner was completely indifferent. Oh, and we'd have to stay super late at night to make cookies and party subs. Party subs were the worst because you had to braid all of the bread dough, bake it, slice up enough meat, slice all the veggies and place all of the condiments in separate containers (you couldn't put them on the sandwich or it would get soggy). Cookies weren't hard to do, but baking hundreds of them took hours.  

We were allowed one six inch sub for lunch each day, which we sometimes traded with the pizza place next door. One day this new manager, Jay, worked out a trade with the pizza place; we'd give them our subs for a large pizza and some wings. 

After I left for the day, the owner came in and saw the pizza box. Instead of saying ""we bought a pizza,"" turbo-douche Jay told the owner that I had traded subs for pizza. Now, all we did was trade the six inch subs we would have gotten for free anyway for a pizza. Maybe not the most noble thing to do, but certainly not crime of the century. 

So when I came in the next day, the owner goes into a tirade against me, tells me that Jay ratted me out and that I was fired. 

Fast forward a few days. I call in and place an order for a party sub under a false name. Jay picked up the phone so I threw my voice, posing as my high school music teacher. I ordered a 15 foot party sub with extra meat, extra tomatoes, oil &amp; vinegar and mayo. Jay says, ""We put the condiments on the side so it doesn't get soggy,"" to which I reply, ""Just put them on, I like it soggy."" Oh, and I also ordered 350 cookies. The total was over $450. 

They didn't ask me for a credit card, just a name and number. I gave them a false name and the number for my high school. 

That order must have taken Jay HOURS to fill, and because I asked for all condiments on the sub, it was completely inedible. I tried pulling the same stunt three weeks later, but they got wise and asked for a credit card. 

TIL: I placed a false, time-consuming order for a very expensive party sub. The brown-nosing manager who lied to have me fired had to make it, and the owner lost the money. I wouldn't do this now, but I was 15 at the time. ",null,0,cdnidkt,1ri8y4,AskReddit,top_day,1

I told him that I didn't agree with how they were getting people into this job.  I was fired on the spot and walked out.

Cananbaum,"STORY TIME KIDS!! 

I was with Stop&amp;Shop and after 2 months of being horridly abused by the hire ups I had had enough. Well one day I was doing cart retrieval. 

The bitch of a deli manager would come out ever 10-15 minutes for a cigarette break and if I stopped even for a moment to even get a drink of water, I would get reported to my supervisor. I was 90 degree day and we were incredibly busy. I was constantly moving and very thirsty. 

Well I stopped to take a drink of the water I have with me and she has a fit and I get reported for a fourth time. I get called in and in front of customers I get belittled by said supervisor and the deli manager has this wicked smile on her face. I'D HAD HAD ENOUGH. 

I was never properly trained on registers, it got so bad a manager would follow me up to the time clock to make sure I didn't ""clock in early"" (I had a ""bad habit"" of clocking in about 5 minutes early and was threatened with being written up for time card padding), the store manager was critical to where ever I parked, even if I was in employee parking so I ended up parking at the farrest reaches of the customer parking lot to shut him up, and my favorite one was how my brother who I'd not seen for close to 10 months after being shipped off for the Navy came in to surprise me during what was supposed to be my lunch break (My parents had called and on one of my breaks I called back. They asked when my lunch was, that was how he knew.)- and the manager decide that was a good time bump my lunch up for an hour. I didn't get to see my brother for another week after that... it was bad. 

So I looked at the supervisor screaming at about being insubordinate and how I needed to come inside if I had nothing better to do so I told him, in front of the customers, that he and the deli manager needed to ""Get the fucking sticks out of their goddamned asses!"" 

I was fired, and rightfully so. I was happy to be fired in this case. 

But now **THE REVENGE**

I ended up calling corporate and used my voice acting abilities to convince them I was an elderly woman named Roberta - and I filed a complaint against each and every one of the higher-ups I had issues with, claiming I'd shopped there for years and saw the shit that would happen in front of the customers. IT wasn't far from the truth because people were reprimanded in front of the customers all the time. It was embarrassing.  

Corporate bought it. Two people I found out got transferred, the deli manager got fired and the store manager was replaced withing 3 months. 

**TL;DR** Was abused by the higher ups at a grocery store. Called corporate and pretended to be someone I wasn't and had one person fired, two transferred and the store manager replaced.  ",null,0,cdnimdt,1ri8y4,AskReddit,top_day,1

There is not a single shred of evidence that, in any way, supports the claim that life exists elsewhere in the universe.

We should have been visited by an ET civilization, or have found some sort of artifact (in orbit) that was meant to communicate with possible civilizations. Logically space-faring civilizations would put some sort of communications device in orbit around candidates for probable civilization cultivating planets.

Also god's evil he has killed far more people ""directly"" than Satan.

Jesus became the first hybrid human/alien to better understand us, sadly the evil in our hearts caused by the fear of a race we couldn't even comprehend since we were such a young race back then.

They couldn't give us their the technology, though they still used what they had, which were their flying  vehicles, which in the bible got translated to flaming chariots.

They didn't know what was going on, this race was too far ahead, they had to let us do this naturally.

So they bred with us and gave up their tech.  God was most likely a leader of the alien race, and Jesus a human/alien hybrid which was artificially inseminated in the virgin Mary.  Cause how else would a virgin have a baby?  Magic?

I got onto SNAP using a mailbox at a house that was long abandoned (I would have slept there but it was way worse than under the bridge).

I had a government phone that had 400 minutes on it a month and I picked the bridge because there was outlet at the base that the lock had been broken off. Free power!

After a while I was able to get to a library and look for work. after a bit I got hired and could walk to work. After a while I was able to move into a furnished studio paying weekly. 

I had hit rock bottom and I was too proud/stupid to ask for help. I had lost everything I wanted/had due to an addiction I could not let go of.

6ixsigma,"I befriended an unpopular kid in highschool, he the heavy antisocial type that got picked on, me the semi-popular kid with a pretty normal life. According to his mom, I was the first ""friend"" to ever hang out with him/come to his house.  Invited him to every social gathering/party, introduced him to an incredible about of people, became best friends (his mom always called me her 2nd son), stopped by his house for the holidays, introduced him to his first girlfriend (now his wife), got him a very well paying job in IT, the works. 

Recently, him and the girl I introduced him to got married. Without question, I knew I was going to be the best man. Everyone knew. I was proud of him and thankful I could be a part of shaping his life. 

But, he picked another high school friend that all around treated him like shit, has done nothing for him but ask favors, and only came around a few times a year ( over the course of 10 years since highschool). His best man speech was painful - there was nothing for him to say given the little involvement in my friends life(nothing about how the couple met, nothing about growing up together). 

It was that moment it struck me. Here is this guy getting married, whom I've asked nothing of, whom I've considered a best friend for many, many years (and him too, without a doubt), and who's life has been greatly shaped by nothing more than me being a good person, and a better friend.

It also complicates things if one person wants to have biological children and their partner is older and would have a hard time conceiving a child. These things aren't necessarily deal breakers but they can add stress to a relationship. 

That being said my boyfriend is only about a year and a half older than me and I have never felt so connected to anyone before.

TacoGoat,"This applies to me and I get weird looks for it, but here goes;

I was 17 when I met my now boyfriend. He was 24.

I'm from Quebec he's from Texas, (we met online.) If I remember right the legal age for Texas is 17, 16 for Quebec.

He liked me, (no, not in a creepy way), we talked alot about the game and other things, so it started from there. We played a MMO together.

When we got together, I was afraid he'd get into trouble and asked him if he was ready for that, he said he didn't care about that. He really doesn't care what other people think, as long as he and I are happy, that's what matters.

I'm 18 now and we 'got together' when I was '17 and a half' so I guess it wasn't as bad.

I still get awful looks when I say that, though. It kind of hurts.

Last time I said this I got downvoted and berated but I'm sharing anyways because it's related.

I'm younger by 7 years, and while he has more 'adult' experience than I, I have experiences he doesn't have. One would be living in Quebec, since it's mostly French and I'm English. I've dealt with racism all my life over here, he doesn't like it when I mention the crap I've seen here.

It's strange, as others are mentioning in the thread, after 20 or so, people stop caring about the age difference, for the most part. There's still some that will raise eyebrows.

Walking down the street, and a guy comes up and asks me for $10.  I tell him I'm broke and attempt to keep walking.  Guy turns me around, sucker punches me, and takes off with my wallet (It was empty, by the way.  I was 16 at the time and was broke.  Didn't even have a licence.  All it had was my school ID.).  

All of a sudden, some guy comes full speed from down the street on a BMX, chases the guy about a block, beats the fuck out of him, and gets me my wallet back.  Never saw the guy before or since.

Working in a supermarket.  A bat somehow makes its way into the store, and is hanging around the produce section.  Manager calls for assistance.  Meanwhile, everybody else is hanging out watching where the bat is.  Customer comes in and before we could stop him, he wanders into the produce section to do some shopping.  He gets buzzed by the bat.  The bat buzzed the wrong person.  

This guy gets this ""HULK SMASH"" look on his face.  He turns around, sees the bat, and runs towards it.  In one fluid motion, he grabs a stick of pepperoni from the meat section, hops into the air, swings and makes a direct hit, sending the bat into the wall and down to the ground, dead.

iswearimnorml,"**TL;DR this may sound cheesy but, my dog.**

On a daily basis, as in, what gets me out of bed in the morning: my dog. I love the ever-living shit out of her. She is 5 now and is the first dog I raised by myself. I rescued her when she was 3 months old and I was 20. 

My parents told me I would regret getting a dog, and I would never be able to take care of a dog or to train it well. I proved them very wrong. I read three or four books on dog training and dog care before adopting. I spent hours training her and playing with her every day from when she was 3 months old until she was about a year and a half. I learned the secret is to reward good behavior and correct bad behavior. Punishment, yelling, and hitting only teaches a dog to be scared of you. When I take her to dog parks I get all sorts of compliments and questions about how I raised her, and this concept somehow just doesn't sink in to 99% of the people I talk to.

Everyone who I know says she is the most well-behaved dog they have ever met. Now every time I go out of town I literally have people bribe me to let them take care of her. My parents can't get enough of her. She knows several tricks. But by far her best trick is following me around on our daily 30-45 minute walks, stopping at each intersection and knowing to stay on the opposite side of me from the road. She doesn't need a leash but I keep one in my pocket for legal reasons. She is so well behaved and listens to me so well that I have gotten out of tickets because animal control was so impressed. Her daily routine has very much become OUR daily routine. If that routine gets interrupted it affects both of us.

She is my biggest motivator because she keeps me grounded, she is my best friend, and I put my heart and soul into raising her. She has been with me through 2 girlfriends, 2 cities, 4 apartments, alcohol dependency, and the death of my best friend. All she asks of me in return is that I rub her belly. I'll never have another like her.

Englishly,"I really think the deconstruction of the welfare state and the rise of extreme wealth is an issue that, while getting more attention, is possibly an oncoming storm of problems. Our wealth gap today and the size of financial transactions is larger than during the gilded age that lead to the Great Depression. Combine this with the destruction of programs to help those in need (not just in America but Europe) and there are tons of problems bubbling under the surface. Look at the [size of financial services](http://seekingalpha.com/article/289397-just-how-big-is-the-global-financial-industry) compared to [world economic output] (http://www.indexmundi.com/world/gdp_\(official_exchange_rate\).html). Financial services are valued at over a quadrillion dollars, while actual GDP is around 70 trillion. Combine this overvaluation with the fact that social programs no longer receive support (not just welfare, but education and infrastructure) and there is a real war going on. Money is percolating up to corporations and financial elite, who then engage in risky financial schemes that attach value to the trendiness of a product - not to actual material or potential future earnings. Karl Polyani wrote a book called *The Great Transformation* that showed how the growth during the gilded age laid the groundwork for what he called a ""vivisection upon society"" that undermined the values of society. This phenomenon then led to the social milieu that incubated nationalism and led to World War II. If his thesis holds true, we could face a similar result when the bottom falls out. The good news is we have all the information in front of us to do something about the problem, the bad news is that there is little political will around the world to take the necessary steps.

Horrorland is a good one. Its a mystery book with some supernatural stuff. 

I don't think The Stand is very gory or scary but it is long. You might want to see if you like his style before reading it. The Dark Tower series is amazing but you probably want to ensure you want to invest before getting into it. 

Insomnia has no gore and isn't very scary. Its a very strange story about an elderly man with insomnia who gets involved with a supernatural plot. Very good. ",null,0,cdnhs1g,1ri4uj,AskReddit,top_day,1

He also works from home about 75% of the time, occasionally he travels. I worked for a long time as well, but when we moved to a new state, he was able to keep his job and I wasn't able to keep mine. Initially I was looking for work, but we both began to realize we liked having me home all day. We eat home cooked meals 5 nights a week, the house has never been cleaner, our pets are happy to have someone to cater to their inside/outside desires all day, we like seeing each other most of the day, etc etc. Also, with the job market being what it is now, I would likely have only found a slightly better than minimum wage job that someone else probably really needs. We have plenty of money; we don't really need a second income. I actually save us money by not working since we no longer have a house cleaner, a dog walker, a commute budget, and we eat at restaurants way less. Plus we both really would like a stay at home parent when we get around to having kids and thought this would be a good chance for me to get used to not working (it has been a significant psychological adjustment).


While he works from home, we still don't see each other much of the day because he's holed up in his office actually working. A typical day goes like this:

* wake up, let dogs out, make coffee, do dishes from last night (he scrapes and soaks, I wash)

* start laundry if needed, let dogs in, internet time

* switch/fold laundry, let dogs out, bad tv/video game time

* make lunch, hangout with husband while we eat, clean up lunch, let dogs in

* clean a room - I rotate throughout the week, let dogs out

* more internet/bad tv/video games, whatever

* start dinner, let dogs in, smoke a j with husband

* eat dinner, fall asleep watching good tv with husband

I have several accounts of tornadoes doing damage to my city and place of work...but there's nothing I could put into words which would equal some of the videos I've seen online. This one, in particular, hits me like a ton of bricks. The video of the impending destruction, then the aftermath that leaves the home and neighborhood destroyed and lives in disarray in a matter of seconds.

morbo-74,"My siblings and I were home alone.  We heard that there was a tornado In the area so we opened all the windows to equalize the pressure (later found out this Is a myth) and went out to the balcony to watch (Not our smartest decision)  we couldn't actually see a funnel cloud.  We couldn't see much at all. The entire sky was just a green haze.  As it approached we decided the balcony wasnt the best spot so we went downstairs until it calmed down.  When we venture back upstairs, walls ceilings,  and floors were covered with pieces of leaves.  Not a single whole leaf, Just shredded bits, covering everything.   When we went outside to explore the damage we saw that our neighbours garage had been destroyed.  It seems like the tornado, which was small to begin with,  collapsed just short of our house.  
 ",null,0,cdngp45,1ri2zj,AskReddit,top_day,2
KneeDeepThought,"After the Tornado Warning blared over the TV and from the Civil Defense horns, not much happened. Mostly that's all the watches and warnings had been our whole lives, a whole lot of not much. Today was different. The first thing we noticed was the speed at which the world got dark. It was as if a charcoal blanket had been pulled over the whole town. Near pitch-blackness in the middle of the afternoon. We wanted to run around the house and turn the lights on, but mom and auntie said no. Then the sound came. A low, howling rumble like a far off train with a low-pitched horn. It got louder and louder. My cousins and I gravitated to the window even though we had been shooed away, and what we saw terrified us.

A funnel cloud was about a mile away across the fields, throwing debris skyward as its howling wind began rising to a shriek. My aunt bustled past us as we gaped out the window, took one look and screamed, ""INTO THE BATHROOM, NOW!"" Their house didn't have a basement, so all the kids jumped in the tub and my mom and aunt threw a twin size mattress over us, then held one over their heads as they crouched on the floor at our side. 

It was oddly quiet in the tub. There was no elbowing, no bickering, no juvenile humor. We were all terrified. We sat there in the dark for what felt like hours. No flashlights, no radio. Just a moaning wind that occasionally shrieked to the upper registers. Sometimes a scratching or a thud as some piece of debris was flung against the side of the house or went tumbling down the street. We knew we could be flying through the air next, but nobody wanted to joke about it. 

Finally, after what seemed like ages, the wind died down and disappeared and the Civil Defense horn sounded the all clear. The funnel cloud didn't get much more than a half mile away from us we think, but that was plenty close enough. We had dodged a bullet, but some of auntie's neighbors weren't so lucky. She packed up a few things and went out to survey the damage and help those who needed it while mom took care of the kids. Driving home later we saw framing timbers and roof shingles scattered like confetti across a few roads, along with tons of inflatable pools, yard tools, mailboxes, and anything else that might have been left outside. Overall it was a fairly small tornado. No one was killed, and only one or two houses were completely wrecked, but half a dozen or so had their roofs ripped off. 

I can't recall a single moment of my life when I felt more scared than when I saw that funnel and the danger I had been warned of all my life became immediate and real. In the face of such power our existence is very temporary and fragile.",null,0,cdnh587,1ri2zj,AskReddit,top_day,2
DkPhoenix,"I have been in a building that took damage three times in my life.  I'll tell you about the one I remember best, because I was an adult when it happened.

It was a mixed wood and brick apartment/condo setup, two stories, about 12 units.  I was watching TV, the weather reports here get pretty damn precise, tracking the progress of a storm block by block.  They were reporting that it was about 3/4 of a mile away when the cable went out.  That's close, but not scary close when you live in Tornado Alley.  I went and got my battery powered radio/CD player, and tuned in the audio from one of the local TV stations.  (This was back in the days before all digital TV signals, when you could do that.)  The funnel cloud was about 5 blocks away.  Then, the power went out.

Uh oh.

So, I grabbed my two cats, flung them into the bathroom, took said battery powered radio in, and shut the door.

I'm sure you've heard the sound of a tornado compared to a freight train.  There is that element to it, but there's also a shrieking banshee like metal on metal kind of sound, and thumps and cracks, when the debris hits something.  The whole building shook and popped and creaked, then, it got quiet.  Really quiet.  (Except for the piteous meowing coming from the bathtub.)  I opened the bathroom door, fully expecting to see daylight.  Instead, the power came back on.

I went outside to see if there was any damage.  Most of the open carport was gone, as well as the shingles from the roof, and several low wooden fences that hid the water and gas meters.  All the cars in the carport were still there and relatively undamaged, some had debris on top of them like strips of tar paper, sheetrock, insulation, pieces of wood and branches, etc.  There was also debris scattered around on the concrete.

There was a row of old frame houses across the street, not in perfect repair to begin with, and some of them fared much worse.  They had taken a more direct hit, too.  None of them were completely flattened, but some were missing their roofs entirely, and one had partially collapsed in front.  There was a medium sized oak tree uprooted and lying across the street, and several cars overturned.  The stop sign at the end of the street was gone.  There was lots more random debris lying around, same as in the parking lot, also some bricks, shredded tire rubber, broken glass, and twisted up pieces of metal from guttering and drainpipes.

This tornado was an EF3, and it was a ""hopper"", which means it didn't stay on the ground for the entire path.  The same one tore up a strip mall, completely flattened a church sanctuary, and wrecked a truck stop about 10-15 miles away from my building before it spent itself.

As an aside, my father lived about 3 blocks from that church that got flattened, and he slept through the whole thing, sirens and all.",null,0,cdnqdc3,1ri2zj,AskReddit,top_day,2

happahiro,"For me when I have to focus on some school work/work I need to finish up at home:

-Keep your long term goal in mind.  Sure it would be easy to put off studying or the report or cleaning, but it will just build upon itself, along with other things that I'll have to do, and I'll end up having even less time doing it later on.  Do it now at a leisurely pace or stress out about it later.

-Take some short breaks.  Try focusing for about half an hour then take about a ten minute break to do whatever you want.  TV, check reddit, facebook etc.

-Reward yourself for progress; if you have a lot of assignments, or lots of chores to do, it's nice to reward yourself with something small in between each of the tasks, this kind of goes along with the breaks in between working too, but as rewards some things I do are tea/soda/ a snack.  Pretty much food hahaha.

-Put on some music while you're doing work!  I like to hum to something while I'm working, it helps time go by faster and at least for me, listening to something I like while working makes any task more enjoyable

mrhymer,"1. General advice - When you are 28 you will look back on your 18 year old self and think he was a lovable idiot who thought he knew everything. When you are 38 you will look back on your 28 year old self and think he was a lovable idiot who thought he knew everything. This will repeat for every ten year period of your life. Don't take yourself too seriously.

2. Girls - the key to a healthy relationship is to stay separate people and only come together to enjoy each other. If you live with or marry a girl you need to have your own spaces in the home to go to. Your own TV and your own tech, etc. Split the household bills fairly. She buys shared groceries and you pay when you eat out. Live like roommates fuck like cheaters. 

3. Work - The goal is not to work for someone else as soon as you can achieve that. You need to get out of the being an employee business by age forty. You become much less valuable to corporate America at fifty. Train yourself to be an entrepreneur. Find your niche and start your own business. 

4. Money - Money is freedom. Debt sucks. Do not go into debt for anything other than business, house, and if you have to a car. If you need a couch then save the money for the couch, charge it and then pay off the credit card with the saved money that day. **Never** hold a monthly balance on a credit card. Have only two major credit cards. Buy gas and major purchases on the one with the best rewards. Buy groceries on the other card. Pay them both to zero each month. While you are young you can do without nice things more comfortably than you can when you are older. Live well beneath your means. Your goal should be to save as much as you possibly can up to 25% of your income. 25% sounds extreme and it is. The key is to start by saving 10% (more if you can) of your current salary. Have it removed from your pay before you get your hands on it. Once you adjust your life where you are putting away 10% then live that way for the next ten years. Increase your savings with each raise, promotion, and better job change. You will be the only 28 year old among your peers who can buy a new car with cash or pay 50% down on a modest house with a 7 year mortgage or invest $50k in starting a new business. 

5. Drinking - moderation. It's not fun to be the drunkest guy in the room. It is more fun to watch and post the video of the drunkest guy in the room and then remember everything enough to give him shit the next day. Also, you always want to be much less drunk than the girls. Take time off from drinking to make sure alcoholism does not fuck you in ass. One complete month every six months. If you cannot go a full month without drinking then get help. 

6. Drugs - Not worth it. 

7. Pets - You never want to be known as a cat guy. 

8. Porn - Porn and masturbation are what good men use to keep from cheating on the women they love. Don't be a cheater be a beater.",null,0,cdnge15,1ri27s,AskReddit,top_day,3

The second was [Elysium](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535108/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I understand that economic class disparity in the United States is certainly an important issue. If the issue can be simplified into a film for easy digestion by the masses, so be it. However, no matter the importance of the issue, *the movie must work as a movie, too.* Elysium did not.

For those who've played, Gwyn's soundtrack left a huge impression on me. Rather than some epic track, its just a mellow piano that's saddening, and symbolizes the dying ideals of an old, withering god.

Metal Gear Rising because its soundtrack reflects its style of play. Instead of stealth-orientated play like previous Metal Gear games, its fast paced and hack-and-slash, and the music reflects that by being fast paced as well. ",null,0,cdnhb3m,1ri1ql,AskReddit,top_day,1

TacoGoat,"My mom ran out of the house drunk as fuck (as usual) with a doritos bag (no idea why) and drove out somewhere for about an hour. My dad was just fed up of fighting with her over stupid shit and didn't want her to get into an accident. 

When she pulls her temper tandrums she usually goes to her parent's place so I had called them to warn them of her coming over drunk - apparently she didn't go there and my grandfather started screaming at my dad, blaming him for my mother's alcoholism. (My grandfather is a raging alcoholic too) 

My dad snapped (this was a year ago and my grandfather and father still don't talk to eachother) and screamed back, he hung up and just cried on my shoulder. It was so awkward, I can honestly say I do not care for my parents because they are both horrible people. This sounds heartless but they really are.

blackamaranth,"(continued from previous post)   
Rape, does happen. But, not so much out of sexual frustration. Rape is inside as it is outside, it's all about power. It's a way to humiliate and conquer a foe. There are plenty of ways to find willing participates for sexual activity.... And that's about all I need to say about that.
The guards? Yeah. There are some that are complete assholes and deserve to be in the cells more than they do in the guardposts. There are guards who REALLY get off on the power of having all these dangerous predators under their 'control' (which is an illusion anyway, if the inmates wanted to take over en-mass, the guards would have little chance of stopping them without killing most of them). They play the social game with the inmates. They take sides, and know when to turn a blind-eye. I have never SEEN any guard take a bribe of any kind, or do anything that couldn't be chalked up to being inattentive or stupid, but I know there has GOT to be a few that would cross that line. 
However, these are usually low level guards, and not in the majority. The majority of the guards are there to 'maintain the peace' they  keep their fingers on the pulse of the unit, feel out when tensions are getting high, and usually use psychology and socialization to try to quell any surges in violence before they happen. Most guards socialize with the inmates, but keep them at arms length. They are social, and express a removed concern for the lives and goings-on of those in the unit, but they never forget they are there to guard these guys. Like a zookeeper who befriends a tiger. They might be a-ok 80% of the time, but they never forget this tiger eats things like him. 
As far as One guy in control? That's not exactly true. At least not in the few facilities I have knowledge of. at any one time, one group/gang is more powerful than another, (and usually that is a rotating position) and the 'leader' could be considered the most powerful guy in the facility at that time, but there is no throne, no grand dictum that allows him to have anything done he wishes. There is always opposition. And his time at the top is fleeting and always under attack.   
Basically, it's a chaotic environment and under constant threat of violence. It's not like they show in the movies, but it's absolutely no picnic. Even beyond the threat of violence or violation of your person or property, having every aspect of your life, schedule, and future observed, scrutinized, and controlled by an institutional industry is enough to crush anyone's spirits in a relatively short period of time.    
It is as the kids say, ""Teh suck!"". Trust me, it's not something you EVER want to experience. So, mind your manners, do your taxes, don't steal, don't kill, don't fight, and don't drive drunk. Enjoy the freedom you have, Enjoy the life you have, and stay on the right-side of the law.    
Source: Was incarcerated twice for 2 short stints back in the 90's, and have 8 friends currently doing time whom I correspond with/visit on a regular/semi-regular basis.",null,0,cdngv60,1ri0y4,AskReddit,top_day,6
blackamaranth,"It actually depends on the state, and the classification of the facility. There are minimum security correctional centers (at least in 3 states that I can confirm because I've either been in one, or visited someone in one) that are less like prisons and more like halfway-houses with tall fences and guards. Those are pretty civilized, but are normally reserved for misdemeanor only offenders, and very, very low risk offenders awaiting trial. But, those are fewer and far-between.
The standard maximum security long-term 'Prisons' that you are most likely referring to, are as bad, or worse than you can imagine. The facilities don't look like they do in the movies, all dark, gothic, and in disrepair. They are build much like public schools only more secure, very well-lit with CFL Lights, hard concrete walls, ugly linoleum tile floors, double or triple pane safety glass with chicken wire inside, steel reinforced doors... You get the idea. The seating, tables and other furniture in the common areas is usually very specific for secure institutions. 
Now the social order is very much savage. If you put a couple hundred to a thousand hardened criminals with little no regard for right and wrong in the same building, it's obviously going to be intense. For the majority of the inmate population the only thing keeping them in line is the fear of the consequences. It is the minority that actually have a conscience and are actually trying to reform. Most of them carry on their criminal careers inside, and stick to the gang-style hierarchy. Different groups loyal to different creddos exist and are constant at 'war' with one another. Different facilities have differing levels of inmate violence, depending on how the administration handles it, and the capabilities of not getting caught. But, basically if you go in, you can expect to be caught up in some sort of violence (either as one of the perpetrators or one of the victims) within your first month. You can try to side-step the social 'game' and just keep your head down and live small and get out, but eventually, someone is going to try to use you, or suck you in for some reason. You better have a plan for when that happens and how you plan on getting out alive and in one piece.

Not to say it NEVER happens, but their quality of life is severely diminished if they get caught in sexual behavior with their fellow offenders (consensual or otherwise). Some of the punishments include being removed from general population and put in solitary confinement, being transferred to another prison in another part of the state (hours away from any family visits), etc.

For example, here's last year's party:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeLzbjd5HPg&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUg4gJ5xPUTwenHpFvbo5HCA

Originally it was canary yellow so the family called it the canary, but by the time it was given to me, I had tried (and failed) to do some body work on it and my brother had practiced his painting skills while restoring his blue mustang. So when I turned 16 and started driving it was canary yellow, rust brown, primer gray, and mustang blue. You knew it was me coming.

1. Leaking gas tank
2. Bad wheel bearings
3. No heat although the defroster would work

What I hated about it was that the woman who owned it before me was an older lady who drove it cross-country twice a year to visit family and couldn't afford to keep up with all the necessary maintenance. I tried my hardest to have most of its glaring issues repaired, but most of its problems just weren't worth the cost for what the car was worth due to its extremely high mileage.

It ended up dying a few months ago after the brakes just un-expectantly quit one morning as I was driving down the street from my house. I pulled over and turned off the engine for a while waiting for a tow, and lo and behold it wouldn't start up again after that. The repair shops in town all quoted in the area of $3000 - $5000 to fix it, and this was just for the necessary work to make it road worthy for a few more months.

CampusTour,"Well, in order to know whether or not it has failed, one has to ask...what is the objective?

The United States is one of the most capitalist nations on the planet, and it is also the richest and most powerful nation on the planet. 

The Soviet Union was its non-capitalist counterpart....

Communism (in the forms it was attempted) resulted in some spectacular failures.

Socialism is a mixed bag, and it seems like the more successful experiments with it involved injecting a very large dose of capitalism as well. 

",null,0,cdnf085,1rhykc,AskReddit,top_day,1
Skittlebrained,"Capitalism has not failed.  People have failed in implementing the definition of profit correctly in order to benefit the world.  Capitalism is (as defined by wikipedia) ""an economic system in which trade, industry and the means of production are controlled by private owners with the goal of making profits in a market economy.""

If everyone started to look at the world as one large complex organism rather than billions of people and millions of species of animals, we would see that capitalism is performing just as it should be, but the constraints of our definition of profit keep us from seeing that we are, as a world, not profiting from our actions.

When we consider profit, we are only focused on how much we, as single and separate individuals, can benefit (usually in $ form) from something.  When we take this view, we forget to include everything else in the world.  The only variables we care about in this view is My Value Gained and My Value Lost.  We usually fail to include Everyone Else's Value Gained and Everyone Else's Value Lost.

Let’s use these equations to define profit (I think we can agree that they make sense):

(My Profit)=(My Value Gained)-(My Value Lost)


(Everyone Else’s Profit)=(Everyone Else’s Value Gained)-(Everyone Else’s Value Lost)


(My Profit)+(Everyone Else’s Profit)=(World Profit)


(World Profit)= (My Value Gained)-(My Value Lost)+ (Everyone Else’s Value Gained)-(Everyone Else’s Value Lost)


You are part of the world and when the world benefits, so do you.  When the world is harmed, you are too, though it may be difficult to see because change on a global scale takes a very long amount of time to see.

The reason that it seems like the world is going to shit because of Capitalism is because most people choose to ignore some of these profit equations.  They only see their own and so they’re only concerned with their own profit.  

If a company’s profit for drilling in a certain area is $10 Billion, but the harm done to the environment is valued at $20 Billion, the overall World Profit will be -$10 Billion.  Most companies will be able to see this and not pursue drilling, but in the case that the company doesn’t care and wants to pursue drilling anyway, it is the role of governments to spot such instances and make sure that these companies do not pursue the drilling.

However, when personal greed comes into play and people forget about the big picture, it’s easy to see how a company might get away with pursuing drilling in the example above.  The company may pay off government officials to look the other way.  It can also pay lobbyists and PR teams to convince the public that the damage that will be done to the environment will be lower than $10 Billion.  In this case the World Profit will be negative and we will all suffer in the long run.

**TL;DR** Capitalism seems like it isn’t working because people aren’t looking at the world on a scale that is large enough.  They are only concerned with small scale things such as only themselves or only those immediately close to them.

LewisLewis,"Meditation. Find a silent, still place somewhere outdoors preferably. Sit cross legged and rest your arms comfortably, close your eyes and at first just focus on calm breathing. If you spend some time not thinking about anything in your life at all, just your stillness and calm breathe you will find yourself relaxed enough to seek out and understand almost anything this existence has to offer. This state of mind is not always as easy to achieve as you would think just reading about it, I make it all sound simple by just telling you. If, however, you practice... The potential to travel the entire universe within your free and unbiased mind becomes possible. 

The positive side effect of this is that in returning from your journey, you often realize (in your new found clarity) simple solutions to problems that were daunting you before hand. It isn't so much sitting down to contemplate your problems as it is just leaving them all behind as if it does not exist. When you do this, they becomebut grains of sand... easily sifted from your new perspective above the clouds. 

For now, just do the simplest of things, and focus only on your breathe and stillness. The rest will come in time. Hope that helped.

ReportPhotographer,"This will no doubt be buried, but for me I was 21, and it was a single moment during my first proper job very shortly after leaving university in 2010.

I was about four weeks into working as an exploration geologist in the Congo when I ended up at gun point along with my driver and another geologist.

The army had put up illegal checkpoints in the bush – a fairly common practice in that part of the world – on an a 200km access road our company had built to get in and out of the exploration area.  I remember us pulling up to it and smell of gin on the guard's breath when he stuck his head through my open window.

Next thing we're all dragged out of our Land Cruiser and pushed up against a small shack they'd made, with the muzzles of their G3s pressed into our backs. 

They raided our vehicle for anything they deemed ""illegal"". I lost my Nikon D3, and some company kit was also taken, and then laughing, they cracked us in the kidneys with the butts of their rifles. 

I snapped and started swearing at them in French. Then the muzzle was up against the right-side of my forehead.

It was right then, so vivid in my head when I recall it to friends closest to me. I was recklessly unafraid, practically blinded by anger.

And then it hit me. I was so very far away from my parents' farm in Scotland. 

Never had the line ""We're not in Kansas anymore Toto"" been more appropriate to me.

We'd talk about ex-partners and porn. We'd get hammered and go on pub crawls. We were all ""adults"". I started noticing something that was very unnerving at first. Weakness. Adults had weaknesses. They had moments of panic. They were immature. I realized that they didn't have everything figured out. I saw grown men cry, and awkward situations. One such situation was me and about a dozen coworkers out drinking. One of the Managers accidentally hit a female coworker in the mouth, drawing blood. Complete accident. He felt so horrible. I followed him outside and talked to him. He was torn up. I saw vulnerability. You don't think adults are vulnerable. I was trying to make him feel better. Me, a 19 year old.

My moment was actually a weekend. Three things happened that spurred my transformation into adulthood, the first on Friday, second on Saturday and the third happening on a Sunday, all in December, 2 years ago. 

1st, I got my first girlfriend. Asked her out after school and she said yes. I had finally grown a pair of balls and done the adult thing of taking the initiative. 

2nd, I helped out around the house because it needed doing, not because I was asked to. There were dust bunnies everywhere, so I vacuumed them up, and while I was at it, I might as well vacuum the rest of the place. Didn't realise the significance till I was finished. 

3rd, I comforted my mother about troubles in her life, where it had always been reversed till then. If I had needed a hug or someone to talk to, she was there. This was the first time I had willingly helped her out when she needed it. I wanted to go play video games, but I sat and held her hand till she felt better. Then I stayed and watched a romantic drama with her because it made her happy. 

It wasn't till the end of Sunday that I realised that I'd mentally made the transformation into adulthood. Felt kinda nice. ",null,14,cdnez0u,1rhxjs,AskReddit,top_day,31

I was preparing myself for the news that she passed away cause it just seemed like that was a very real possibility. I really didn't think her having only minor injuries was really a possibility. I figured that she'd most likely be pretty badly injured at the very least. It was a head on collision on the freeway, so both cars had to be going at least 60 mph. While I was waiting in the traffic caused by her accident, I started thinking about how her death would affect things. It made me realize really quickly how dependent I was on her. She put a roof over my head and food in my mouth. My dad would definitely help me still, but the whole experience made me realize that I needed to start breaking away and start supporting myself. At the time I was flunking a lot of classes and barely getting by in school. My mom actually ended up being ok in the end. She had a small cut on her head, a concussion, and some bad whiplash. She had to be cut out of the car and part of the frame was about an inch away from her throat. The other car just hit her car in exactly the right way for her to survive with minor injuries.

TruStory2426,"I've had a troubled past...and the one thing that's helped me get over it is distinguishing the difference between being a victim of circumstance or knowing that I'm making very poor decisions. My 15 year old nephew has a schizophrenic father, his mother abandoned him, and the only person he called mom (my mother) died recently. Now that's a fairly troubled past, but it's due to circumstance. I had a good mother and a decent father until I was 10 years old. I went to school and knew right from wrong. However, The street life really enticed me. I wanted to be a dope boy, I wanted cars, cash, and fast women...and I did whatever I could to be a part of it up until I was kicked out of college for possessing drugs and having a physical altercation with my academic advisor. Following college I had a string of dead end jobs, and just hung around all the wrong people. I ended up in trouble for stealing $30k from Rite Aid over the course of 2 months. Several times I found myself standing on the outside of a random door preparing to kick it in and steal everything that's not nailed down. Also with the mentality that if anyone is in here with a set of balls, they were gonna get shot and killed. I didn't give a fuck at all....for a brief period. Then one day I ended up with a pretty big time Drug dealer in my city. a close friend of mine worked with him and they both got arrested on Attempted murder charges...my friend was still locked up while this drug dealer was out on bond and on house arrest. I ended up running some errands for him. First stop was to pick up a brick of soft (kilogram of uncooked cocaine). on the ride from where I picked it up, back to the dealers house...I got pulled over...this was my first real interaction with Philly police at the time. it scared me shitless to know that I had drugs in my back seat. fortunately the cop let me off with a ticket for tinted windows. Scared the shit out of me....that very same day I'm helping this dealer set up a deal so he can get back on his feet...he tells me to go see a friend of his that's posted up in a parking lot not far from where we were. I go to the parking lot and approach the guys car...he doesn't know me at all...so when he rolled down the window he had a gun pointed right at my face and asked ""who da fuck is you?"" I simply told him that I had a phone and someone he knew was looking for him...he told the dealer that he would have shot me had I not mentioned his name...later that same evening the deal was to finally go down. He was going to trade the soft which was worth about $25k for 30lbs of weed which he could whole sale much faster and was worth about  $33k. The Jamaican guy agreed and he said he was coming over. The dealer hands me a gun and tells me to wait in the kitchen...if anything goes down come out and shoot'em...in my mind I knew I was going to shoot'em, but I was scared as hell. I'm in the kitchen in the dark looking onto the porch through the thin curtains. I see them talking and the gestures they're making are getting much more aggressive. I make sure I'm ready as I check the revolver one more time...then I start to panic...Although no punches were thrown I got so nervous that I was ready to just run out, aim and shoot...I hear footsteps coming down the stairs in the house...then the drug dealers 13 year old sister comes downstairs apparently to get something to eat...she turns on the light and see's a big black guy wearing all black standing in her kitchen with a gun....sweating...and breathing really hard only through his nose....that was me...The look on her face made me realize that this is NOT who I am and this is NOT how I was raised. She looked at me as if she had seen a monster. at this point my girlfriend was pregnant and I had already done so much dumb shit...the deal ended up NOT going down and the Jamaican guy left. as I was going home the dealer called me and said he's back at it tomorrow...at that moment I turned my life completely around. all in one day I had the fear of Jail, the fear of death, and the fear of being a murderer. I looked at myself as a monster and knew that this is no way to live. once my daughter was born I went back to school and got a degree and found a job.

I fucking love it, since we both hunt, we don't eat all the meat but what we don't eat we give to friends and whatnot.

When I go hunting, I don't go out hunting simply to ""shoot something"" or ""murder an animal"" as so many people so eloquently put it, I go hunting because there is nothing better in this world than being out in nature before sunrise and then watching the world wake up around you. 

Being out in the woods, I can forget about everything for a few hours. Just sitting in a tree stand, being a part of nature for the first half of the day is one of the best things on this planet. 

You really get an appreciation for nature once you go hunting, an extremely small population of hunters are the cock nuggets that go out to just shoot something. Fuck those people.

And helping keep the deer population in check is a bonus, the deer population in my area is so fucking ridiculous that if people didn't go out hunting they'd starve to death or get hit by cars- that is a lot more painful and brutal than a 12 gauge slug through the chest",null,1,cdnf01v,1rhx2k,AskReddit,top_day,4

lifeatmach_2,"My dog was given away, and I couldn't do anything about it. It was the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. 

I had her for about 7 years. The longest we had ever been apart was 6 months. I was lucky to have her near me wherever I was stationed because I have awesome friends. I went away on my first deployment, and she had to stay with my friends. I was told for weeks she would sit by the door at the same time, waiting for me to come home, and would cry when the door didn't open. She wasn't her usual self. I was told she would often lay near my box of clothes. Sometimes I would put a folded up piece of paper in my boot, so when i sent it home she could smell it. I guess she would and would be very happy about it.

But somehow, while I was gone, my mom got a hold of my friends, and my dog, claimed I told her she was 'allowed to have the dog'. My friends believed her. My mom took my dog to a shelter and gave her away. She did this because she was mad at me, and it was how she could hurt me. 

I feel bad because to a dog, their owner is their whole world, and one day I just didn't show up, and her world stopped. My dog is still probably no longer living, if she is she would be 12 now, but I still feel so guilty about it. I like to hope that she got adopted by a family, who gave her a better life than I did. Or maybe someone who was lonely that wanted a friend. 

But in reality since she was old, and went to a shelter, she probably didn't get adopted, and got put down. She probably spent the rest of her life, alone and scared, in a cage, confused about why she isn't loved. I didn't even get to say goodbye.

I feel more guilty about this than I do about anything else. I couldn't do anything about it, but I essentially let my best friend get given away and die. She was the best friend I could've asked for, and loved me in the most perfect way she could.

This was back in 1998, so he spoke to her on a second landline at his house, and she and I would chat on AOL. One night, she messaged and asked how I was. I replied, ""Not so great, but getting better."" She asked what was wrong and I said, ""Well, it's been pretty tough dealing with losing Patrick."" (Pat hadn't answered her calls in a few weeks by this point.) ""What do you mean, 'Since losing Patrick?'""   

""He was killed by a drunk driver a few weeks ago- I thought you knew that?"" ...Cue intense conversation with her being very upset and not knowing what to believe.   

Fast forward a few weeks and I'm at my first weekend in college. She pops up on AOL again and I pretend to be my sister so I could confirm that Patrick was dead.   

Pretty fucked up, right? Well, that's just the beginning.    

Fast forward to next summer and I'm home and decide to jump on AOL for the first time in forever (by now it was AIM, I believe). Sure enough, she's there and asks how I've been. Patrick had (in real life) just gotten married the week before, so I replied, ""Great! Patrick's wedding was beautiful!""
She understandably freaks out and doesn't believe me, saying ""Patrick's dead! I read a poem about him at school! I have a shoebox under my bed filled with memories of him! Our school dedicates prom week to him to remind people not to drive drunk!""   

I finally convince her that either she is mistaken or someone used my account to play a horrible joke on her. Turns out, she had a cousin they all thought was dead for years who randomly showed up a few months earlier. So, this is seriously fucking this poor girl's head up.   


Extremely fucked up, right? Well, just as I am signing off, I type, ""Just kidding- Patrick really is dead.""

Fast forward 7 years later, i'm 15 and she is 16 and nothing has changed at all, the only difference is our parents are divorced and we are both at my mothers house for a year. We both come home from school, she taunts me and fucks with me and finally she hit me unlike she ever hit me before, closed fist across the face while she was smiling. 

When you are punched in the face, one of two things happen. You fall, or you see red, I saw red. I punched her so fucking hard in the face, she fell back about 6 feet from the doorframe of my room to the doorframe of her room across the hall. 

She got up, started crying and shut the door. And she never, ever layed a fucking finger on me again.

TL;DR Cunty sister abused the shit out of me as a kid, she punched me one day after nearly a decade of torment and I uppercutted her in the face and she never fucked with me again. 

Edit: The most infuriating thing about her abuse was, after she did something to me and got away with it without getting in trouble, she would hide behind one of our parents and flash that Tom Hardy from Bronson smile. Oh my god, my blood boiled when she flashed that smile. For those that don't know the reference, here you go.

Fast forward: I go over to his house to buy a 20 sack. I brought some chick-fil-a (Robs favorite food) to combat the inevitable munchies. I get to his place, and my girlfriends car is there. I think ""what's going on here?"" and text her ""Hey, why are you at Rob's? No response. I go in with the food and hear LOUD rap music blaring, and what sounds like sex. I also notice on his kitchen counter, my girlfriends phone, and his laptop. The laptop is open to facebook with PM's from my girlfriend, calling me a ""chubby loser"" who isn't worth her time, and see the recently sent text from me on her phone. I go through the messages, and they've been fucking behind my back for a few months. I don't get angry very often, but when I do I go on a blind fucking rampage. Long story short, I ran over the phone and the laptop in my jeep, put them back in place, and leave the chick fil a I bought for him. I never said anything, but he never talked to me again, we saw each other at a restaurant once, and exchanged glares. They stopped seeing each other and my new ex tried to get back with me, but I denied having seen or done anything. All I said to her was that I needed some space.  
EDIT: Honestly, I probably was a bit chill on my reaction, but FUCK getting him busted dude. That's way beyond a bitch move and how the fuck would I have gotten a new connection when they put two and two together and realized I ratted him out? And I didn't leave ALL the chick fil a. Just his. But I took his chick-fil-a sauce, so I guess you could say I was a mildly nefarious. ",null,143,cdnfot9,1rhwa8,AskReddit,top_day,724
Cynnimon,"When I was two my mom found a litter of kittens by the side of the road that looked like they were starving. Mama kitty had probably gotten hit by a car. So she took all the kittens home in a box, and proceeded to call the local animal shelter to come swing by and get them.

While she was on the phone, I apparently grabbed one of the kittens and ran behind the couch. After a while my mom noticed I was gone and started looking for me. Ended up finding me behind the couch strangling the cat. She got it from me and thankfully it was still alive, but by the time the animal shelter folks had come by it had passed away.

I don't know if I was just playing with in inappropriately, didn't understand, or was being a little 2 year old shit, but my mother just loves to bring up the fact that her daughter who is now a massive cat lover once killed a kitten. :'( So yea.

I was sat on a beach on my 23rd birthday and got stung (fully stuck into my leg) by a hypodermic needle, found quite a few of them that day on the beach.

Didn't think much of it, but mentioned it to a friend, who happens to be a Nurse. I was told to go to hospital and have a HIV Test, and get Hep-B injections.  The Dr's told me it was moderate risk, as the beach is near to a regular spot for Heroin abusers, and I had to wait a month for another blood test and the 2nd Hep-B injection.

In that time, I cheated on my girlfriend of 3 years with my best mates sister (unprotected) and continued having unprotected sex with girlfriend. 

Turns out I was HIV Negative and didn't have Hep-B.  But before I had the results I was in a pretty severe depression because of what I did.

pics-or-didnt-happen,"Here comes this story again.

My best friend from childhood had never had a real girlfriend. He was kinda the ""sidekick"" guy. He always saw me and his other buddies with girls and I think it really bothered him that because he wasn't the most attractive guy in the world, he couldn't find anyone to love. Biggest heart you've ever seen, huge teddy bear character who has literally given me the shirt off his back and saved my life more than once. Terrific friend.

Fast forward to a few years ago. Buddy finally meets a (really cute, sexy) girl and they hook up. He's esctatically happy. She cleans him up good, he finally cuts his hair and buys clothes that don't have holes in them. THe whole ""relationship"" thing lifts him out of what was growing to be a deep depression. Everyone is really happy for him.

Sooooo.... This girlfriend of his starts hitting on me. Uh-oh.

What do I do? Do I tell him and ruin this thing for him? Do I tell her she needs to have more respect for buddy because he's a great guy and really cares about her? Do I GTFO and keep a 5 mile distance between myself and the situation? No. What do I do? I go and fuck her. Repeatedly. For months. He of course finds out. So does my girlfriend of 5 years. Somehow, both relationships stayed intact. The friendship, however became impossible. I moved across the country for three years for work and that was that.

The last time I posted this story, we hadn't yet spoken. I moved home a couple of years ago. I learned that since I'd left, he has caught her cheating several times and finally left her when, on the eve of his leaving for Africa for six weeks, at his own going away party, in his own house, he caught her having a threesome in the back room. That's what it took for him to finally realize the girl is a scummy cunt.

Since then we've managed to rebuild the friendship to a certain point. One thing is for sure, we'll never let a woman get between us again. The guy is still hurting, though, and I'm sure (though he hasn't mentioned it) that it brings back some of what he must have felt towards me all those years ago.

Anyways, that's the worst thing I've ever done. That and I once stabbed a guy over drugs (no real story there).",null,107,cdnffae,1rhwa8,AskReddit,top_day,309

I was super late for a flight from toronto to new york. Like I didn't make it to the line at the counter to check in until the flight was already boarding. It was set to take off in half an hour and I hadn't even been through customs yet.

So I'm waiting in line and trying to think of a way I can either be rushed onto the plane or get put on a new flight without getting charged extra. So I put a certain tone to my voice and made it to the desk.

""Hi! I'm going to New York!"" I said. They asked which airport and I had honestly forgot whether I was flying into JFK or LaGuardia so I used that to my advantage. I pulled my hair back as if I was stressing out and said ""Ummm...JFK or LaGuardia, one of those. I...I need to go to New York""

The guy then tells me what I already know. ""That flight's boarding right now."" So I ask him ""Am I gonna make it?"" with a really hopeful expression on my face. He says he doesn't think so.

""Oh no. Oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no!"" I say while rubbing my hands on my face ""I...I need to go to New York!""

The guy says everything will be okay, he's putting me on the next flight. This one's better anyway because there's no stops!

I thank him, cross into customs and drop the voice. Then I notice there are no pens to fill out the paperwork so i have to go BACK and ask for a pen while using that voice tone. He gives me a pen and I fill the information out.

The flight I was put on was full. It's possible someone was bumped for me, I know some standby people didn't make it on.

I've since flown Air Canada a few times and I once heard someone remark to the other people at the desk while looking at my ticket info that I'm ""socially unaware""

I'm glad I made the flight but I've worked with a lot of special needs and inclusion children in camp. I feel guilty that I acted in a way that people associate with people who have mental handicaps for my own gains.

Something_Funny_,"Last summer i got suckered into taking a job selling Kirby vacuums out of a van. Me and two others drove way the christ to northern BC and set up shop in the shittiest hotel we could find, and the office blanket-called the whole town telling them they'd won free carpet cleanings. When we got there we really did clean it for free..but a 60 page script designed to leave the $2000 machine there was involved. Anyway my boss was a 26 year old girl who was hardcore as fuck. Always had an ounce of weed on her, had her jaw broken in Ontario, hitchhiked to BC, didn't have anywhere to live in town before she got this job. Crazy. So between shows we're smoking a joint and talking. Eventually the other girl gets back and we all chill and figure out where our shows are going to be.

Mine is way the hell out in the bush away from the town, it takes like 25 minutes for us to get there. I know that it's going to take them ages to just get to their shows and start, so i'm going to be here for a while. The first part of the show is ""Make Friends"". Before the kirby comes out of the box you gotta get their guards down and be friendlylike. So there's me, a 21 year old, white, slighty stoned kid on a Native Reserve, and the client is an elderly woman. I start in with the friend making, she's pretty reserved and not opening up much. I compliment her home and we go back and forth and sit down. I know i have to stretch this as long as possible. For 45 minutes to an hour we talk and I get her to open up about the town, her life. She's sort of racist. Mentions something offhand about the white family or white people ruining things. Cough. Eventually she starts telling me about her church and I nod politely. 

""Oh you're christian?""
I am not.
""Yeah, i am.""
""Oh that's lovely, what's the name of your church?""
""*Hometown name* United Church""
""Ohhh that's so excellent""

After this she became significantly more comfortable and told me about how her husband had passed away years ago, and she was afraid to go outside. She just stayed cooped up all day and had no family or friends to come visit her. She was looking very forlorn. Then she dropped the bomb on me.

""I would have killed myself...but i would never meet him in heaven.""

Hooooly fuck. At this point I awkwardly offer to give her a hug. We stand and proceed to embrace in her kitchen. She holds onto me slightly as i go to pull away so i hug her longer. 

After that I proceeded to do the show, show her how it worked and came apart and how it cleaned carpets and hardwood. How it could vacuum her furniture. I called the office to ""ask"" how much they were going to give me for her tradein. I showed her the price+200 and and showed her how we were taking 200 off for her tradein. Then I asked her if she wanted to get started on the paperwork. She gave me a small nod and we filled it out and I left it there. I was praised for it and made $300 or so. 

This has always struck me as the shittiest thing I've ever done. Completely conscious of what I was doing I got this woman to open up to me and then exploited it to sell her an overpriced vacuum with money she probably couldn't really spare. I really hope she returned it. 

I wonder if she remembers me.

I decided I should stop loaning money but a few of these people just kept bugging me. So I started paying people to clean my house or mow my lawn, but many of these people were unreliable and either would not do the work or would do a crappy job and still expect pay.

I got fed up and one day one of the most unreliable guys shows up hangs out for a bit then asks for a two hundred dollar loan. I was about to tell him no, but for some reason I say ""sure but you have to suck my dick"". He thinks I am joking laughs then realizes I am not joking and he leaves. Two days later he returns says he needs the money and does it. I have never seen anyone look so defeated. Long story short over the next three years I end up ""loaning"" money to fifteen people who were once my friends, most of then several times. The power trip I got off of it lead me to do some things to people that I don't even like thinking about. It finally stopped when I moved to a new city and cut off contact to all of these people.

O_is_for_Olive,"Oh, God.  Okay, this is long.  Serious, and funny in a terrible way, but long.  

So, I came home from college one summer, and was staying with my parents.  They went on a trip for a few weeks, leaving me home to watch their house, and my younger sister.  Obviously, I decided the perfect plan would be to throw a party, because College and stuff.

To my credit, I honestly (honestly!) wasn't planning on holding some massive kegger; I was always the good girl, never in trouble, so I just invited a bunch of my female high school friends for the evening. Like, 15 people.  But, of course, this turns into one girl bringing her boyfriend, and then *he's* bringing *his* friend, and then another girl gets off her job at J. Crew and decides to invite the entire shift of male Abercrombie &amp; Fitch employees who were working next door, and then THEY showed up in, like, a cloud of Woods cologne, and needless to say, it was *on.*

And, really, it actually wasn't all that bad; nothing was broken, most people just swam in the pool and hung out outside, and put their trash in trashcans and generally acted like humans.  But I'd made one mistake: I'd decided that I didn't care if people smoked in the house.  And so the next day, while I'm wandering through, straightening up, I walk into the den and discover a quarter-sized cigarette burn, just a big old hole, riiiiight there in the middle of my parents' custom rug.  Fuck.

Mom and Dad were still gone for another week, so I went into Emergency Ass Covering mode.  I called a carpet repair place to ask about getting it patched; they sent someone out, who said that the way the rug was woven meant it would require a special, maaaagical patch, blah blah blah, something to the tune of $2000.  (In retrospect, it's entirely possible that the guy was bullshitting the terrified young girl with eyes the size of dinner plates who'd burned a hole in her parents' fancy ass carpet, but that didn't occur to me at the time.)  So, fixing the thing was out.  But I wasn't ready to admit defeat.  And that's when I came up with Plan B, which -- to this day -- remains the most manipulative, diabolical thing I have ever done in my life.  And I'm a lawyer.  This is saying something.

I...I called Grandma.  My 80-something year old grandmother, who lived in an assisted living place right around the corner from our house.  Grandma had her own condo there, and I'd swing by at least once a week or so, to hang out and watch TV.  My family also picked Grandma up every Sunday night to take her out for steak, cheesecake, and champagne (did this for, like, fourteen years.  Every Sunday.  Grandma had standards). 

Now, given how much we saw of her, you might think that Grandma was some sweet little old lady who baked cookies and loved her grandchildren; that is not accurate.  I mean, I'm sure she *loved* us, kind of, but Grandma was, in fact, a hard drinking, shit-talking, sports-obsessed bitch.  Grandma was *awesome,* obviously, but Grandma did not give a fuuuuuuuck.  And, like I said, she loved us (...kind of), but mostly she loved us when we were giving her steak and champagne.  If we tried talking when the Lakers were on, however, she'd throw something at our heads.  Grandma kicked ass.

And Grandma also chain smoked.  Constantly.  You can maybe see where this is going.

Soooo, I called Grandma, and said that since Mom and Dad were gone, I'd love to cook her an extra dinner that week.  She agreed, so I went and picked her up.  First I wrangled her massive wheelchair into my trunk while she hollered at me, all ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  YOU'LL BREAK IT!  YOU NEED A BOYFRIEND TO HELP YOU!  I HATE YOUR COAT!""  

I drove her to my parents' house, while she kept hollering at me.  ""YOU DRIVE TOO SLOW!  I NEED A LIGHTER!  ARE YOU COOKING DINNER?  YOUR FATHER TAKES THE OTHER ROAD!"" 

Got her there and unloaded her from the car.  While she hollered at me.  ""WHAT ARE YOU COOKING?  I DON'T LIKE THAT.  WHERE ARE THE DOGS?  I HATE THE DOGS! TURN ON THE GAME!""

I rolled her into the den, in front of the TV.  I set a tray table in front of her.  And I got her the ashtray.  ""I NEED ANOTHER LIGHTER!  IT'S TOO BRIGHT IN HERE!  WHY DOES YOUR SISTER KEEP SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO HELL?""

Etc.

So, I cooked and served her dinner, we watched the game, and then I started cleaning up. And then: time for master plan.  

I had my sister (God, my poor sister) take the handles of Grandma's wheelchair and start rolling her out to the car, while meanwhile, I ran back into the den to grab her purse.  And, while I was in the den -- and out of their sight -- I ""accidentally"" ""dropped"" the ashtray on the rug.  I made some sort of ""Oh, no!"" noise, for authenticity's sake, and ran into the kitchen to get towels, or...I don't know, Windex (?);  whatever you clean a burning rug with, I guess.  And then I drove Grandma home, while she hollered some more.  ""YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WITH ASHTRAYS!  ARE YOU GOING THE LONG WAY?  I DON'T LIKE YOUR BOOTS.  I NEED A LIGHTER!""  

Of course, when Mom and Dad called, I put on a sad voice, and explained that I'd *tried* to do a good thing by bringing Grandma over for dinner, because I was afraid she might be lonely, but then, CLUMSY ME, I'd knocked over her ashtray while cleaning up, and burned just the *biggest* hole in the rug, and I feel *so* bad and I am *so* sorry and I'll *pay* for it, and please forgive me because I am clearly a terrible, terrible person.

And, of course, they were like, ""Awww!  You brought grandma over for dinner!  Don't worry about the rug, perfect child!  Have some money!"" 

And everyone lived happily ever after.  Until I told that story at her wake, I guess.

TroubledVulcan,"Neither the government nor Congress are interested in stopping the surveillance. Yes there are senators who are publicly against it. But so far it's clear that their objective is to better conceal their surveillance programs and prevent new Snowdens from popping up. They will fail again because their programs will always be as secure as their weakest link: man.

And the truth is, surveillance was always there. A century ago they were reading telegrams coming and going from the US. They go with the technology available at the time. You think we have it bad now. Think how bad it will be in the future. If we can manage to have sensors reading brainwaves, the Thought Police can and will be implemented.

What I find shocking is that people are surprised by the Snowden revelations. We know the technology that makes it possible has been around for years.

Nothing will happen because *it's to protect the homeland*.


Now what about censorship? Technically it's not happening in the US because the First Amendment prevails. But the ICE has already demonstrated they can and do takeover web domain names. All they need to do it again is another excuse, another law. And people will once again protest online but nothing will be done in real life.

Cykuta,"Yes, I have. It worked out very badly. Wall of text below.

I was in a very bad place, self-esteem wise, and I honestly did not believe I deserved anyone ""better than myself."" And I thought I was a complete loser that wasn't worth shit (doesn't matter why.)

I got involved with a guy who was a friend of a friend. This mutual friend of ours was (is) a wonderful person and I think I projected some of his traits onto his friend - I thought that X would not be friends with someone who wasn't worth it, so to speak. So I was more trusting than I would have been otherwise, too.

Anyway, this guy, we'll call him Y, was a bit younger than me, which in itself is not a problem. He was what in the US is called ""high school dropout"" I believe, working some telemarketing job and trying to catch up with that education in one of those schools for adults, whatever that's called. This was also not a problem in and of itself, as I am not a judgmental person. But he was also very lax about his clothes, and I don't mean their look but their cleanliness and overall wear. Other than our mutual friend, he used to hang around similar losers - guys getting by on selling pot, or on various forms of welfare or charitable grandparents. He had very bad black heads which he refused to treat and which, up close, made his face *smell* badly. But he was likable, fun and treated me well, so at first I didn't even feel like I've ""lowered my standards.""

Then it got worse. He'd work during the week, and every two weekends he was in school. So we saw each other once every two weekends. On these occasions, we would only meet at my place - never went anywhere together. He refused to see my friends and never made it possible for me to meet his (I found out about who they were when I *insisted* to meet a few, which led to quarrels). He would never let me see him at his place, even though he'd sometimes say that friends visited him and stayed for the night - but I somehow couldn't. On the weekends, he'd be very late and ""very tired"" (of course, work, school, the bus trip - I believed him) and he'd usually eat with me and go to sleep. He showered because I made him, as I refuse to let un-showered people anywhere near my bed. If I hadn't, he wouldn't shower. Our actual quality time was non-existent, sex was very bad too. Still, he insisted he loved me and like I said, he was likable and I believed a fit partner for a loser like me. Mostly I was just ecstatic to be ""loved"", I guess, which is very pathetic.

Still, I got impatient with always putting up with this shit and started to expect something back - which only meant he'd come by even later and even rarer. He started to claim he had no money to call or text, but when at my place, he'd text his pot-buddies (which is perfectly ok - but not when you claim to have lost use of your phone.) Things went downhill from there, but I was still prepared to be understanding - us losers need to stick together and all.

But when I found out he'd actually been skipping that school, that he put zero effort into it (while dodging me because school) and would actually not pass the semester, I was *pissed.* I confronted him, he mewled about learned helplessness he got because his parents quarreled a lot before the divorce which was his default answer for everything and by that time carried little weight for me.

The sordid tale goes on for a bit, but I think I'll stop there. I think his issues were legitimate, but if he refused to be sensible about them, I see no reason why I should. **The important lesson here, I think, is that I ""lowered my standards"" not because I genuinely saw an error in them or met someone who made me challenge my usual approach or whatever, but as a symptom of my own problems.** And that's bad.

coratel,"I live in Osaka, Japan and often use the subway to go to work in the morning. One day, when I was waiting for the train, I noticed a homeless man standing in a corner of the subway station, muttering to himself as people passed by. He was holding out a cup and seemed to be begging for spare change. A fat woman passed by the homeless man and I distinctly heard him say, “Pig.” Wow, I thought to myself. This homeless man is insulting people and he still expects them to give him money? Then a tall businessman went by and the homeless guy muttered, “Human.” Human? I can’t argue with that. Obviously, he was human. The next day, I arrived early at the subway station and had some time to kill, so I decided to stand close to the homeless man and listen to his strange mutterings. 


A thin, haggard-looking man passed in front of him and I heard the homeless guy mutter, “Cow.” Cow? I thought. The man was much too skinny to be a cow. He looked more like a turkey or a chicken to me. A minute or so later, a fat man went by and the homeless man said, “Potato.” Potato? I was under the impression that he called all fat people “Pig”. 


That day, at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about the homeless man and his puzzling behavior. I kept trying to find some logic or pattern in what he was muttering. Perhaps he has some kind of psychic ability, I thought. Maybe he knows what these people were in a previous life. In Japan, many people believe in reincarnation. I observed the homeless man many times and began to think my theory was right. I often heard him calling people things like “Rabbit” or “Onion” or “Sheep” or “Tomato”. 

One day, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask him what was going on. As I walked up to him, he looked at me and said “Bread.” I tossed some money into his cup and asked him if he had some kind of psychic ability. The homeless man smiled and said, “Yes, indeed. I do have a psychic ability. It is an ability I obtained years ago. But it is not what you might expect. I can’t tell the future or read minds or anything like that.” “Then what is your ability?” I asked eagerly. “The ability is merely to know the last thing somebody ate.” he said. 

I laughed because I realized he was right. He said “Bread.” The last thing I had eaten for breakfast that day was toast. I walked away shaking my head. Of all the psychic abilities someone could have, that one must be the most useless.",null,58,cdnh4w1,1rhvun,AskReddit,top_day,345

alloftheproblems,"**David Bowie Statue**

A few years ago, a mother and father decided they needed a break, so they wanted to head out for a night on the town. They called their most trusted babysitter. When the babysitter arrived, the two children were already fast asleep in bed. So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later that night, the babysitter got bored and went to watch TV, but she couldn’t watch it downstairs because they did not have cable downstairs (the parents didn’t want children watching too much garbage).

So, she called them and asked them if she could watch cable in the parent’s room. Of course, the parents said it was okay, but the babysitter had one final request… she asked if she could cover up the David Bowie statue outside the bedroom window with a blanket or cloth, at the very least close the blinds, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father who was talking to the babysitter at the time said, “Take the children and get out of the house… we will call the police. We do not have a David Bowie statue.”

All of a sudden an electric guitar cut through the air. “KEEP YOUR ‘LECTRIC EYES ON ME BABE!” howled a voice from outside. The babysitter dropped the phone and ran to the window. “David Fucking Bowie!” she screamed, watching the statue as it came to life, shredding chords on its electric guitar. “Put your ray gun to my heeeeeead!” The babysitter ran the children outside where they watched an impromptu Bowie concert that was so awesome that afterwards the children had sweet dreams forever more and the babysitter was given a bonus for her efforts.",null,12,cdneloo,1rhvun,AskReddit,top_day,64

Commander_Shepard_,"###ED EDD EDDY COPYPASTA

“We hadn’t always been here. But the neighborhood has. Even before it was a neighborhood on earth this one had been here. Here for those that would be lost on those cursed grounds, here for those who would die long before their real life ever truly began, here for those who never really wanted to grow up. We come from different times and we come from different lives, but one thing remains true of all of us. We lived on the earthly realm of the neighborhood at some point in our lives and died long before our time was supposed to come. We don’t remember much of our lives in the cul-de-sac since the last member of our group joined us and certainly we won’t remember now when the next spirit comes, but here is what we do know:

Rolf was the first to come here. Unlike most of us he was born in far off lands and even in the afterlife hasn’t lost the touch of his old world upbringing. He lived in the neighborhood before it was developed. The son of a shepherd, he and the rest of his family came to start a farm on the lands that would soon turn into the place we would all eventually reside in. He died in 1903. While tending to the family’s animals, the bull broke loose from its pen and in Rolf’s efforts to stop the beast he was trampled to death. That is why even though he brought many of his family’s livestock with him in spirit he chose not to bring the cattle along. He continues to go about the farms business on a daily basis, but is more than happy to occasionally neglect them to play with the other children of the neighborhood.

Jonny was always the lonely child. In fact Rolf actually became his first human friend ever when he came to the cul-de-sac after his death. His parents moved onto the grounds of Rolf’s former farm not long after his death. With no other children around and no fieldwork to take up his time as it did Rolf’s Jonny drew into his own mind to a great extent. From the Plank was born. Together they wandered about the country side climbing trees and getting themselves in trouble. Sadly this didn’t last forever as a few years later Jonny became bedridden with illness. In 1922 he died after a long battle with tuberculosis. He saw his imaginary friend plank standing by him to his last breath. Even now in the afterlife without the countryside to play in Jonny still wastes much of his time frolicking through the backyards and streets.

Eddy was the next to come. Eddy was born in New York City but moved to the neighborhood in 1932, just as the Great Depression was hitting full swing. The neighborhood while still different was beginning to take form from the fields of its past as families moved in and split up the lands that had once belonged to Rolf’s family. Always a schemer, Eddy looked to do anything to bring some comfort to his very bare family life even if it cost him the friendship of others. Eddy died in 1939 after one of his grand plans to swindle a sap backfired. He drowned trying to cross the local river after trying to run away from the angry kids that he had tried to deceive. Even in the afterlife he keeps chasing after the almighty dollar.

Sarah and Ed came together not too long after that. By the late 40’s the cul-de-sac had already nearly taken its final form as one of the preplanned developments that became popular in the post war era. As brother and sister growing up in the chaos of World War II, they both had various ways of escaping their lives as children of a dead GI and a working mother. Sarah became enraged and controlling as she sought to make sure that everyone around her knew that she was in charge, all in an attempt to copy off of her view of the hustle and bustle of her often working mother. Ed on the other hand went about it in a different way. He just shut it out entirely, in fact he shut out nearly everyone and everything in the world entirely becoming what appeared to be a complete idiot. Ed chose instead to become completely involved in the monster movies and comic books that began to pop up after the war had ended. It wasn’t too long after this that, in 1953, Ed and Sarah died in a car wreck as their mother was taking them to visit their grandparents.

Nazz came a time after the brother and sister. Nazz was a flower child, born to a pair of hippies turned establishment in the late 60’s. She was a naturally beautiful girl that had always had a way with boys and men alike. She lived life on a whim and would often go about flirting and playing without any intentions. She died in possibly the most horrible way of any children in the neighborhood. In the summer of ’79 a serial killer, who had broken out of a local asylum, had slipped into her house in the dead of night and raped and killed her along with her entire family. In the trauma of these events she in a way similar to Ed shut out the world entirely and forgot of her parents and siblings, which is why in the afterlife she doesn’t ever receive demands from the non-existent parents unlike many of the others. This gives her much more time to lounge around and party as she often does.

It didn’t take too long before Edd joined the rest of the neighborhood. He was the child of two highly controlling professionals in the age of greed that, despite their constant absence, dominated his life. As such Edd became quite the intellectual and a rather meek and shy figure. Always the curious type, he loved to experiment when given the time away from school and the constant chores of his parents. This would lead to his untimely demise in 1986, as a gas leak combined with a Bunsen burner from one of his experiments tore him and his house to pieces. Being the timid and subservient type, between various misadventures, Edd continued to follow the written orders of his parents long after his death.

Kevin was the next to join the group. He was born to the day of Edd’s death and is in many ways his polar opposite. Kevin came from a broken home and developed a bold personality. In life he was the cynical and angry and took it out on many of the other children. His abusive father would rarely pay him any attention in life and would end up bringing about the end of it. In a drunken rage his father beat him after Kevin attempted to stand up to him. He died on the way to the hospital in the winter of 1999. His father spent the rest of his life in prison. In the afterlife Kevin changed his perception to the opposite of what his life really was, with a distant father who would shower him with gifts, however he continued to maintain his bullying even in death.

Jimmy was the last to come to the cul-de-sac. He died in 2000 not long after moving into the house that Kevin’s father had once lived in. He had had leukemia since he was barely old enough to walk. As such, he was always a very sickly child and due to his over protective parents he never really got to be around other children. He lived his days out in a small bedroom completely neglected by the outside world. Jimmy lingered for quite some time in a state of near death, but in the end finally caved into the suffering of his life long illness.

The Kanker sisters were different from any other denizens of the cul-de-sac. They were never of the earthly plane of existence. Instead they are the children of demons not too dissimilar from the succubae of human lore. They seem to possess abilities impossible by the standards of the others, such as the ability to appear nearly anywhere instantly. They were sent from hell to torment the already tortured souls of the neighborhood. Surprisingly they are attracted to the Eds for unknown reasons, although it is speculated that they are the weakest willed members of the neighborhood and are seen as easy targets by them. Despite that they are universally loathed and often feared by everyone including the Eds.”",null,4,cdnnjlg,1rhvun,AskReddit,top_day,24

We've had these discussions before, and they're both extremely supportive, and the conversations always end well, helping me make decisions that ultimately end up for the better, such as moving back home, transferring schools, pinpointing errors in my study habits, realizing that maybe engineering isn't for me, ect. But every time I think about it, I'm scared that I've disappointed them, and somehow failed them for all of their sacrifices and effort that they've spent on me. The worst it's even I tell them that I feel like a complete fuck-up, and a failure, and they tell me that they don't feel that way at all. I know that they really do mean it, as we all love each other as a family, and we're very happy living with each other, but I always get a voice in the deepest party of my head telling me that they're only lying to make me feel better, and to cover up the fact that their son is worthless, regardless of all of my other achievements. 

It always causes me to wait till the last possible moment to bring up the issue, which always makes things worse, as, with nearly everything in college, time is always running out, causing more stress, and fraying my nerves even more than necessary. 

It's an irrational, silly fear, but one that has crippled me multiple times to the point where I've dreaded getting phone calls from anyone, and resolved to just leaving my phone and computer off just on the off chance that they call just to say hi.

- Has no respect for personal space. Is constantly *sneaking* up behind me at my desk and reading over my shoulder until I notice the smell. Listens to my personal conversations from across the room and chimes in.

- Always comes up with something to say in meetings, no matter how irrelevant just so he can hear himself speak.

- Got my number from the directory and calls me at home on weekends to ask work questions instead of calling the boss.

- Knows nothing but speaks with authority on every subject. Never shuts up.

- Spits when he talks.

- Is a close talker.

- Touches my computer screen/mouse with his greasy fingers.

- Orders food twice a day (he has money to waste because he lives alone with his grandmother and she pays all the bills).

- Plays video games between calls, gets mad and slams his keyboard.

- Makes awkward/inappropriate jokes and follows them up with his own brand of desperate laughter.

- He is absolutely impervious to social queues (like if people step back when he close-talks, he will keep stepping forward until he has them backed into a corner).

- Assumes everyone cares about video games when in fact, nobody around here does. If you haven't heard of the game, he will tell you all about it for the rest of the day (right down to how he likes to customize his controls).

TroubledVulcan,"First, you have to understand that the case was argued in Texas, and Texas is notoriously patent-friendly. Every patent-troll has a fictitious office in that state so they have the legal right to sue in Texas.

Second, patent trolling is legal because it is simply not made illegal by the law, because no one foresaw this kind of business coming. Now Congress has two bills going that could put an end to it but they still need to agree on those bills contents.

Patent trolling started with software patents, which came to existence in a court of law more than 20 years ago when a court validated a software-based patent. Since then, every software company submitted as many software patents as they could. Not necessarily to sue everyone else but to protect themselves.

Then came people who saw the opportunity to use patents to deliberately blackmail you because you are infringing on their patents, knowingly or not.

Rob_G,"In high school, I worked at a local restaurant on Long Island. I remember one day I was taking this table, two older couples, one of the men called me over and said something like, “Son,” because all old people do stuff like that, call any young person son, he was like, “Son, are you a good student? Do you take any science classes?”

And I’m so full of it, and I know that I’m full of it, it’s something that I’m constantly trying to work on, not acting like I know everything. But this was something like fifteen years ago, I wasn’t working on anything back then, so I shot back an immediate, “Of course I take science classes, and yes, I’m a great student.”

So this guy said, “Great, maybe you could help settle an argument we’re having. How come you can’t see the moon during the day?” And I don’t know, I couldn’t think of anything, nothing close to an answer anyway, but I wanted my response to be instantaneous, like not only am I a good student, but I’m hyper-intelligent, like I don’t even need to fully listen to your question before I start rattling off some ridiculous scientific-sounding explanation.

And that’s exactly what I did, I made up some nonsense about particles in the air being refracted by sunlight, like that’s why we can’t see the stars either, because everything’s blue, and I just kept going on and on, talking and talking for what had to have been two solid minutes. I stopped, I looked around at these four adults making eye contact with me, I took a breath and thought, OK, that sounded like a knowledgeable answer, maybe they bought it.

“Great, thanks,” the man said and went back to his chef salad or whatever it was he was eating. And I walked away, sort of confused by my own rambling answer, but weirdly self-satisfied, like, OK, even if I didn’t exactly know what I was talking about there, at least I played the role of the smart kid, at least I looked like I knew what I was talking about.

But then like a week later this sudden realization flooded my brain: of course you can see the moon during the day. It’s there all the time, you’ll be staring at the blue sky and you’ll notice the moon, right there. Jesus, what the hell was all of that baloney about particles and refraction? Why couldn’t this thought have been available when I needed it, at the table? I could have casually answered, “What are you talking about? You can see the moon during the day. More iced tea?”

And this weird interaction, it’s haunted me ever since. Not a month goes by where I don’t picture myself as this wannabe know-it-all, a guy who, when presented with a problem, with a question that I’m not prepared to answer, instead of being humble, instead of looking upon this as an opportunity to be teachable, to learn something new, I’d rather just throw a string of words together to keep alive the illusion that I’m smarter than everybody else.

A few years ago I was reading this book about space, about astrophysics dumbed down for the average non-scientist. And this point came up, the author actually stated that the moon is visible during the day just as much as it is visible at night. Instantly I was transported back to that day at the restaurant, me, a pimply-faced fifteen-year-old giving a fake science lecture to a group of four adults.

What was that guy’s angle? I always think about this too. Why get me involved? Was he having a similar moment of confusion, suddenly unable to visualize the white moon in the blue sky? I don’t think so, because even if he was blanking out, surely someone else at the table could’ve corrected him, no, you actually can see the moon during the day.

What I’ve put together in the years since is this group of four, sitting around a table lamenting the poor state of modern education. Maybe he was a scientist, or a science teacher, and in between bites of ham and hardboiled egg, he’s railing at the youth of America, “They don’t know anything, not about math, not about science,” and maybe one of the women tried to mount a defense on our behalf, “Oh Roger,” I’m imagining his name is Roger now, “Kids aren’t as bad as you’re making them out to be.”

And he was like, “Oh yeah?” before sticking his hand in the air to call me over. “Hey son, let me ask you a question about science,” and then I stood there and went, “Blah, blah, blah,” over and over again, a steady stream of absolute garbage pouring out of my mouth, and then he sends me on my way, “Great, thanks a lot.”

And as soon as I’m out of earshot, he says to the rest of the group, “You see? That kid was an idiot, a total moron!” and everyone else would have had no choice but to shrug in agreement, because yeah, that was a pretty dumb answer on my part.

So whenever I get presented with a question in life, something that I’m not sure of, I try really hard to keep that experience on hand, ready to play back in my head before I turn the old chatterbox on.

percy_veerance,"I'd got a new girlfriend, been with her about 6 months or so having been in a 5 relationship with the woman I thought I was going to marry. (I was single for a year or so inbetween) She moved away after we broke up and I hadn't spoken to her since.

I had deleted her from Facebook etc. Zero contact.

Then I bumped into her in a bar. She was back to see her family. We had a chat, pretty much deserted our respective friends and were just generally reminiscing about the good times, so ignoring the part about her fucking other guys and stealing from me. As usual with these things it gets flirty and we talked about the sexual things we did, the great nights, the sex is strange places.

She left to go to another bar with her friends and that was that. But I kept thinking about her. I didn't want to go and try and find her again or try and get her number. I still had her email, so I thought that would be the easiest way to contact her. People don't often change an email address.

So I wrote out a long email, while drunk, about how I missed her (I did), that I still loved her (I did) and how my new girlfriend is great but it doesn't have the same spark we did (true) and just generally talking about the great parts from our relationship. 

At this point I should probably also tell you that my ex and current gf had the same first name. Yeah. You can see what's coming now.

Sent the email to the wrong person. 

I didn't even realise. I didn't expect an instant reply and being pretty drunk, I went to bed. I sent the email at a little after 3am.

6am rolls around and I hear a banging. Try to ignore it. It gets louder then I can hear shouting ""Percy you son of a bitch!!!!"" so I get up and there is my current girlfriend. She throws a bunch of my stuff at me, gives me a slap and storms off. 

I took me a second to realise why. Then I hated myself. Lost the new girlfriend who didn't deserve that shit and didn't get back with the ex. Because never go back.",null,154,cdndxlz,1rhsx0,AskReddit,top_day,655

For over two years I have reinvested probably above 75% of whatever I made and have lived extremely frugally by seldom wasting big money on unnecessary things and being thrifty with everything else.  I was really lucky because there had to be a combination of the right conditions (picking the right investments during a global financial recovery, living in a city with lots of decent poker action, having almost 10 years pre-college experience with investing and financial management to name just a few)--so I can't say that my experience is one that should be followed ever--but somehow thing's have worked out for me as unlikely as it may be, so just know it's possible to succeed without college if you are willing to take risks and have the right combination of luck and support.

Knigar,"Watch another member of family die slowly.

7 years ago my grandad fell over in a hardware store, cracked his pelvis and 5 of his ribs (he was already using a walking stick). After that he was bed ridden and just watch him withering away was extremely painful. 6 years I regret not seeing him every day, but every time I saw him it hurt me to see him like this.

I remember the day he passed away, I was sleeping at home, I get a phone call from my grandma saying, please come to our house ASAP. The tone of her voice and the way she spoke still haunts me to this day. There was nothing I could do for her. I went to their house, there he was resting peaceful, I was sad/happy/scared/couldn't move. I phone the ambulance as they had to confirm the death, i and to then pick my mum up and get the death certificate fem the doctors.

 We got a drumkit and were playing one summers day, middle of the day, we never played at night. Here the law says you can make noise till 10 in summer and 8 in the winter so we did nothing wrong.

 He was grabbing the window so we couldn't close it. We asked him to leave and he wouldn't so I tried to pry his hand off the window. He said if I went any farther he was going to sue for assault. 

All this to us kids, never when we were with our parents. We actually called the cops on him at the end for trespassing, to get him to leave.

Everybody in my school knew me. My HS starts at grade 10, so when I was a sophomore I knew quite a bit of people, then eventually met everyone by the time I graduated. I could hangout with anyone and I was welcome. Football team, basketball team, cheerleaders, band kids, the nerds, mathletes (math club), computer tech kids, Pokemon kids, etc. I had friends in every group, which led to me making more friends in every group. I didn't hangout outside of school with most of them. My home life back then (3-5 years ago) wasn't the best, which led to that.  


Insecurities, though? For the most part, I wasn't insecure. I was on the football team in junior high, marching band (switched after football because we toured America and had way more opportunities) in high school, then girls volleyball manager after band (played basketball with the team after/before school). Did I fit in with everyone from those groups? No. Did it make me insecure? Not really. We all feel insecure here and there, but that's just life.

blacklabelpaul,"I believe that being a parent is a lifestyle.  I think the problem many instinctually go for is they need children to validate their own existence or to claim purpose in life rather than see it as chosen lifestyle.

If you make surfing a lifestyle, you live near the beach and have a job that is in/around surfing.

If you're a nudist, you enjoy being nude and maybe live in a club/resort to enjoy being nude full time and become an active member in the nudist lifestyle.

If you're a gamer, you go to conventions and center your life around technology and make gaming all about your life and communicate with other gamers.

For my fiancee and I - kids just aren't our lifestyle.  We see the benefit of our lives in other places that really we're not doing the world any favors by having kids.  

Truth be told - this is one thing where I'm kind of proud of our (millenial) generation.  We're going beyond our religious and cultural backgrounds to see that we don't just become adults for the sole purpose to have kids.    But rather we're seeing that having kids means you're adopting a lifestyle that you want.  If you know that is the life you want, then you're more likely to provide your kid the emotional ""availability"" and dedication to benefit their life and your own.  

In short - If you're having kids because that's the way you were raised/told, then it's no different than being a never-nude in a nudist resort.

porksandwich9113,"First, I will shamelessly link /r/childfree.

Then I will preface this by saying I am a 23 year old male who is about to have a vasectomy.

Now that I have taken care of that, I think the top 3 reasons you will find will be :

* Lifestyle/Money - Lots of my DINK's friends (Double Income No Kids) travel a lot.  They take week long vacations to Europe, Asia, Cruises, ect, every year.  They buy nice Cars &amp; luxury items because they don't want to spend money on kids.
* No Desire to Parent - Self-Explanatory.
* Bad Parent - Many child-free people believe they will be a bad parent, or their bad childhood has turned them from wanting to be a parent.

For me, it's a combination of things.

My biggest one is that I think I would be inadequate/no desire to be a parent.  One leads to the other in my case.
Call me selfish, but I really don't want to raise a child.  Spend *MY* time, *MY* money, and *MY* life (or at least 20+ years of it) raising another person to be self-sufficient. I believe my desire not to have children would then lead to my bad parenting if I had a child.

I'm sure I would love my child (If I had one), I'm sure I would take care of him or her, but deep down I will know I didn't want him/her. And bringing an unwanted child into the world of one of the worst things a person can do. (In my opinion).

The second big thing is lifestyle.  I see what it's like.  My brother and his wife (both 27) have an 18 month old.  They are always tired.  They are fiscally strapped (despite having a decent income for late 20's), they have older cars, their house needs tons of work..The list goes on and on.  Having a child is EXPENSIVE.

While I am not rich, I'm a 23 year old /w a B.S. in C.S. (I always like saying that) who has been working in the IT field for about 18 months now. I definitely live a much more comfortable lifestyle than my brother despite him having a much larger salary than I.  I have a nice 1 bedroom that needs 0 work, I have a nice quality used car, and I am able to divert a massive amount of income to paying off my loans early while contributing fully to retirement. When I have my loans paid off I will have a large amount of disposable income.

Beyond this...I always get asked..When did you know?  

Honestly, I had the inkling by the time I was 16 or 17.  You know how when you get your first girlfriend and you've been going steady for 6 months and you have that ""future desires"" talk.  The no child thing popped into my head back then.  I always thought I would have children because it's the thing to do.  Your parents always say, ""Just wait until you have your own..""  And shit like that.  But I never wanted that.  I remember 18 months into my first serious relationship I lied to my college girlfriend at the time and told her I wanted kids.  We broke up about 2 years later - our ""future together"" being the primary reason why.

The sound of a baby crying gives me feelings of intense anger towards the child, so I would probably be abusive, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life behind bars. I need a lot of time alone each day, and that would be difficult to achieve with kids. Finally, I see no reason to give up the next 20 years of my free time when I could just use a condom and keep taking the pills.

The only benefit I can see is that it might be quite nice to have grown-up kids, but a quicker way of getting a rewarding relationship with another adult is to find someone who already exists and befriend them.

I can't really afford it either. I guess I could work more hours... but why would I want to do that when I could just not have kids and keep my leisure time?

El_Valafaro,"A few reasons, personally.

Firstly, raising kids well takes a certain caliber of person, and I'm not up to snuff with that. I have a hard time with long-term commitment in general, so having a kid probably wouldn't be wise for me. A kid is for life, not just for christmas. I doubt I have the fortitude for it either. I tip my hat to the parents of the world. Takes a lot to go through with something like that.

Secondly, the personal expense of having a kid is astronomical. I don't ever see myself in a position where I can support a kid financially speaking. I'm not willing to break my bank for no real reason.

Thirdly, I am forever alone. Takes two to have kids after all.

And finally, I just don't like kids in general. That's not to say I hate kids or anything, I was one too. I just don't like the idea of having this screaming, pooping, barfing mini-me that constantly wants attention running around the house.",null,2,cdneodp,1rhrs7,AskReddit,top_day,3

TacoGoat,"I have huge anxiety problems right now and I don't know if I'd be able to handle the stress of having a kid(s).

I've never really liked young kids, either. My cousins especially. They are spoiled fucking brats and I've had to babysit them a few times - it's impossible. I don't *think* I'd be a bad parent but I am 100% against spanking and whatnot. (Thanks to my mom when I was much younger, she'd like to take it like 20 steps further from spanking and would do it whenever she felt like it. No kid deserves to be hit.)

But my cousins are absolute fucking monsters, they've never been spanked and I'm kinda seeing that maybe they should've. They're just told 'no' and put in their room for a little bit. 

One part of me says no spanking the other says maybe and I kinda feel like I'd suck at disciplining my kid.

While I'm constantly told I'm very motherly/good with kids, I am uncomfortable and I feel super awkward around them. I prefer kids over 6, I hate toddlers and babies... Hate it when people ask me if their baby is cute... I don't know, it's a mix of things.

Her response: ""you'll change your mind""

She's been trying to change my mind for well over 15 years.  

Basically what it boils down to is 3 main points for me:

1. I don't want kids because I can't afford them.     
-How can I bring a child into this world when I cannot provide for them?  Time and time again I see my friends, colleagues, and coworkers do it and I often wonder *how*. It would mean giving up so much for myself, in addition to adding higher expenses to my necessity costs, leaving me unable to provide a stable healthy lifestyle for my child. In my view, it would almost be child cruelty to raise a kid on my salary.  Now, this is just for myself, but if I were to choose to bring a life into this world I want to know the I have the resources to ensure that that baby is well loved and cared for and not neglected in anyway. 

2. I don't want kids because I know they won't fix my life. 
- Having a child will not mean that ""poof!"" my life is perfect.  In fact, quite the opposite; now I will have additional complications and expenses that are vital to the life of another human being.  Having a baby will not increase the love for myself, or the love for my partner (in fact it may cause more domestic turmoil between the two of us) and having a baby will certainly not cure any anxiety, depression, or other neurosis.  In fact the child will provably inherit those *from* me and amplify them!

3. While I would love the unconditional love of a child: 1. Children grow up and 2. Children are in need of love in numerous places around the world. 
- Having a baby will not end the worlds suffering so why would I want to bring another human into it?  If I want to be a parent I can adopt or foster a child.  I can also be nurturing by giving back to my community.  Sure, my genes won't pass on, and I may regret it when I'm sixty or eighty, but my life is not measured by the life I create and my self-worth is not determined by the genes I leave behind.  

Basically, if I ever do have biological kids, I will be in a secure place financially and emotionally and have the means to provide my child with a life they can be proud of and a childhood where they feel loved and cared for.  Until that day, of it ever comes, I choose to not have children.  ",null,0,cdnoqoj,1rhrs7,AskReddit,top_day,1

Furthermore, I don't want to change diapers. I don't want to have to feign excitement about some crappy crayon drawing and then have to have the ugly-ass thing hanging up on my fridge.

SylverV,"I can paint; and apparently I can paint really well. 

I went to university to study art (non-practical course; but you still had to do the practical stuff) which involved – obviously – doing some painting, which I hadn’t done since I was a little kid. I painted a few abstract things as required and the lecturers went bat shit crazy for them; personally I thought they were crap – I can’t stand abstract art – but they were looking at me like I was the next van Gogh or something. Which made them all the more disappointed when they had to kick me out for not turning up (or being drunk when I did turn up).

And no, before you ask, I don’t have any examples I can show you. As I say, I think they sucked so I left them all at the university. But several qualified people disagreed with me, so it’s just possible I missed my calling as an artist.

lonefeather,"Franco &amp; Rogan would have a very good ""fair use"" argument if Kanye tried to sue them for copyright infringement of his music video.  The legal test for ""fair use"" focuses on how ""transformative"" the parodying work is of the original, and the fact that the original footage of Kimye does not appear at all (replaced instead by footage of Jameseth) would likely be considered ""transformative.""  

Complicating the issue, however, is that Jameseth used the original song in their video, which detracts from a ""fair use"" argument.  They would likely be liable to Kanye for songwriter royalties, for Kanye's musical composition copyright.  But the parody-video-with-non-parody-audio synchronization raises some interesting and novel issues which no legal precedent addresses to my limited knowledge.

But I am not a lawyer, and I'd agree with /u/BaconAndWeed that Kanye probably wouldn't actually sue Jameseth, since they seem cool.",null,0,cdncwlk,1rhq7n,AskReddit,top_day,1

I was sailing the Mediterranean sea and had fairly good weather. 2 beaufort and a nice 25-30 degrees Celcius. I was on the top deck with a friend and in the distance the sky turned greenish and was filled with some sort of black fog. The clouds over yonder were very strangely shaped.

We were sailing in said direction and wondering what that was. We intered the ""black fog"" and it was actually a huge rainstorm wich we didnt hear coming and the wind went from 2 beaufort to 11 beaufort in mere minutes.

Everything that wasnt fixed in place was blown of by the wind. We had to cut cables. The ship was positioned with his nose in the wind and all engines to a minimum.

Visibility was just a couple of meters far and the radar was one big green mess. Our commander had fear in his eyes but kept his cool. 10 minutes later the wind calmed. Visibility restored. Everyone went back to their business.

My mom stopped the car at a church and began to cry. She thought we would die. My 5 year old brain urged my Mom to drive through the ditch to get home. She did and drove through the ditch, while the tornado was forming.

Rob_G,"The Queensboro Bridge links Midtown Manhattan with Long Island City. I cross it every day on my bike to get to work. There’s a dedicated lane, totally apart from traffic, for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s wide enough for everybody, so on a purely theoretical level, there shouldn’t be any problems. But there are always problems.

People don’t know how to follow the rules. This dedicated lane has a line drawn down the middle. On one side, there are stenciled images of people on their bikes, on the other side, ones of people walking. That sounds simple enough, right? People on their bikes are riding fast, and people walking or running, not as fast. Terrific.

But it’s like, maybe twenty five percent of people on the bridge at any given time are either not understanding this very clear line of demarcation, or they understand it, but they’re thinking to themselves, fuck this line. I’m not going to get bossed around by a line. I’ll do whatever the hell I want.

I know it’s really lame for bike riders to complain about people being in the bike lane. Even though it’s true, it’s a tired argument, and Fred Armisen made fun of this trope at length on Portlandia. But come on, why are you going to walk in the middle of a bike lane? Riding downhill, bikes are flying. It’s like some people are thirsting for a collision.

And so every day I cross the bridge and there are always at least one or two people doing their thing, walking in the bike lane. Most of the time it’s … whatever, it’s annoying to me, but I’m not going to do anything. Normally there aren’t tons of people in the way, and it’s really no big deal for me to do a little swerve and avoid that guy with his head down (looking straight at the stenciled bikers spaced twenty feet apart) with his headphones on, or texting on his cell phone.

I really try to prevent myself from getting annoyed. I know that it’s crazy, that there are a billion people in this city, and I can’t let myself get upset at stupid trivialities like this. If I indulge even one urge to yell to somebody, “Hey man, this is the bike lane,” as I zip by, even if it does do something, which it most likely won’t, there’s just going to be somebody else doing it five minutes later.

And so I just try to stay calm, tell myself that I don’t have any control of this world, of other people, that this is probably like a metaphor for life, for my existence on the planet, me trying to do my thing without getting all bent out of shape about other people doing their thing.

But sometimes I’m not so patient. Every once in a while I will yell out, “Bike lane!” at some clueless pedestrian. Sometimes I’ll try the passive aggressive route, cutting right in front of the walker just inches after I pass. Did you feel that gust of wind when I passed? Yeah, that’s because you’re in the wrong lane buddy. You’re going to get hurt. I’m going to get hurt.

The lanes aren’t there arbitrarily. They’re an attempt at maintaining order, at facilitating the bridge crossing for a large number of people using different methods of transportation. Why do some people ignore it? It’s like life, why are some people just so opposed to everything?

“Hey, maybe things would run a lot smoother if we did it this way.”

“You think you’re smarter than me? Don’t tell me what to do! You can’t tell me what to do! This is America! I’ll do whatever the hell I want!”

The other day I was crossing and this guy and girl were walking their bikes, taking up the entire bike lane. And as I was trying to cross, there were other pedestrians going the other way in the pedestrian lane. And so I actually had to come to a stop because there was no way for me to pass. I made eye contact with the guy in the bike lane and that was all it took to set him off as he got instantly super aggressive.

“What the fuck are you looking at, bitch?” he screamed. And so I probably should have just ignored this and pedaled on, but I responded to the aggression with my own surge of adrenaline. I shouted back, “Get out the bike lane, you’re in the way!” His response to that was to throw down his bike and start walking toward me. I didn’t want to throw my bike down, but I didn’t want this clown to think that he could scare me away, so I placed it down, but did it with dramatic zeal.

“What are you going to do, beat me up?” I said, wildly mimicking his chest thumping and arm flailing, “You’re going to be a tough guy?” at this point the girl he was with started pulling at his arm, and me, having absolutely zero interest in getting in an actual physical altercation with a complete stranger, I picked up my bike and continued my ride to work.

It was pretty stupid. That guy could have been nuts. He could have totally attacked me. I don’t know what I was trying to prove. I felt like an idiot on the rest of the way over. What if he punched me in the face? What would I have said to my boss if I showed up to work all bloody and bruised? “Sorry boss, you see, this guy was walking in the bike lane, and we got into a fist fight …”

I just don’t see why we can’t at least try to follow the rules sometimes. Not every line is a challenge to your personal liberty, an invitation for something to be crossed. There are a lot of people on this planet, and sometimes these rules just help everything to run a little smoother.",null,5,cdndtuo,1rhpxd,AskReddit,top_day,19

We have seen Reddit flooded with what happens in tornadoes just in the past week: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1r6jss/video_from_the_washington_il_tornado_man_films/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1qx82d/washington_illinois_aerial_view_of_tornado_path/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1qu8ua/tornado_update_reddit_it_is_all_gone/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1qzugv/tornado_blew_the_roof_up_the_curtain_blew_outside/) just to link a few. They fascinate me and scare the crap out of me. As seen in the first link I posted above, it only takes 45 seconds for a tornado to go from in your path to destroying your house.

[A tornado threw this semi.](http://i.imgur.com/rfgc95K.jpg)

They are so unpredictable it's not even fathomable. Yeah, you can see a curl start on a radar, but you don't have a radar. You're sitting at home. Or god forbid sleeping in the middle of the night. All of a sudden the sky turns green-tinted, and you hear what sounds like a freight train. Then the pressure changes and your ears pop. 

You could have your house flattened, get impaled with a flying 2x4 shard, be thrown half a mile into the air and dropped down on the rubble of your busted life. And your neighbor's home could be untouched. That's how unpredictable these things are.

Tornadoes destroy [cars](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qx40GfKouV8/TeExNgT8QgI/AAAAAAAAOBY/siWiXnkMeis/s1600/car+after+tornado.jpg), too. Pick 'em up and throw 'em like it's nothing. Even the [police](http://www.vosizneias.com/assets/uploads/news_photos/thumbnails/700_x0b1dtu9qbazmspvmkxodqb9dewsmvfg.jpg) aren't safe.

[A house used to be here.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/F5_tornado_damage_example.jpg)

The F5 in Tuscaloosa a few years back, along with several other F5's in the span of a few days around there, killed 350 people. Just like that, dead. Usually crushed or impaled, or picked up and thrown by forces of nature. Swirling winds at 250mph or more. No thank you.

One twister in Joplin back in 2011 killed 158 people in just a couple of minutes. One hour the town was a bustling little place. The next it is catastrophe. 

YouTube some tornado footage and tell me they aren't scary as hell. Do it.

Hurricanes? You get to watch as it grows and moves towards land. Earthquakes? Scary and unpredictable, but not as common (at least not in the US). Snowstorms? Give me a break. 

I grew up in the mountains of North Carolina. Mountains that are meant to stop tornadoes. But one still got through and [devastated](http://roadspullzone1.wataugaroadscom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/417762_.jpg) pieces of my little town last year.

So forget your answers or ""Humans"" or ""Australia"" or ""Ebola"", and try something that will send chills down your spine.

I couldn't imagine what the world was like before accurate warning signals and reporting came about. You are sitting at home enjoying dinner while heavy rain beats the windows. All of a sudden, your house explodes. You are taking a walk in the woods, and the next thing you know trees are being ripped from their roots and tossed about. Then your boots begin to float and the pressure makes your head want to burst. Nope.

runawayphoenix,"Coping with depression and anxiety was extremely hard to begin with the first time around... Unfortunately I've been through enough lows to appreciate the highs when they come, and have found a couple ways to deal with both. For the depressed part of me, letting the people closest to me know what I'm going through helps the most. It becomes a lot easier when you know that you aren't the only person going through this and knowing you've got the  support you need in the people care about you the most is my basis of coping. Seriously, whether its sitting down with my mother letting my emotions run wild (aka tears streaming down my face and screaming) to going on 3am drives with my best friend/s to our local 24 hour burger joint or the beach, having someone to support you, even if they don't fully understand the nature of your woes, helps a lot. You don't need to think, you can just feel whatever you need to feel and let it out. Knowing that someone cares enough to be there for you is help enough for me. When I feel like I don't deserve the help of people, I tend to shut myself off from the world - playing my favourite album while going on a long walk helps. If its during the evening, I'll make a hot chocolate, curl up in bed and watch my favourite movies until the darkness takes away the pain and I wake up feeling better. As for the anxious part of me, I usually just remind myself that I'll all be over soon; focus on deep breathes.

Also, for anyone else with anxiety, I highly recommend downloading an app called SAM. It lets you list what makes you anxious, record your anxiety levels, and track them to see how they compare day to day. There's also information about anxiety, different types of coping with it, and stuff like that. My favorite part though is it has a tool for helping you while you're in the middle of an attack. It gives you a paragraph to read over, basically telling yourself that you're okay, these feelings suck but they will pass.

arcade_13,"Worst - Long haul flight from Paris to Vancouver (direct) with a baby to the left of me (I was in the middle) and a baby behind me. The baby to the left screamed for about 7 hours. Ear splitting, gut wrenching screaming that she just wouldn't stop. Hoarse sounding, throat peeling, legs kicking, eye exploding, vomit inducing screaming.

The parents didn't care, even though there were two levels to the plane and the level below only had toilets. They could have taken the child downstairs and let it scream without disturbing anyone. The flight attendants tried numerous times to quieten it but it wouldn't and the parents didn't care enough to make an effort. 

We ended up getting three glasses of baileys given to us (all passengers in the surrounding seats) as a way of calming us down. Not only that but the child behind me decided to kick my seat constantly. It was an all night 13+ hour flight. I started to get manic and couldn't stop eating, I just kept stuffing food in my mouth and then punctuating my chews with glaring in the parents direction. I could have exploded them with my eyes. I have never been as close to feeling murderous as I was that time. I could have fashioned a shiv out of my toothbrush and stabbed that couple to death with no guilt afterwards. 

NOT ONLY THAT but I was second behind the front row and the row in front had four seats and my row had five. As I was on the edge of the middle row, my T.V. was on the back of the seat diagonal to me so I had to look to the right to watch anything. My T.V. was so far to the right that it was actually in front of the person beside me, which made no sense in terms of engineering. 

NOT ONLY THAT but it was terrible turbulence. The kind that makes you lift out of the seat just a little each time it drops. Like, your constantly trying to figure out if the hot tea will spill on your lap but where do you put a full cup of hot tea except your tray, even though it's filled with empty candy wrappers and half finished shivs and numerous cups of baileys.

Since the trip started at midnight, I had been up since 6 in the morning with no sleep.

I end up next to two really sketchy russians. After a little bit they ask me where I'm from and we end up talking a little bit. They then said something in russian to the stewardes after which she brings back not 1 but 2 bottles of vodka. I didn't think much of it at the time. We start drinking and singing songs....after a while I'm completely drunk and they are...well russian. It was the best flight ever. I was pretty nervous about getting off the plane drunk, but they told me not to worry.

jdpatric,"When I was really young, maybe 4 or 5, my parents took me on a plane to go to California for vacation from Pennsylvania. It's a longass plane ride, that I don't rightly recall how long it was. 

I had a Sega Gamegear as it was circa 1992 or so, and I was playing Sonic or something for it. I'd left the volume on because...well I liked the noise. My mom and I got separated from my dad for one reason or another and the angry businessman sitting next to my mom (he had the aisle, mom had middle, and I had window) wouldn't switch with my dad. Whatever, we've had that happen before and since; doesn't really bother me (didn't then either, I had Gamegear and a window).

Well, a few minutes before they told us to shut off the electronics angry business man complained to my mom about the game making noise. Mom didn't really know the intricacies of a Gamegear and had me turn it off instead of just turning the volume off. I muttered and whined a little, but I loved flying so I just stared out the window.

We takeoff and start to gain altitude. I know to periodically swallow to equalize the pressure in my ears and get them to pop. Well, the newborn baby in the seat directly in front of angry businessman wasn't privy to this particular detail and proceeded to scream his/her head off for the remainder of the flight. From as soon as we hit like 5k feet outside Pittsburgh all the way to somewhere in California that kid screamed off and on. I slept for the vast majority of the flight and my mom sat there with an incredibly smug look on her face while the angry dude just had to sit there and take it.

Note: I currently have a 16 month old and a really good baby monitor, so I know how very difficult it is to sleep through an angry baby screaming. I have no idea how I did it at 5 or so, I guess I just wasn't wired to hear it like I am now. ",null,1,cdnd7dw,1rhp0n,AskReddit,top_day,1

Yeah. Right.

Clifford is a killing machine as evidenced by his size and color. Gingers have no souls.

One day, Clifford snaps. He eats his friends. He eats the entire town. The only one left is Emily Elizabeth.

He stares at her. He begins to foam at the mouth.

""I know that's not you, Clifford,"" she whispers, tears audible in her words. ""I know there's still good in you.""

*Yeah,* he thinks to himself. *Chloe and T-Bone were good. Great, even. And they're inside of me along with the rest of the town.*

""I know you don't want to do this. Deep down inside...""

Clifford questions himself for the first time since his turn. Emily Elizabeth starts approaching him.

And then as she reaches in for a hug, Clifford notices a glint of steel in her hand. He snarls and backs away.

""Martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential. People who train BJJ are healthier, their egos are healthier, they are easier to talk to. They are easier to hang out with because they are facing reality on a regular basis. 

When you do BJJ it is impossible to be full of shit because reality comes at you in the purest form possible; a life or death struggle using your determination, your focus, your techniques, and your mind in your training over, over, over, and over again. It is as real as can get and that has made me a better person. It has made me a better man. It has made me understand myself. My weaknesses. My strengths. The shit I need to work on. Jiu-Jitsu has been one of the most valuable tools that I have ever had in my life.""

Rob_G,"Sometimes I feel like I’m always running late, regardless of when I have to be up, or how much time I have at my disposal to be ready. For example, the other day my boss asked me to work a double shift. “No way,” I told him, “I hate working.” OK, I didn’t say that exactly, but I still said no. Not taking no for an answer, he countered “OK fine,” he told me, “How about you can come in at noon?” And I was like, all right, fine, that sounds doable.

And I started planning out how the day would go. I’d wake up at eight-thirty, take my dog Steve for a long walk, make a nice breakfast, maybe even get some reading done. Let’s do it!

The next thing I know my cell phone alarm clock is blaring at the periphery of my consciousness. I’m trying to get out of bed but my body is completely unresponsive. My cell phone alarm is so loud, so grating. I don’t know if everybody is familiar with the iPhone alarms, but I always use the one that sounds like the red alert from Star Trek. It’s intense. But it’s the only one that even stands a remote shot at waking me from a deep sleep.

What happened? Eleven o’clock already? Jesus. I usually wake up a lot earlier. I barely had time to get up, shower, shave, and then take the dog for a walk before I grabbed my bike and pedaled to work at a pace I usually reserve for outrunning taxis I’ve accidentally bumped into in traffic. OK, that’s not really true. I don’t outrun taxis. I just got a little carried away with the length and dramatics of that sentence. Although I did love Premium Rush.

But still, I was right on the verge of being late for a shift that I was already told to come in late for. I really was biking to work a lot faster than I usually do. For the first time in the better part of a year, I had left the house without so much as putting a morsel of food in my mouth. More importantly was coffee, or the lack thereof. Brewing and waiting and sipping, it was all completely out of the question.

I made it on the floor of the restaurant literally at the very minute. And I’m not one of those guys to throw around the word literally. Like I actually punched in and it said 12:00. I made it to work and the floor manager sees me and goes, “Finally! Rob’s here. Where have you been?” That deal that the general manager made with me? That whole thing about working a double and then telling me to come in at noon? Did we seal the deal some kind of a secret handshake? Because he didn’t tell anybody else. So I had to explain myself to the other managers, telling them I actually wasn’t late, but even when I hunted down the GM, “Right?” I asked him, “Remember you said I could come in at noon?” “Right …” he had that look on his face, like I might be making it all up, like he couldn’t really pinpoint the agreement I was talking about.

The day is over. I made it through. I just can’t get over the fact that, with two extra hours added to my day, I wound up being later than ever, later than I am on a regular day when I have to be at work at my regular time. I missed breakfast, I missed coffee, and I didn’t get to write anything. My whole day at work was thrown off balance. I was having what I assumed to be a lack of caffeine induced headache, even though normally I don’t believe in those. And I was starving. I was starving and serving people delicious, delicious lunch. It was torture.

When did I become so dependent on coffee? I never drank coffee in college. I don’t even remember when it became this habit. I honestly don’t know how I got to the point where I need three cups of coffee just to feel like myself in the morning. That’s kind of crazy, right? But tons of adults drink coffee. Maybe I’m more of an adult than I’m letting myself admit. You know, aside from the whole almost being late to work at noon thing.",null,12,cdncb86,1rhmxk,AskReddit,top_day,44

StinzorgaKingOfBees,"[Ruina Imperii](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6STwXVWqDoc) by Sabaton. Song is in Swedish.

The song is about the final fall of the Swedish Empire, once a major world power. Charles XII (Karl XII) of Sweden was killed at Fredriksten Fortress in Norway on December 11th (Gregorian), by a projectile of unknown origin (the big question being from which side did it originate from.) General Armfeldt lead the battered remains of the defeated Swedish and Finnish forces in retreat away from Norwegian pursuers, intending to cross the mountains between Norway and Sweden in the dead of winter, having no other alternatives. While traversing the mountains with poor gear, a severe blizzard struck, reducing visibility, and inflicting many causalities, including the guide. About 5800 left Tydal, Norway, and around 3000 men perished on the mountains. The Swedes were forced to abandon or burn much of their equipment for warmth and speed, most of the horses perished, and some of the men became lost and fragmented into groups that had to find their own way, many isolated individuals never did. Another 700 died on the way from Handol, Sweden, to Duved where lodging had been arranged for the 2100 survivors, mostly hardcore Finnish veterans, of whom 600 were crippled for life. The Swedish Empire would never recover and lost many of their gains during the Thirty Years War and the Great Northern War. It is said for years afterwards the fur-hunting was the best ever because of the foxes, wolves, and wolverines that fed on the corpses.

Wallet_In_A_Tree,"Story time.

Back in Grade 11, there was a semester-long project for English due by the end of the semester. The project consisted of selecting one book out of six, and then writing at least a minimum of fifty journal entries that had to follow the criteria. Some of the journal entries had to be written in the perspective of certain characters, we could make analogies to other forms of media, compare and contrast characters, discuss the book and its plot, etc etc.

Anyway, I get about half of these done by the start of winter break. During the three weeks of vacation, I pretty much procrastinated and avoided making progress on the project because I believed that I had about three more weeks after vacation ended to finish and hand in the project as told by my friend. When asked by another friend how my project's progress was going, I merely replied that I was going to finish the second half of it by the end of the semester. That was when she told me that it was due the week after school resumed.

This left me with approximately six days. Full of panic, I used up as much time productively as I could to churn out the second half of the project. School resumed and I had four more days. Judging by the time remaining, I would not be able to finish in time to meet the deadline. My solution to the lack of time available to finish the project would be to not sleep.

I stayed up for sixty hours straight while going to school every morning, coming home at 4 and being productive. I finished the project in time and handed it in. When compared with everyone else in the class, only about a third of them had met the minimum requirements of the criteria for this project.

2 weeks later we were handed back our graded projects and I discovered that I had received 96% for excellent efforts. 

2 years later, I have still not learned my lesson and am procrastinating to this day. As I speak I'm on my 15th hour of staying awake trying to finish a paper that's due in 9 hours.

It was a hundred person class and I was way too timid to talk, and a lot of the time I was reading other books on the syllabus (or ones he had recommended that weren't) while he was talking about something else. The only thing I said that term was on the last day of the class, and it was ""when is your next class?"" It was in a year, and I was the first seat filled.

I was a pretty poor student; I thought that I never had to go to class as long as I did good work and showed up for exams, so my GPA was totally in the gutter. But, I went to that teacher's class more than the others. We were reading Don Quixote the next spring, and I was reading Fear and Trembling by Kierkegaard for leisure on the side (I have always been a weird kid), and with never having participated in class, I sent my teacher a twelve paragraph email at two in the morning with my notes comparing the two works. I got an email back twenty minutes later, equal length to mine. 

My teacher helped turn me around. He gave a ton of great books over the years, gave me the confidence to man up and take initiative in my other classes, get out of my narcissistic student rut and to create real scholarly work about things that I was passionate about. He always went above and beyond for me, is trying to help me get into graduate school, still critiques any work I send his way, keeps up with my life.

This same teacher caused me to shed my introverted shell which I had grown due to the previous 3 years of homeschooling. This teacher also taught me to respect the humanities and arts, especially literature. Previously, I thought they were kinda useless, and that only STEM studies were worth it. 

Although I'm now a college student majoring in computer science, I really enjoy reading literature, analyzing it, and use this skill in analyzing films for fun.

On the day it was due, I put it on my desk as instructed and put my chair on top of my desk at the end of the day like every other student. 

The next day I was scolded for not handing it in. I had and I knew it. I was given until the next morning to submit a project or I would suffer some kind of consequences (can't remember what, maybe a detention which I've never had in my life) 
I spent my lunch breaks searching rubbish bins around school because I knew it had to be somewhere. I found it in the dumpster near the staff carpark and grabbed it out and handed it in to her again the same day.

She went red with either embarrassment, fury or both and told me I was a cheeky little shit.

* You think only ""love at first sight"" feelings matter. These are rare and often fade away quickly. I'm not saying you should date people you don't like, but you must surprise yourself falling in love with a girl you just thought was ""nice"".

Should I just have sex already or what? Nah, until your desire to have sex is greater than your disinterest in someone who wants to have sex with you, there's no need to put yourself in a situation you aren't keen on. Someone will make you want to sex them.

Am I just being naive? Nope, nothing wrong with high standards or waiting for a natural sexual attraction. Besides, sex is no good without sexual attraction anyway. 

Am I just superficial and vain? Only if you actually think you are too good for everyone, if its a simple matter of no sexual connection then nah, you're fine. I'm attractive and there are other attractive people I don't find sexually appealing. It's just a thing.

Do I not know how to appreciate someone? Do you appreciate your friends? Do you appreciate other people not included in this topic?

It took experience to teach me that and experience does have it's advantages but so does inexperience.

It's a hard road to walk, being different from your friends, but at the end of the day the people who accept you for who you are and respect your decision are better people to be around. So sometimes being different helps you develop stronger friendships with those people while being able to realise which friends just aren't worth keeping.

The type that you do because, heh, sex. This is your one night stands, your fuck buddies. Fundamentally it's no strings attached fucking. 

Then there's sex with a person you care about. This is totally different ball game. But then, everything that you do with your partner is different. Whether it's back rubs, showers or watching TV together. 

I'm going to say this next bit very bluntly. If you're that worried about being a virgin, give one of those ladies a call (the ones that are/were into you) and take them up on their offer.

He spent the night pacing and brooding, and finally pushed our own dad over the back of the couch onto my brother in law and started yelling that he had a gun and threatening to kill everyone. 

My mom did what she could to deescalate things and eventually we got him into her car. I sat in the seat right behind him just in case he got physical and needed to be restrained. We packed up some of the food that had been cooked already for him and drove the incredibly tense 45 Minutes back to his apartment to drop him off.

Oliver-the-odd,"Back when I was in secondary school, there was a kid, Sam, who really hated me. He used to take the piss out of me all time and he was always horrible to everyone. Eventually he got kicked out of school. To get home from school I had to catch one bus half way and then walk for 5 minutes to get a second bus, which would take me to my old primary school where I'd meet my Mum and sister. One day I'm walking to my second bus, when a door to one of the houses on that road opens. Sam comes walking out. I thought I was seeing things at first, because he basically ignored me and him and his friend started walking in the opposite direction to me, but then he turned around and shouted ""Oh look! It's my best mate Oliver (me)"". I tried to ignore him; To be honest, I thought he'd just walk away, but then him and his friend started walking towards me. I didn't feel comfortable with this ,so I started to walk to the next bus stop along the road. I crossed the road about 3 times on the way, to avoid them as much as possible, but they still continued to follow me. Then they started to speed up. So, I did the same. I ended up running past another bus stop. Eventually I realised I wouldn't be able to loose them on this big open road. Especially if they lived here, so I ran across a train and tram crossing, which started to close by the time they got to it, so they were forced to take the bridge. This gave me time to escape. I found a service station and hid in there for a while. There was only one set of shelves that wasn't visible from out side. The alcohol isle. As you'd imagine, the man behind the counter started asking me what was going on, when he saw my scared expression. At first I told him I was fine ,but then I realised they might come into the shop. If that happened I'd be screwed; I can't fight 2 people at once, especially not in such an in-closed space. So I told him I was being chased. He was gonna call the police but I told him not to. Instead I just wanted to hid behind the counter for a bit. Later on a woman came into the shop and agreed to give me a ride to my grans house, which was closer than my home (where I had originally been going). I was a bit un-sure about this, but I didn't feel like I had many options. I was already very late getting home. So she gave me a lift and I spent the next 10 minutes entertaining her son, who was also in the car. Whilst we were driving, she told me she'd seen two boys running down the road when she parked up. I'd imagine that was them. Thanks to her and the man behind the counter, I was able to escape Sam. :)

I was homeless, hungry and dirty. I washed in gas station toilets and ate from dumpsters.  

One day, while looking for a place to sleep,  I found an unlocked shed behind a church. It was full of stuff apparently intended for a rummage sale. I stole a complete set of clothes and slept on a soft pile of clothing under a blanket. I was clean, warm and dry. Heaven.

The next morning, as I left for school, I saw a crate full of small cartons of milk on the back porch. The church had a day care center. I stole two cartons and went to school with something in my belly for the first time in weeks.

It was a great place to sleep,  so I returned that night. Good sleep, stolen milk for breakfast.

The third morning, when I went to get the milk,  I saw something amazing. The crate of milk was there.  It hadn't been locked up. There was no policeman waiting. No security cameras.

No, the crate was there. And on top were two extra cartons for me.

I had been stealing.  Someone, the secretary, the pastor, the milkman, I don't know who, reacted with kindness and compassion to a stranger,  someone they had never even seen.

So I was in an incomfortable situation, being a not-so-much friend of his, and being a jerk 3/4 of the time. I just couldn't handle the peer pressure and chose the easy solution, denying being his friend when people asked me why I was talking to him.

We eventually lost contact when entering high school (we went to two different schools), and we found ourselves again a year later. He had become much more mature (and so did I), and we rebuilt a good friendship, without all the teasing and awkwardness. After months of this healthy relationship, I told him I was deeply sorry for what I did to him in our school years. He told me it was K and we moved on.

I'm sometimes a bit sad thinking of it tho. I assume I wished he yelled at me at least a little. Now he just adds a layer of kindness on top of my awful teenage behavior. (Fuck you dude :c )",null,0,cdndtdm,1rhjic,AskReddit,top_day,2

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125608/?ref_=nv_sr_1

I'm quite amazed that no one has mentioned this documentary yet. 

It's an amazing story of a musician who released a couple of records back in the 70's but never had any big breakthrough. Some bootlegs of his records managed to make their way over to South Africa, where he was turned into an icon in the anti-apartheid movement and his music became more famous there than the Beatles.... but no one over there ever knew who he was.

The documentary is about the impact his music had in peoples life and about how a couple of music store owners in Cape Town decides to figure who he was, what happened to him and if he ever knew about what impact his music had.

It's one of the most amazing real life feelgood stories I've ever heard of, and it's accompanied by an amazing soundtrack - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6bjqdll7DI - and it even won an Oscar for best documentary this year. 

Definitely a must-see documentary.

Iwasraisedonthedairy,"My husband and I mainly watch Documentaries.

A lot of our favorites have been mentioned, but here are a few more:

""Freakonomics."" It's based on a book, but the documentary has a lot of interesting facts. The part I personally found the most interesting is baby names and whether they affect a person's future.

""The Parking Lot Movie."" It follows a group of people who work at a paid parking lot. It's hysterical.

""The Business of Being Born."" If you're pregnant or considering getting pregnant, this is a good one to watch. It's mostly about women having babies in America and the healthcare system. It has some valid points, but it's very biased. It's very pro home birth, which is great for people who are into that sort of thing if they are lucky enough to have a healthy pregnancy, but the ending kind of contradicts the whole point of the documentary, which I found amusing.

Then it's bright and I am weightless. I'm standing in a crowd of people, commotion all around. They are all staring at somethign but I cannot tell. I move closer, fighting my way through the crowd. No one aknowledges me, It's like I am not even there. I finally make it to the front of the crowd.

It's me, my car wrapped around the pole. Engine split in two around the pole, front tires gone, windshield smashed. My head is on the steering wheel with blood everywhere. My arms are dangling at my side. 
I try screaming for help but nothing comes out, silence. No one is doing anything, just standing around staring. I couldnt understand why noone would help. 

Thats when I woke up. It sucked, the feeling of being helpless, invisible. Bt wat stuck with me the most was the dying part. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't do anythig. My eyes just keep closing, my arms dangling. My head felt like it was being held down I could not lift it. 

The feeling of not being in control of my body infuriated me. Anytime something happened to me I fought through it. When I broke my ankle I rode my bike home, when I fell out of a tree I got up and went right back up. When I crashed my bike into a brick wall and cracked my head open I got up and tried to continue riding(would have too if my dad didn't notice all the blood).

She'd constantly flaunt her grades and knowledge and then proceed to ask if I felt stupid around her. She was extremely selfish and apparently never learned how to share in pre-school. I'm a very giving person so it was weird being around someone who was opposite of that. My birthday present wasn't good enough so ""her mom"" said I didn't deserve wha was planned for my birthday. It was an overall shit show. Everyone loved her, though. I guess I was the only person she treated like garbage. This was high school, too. She was a terrible person. It's been years since this played out and she doesn't keep in contact with our old friends like I still do. I can only imagine how she treated the friends she had met in college.

I quietly shut off the video camera, and then told everyone I was going back to bed for a while. My husband came in when I was lying down and asked if I was OK. I was so crushed. I asked him if he realized that there wasn't one gift for me under the tree. He looked stunned, apologized and said he would ""make it up to me"". He ran out to a Walgreens that was open on Christmas, and bought a bunch of crap like a bag of candy, a cheap souvenir pot for tourists to Arizona, a makeup up kit of eye shadow and blush...

I just had to go rent Ghostbusters 2 or I wasn't going to live through the night! I screamed and pleaded as my mom and sister began decorating the tree. 

My dad finally relented and took me to the video xpress, I was giddy as I rented it. Upon getting home, the tree was done. I was shocked. For some reason, in my selfish little 12 year old mind, I'd expected them to wait for us to get back.

My parents weren't upset really, more annoyed (They'd already bought it for me after all, the whole time it was sitting in their closet wrappped for me to smile at on Christmas morning.) My little sister was already passed out. 

I cried myself to sleep that night, fearing I'd ruined Christmas. It was all in my head, but that moment still stands out to me as a pivotal one.

dragondemo5,"It depends, if your pursuit of wanting to be happy is making you unhappy then yes it is flawed. For example if you have a high paying job but it makes you miserable then that would be how wanting to be happy, at least through money, is flawed. If your pursuit of happiness is actually making you feel happy then in a sense it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Life may not be all rainbows and sunshine but if you do what makes you feel happy you probably won't go wrong though, flawed or not. ",null,0,cdnai9v,1rhh04,AskReddit,top_day,1
HomemadeBonerSoup,"humans have adapted over time to be generally content with life. im not able to provide the source now, but there was a study that showed that both multi million lottery winners and people who suffered quadraparapilegic (spelling) accidents all returned to their average level of happiness within 2 years i think? so basically, you could lose all limbs, and after a few months/years time, you would be just as satisfied with life as if you had won the lottery instead of the accident. so, to answer your question, i guess it is flawed in the traditional sense that people are ""in the pursuit of happiness."" that being said, i believe that there is so much joy in life that we just have to appreciate instead of simply becoming ""adapted"" to it. for example, appreciating cuddling with a spouse after twenty years, or having a hot shower in the winter months (i live in minnesota). i hope i helped answer your question at least a little bit",null,0,cdnakae,1rhh04,AskReddit,top_day,1

RAM_Burglar,"One Sunday, earlier this year, I left my apartment and drove my luxury car to the station and caught the train to the city. I walked from the station to the place I work. I have a good job, it pays well, and it's in a really nice building. To get to work I have to walk through a really crappy area of the city. It is filled with homeless drug addicts and the streets smell like a toilet. As I was walking to work - miserable because I hate my job and didn't want to be working on Sunday - I encountered a magical crack head couple. 

On the ground they had placed their crappy tape deck and they were blaring some awful 90s rock music while they were passionately making out. It was like something from a Derelecte commercial. It was incredible, though. They were so happy - so in love - despite looking like absolute garbage and having no home. I have a nice car, nice job, and a roof over my head - but I feel trapped by my car payments, and I actually hate my job and dread waking up every morning. It really hit me hard that you can have ""everything"" and still be miserable, and have ""nothing"" and still have best damn morning of your life. Being happy is everything. Nothing else matters.

KingofArgos,"I think it is actually flawed. And from your story, I think that you may already know it.  

To see that flaw, turn ""the pursuit of happiness"" around. Think about avoiding unhappiness.  

Now, take a moment to consider what you value the most in life, as a student, as a lover, and as a member of your family. If you stay true to your values on all fronts, will you always be able to avoid unhappiness?  

No. You will need to struggle, persevere, and confront people that can hurt you. You will have to face stressful situations, to stand up and take hits, and alas, to make sacrifices. And all this is just the bare minimum required not to lose track while you pursue happiness.

So you pursue happiness by not avoiding unhappiness. Do you see the flaw?

Happiness, albeit an ephemeral sensation, will be found in the path that is truest to your values. Beware if you stop facing your values and turn towards happiness as your end goal not to be lured off course by the mirage of avoiding unhappiness.

So ask yourself: what do you value the most, living a fulfilling relationship with your girlfriend, or living the life that is expected of you by your parents?",null,0,cdnas3w,1rhh04,AskReddit,top_day,2

I'm definitely not bashing smartphones, and I'm excited to see technology evolve rapidly like it has in recent years, but there's something disheartening when I'm walking around the campus of Uni. and just about everyone is plugging away at their phones. Eyes glued to the screen. Yes, it is convenient, but it also makes me feel bad sometimes when I go to grab dinner with friends, and end up being the only one not on his/her phone. I mean, tech has brought us together, closer than ever before, but it is also distracting us from spending quality time in the present. It's alright to send a text to your friend that you're going out, yeah, but sitting at dinner talking to your other friends, not interacting with the people you're physically with is wrong to me. I remember I went to a city with a group of friends, and they spent just about 50% of the time on their phones, looking down and texting away, and at the end they missed out on a whole bunch of things, and thought the trip was ""boring."" that made me upset.

thegreatkathsby,"In the 8th grade, to help us get prepared for the test, my American History teacher would let us play an educational game the day before the test. This week it happened to be ""basketball"" where you are asked a question, and if you get it right then you could throw a ball into a can and get bonus points for the test.  Well I realized my pad was overflowing in the middle of the game, so I asked to go to the bathroom and said it was an emergency.  He said no.  A little sooner it comes up to be my turn (I assumed the blood hadn't made it to my pants yet) and when I go to get the ball and bend down and I hear the teacher pause in the middle of something he was saying.  I throw the ball, I miss, I sit down. 
30 turns later, it's back to me.  Except he skips me and calls on the kid behind me.  Being the impulsive bitch I was, I was like, ""Coach, it's my turn"" and his face gets red and he said,""Oh is it? I must've miscounted. Go ahead.""
So I go and throw the ball, and I can't remember if I made it or not, but I remember looking back at a bunch of terrified faces not knowing what to say, and I realized what I just did.  I acted like I knew nothing, and when the bell rang I went to the bathroom I saw that there was red all over the back of my pants.  I spent the rest of the day with a jacket around my waist.

My sister used to pick me up from school everyday when I was a sophomore in high school, and the trip would usually last between half an hour to 45 minutes. One day, about ten minutes into the drive home I had a spontaneous nose bleed. This wasn't just a small one, this was a full blown torrential flood of blood from my nose. My sister was really finnicky about her car and would freak out if anything got dirty, so we have nothing in the car to plug up my nose other than a tampon in my purse. So I take it out and plug up my nose and SUCCESS. Ten minutes later when I thought the bloody nose was gone I took it out along with a really long disgusting clot clinging to the end of it (fortunately no more bloody nose) but then my sister starts freaking out about it again, asking me why I took it out in her car and how I was going to make a mess. She then rolls down the window and orders me to throw it out the window. I do as she tells me and I fling it backwards a bit harder than I should have. Just as I threw it, a car to the right of us drove past and THE THING LANDED BETWEEN THE HOOD AND THE WINDSHIELD.

During a biology lesson we were learning about some biological stuff, mainly this class it was about the blood steam. As the teacher was speaking this girl asked if she could go to the bathroom. Many of the people in the class dismissed it as her just needing to go no.1 or 2 but some heard the distress in her voice and continued to look at her. The teacher eventually dismissed her and as she was walking towards the door we suddenly see some blood on the side of the inside of her thigh. There wasn't any trickle till later so we assumed that it just shot out of her. Now between me and some old friends she is forever called Projectile Period.

Right when I started middle school I noticed things were off.  My mom had been frequently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and her newest therapist just didn't sit right with me.  I figured out they were having an affair while my 5 siblings went on in perfect bliss.

Eventually while out getting Jack in the Box with my dad I broke the news to him, and he told me he knew but was biding his time.  A few weeks later he serves her papers but I'm the only one who moves out with him because my mom is a legitimately terrifying person.  

Over the next few weeks my mom continues to show up at my school and mess with stuff and do other creepy things like break into my dad's place and go in my room at night.  

Eventually, she basically kidnaps me from a friend's house and after she locks me in my old room at her place I try to make a run for it from the window.  I'm on the road a good couple miles from her place sprinting for my life to my buddy's place when I see her car on the horizon.  I continue running and notice she's speeding up and swerving her car towards me.  I jumped in a ditch so she missed, but then she turned around and tried to get me again when I resumed running.  Eventually I had to run through people's yards to get toy friend's house.

Classic story.

""...One time I was pretty drunk with a friend at a Target buying Risk (and no, we never finished playing the whole game). This little mexican 5-7 year old with a mohawk, was being an insufferable little shit in the action figure section. I heard him from like 5 aisles over and it was like nails on a chalkboard. I tell my friend, ""I'm gonna fart on this kids head. Watch and learn.""
I saunter on over to the aisle in question and see the vile little prick calling his mom an ""idiot"" for not buying him a huge fucking G.I. JOE The Movie vehicle (which pissed me off even more considering how awful that movie was. BUY SOME GOOD TOYS!) ""I already bought that one for you and you broke it by throwing it down the stairs"" ""SHUT UP. I NEED IT. IT'S THE ONLY ONE I DON'T HAVE NOW."" The mother was younger than me (I'm mid twenties) and gave a defeated look, ""I don't have enough money right now."" ""YOU ARE AN IDIOT,"" and continued to just berate and publicly shame this woman.
At the time, I was on a strict Chipotle carnitas burrito diet. And while I was watching all this, my stomach gave me an initial warning gurgle (very courteous stomach) telling me I was about an hour away from punishing the toilet. Serendipity! Destiny!
I inch a bit closer to my prey, inspecting some wrestling toys and pondering the weird homoeroticness of the whole 'sport' in general. The kid shouts ""FUCK YOU, I HATE YOU!"" The mom rolls her eyes and turns her back to the kid to ignore him. And could you believe it, the kid gets on his hands and knees and starts taking the toy out of the box. It's go time, motherfucker.
I position my back towards him and at this point am like 2 feet away from him. His head is down, getting frustrated with those god damn twisty tie things, and I go for the kill. I bend down to reach for the one of the toys on the lower shelf. At this point, my ass is INCHES away from this kids head.
Now, generally speaking, the best way to go about this is to act casual, drop your belly bomb, then walk away after a few seconds like nothing is out of the ordinary. I usually go one aisle over and listen to the kid's reaction in delight. However, today I couldn't help myself. I have my head tilted back looking at this kid out of the corner of my eye, to ensure accuracy.
I'm so close that from a distance it looks like I'm about to sit on him,. My friend sees this happening and can no longer contain himself. He's covering his mouth, but his 'hee-haw' hyperventilating donkey chortle is fairly audible over the late 90's pop muzak playing on the loudspeakers.
The kid immediately looks up towards the laughter, but can't help but notice there is an ass now directly in his face. Now, I'm trying not to laugh but also panicking as I just made eye contact with him. He furls his brow and I look over in the mother's direction, still back towards us. I relish in the moment and the look on this child's confused and naive face.
The initial blast was mighty and boisterous. I swear I saw his hair blowing in the wind (so to speak). If I wasn't wearing jeans, I think it could have probably blown over an empty soda can. I would call it ""a very fun fart"" (A++ would buy again). However, what immediately followed that out the chamber was truly horrifying. The fart's implication changed without notice and swiftly. It went from a joyous, dry airhorn squeal to a nefarious, hissing mephitis. I think the little moppet noticed the hateful metamorphosis before even I did because he wretched his neck violently trying to get away from the personified evil being fumigated into his soul. Because of his positioning (hovering over the toy, hands and knee), it was all in vain as the only way out was forward...and forward would mean certain death. I had positioned myself well on the higher ground, free to escape or relent at any time and him, poor and immobilized: biding his time until the cruel attack was over. Obviously, this child needed to re-read Sun Tzu.
In total, it lasted about 4 seconds but for that kid, it must have seemed like time was frozen. The long-term severe brain damage which he no doubt suffered, only added to that effect.
When I finished with my bidness (i.e. forcing a little boy to huff my farts), there was a silent, pregnant pause. The kid was clearly shocked and stunned. No one had ever stood up to this dwarf sociopath in his whole life. I had taken the words out of his mouth and filled it with fart.
I make my move first, picking up the toy I was ""reaching for"" off the low shelf, take a few steps forward and stare at it for a few seconds. On '2 alligator,' the only thing the kid could manage to do was burst into tears. My friend senses danger 'the jig is up' and his head darts for cover. The mom turns around to see her kid with an open toy, crying on the floor and me minding my own business.
She walks up to him and asks what's wrong but the kid can't speak. All he gets out is, ""BAWAWAAAWAFARTBAWAWA."" It took every fiber in my body not to laugh. I put the toy back on a middle shelf, turn around, give a final nonchalant looksy and then begin to take my exit.
Sensing that his assailant was getting away scot-free, he somehow managed to compose himself for a moment. He shouts, ""HE FARTED ON ME!"" I could feel him pointing at me but I continued to act like I was just browsing. I was ALMOST around the corner when the mom goes:
""Excuse me....sir....SIR!""
I turn around nonplussed, ""Uh...who? Me?"" while pointing to myself.
""Yes. Did YOU just FART on my son?""
Weighing my options, I played dumb. ""What? I mean, I did fart.""
""On my son?""
""Well, I mean, technically speaking...I mean...what is 'on'?""
""Why did you fart on my son?""
At this point the little kid has the look of schadenfreude on his face, happy to see me in trouble. Fuck you, I'M A MAN! I WILL FART ON YOU IF I PLEASE! I turn my attention to the little kid and stare at him, ""Because the whole store could hear him being a little, rotten asshole to his mother so I thought I'd come over here and treat him like one.""
The mom looks at me, her son and the scattered GI JOE/wrappers/box on the floor. The mom is puzzled as to what to do and says, ""Just..just go."" That's my cue! I turn around, walk away with little extra step. I look up to see the black orb of security cameras and all the stories on reddit about unjustly having to register as a sex offender flash before my eyes. As soon as I turn the corner, I book it outside as fast as I can while dialing my friend. Like a true friend, he is right out front with the engine running and Risk in the trunk.
We laugh on the car ride back about the whole scene. With a slight hint of seriousness in his tone, my friend asks me:
""Do you do that a lot?""
""Ahhh, not that much. Like once every 6 months or so.""
We both knew I was lying. We got to our other friends house, played risk until 4 in the morning while drinking scotch. Overall, I would say it was a preeeetay preeeeetay good day.""",null,0,cdnapbn,1rhfk4,AskReddit,top_day,3

After a few minutes of looking, I finally find a men's room. Turns out all the bathrooms in that building were fully tiled, and more echo-inducing than an empty cathedral. Meanwhile all the wonderful sausage I had just eaten was working its magic on my digestive tract... and uncontrollably erupted into the longest, loudest, butt-cheek-slappingest, earth-shakingest, wettest fart of my entire life, echoing merrily around the stalls.

I feel a lil rumble in the tummy so decide on a stall rather then a urinal. I'm perched upon my throne chatting with my bud, the bathroom was empty so it wasn't creepy.

I let out this tiny fart, like the sort of fart you would expect from a 5 year old girl. Of course my buddy starts laughing and mocking me, I have no choice at this point I must unleash the beast. I bear down and push with all my might, I hear the distinct creak of the bathroom door and footfalls of someone coming in. The poor bastard gets maybe 5 steps in when it happens.

The loudest most noxious gas I have ever passed in my life. This was loud mostly because of the small stall with tiling acting like an echo chamber. The damn thing lasted for about 10 seconds...in that time all I heard aside from my ass rending fart of doom was a loud ""fucking hell asshole"" and  very hurried footfalls out the door.

Then silence for a good minute, I'm recovering from this, because well it actually hurt. Then my buddy just starts laughing. We make our exit, luckily it was 11:30am so not many around to share in my shame/triumph.

Have had to have her committed to mental institutions multiple times and recently was nearly killed by an abusive partner who tore her insides to shreds. She is now about to have her 4th operation to try and fix it but she doesn't look after herself which is what cause the first 3 to fail, it sounds like all her problems but I am the one who has to try keep the family going and keep her at bay. That's just the tip of the iceberg but I get over telling my story to all the courts and police and blah blah blah that I have to tell so I'm stopping there before I even start talking about the 10,000 earthquakes to hit my city and resulting effects*

I know people are just trying to be nice and I know they could never know, but for me, I either let on that my shitty hand gets me down and open myself up to probing questions that can't be answered in short or keep on lying to that question.

It's the only way to make real connections. And if afraid and socially awkward is what you are, then so be it. If you have the courage to ""be afraid and saddle up anyways"" (john wayne) then you will find kindred spirits. Silence will ensure loneliness and further you lack of confidence. And believe me, the more you do it, the more comfortable you will become with it. You will find that some people will in fact like you despite your awkwardness, even like you for it, or  be drawn to it.

r9j0nr0nd0,"Apologies, but my lie is in need of substantial background information; way back when I was in the Sixth Grade, construction began for a real nice golf course on the edge of my middle-of-nowhere town. My friends and I heard the guy who financed most of the construction was going to be there to check on its progress. We had no idea who it was, but we went to see just in case we recognized him. The moment we set foot in the parking lot, who else do we see step out of his Jaguar, but his Airness himself ***MICHAEL JORDAN!!*** 

We didn't get to talk to him, but we found out he was building a house on the grounds for when we wanted to get away. We immediately started making crazy statements like Jordan was moving to our town and his kids were going to go to school with us. And even though everyone knew it was all false, we were all still excited there was even a connection between MJ and our rural community.

***OK...FINALLY***, fast forward a few years to high school, I was studying abroad in Brazil near Sao Paulo. I didn't speak the language at first and wasn't exactly overly interesting, so I barely talked to my classmates to start. One of the questions everyone always seemed to ask me though was if I knew anybody famous in the U.S. After about a month, I gave in and told them the small link my town had with Jordan which they were all amazed by.

After a while, I couldn't help myself and so I began telling everyone, and I mean everyone (it was my go-to conversation when talking to people at clubs) the exaggerations my friends and I used to joke about. Pretty soon I was ""best friends with Jordan's son back home"" and on a first name basis with the God of Basketball. The more stories I made up, along with my extensive knowledge of Jordan as he was my idol, the more convinced everyone was. Becoming ""the American who's friends with Michael Jordan"" got me invited to parties every weekend, endless free drinks and into the VIP section of clubs a handful of times. I even dated two gorgeous girls from my class there, which I'd like to fully attribute to my own charm, but I'm more realistic than that.

***TL;DR I told a bunch of Brazilians while studying abroad that I was close friends with Michael Jordan and his family, which got me popularity and VIP treatment***",null,0,cdnala5,1rhf0j,AskReddit,top_day,2

My son is only a few years away from having to deal with that sort of thing. For a young person it's one of the hardest moments you have to face (at the time. Later the real world has a way of upping the bar when it comes to tough experiences). If I can share anything with him to help him on that day, I guess it would be this.

""Remember when you were little an your favorite toy broke? You cried and screamed. Wouldn't let me take it away from you. Felt like the world was ending. It seems kind of silly now, but at that moment the pain you felt was real. Eventually you found a new toy and moved on, but part of you will always remember the broken one.

Relationships are like that. Once they break, they usually can't be fixed.No shame in being sad. Plenty of folks feel that way from time to time. It won't help now, but remember that what you feel today will someday feel as foolish as when you got so upset about that toy.

Now, I'm not going to minimize what you feel, but I will tell you this. What you will regret more than the relationship in the years to come is the way you behaved after it was finished. It's tempting to say things, or do things, in the midst of that passion that you'll feel crappy about for years to come.

Take the time you need, son, and let it out...but do it in private. Minute you walk out your door you need to keep your head up, back straight and keep a smile on your face.

Someday, perhaps, you'll find a toy that's not broken and can't be broken.""

Well, not sure how that advice will mean to him. Thing about advice is that it tends to get ignored in the heat of emotion. Still, it's a pretty true statement. As I said, however, eventually you get that perspective. It's the hardest part, but you'll get it eventually. Things get much better from there.

We were in a normal relationship, with increasing senior year of highschool levels of sexual activity.  When we had rounded the bases of ways to be sex each other up, sexual penisvagina intercourse was the next step.  She began to panic. She became reclusive for a bit.  Then she broke up with me at the park.  I remember how bad she felt for having to come out to me in order to break up the relationship.  I asked why she didn't mention any of it sooner.  She, tearfilled, screamed ""I didn't know myself!""  I felt like surely I would be some exception... but it didn't turn out that way. 

After all the tears were gone, we were sitting at the picnic tables talking about what it all meant for her.  And I remember asking, ""Wait, does this mean you like Barbara Streisand, now?""

I also confessed to her about my interest in pegging and she told me I didn't feel so manly anymore and sexy times were never the same.

Started blaming myself thinking I was doing something wrong. However he was totally smitten over me. He would buy me thoughtful gifts and flowers he was just a sweet guy. One day he told me he thought he was bi and I supported him. Life went on and we eventually separated and he became very bitter towards me. He would send me letters saying I made him gay and that I should feel ashamed. I really felt like he struggled a lot and wanted someone to blame.

It blew my mind and changed my life. Seriously. Once I got home I drew all the characters from memory as best I could. I saw the comics soon after, and was able to relive the film thanks to the neighborhood barbershop. My father, whom I rarely saw, bought me the first few Marvel comics that came after the movie. I got C-3PO for Easter. The toys came in a steady stream until 1981. I read the comic books until issue 50. My mother allowed m to cut school to see the first showings of Empire and Jedi. I went as Luke for Halloween  one year, and as a Storm Trooper another. Every one of my mother's boyfriends bought me at least one Star Wars toy. I got Boba Fett in the mail in trade for 5 proofs of purchase. Bossk also. Stopped believing in Santa Claus when I accidentally saw the Death Star play-set in the trunk of Mom's Toyota. Traded Empire cards with a girl in 4th grade who had more cards than anyone. Learned to identify cards in unopened packs until I finally located the Leia card from Empire series one. Repurchased the Cantina play-set and all the monsters and bounty hunters 2 years ago once I made enough money to replace the old toys.

3lazycats,"I have hired a lot of people, and most of them are/were  average/unspectacular. Average people make up the majority, you are in good company. However all of them had ""their shit together."" Here's what I look for in a new college hire.

* Phone skills: You answer the phone professionally and with confidence. The music is already off. You let it go to voicemail if you aren't able to take an uninterrupted call. You have a voicemail message that states your name, and helps me understand I reached the right person. Simple, no musical interlude (unless it's germane to your profession), unrambling ""Hi this IThatAsianGuyI, please leave a message."" This probably sounds basic, but it's becoming less and less common. Phone skills are the number one reason I don't call people back for an interview if you get past the stack of resumes.

* You actually have good references because you have a good reputation for what you know and how you do it. You've accomplished things outside of the classroom. You've done more than the minimum. They don't have to be HUGE things, but you finish what you start and people like working with you.

Good references grow out of good relationships. I don't want to call the most impressive person on your list, I want to talk to the person who *found you most impressive.*  I'd rather talk to your manager at Burger King who will tell me how reliable and hardworking you were, than your Professor who confuses you with another student. 

  -  To get good references you have to accomplish things working with other people: work on *finished* projects, at *productive"" internships as well as *any paying* jobs. 
   -  To get good references start building your ""professional network"" and socialize to get on those projects, internships and even shitty paid jobs. 
   - Class projects rarely count in my mind as things to put on a resume, because it doesn't show you doing anything in other than the minimum to complete your classwork. However if that class project far exceeded the scope of the assignment and you took it to new places, please go ahead and list it as an accomplishment.

A good reference phone call is a pleasure. The person really liked working with you and valued your contribution. A good reference basically tells me I'm the dumbest dumbass on dumbass planet if I don't hire you. I often wish the candidate could hear what their reference said. On the otherhand a bad reference is someone who doesn't remember what you worked on together, doesn't give a shit or worse doesn't even call me back. 

* You dress, smell and groom yourself nicely. I can't tell you how many young people look like they are totally uncomfortable in their ""work attire"" or how many look like big versions of little kids on picture day. Work on your personal/professional style. Experiment, figure out your ""dapper"" look and feel comfortable in it. 

* You are nice to everyone you meet. This doesn't mean you spend time flattering/pandering, but it does mean you make and sustain eye contact and smile. You can practice this everyday, particularly with cashiers and other folks you meet during the day. I can't stress this enough. Cultural fit is all about your attitude and how well you get along with everyone.

* You have managed your online identity. I can find you on Linked in, and you have a profile written that lists your skills with a good photo. You have an email address that doesn't make me giggle.  I'm only going to spend a minute googling you, so make sure I don't find the pictures of you drunk with a penis drawn on your face in that time.

Note: I once hired a serious young man after I saw his ""stupid party photos."" I was deciding between 2 candidates, and did a deeper review of what I could find about them online. These photos showed me he had a sense of humor. They weren't outrageous but they did show a side of him that he was far more fun than he represented himself.

And each night I would line them up according to size then cover them in the dirt (they were my secret stash). Sadly my 4 year old depth perception must have been off because I covered them with a solid 6 inches of dirt and then packed it around them. Every day for 6 days. Had a small birm on the back of our campsite by the end. 

Apparently my mom noticed me collecting the frogs but thought it was cute (I would talk to them the whole time- not a sneaky child). My father was completely unaware however. As we went to pack up my mom asked me where my frog friends were so I could put them back into the water. This was when she learned of the Frog Cemetery behind the tent. I was scolded and my father said something along the lines of ""hopefully you didn't kill them all""

Fast forward to the next summer and one of the local news stories is a large reduction in the frog population at said lake and the influx of other bugs making it a difficult place to fish/camp. Apparently it took years for them to come back.

ZeamiEnnosuke,"Nothing. I can't stop it. Heck I often think about stuff that is 5+ years ago and how stuff would've been if this particular thing did not happen.

Most of the stuff I over think are situations where I think that I did not react right, mostly when I reacted based on feelings not on thoughts. I can't stand it. I hate it, it feels for me like I'm lost the control and because of that bad stuff happened.

E.g. Last weeks Saturday (the 16th) my dad wanted to go to a zoo in the Netherlands and asked me if I wanted to come with him. I however just wanted to sleep long and do a few house chords. When he came back he told me that he blacked out and was in a hospital in the Netherlands because he broke his finger and shit like that.
Well the rest of the day I just thought about what if I had tagged along? Maybe I could have helped him, maybe we would've had some breakfast before we headed into the zoo and stuff like that.

I thought about it all night, even through I was in a club and got hammered, I still thought about it. Even now I'm thinking about it, but now it's more about the possible consequences this shit has and how I wasn't there for him to help him. Fuck it.

Another thing I often remember is like 7 or 8 years ago. I was 14 or 15 and my crush of that time asked me to talk with her between classes in school. She then proceeded to tell me that she was in love with me and what an awesome dude I'm, but freaking idiot me chickened out. I'm always thinking, what would've happened if I didn't chicken out? Maybe we would still be together? Maybe my life would've went different and more positive from that point on?

After all I'm to pathetic to stop doing it. Even through it causes much trouble e.g. I loose appetite when I'm over thinking resulting sometimes in me only eating a slice of bread for like 2-3 days straight.",null,0,cdnb4ec,1rhe0c,AskReddit,top_day,1

Tempest123,"/r/anime /r/Animesuggest are two great places to help you get started.

My personal recommendation to start out with would be:

- Fullmetal Alchemist(2003) then Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
- Cowboy Bebop
- Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

Then once you have you're bearings, there is a whole world of anime to explore.

My personal recommendations:

- Steins;Gate
- Attack on Titan
- Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya
- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
- Neon Genesis Evangeion + End of Evangelion + Rebuild of Evangelion 1 &amp; 2 (WARNING don't watch this franchise first, seriously don't)",null,1,cdn9n04,1rhdwy,AskReddit,top_day,6

duntcherg,"Honestly you should have given us a little more to go on. It's hard to suggest things when we have no idea what your interests are. That being said, here's my advice.

If you just want to dip your toe in the water, I would suggest starting with a couple of films rather than series. Some stand outs to me are:

* Spirited Away

* Paprika

* The Girl Who Leapt Through Time

* Grave of the Fireflies

If you would rather start with series, or if you watch the movies and decide you'd like to try going further, here are some of the more accessible and relatable anime (some of them are a bit much if you're not used to the culture):

* Death Note (extremely popular, even with people who aren't into anime. Psycho-thriller type series)

* Samurai Champloo (a great introduction to Japanese culture, albeit feudal Japan. Some cool western influences and references.)

* AnoHana (a story both heartbreaking and heartwarming about young friends)

* Toradora/Clannad/Ouran High School Host Club (if you're into romance)

If you want to take things even further, here are some of my favourites:

* Steins;Gate

* Gantz

* Elfen Lied

* Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan)

* Monogatari

* Psycho-Pass

* Mitsudomoe

* Haruhi

So back to the party, we are all dancing on this platform that is crowded with people. This guy keeps on rubbing up against my backside and holding onto my hips, which eventually leads to his hands sliding to my ass and squeezing. I keep on trying to elbow him out of my way and move, or to move his hands, but he's bigger/stronger than me. I'm also kind of short and inconspicuous looking, and I don't think the people around me really noticed or cared. It was also too loud to tell him to fuck off loudly, because I was making eye contact with him and obviously was avoiding being around him/moving him off of me, and he wouldn't stop.

My friends didn't seem to notice that I was moving around the platform to get away from the guy. He kept on following me and was really getting into my business. His fingers were wiggling their way into my waistband and he was trying to grab me up front. 

Eventually, I just told them, ""Dude, if we don't leave this area, this guy is going to start fingerbanging me."" 

I got a couple of incredulous looks, and I just walked off the platform and led the way to a new spot.

I asked later, and of course they didn't see anything. 

TL;DR - Stranger tried to fingerbang me on stage. ",null,0,cdn9x2y,1rhdwf,AskReddit,top_day,1

cuddlemaster218,"My first week of college I saved a man from bleeding on the street.  I was coming back to my dorm from a party. The guy I was with missed the turn onto campus I saw a guy face down in the street covered in blood. I told the guy to stop the car jumped out to see if the guy was ok. I told the guy I was with to call an ambulance the guy covered in blood stand straight up and tells us not to call. He is a much older gentlemen he is probably 50s-60s. He tells us he took his pain meds and passed out on his evening walk and we agree to take him back home. He jumped in the car and he does live close by I thought maybe he has family who can convince him to go to the hospital. Once I finish walking him to the door I realize he lives alone and to make it worse he completely passes out. The guy I was with I tell him to call an ambulance and he is so freaked out about getting in trouble for not calling earlier refuses I throw my phone at him and tell him to call. He gives fake names to the dispatcher. Meanwhile I am looking through this guys medicine cabinate and trying to patch up to wound on his forehead. Less then 5 minutes later I see and hear ambulances and the guy I originally was with literally dragged me out of the apartment and said he didn't want to stay for questioning. I was covered in this mans blood and he didn't want to stay for additional questioning froma cops. Man had ambulance rush into his apartment as I'm

These men and woman go through just as much hell as the people in the military, but they aren't treated as heroes in society. They have seen shit that most people couldn't imagine seeing. My dad was on the fire department for 25 years and he has seen more people die/dead because of accidents, murder, suicide etc. than most military people see in a lifetime. 

These two stories will forever stick with me about what he had to go through. 

He once went to an accident where a drunk driver hit a pedestrian crossing the street at 70mph. The pedestrians torso was on the hood, his legs were 50 ft from the car, and it took them 2 hours to find the guys head that was under the backseat of the car because of the force of the impact.

The other is the story when I almost lost my dad to a gun. ON his birthday he responded to a minor car accident. The guy that hit the other car was drugged up on whatever and pulled a gun out on my dad when he approached the car.  The only thing my dad could do was attack the man and get the gun away from him, police tasers didn't even affect the guy.

Here is the article for those who don't believe the story.

lay4la4,"CPS (Child Protective Service) Social Workers

Think about it. You have a person going into the profession of social work because, for the most part, they want to help. Not because they want to feel like some sort of super hero but because they have this feeling that helping struggling families is the right thing to do. However, helping people isn't always as easy as it seems. Why? Because CPS Social workers are underpaid, overworked, and constantly monitored in EVERYTHING they do.. Why?? Because EVERYONE is watching. The biological parents, the foster Parents, their lawyers, the family court judge, the police, teachers, your supervisor, your supervisor's supervisor, other social workers and the children. On average a social worker's case load should be between 25 to 30 cases however, where I'm from, the average case load is between 35 to 45 cases and rising.

Lets start with the bio parents. The bio parents will already be pissed at you for several reasons. They aren't looking at you as someone who will help them, they are looking at you as the person who STOLE their babies. You're the bad guy, **YOU** took them away. They take on the ""it's not me, it's you"" mentality right away. You have some parents who either refuse to listen to anything you say, threaten you with lawyers if they don't get their way, and spend more time fighting with you or trying to prove that they are ""wonderful parents"" instead of actually trying to get their children back. Or you get those types of parents who completely abandon their children as soon as they're placed in protective custody. No phone calls, no visitation with their children, just nothing. Next, you deal with the foster parents. Now some foster parents are amazing but then there are those who are on the brink of having CPS called on them as well. They take children by the barrel full because they want their check. They do the bare minimum when it comes to raising a child to the point where the child is just a roommate instead of part of the family. Then the social worker has this eternal dilemma. Do you let a child be in a home like this or let them grow up in a foster home? 

You have family lawyers making sure you don't mess up because if you do, it's not the parents fault.. **it's yours**. It's not the mother's fault she didn't go to drug counseling, you didn't sign the referral. It's not the father's fault he didn't visit his children, you didn't call him to tell him what time. They look for anything to dispute in court (because it's their job) but in the end the one who gets put on the stand for their actions is the social worker and not the parents or parent who carried out the abuse. The judge is the same way. When social workers place children into protective custody they aren't armed with anything, not even pepper spray or a bullet proof vest if parents were to get physical, which they do. They are armed with a pen, a clipboard, and our badges. They go into the houses not even police officers won't go to. And get this, when we are going there to removal a child, it is illegal for social workers to go into a house if the parent does not give consent because they don't have the authority. 

Finally, after all of this, you finally get to work with the child who has come to you because of something horrible. They have either been sexual abused, physically abused, or neglected and many times by their own family. I couldn't tell you how many horror stories I've read. Parents so high on drugs that when they went to go take their children chicken noodle soup, they've dropped it on their child causing severe 3rd degree burns, mothers so angry at their children they've left scars on body parts because their little boy ate the last bag of Hot Cheetos. Children crying and screaming, begging to go back to their parents because that's all they know.. and yet Social Workers have to work with these same people because that is their job.. and because they promised to help those in need...

Alatian,"I think this question greatly varies from man to man. I'll give an example: I have two really close friends, who are also my roommates, and also myself.

Myself: General appearance related ones are always nice, especially since I suffer from low self-esteem. Less than a year ago, I looked...well, I wasn't awful, but not the best looking guy either. Recently I've cut my hair, got contacts, my skin has cleared up somewhat, my social skills dramatically improved, got nicer clothes, etc. Still working on my severe lack of self-confidence, but that will come with time. I still view myself as ugly, even though objectively I know I'm a pretty good looking guy now.

So it's weird and AMAZING when someone calls me handsome. Even six months ago, that never used to happen to me. I'm really good friends with a group of girls, and they all say I look way better now, which gives me little happiness butterflies in my stomach when I think about it. Specifically, I'm really proud of my eyes. I wore glasses all my life, and my eyes fully stood out when I got contacts. They're really big for a guy, and icy-blue, almost grey. Every time someone points them out, I get a little giddy :)

At the same time, I have awesome confidence when it comes to my intelligence and personality. I have a reputation of being a really friendly guy, and I never get in fights or arguments (well, rarely!). I was a ""gifted"" kid my whole life, and always looked at as the smart one in the group. For some reason, because I'm so self-assured of these qualities, compliments in these areas are diminished, because I hear them so often and know them to be true.

One roommate, Tony, is the most confident guys I know. People assume he isn't smart, because he's a big guy that speaks slowly. He's funny, he's outgoing, and it feels like he can speak to anyone. When someone compliments him on his confidence, he shrugs it off. ""I know that already"", sort of deal. He slacked off in high school and is working through community college now, so when someone compliments him on his intelligence, his breaks out in a grin.

Then there's Dawson. Dawson is EXTREMELY handsome. Always gets ladies telling him that. He looks somewhat similar to James Franco, if that puts a picture in your head. The same pattern follows here. Compliments about his looks hardly affect him, while compliments about his personality or intelligence mean a whole lot more.

So, my roommates and I have reached our own little conclusion. People are more affected by the compliments that dispel their own insecurities, and least affected by the compliments that they already know to be true.

BlackKitty0937,"I actually just had a really traumatizing dream this morning, I even had to tell my friend about it. So here it goes: There was warfare going on, almost like it came out of a Red Dawn movie, bombs going off; airplanes being heard overhead. It was scary, I had that gut feeling I wasn't gonna live another day. I was wandering around with an ex of mine looking for shelter, and there's just a bunch of shady, angry looking people. I had a butterfly knife with me, to appear more threatening, but one guy approached me anyways. After all the kicking and punching, he manages to rape me, but in the end I slit his throat. 
I manage to find shelter with what appears to be a barn or toolshed. My mom(I have no idea who she is in real life but I associated her as my mom) happened to be there and I felt a slight relief for a moment. As I was about to tell her all I've been through, a saw blade in the shape of a giant letter 'V' (idk..) slowly pierces right through the entire front of her body. So she's being perfectly cut through by the letter V, her body is literally shaking and she's in complete shock. She was also a rather large woman, I'd say maybe 250-300lbs. Then she fell into a wood chipper on the wall, which was more akin to a paper shredder I guess. 
All while this was happening, I'm standing in shock, and for some reason, I turned into a male? That was weird, she kept calling me son and I felt like I'd been her son my whole life. And there are a group of men laughing while she's being shredded into chunks of flesh. One guy even tried unraveling her purple floral dress from the shredder but it was caught and mangled with the rest of the cut up body. 
I woke up, and I still had 3 more hours of sleep before I actually needed to get up. Yeah, I was on the verge of vomiting and pissing myself those whole 3 hours. It's been on my mind all day. ",null,7,cdna1t3,1rhd85,AskReddit,top_day,30

Adrenaline_Flux,"I had this dream my Freshman year of college. I usually have trouble sleeping and semi-frequently experience sleep paralysis, lucid dreams, ""Inception""-esque dreams, etc. Just weird sleeping habits, in general. This was the first, and really only, time that I experienced the three aforementioned dream types at once. 

It began with me lying in my bed, on the internet. Probably surfing Reddit as I often did that when I struggled to sleep. My roommate came into the room and I asked him where he had been. He laughed and told me that he had just been at a crazy party. This was normal as he would almost always be back later than me on weekend nights. However, I quickly remembered that this was a Monday night - he isn't one to go out during the week, and certainly not on a Monday. When I confronted him about it, his entire demeanor changed. Gone was the roommate that I knew. ""I really wish you hadn't asked that,"" he said.

The lights went out. I was lying in my bed on my back. He walked over and his entire configuration had changed. He now looked tall and lanky, as though he had no flesh on his bones nor blood in his body. He was dark and appeared to be wearing a cloak. I imagine he was what Death looks like. I was crippled with fear and could not move a single muscle. He ripped into my stomach and an intense pain filled me. I've been told that you're not supposed to feel pain from your dreams, but I have a few times and this was one of those times.

A flash of light. Suddenly, I'm no longer in my college town. I'd awoken in my car in a parking lot I recognized from my hometown. I saw my mother. I was excited to see her, to be awake, to know no horror remained. However, immediately, she began lashing into me. She told me about how she and my father were disappointed in me and how they don't really love me and would never love me. Nobody would ever love me. They listed off every reason why I'm a piece of shit. 

Just as I thought I could handle no more, the darkness returned and I was lying in my bed once more. I looked over and saw my roommate passed out in his bed. I believed I was awake, but then our door began to open. The shadowy figure from before emerged and made his way slowly toward me. He stood over me and did not attack this time. However, I was filled with a new fear. Not fear that I would be harmed, but just... fear. That was short-lived though. My fear left me, as did the anxiety I am constantly filled with, and with it too my happiness. He was equivalent to a dementor in that it felt as though every emotion and ounce of life besides sadness and hopelessness began to leave my body. I felt broken down, worthless, and as though I was not only in danger of losing happiness forever, but the memory of what happiness was. Just as I felt my tank was about to hit E, I jolted.

I was covered in sweat. I looked over and saw my roommate passed out in his bed. I looked toward the door, expecting it to open and the shadowy figure to come for me once more. Alas, he never came. I was awake for real this time, but it took me quite a while to truly believe it. I did not sleep for another two hours and I spent the next 36-48 hours semi-questioning my own reality.

The weirdest part though was that the woman I was following was decaying, like there was pestilence coming out of her and she was basically rotting. And then when she realizes she has to go on the escalator, she looks to her left and she sees herself, or at least a copy of herself. But it was perfect.

I entered my house and found a blank piece of paper on a small coffee table in the entry room. I pulled a pen from my pocket, started to write what seemed like a letter but got frustrated and crumpled it up. I walked into a room to the right of the entryway and opened a closet, on a shelf high up in the closet was a loaded handgun. I walked back to entryway, put the gun to the side of my head, took a look at the crumpled up letter and pulled the trigger.

pomjuice,"**Story Time**

It's a cold october night, you know the kind. The frost is tickling the tips of the grass blades. In a cloudless sky, the moon hangs over the sleepy New England suburb. I wake up to the sound of people gathering outside my house. There are people holding torches and pitchforks... I hear an old timey radio voice from the other room ""There have been reports of multiple sightings... stay in your homes. I repeat, stay in your homes...""

The mob is forming outside my house, growing larger. I rush into the other room to see my parents. My father is holding a pitchfork and tell me we need to get into the attic. A few family friends have shown up, clutching their children in fear. We all gather in the hay filled attic (Why is my house a barn all of a sudden?).  The reporter on the radio can be faintly heard ""Be careful, it seems these creatures are dangerous *muffled groaning before static*""

The static is broken by the wooshing sound of the UFO's. I hear loud bursts of noise, and the crowd outside screams. I run to the window, and the once angry mob has been reduced to a pile of charred bodies.  I rush back to where my parents are. My father looks ill. He's sweating profusely. My mother comforts him but it's not helping. His head is in his hands.

He looks up, and I see his eye.. it's swollen, and popping out of his face. It's growing larger and larger. It falls out of his face and he collapses on the floor! My mother screams in terror as the eye starts crawling like a slug towards me.  It has teeth, and is the size of a balloon.  I realize the aliens have harvested my father's body - and the world is at it's end.

Then I woke up.

I would appear in my house, in complete darkness. There is no-one around so I leave and go looking for anyone. Once I am outside there is still darkness but the moon is huge and shining bright. Which is the only light source. 

I am running all over but I eventually end up in my backyard, but it is different. At this point Jason(Hockey mask and chainsaw) is chasing me. While running I am screaming for help but noone comes. I eventually find my dad and he tells me to follow him. 
As we are running he runs through the bush entrance(Our backyard had a hidden garden which thick bushes all around hidding it from sight.)
 But we I go through he is gone and there is a huge stonewall with a circle door with carving on it. The moon is directly above this door and it is illuminated. I always stop here an I  can hear the evil guy coming. So I climb into a tree and make my way ontop of a very larg branch where I can see everything.

The meat had a funk to it, and I realized it was human parts.  I said no thanks, and saw a man down the hill in a small wooded area, so I start to walk down the hill and investigate.  Before I made it to where the man was, my foot sank into the ground, and a huge chunk of Earth broke way..  Underneath were corpse upon corpse.  Some old, some fresh, some old in age, and some babies.  I smelled the stench from it, and there were worms and muddy flesh galore.  The man spotted me and ran up to me questioning if my relatives at the house had told about him.  I told him ""No, I'm just trying to go home"".  He turns all evil on me and tells me he can't let me leave, and starts to run after me.  I run into the wooded area and find a tree big enough that I could hide behind.  I looked around to see if the man was around, but he was gone.  I look back at the tree, and there was a hole carved out and a burning candle inside, along with a dead baby corpse.  As soon as I had scanned over what was there, the man appeared again to my side and he was mad.  He said, ""You'll have to pay now for sure!""  He grabbed up the dead baby from the tree and pried the back of its skull open.  He held the top of the skull in one hand as a bowl and used his other to scoop out the decomposing brain.  He plopped it into the skull bowl and started to knead it and squish it into a greenish/brownish/reddish putrid soup.  He scooped up the foul soupy brain and started slinging it at me, going up my nose, in my mouth, and splattering all over me.  I ran away trying to spit out the brain and blow it out my nose, and then I was picked up by friends that took me to their house.

I rush to the mirror to sprint through the morning routine, fumbling with my contact lenses, and notice a little bruise or scuff near my eye. I pinch the skin slightly, to see if its a pimple or scab, and it just pulls away like wet linen. The skin tears a little, and I can see my facial muscles and fat twitching underneath the ballooning dermis. It settles back against my face trapping air bubbles between the skin and muscle, smearing to the right so that one of my nostrils is stretched across the side of my nose. I start saying ""Oh fuck, ah, oh fuck, I - I can fix this"", but it comes out garbled because my lips have become detached from the muscle. I desperately try to smear it back in place, patting out the air pockets, and moving my nose holes back over my nostrils. For some reason I still think making it to class is important, so I throw on some clothes, and readjust my face after the collar of my shirt bunches it down near my mouth. I stumble out of my dorm into an reasonably harsh and cold wind. The breeze starts rushing through my eye holes and catching against the inside, inflating, and further separating it from the side of my skull. I can feel the freezing wind drying out my eyeballs, and muscles. My face is flapping around my skull making little tearing noises with each gust, and whipping at my eyeballs, making it impossible to see. The wind dies down a little, and I'm kind of stumbling through a parking lot and I can feel my cheeks and lips idly slapping against my teeth with each step. Suddenly a huge gust rears up, and tears it off my skull. A cloud of dust and bark carried by the gust gets stuck to my eyeballs, stinging an tearing them up. I can't see where my face went. I start clawing around the asphalt for it, panicky and blind, but it's not anywhere near me.

She's making hotdogs but they're the bare minimum plain hot dogs - literally just a roll and a vienna (wiener). Not even butter. I'm hungry as most people are after waking up so I eat it without complaint. Once I'm done I walk to the fridge for cold water. I open the fridge door to find that ALL my favourite condiments, cheese and butter was there. I was full now so there was no use but I was so mad at her that she made me eat a plain hotdog. I was angry and fustrated that there was nothing I could about it.I actually woke up with tears streaming down my face. I probably shouldn't be telling Reddit this but her name was Erin.

2. My most vivid and most memorable wet dream didn't involve sex, nudity or erotic scenes. I had feelings for (and still do) a girl I went to high school with. I had a dream I was running around the school sports fieldand there she was on the sidelines, just her alone, cheering me on and clapping for.

I had a pistol on me, and I pulled it and started shooting. I killed all of them, though I had to chase one down before I shot him in the back. Then I loaded the bodies in the trunk of my car and drove him, intending to destroy the bodies later.

I got home, and it was a nondescript holiday celebration, with lots of family members. I parked the car, went inside, and did some generic family activities (I don't remember what I did). I remember that I was trying to get back to my car so that I could leave, but one of my grandmothers kept interrupting me. I had this constant fear that someone would open the trunk of my car and find the bodies. Finally, I managed to get back to my car and drive away.

I drove for a bit, and I think I was trying to get to a farm or to some forest so that I could bury the bodies. For some reason, I stopped at a suburban house (It was a two story ranch-style house) and dropped the bodies off in the mudroom. Then I hid in the attic. After hiding there for a bit, I returned downstairs to find the family (which I hadn't seen before) undressing the bodies and loading one into a big cooking pot.

There's freaking mountain of inventory and crap, stacks, walls of boxes and shit lined up everywhere. The girl and I are alone, but stilling following the Target employee like Alice followed the rabbit. Finally we get to what looks like a secret government facility and the girl (who somehow knows where everything is at this point) leads the way towards this amazing new product these freaking chemists have been working on. 

Once we get to a room with out people she opens a drawer and pulls out two Eeyore dolls, (from Winnie the pooh) which are almost like silk. I held one up to my face and it started talking when it randomly bit my tongue, but it felt more like a thorn than teeth. Suddenly the doors burst open and this woman in a lab coat points at us and shouts ""stop them!!"" even though it's only her standing there. We go fucking bolting out another door which seemed to have just appeared but was leading us straight out of the building. 

There was now a group of scientists chasing us out of Target while we clung to talking Eeyore dolls. I hadn't realized I was still holding one so I threw it back at them and they stopped.

gottrawn,"I very rarely have dreams, but the few that I have successfully burned themselves into my memory.

My favorite is one where, for starters, the whole world is a grizzly bear, curled up in a ball shape. It's fur is the grass and forests, we mow it where we live and it grows high in some spots, that's just background information that we all know and not really important at all, just to help you imagine the scenery. All of my friends and I live in a small community in Alaska, each of our seven households (which consist of 1-5 people and are in an oval shape surrounding a well) produce a certain necessity and we live in a sort of utopian society, just hanging out and living off the land. Then the United States declares war on somewhere, I'm not even sure. A draft is issued, and one of my friends, Joe, gets sent to war.

Things change. One of the households stops hunting and spends all of their time protesting the war outside of their house. Another household stops making clothing and starts writing articles and doing interviews about how the war should end. One household starts a campaign for the presidency as an anti-war candidate, one man sits atop the well all day and night just looking at the sky, and I, who live in my house alone, just sort of sit around looking at the fireplace.

One day I decide to go visit Joe on front-lines. When I show up, I am directed to where he should be, and when I approach him he turns around and sees me, smiles and waves, and then a bullet flies through his chest. Cotton stuffing, like stuffed animal stuffing, starts blasting out of the gunshot wound. Like a geyser, just spewing enormous amounts of stuffing. It starts collecting on the ground a few meters away and very quickly becomes a pile as large as I am. Joe is now mostly a &lt; shape, his gunshot now taking up most of his visible mass as the force of the stuffing had torn his skin even further. The stuffing starts spilling over, it's a mountain, Joe starts spinning around quickly and the amount of stuffing coming from his body increases to an impossible point. Dozens of other soldiers and I start running away, but we are already covered in and wading through stuffing. The stuffing ends up filling up the entire world, we all float to space and suffocate or drown in our houses. The end.",null,0,cdnc04g,1rhd85,AskReddit,top_day,1

Magistralka,"So 90% of my dreams since I remember  are nightmares and I die in 50% of them. But it is not just I'm about to die and I wake up, but I continue dreaming even after I'm dead. Those nightmares are fine, I'm used to them and I actually find them interesting. 
When I was 15 I had this dream series that took a week or so. 
Night 1: I dreamt that I cut my hand, cleaned the blood and realised that I have no wound and the blood is not mine.
Night 2: I dreamt that I was in some sort of garden, I picked a black and yellow rose, one of its thorns pierced my skin, but again the blood wasn't mine, and there was no wound. 
Night 3: My bf at the time took me to a place where all my friends where writing names and phone numbers of hot girls on little sheets of paper for him, the name on one side, and the phone number on the other. So I got sad and mad and I smashed a vase with a black rose with my hand and the thing with the blood happened again. 
Night 4: Till night 4 everything was a bit strange, but it was fine, the dreams weren't even nightmares. Yeah they got that link of the same stuff happening again and again but that was all. So night 4. Imagine a really old movie, black and white,the picture gets bright or blurry in seconds, that sort of stuff. First it was only a blackish screen with that old movie effect then from the bottom right corner up grew a rose, it bloomed and started to wither down fast. When the flower was dead on the screen popped up a little piece of paper with a strange line of letters and numbers(like a code or smth), it turned round few times, and then the code went red(the only colour in the dream) and blood started dripping from them. The screen went red and then turned into black again. Then a figure started coming closer and it was my bf at the time, with the most heartbreaking look on his face, so he looks at me, gives me a smile that says ""I'm not alive anymore"" tunes back and walks away. And the blackish screen from the beginning stayed till I woke up. 
It was freaky but it got worse. I dreamt the same thing 3 more nights. The only thing that changed was the code on the pieces of paper. After those 4 nights of that thing in my head, and no other dreams I was scared of falling asleep, I did everything that I could think of so I would stay awake. 
I never dreamt of it again. That is the dream that have freaked me out the most and 6 years later It still gives me the chills. And I gotta say that there was e period that I had some nightmares I do not remember but I was waking up screaming and with deep bleeding scratches on my back that I made with my nails ( my life at the point was perfectly fine and I was happy).

So I'm in a house somewhere, there's some green grass outside the kitchen window on the back side of the room, where the fridge is also located on the right hand side. So I take a look in the fridge, I see some rotten cheese and I smell it, it smell like the taste of Skittles. So a few minute passes, and suddenly there's this big ass motherfucking SWAT van outside, from where there comes a witch with a frying pan through the window.

After she gets inside the building, she starts chasin me throughout the house. The frying pan starts to burn and some chicken wings starts coming out of it. She then proceeds to burn down the house, whereas the rest pf the story is unrecognizeable from my memory, unfortunately.

I'm sorry if the grammar is shit or if there's alot of typos, but I'm om mobile and I cba to spellcheck.

Built_From_Rubbish,I was out hunting bears when all of a sudden I was knocked down by Bear Grylls. The next thing I remember is being in a cage made of branches and sticks and BG was a couple yards away sitting in some sort of high throne. He had a crown on and bears were all around him. It gets hazy after that; I remember being roped up to a pole and hung over an open fire or something to that effect.

so i have had a recurring dream for quite a while where i am running away from something but im not quite sure what it is.  Anyway when im running i feel like i lose momentum and need to push off a wall with my feet like you would in a pool when your doing lengths.  
So one night this dream comes about again, however its set in medieval times and im running from some big guy with a pick axe in his hand.  Im running and running having to stop and push off from a wall every so often and eventually i just think 'fuck it, i cant run any more' (this is the first time iv ever stopped in my dream to be caught).  So i turn around and wait a few seconds and this big guy comes running at me and swings his pick axe at me slicing my neck open i can feel the blood pouring out of my neck on to my hands and the warmth from the blood on my hands and feel myself getting faint before i slowly fade away and see a bright white light.  I then suddenly wake in a shock with my hands still warm and on my neck.

They weren't like cute capuchins either, they were terrifying eat your face off baboons.  They surrounded my bed, which was in the middle of the room for some reason, and all stared at me. I was sure I was done for when I gorilla came out of the hole carrying a pot of tea. He sat down and the baboon went into my closet and came out dressed in a bunch of our Halloween costumes.  There was a ninja, a hobo, an army monkey, a wizard monkey, a chef monkey, and that's all the ones I can remember. All the suits were oddly fitting, well, because monkeys were wearing them. The gorilla then produce some cups for the monkeys and I and they all sat around me sipping cups of tea. My mom bursts through the door with panicked eyes and when she sees the tea party going on she leaves and comes back with some cookies.  The monkeys and gorilla all stand up and politely and in single file get a cookie.  The ninja monkey got one for me so I didn't have to get out of bed.  A when they finished the monkeys took off their costumes and put them away. They then one by one crawled onto the tea pot. The gorilla picked it up and left through the hole.

&gt; So I'm here standing alone in an abandonned building without any windows, just the frames of them. I slowly walk to one of them and suddenly a music starts to play, I don't know why but I always refer this music to one of ""Alice in wonderland"". As I come closer to the window frame, the small garden appears to me, it's dark outside as if there were heavy clouds. Suddenly a really fast moving shadow is running in the garden and disappear in an instant. As I lean on the frame, I'm surprised to find a bouquet of white roses that suddenly got drops of blood on them, as I start to look up I'm instantly teleported to another room of the building. I hear children playing in the next room. I decide to go and take a look. In the room were sitting in round ~8 kids playing with an object put in the middle. As I came closer to inspect the object, I discover a weird machine that would roll just like casino machine but it looked more like a writing machine. Then the machine starts going nuts and instead of showing numbers at the end of the rolling mouvement, each rolls stop on a letter. **S** then **M** -&gt; **I** -&gt; **L** -&gt; **E** -&gt; **D**. **""SMILED""**. As this name pop up, a new characther appears in the circle formed by the children, ""it"" had the looking of a kid too but you couldn't define what it was, all you could see was his hair, his long black hair. He then started to look up but you couldn't see shit but his hair... Until his **smile**. His white smile in the middle of all this dark thing.. But no time to be frightened or anything. **Smiled** just took a jar of acid that was right next to him (don't ask why) and he just threw it at the kids faces in the room, I could clearly see the kids faces just melting in front of my eyes and hear the laugh of **Smiled**. I couldn't do shit, i was just ""spectating"". He continued to throw jars of acid at every kids there and they all screamed and cried, wich alerted an adult that ran into the room just to get thrown a jar of acid to the face too.

That's the moment I woke up and I was facing my wall, all I wanted to do was to forget what just happened. I switched on the light but was still facing the wall. I was too afraid that if I turned my head I would stand face to face with **Smiled...**",null,0,cdndrvf,1rhd85,AskReddit,top_day,1

I was being relentlessly chased through something like dock or a lumberyard by this short, somewhat thick guy with a bowl cut and small black eyes.  He wore a white shirt buttoned to the top and rough pants that were too short.  He smiled without any joy, but said nothing. The most unsettling thing about him was his lone tooth that looked like a wooden peg that had been hammered into his lower jaw, splitting and fraying at the top.  The imagery might sound kind of stupid, but it was the evil that he seemed to represent that I can't forget.

People say that dreams that are remembered are the ones that will have influence on your real life, thus we don't remember every single one of them. Sadly the one that i had is scarier then /r/gore. So , here it goes- Here i am suddenly standing in a random house, in front of me was an older woman with gray hear, green eyes , with wrinkly hands but clear and young face. I was not interested in looking around , instead i had a feeling like i was talking to that woman for 10 hours straight , and now that we are done we are awkwardly looking at each other. I stared at her little pointy nose , getting deeper and deeper into some kind of hypnosis. Soon the only picture that i had in my brain was her nose , literally nothing else . Suddenly the thing that pulls me out of my hypnosis is a dark and deep male voice saying ""U belong to me!"". I looked away from her nose and i realized that i am not in the same place where i was in the beginning , instead i was in some sort of an flaming abyss. When i looked back at the woman she started melting slowly, first one was the face , skin was slowly dipping off of her chin down the abyss. She started screaming , it was one of the most horrifying things i have ever heard , it sounded like a combination of a dying lion cub and a new born baby getting strangled by the umbilical cord. I wanted to get away , but i couldn't move at all. My legs were itchy , i looked down but i couldn't see them at all , i was just looking at molten lava beneath me. I started panicking , sweating like a pig on a barbecue ; woman almost fully melted. When i looked around i saw my whole family, from my younger sister to my dad. I started screaming for help , yelling ""Please, i'm sorry , i don't want to die !"" But they were ignoring me completely; they turned around and walked away leaving me to suffer . It passed about 5 seconds , but it felt like forever. I looked above me and i saw a black entity-like creature descending slowly. I could hear the voices coming from him, they sounded awful , they were saying something like ""Why?!"", ""Mom no!"" , ""I am burning!"" etc. But as soon as the entity touched my face i woke up. I was in my bed , wet from head to feet , i had a feeling like i just ran the marathon.

Nothing bad happened that month/year. So i don't really think it was that important , but i still remember it. It is still there , written in my head like on a unerasable piece of paper.",null,0,cdnear1,1rhd85,AskReddit,top_day,1

As far as I was concerned they were real, even though I was experiencing them while awake. The difference between that and normal dreaming is that I was speaking and moving and reacting in response to the dream.

In one dream there was a red button which if pressed would cause the world to explode. Soon, I began to have an enormously strong urge to press the button, even though I had just been told what it did. It was like vertigo, A totally overpowering subconscious urge to *press it*. Eventually I succumbed to the urge and the world started exploding. And in my delirious state screamed and started wailing and crying *""No! I pressed it!

mrlucky2u,"I had a recurring dream when I was younger.

In my dream I was always the same age, around 12 or so. And I was some sort of detective.
I was in a house with about 10 other people and I was working some sort of case, I don't know what I just know I was there to help them solve something.

In my dream there was this little girl, about 3 years old, who had a doll she always carried around with her. This doll had a mouth that was puckered up where you could put a pacifier in her mouth. But the pacifier was missing, and this bugged me for some reason. I remember in my dream often looking at this doll and being very irritated that the little girl didn't have the pacifier to put in the mouth of the doll, I didn't like looking at the stupid puckered up mouth.

So eventually, everyone in the house had to go to sleep, and for some reason we all slept in the same room on the floor. At some point, I wake up in the middle of the night, and I am in that half asleep/drunkish mode. I glance over and see this annoying doll laying beside the little girl.
I pick up the doll and squeeze it pushing all the air out of it, then I put my finger over the mouth and let go. The result is the air can't get back in and the doll remains sorta sucked in with no air inside it. In my stupid half asleep mode, this is hilarious to me and I start laughing. Just as I let my finger off the doll, the eyes turn and look at me. The mouth moves into an evil grin and the fucking thing lunges at me and starts choking me.

We got there and proceeded with the festivities drinking through our entire supply in the pace of a few hours. Waking up basically out of a coma, me and a few friends realize the house is completely empty. Everyone else had disappeared in the night. Well, we make some food and wait for everyone to get back, but there's no-one by the time the sun sets. Considering none of us have the keys to the cars we brought, and we can't find anyone to get theirs, we bunker back in for the night, unfortunately without any more booze. 

The next morning, there are only 2 people left. Fuck that. We get all bundled up and go out into the snow, only to find a massive amount of trails heading deeper into the forest. We find everyone all curled up around a big tree, and its unclear if they're alive or dead. 

Rather than figure it out, we rifle through this dude's pockets, find his keys, go back to the lodge with some booze we found around the tree and bone. 

Then I wake up and go on the trip. Fucking weird, because the dude in the dream was driving me up, and the girl was in the backseat.

When i was little i started to have really crazy nightmares that i was a soldier inside a tank, fighting for my life against a unknown dark.
I just felt consumed by fear and hatred, each time i fired the cannon, i felt  **ONLY** the pain of my bones crushing.
Suddenly when i passed out from pain my subconscious faded everything into blackand just hoovering, i saw the game pong, in slow motion.
Each time the ball hit the pads it would get faster and start doing some curves, the ball bounced, zigzagged, did this crazy things until a shape starts getting clear. It resembled something like a bad face.
It would be the face of the devil himself with a smug smile.
Suddenly i wake up from everything, i would get up go to the bathroom, check if the door was closed and go to sleep.

Suddenly i hear a devilish laugh and the face emerges from my sheets.
I though i was awake, but i was actually dreaming again, that face taunted me, spat on me, and i would hide myself under the sheets thinking it was my only proctection, he couldnt get past that.
The face suddenly gained arms and start doing a weird mumbling, a thing like gregorian chants growing louder and louder.
Suddenly everything around me was infernal,chaotic all covered in live red.
(Bear with me)
I was scared running, then suddenly i saw some figures getting closed with a huge metal music. It started getting nearer and nearer, i kept running not looking back, and a huge deep voice tells me to stop, and i did.
It were the biker mice from mars, (what the fuck) and the fucking pong game was following me.

Whateverwhatever9,"I have three:

I was about 10 or 11 when I had this one. My (then) best friend was in my yard, and there was this loud beeping noise. She was screaming that it was going to kill her and that she needed to be safe. She climbed into my dad's shed and I shut the door. The noise stopped, and I opened it, but she was dead. I remember seeing her eyes completely rolled back in her head. I screamed bloody murder and then I woke up sweating and I'm pretty sure I pissed myself. That dream fucked me up.


The second one I had last week. I was in the waiting room of some kind of doctor's office or something, and this little girl (looked about 6-8) came up to me and told me to follow her. I did, despite the fact that that's how a fuckload of horror movies start, and we went to her house. Her mom was in there, screaming at the little girl's baby sister. She didn't notice us, and we went up to her room and hid in the closet. I don't remember what happened after that, but at some point we ran off into the woods and my current closest friend and ex-friends were there. My closest friend got a gash on her arm and was screaming that she was going to die and that she needed something to use as a bandage. I ran into the garage of my old house and was grabbing paper towels. The little girl's mother came out through the back door and was screaming at me, so I ran with the roll of paper towels into the woods and tried to stop the bleeding with them. It didn't work, and her eyes did that fucking disturbing roll-back thing from the aforementioned dream. Everyone else was blaming me for not getting there fast enough and started beating me up. I ran off and jumped off a cliff, and woke up right before I hit the ground. Yeah, I couldn't go back to sleep after that.


TL;DR I go to a little girl's house where I meet her abusive mother, find my best friend in the woods bleeding, she dies, everyone blames me, and I commit suicide. 


This one isn't mine, but my friend's. It's more disturbing that anyone I've ever had. She said that she was in some kind of hospital room. She looked in a mirror and her face was all deformed and bloody. She said all the doctors and nurses were gone, so she stuck this needle into her arm and it slowly drained all her blood out of her. She said she could feel all the blood coming out of her until it eventually went black and she woke up.

People were turning into enraged primate and dinosaur hybrids and animals all mutated into crazy monsters. The daughter decided to use her body (she was like 14) to persuade the scientists with seduction and kept ripping her clothes off. This only made them furious and they tortured her little brother so she turned into this badass spy and got him back. All the meanwhile, I decided Costco was a good safehaven. A man in the army approached me and told me there was a North Korean crime lord he was to interrogate and that he knew where my father was (I guess they confused me with the daughter). I watched the Korean get escorted into a back room and he made eye contact with me while licking his lips and saying "" I'm coming for you next."" I started looking through the books on sale to calm down and the lights started to flicker as a huge group of some covert special forces stormed in and ordered everyone to evacuate because the Korean escaped. I ran through a back door and ended up in a Rolls Royce. The Korean followed until a swarm of mutants flew in, shattered the window and tore the driver limb from limb. I ended up running through a forest and ending up in a safehaven near some waterfall where I found this young chubby boy attempting to drown himself. I grabbed him and pulled him to shore and he said there was nothing left to live for. The daughter showed up and jumped in the water, removed her clothes and showed the boy her tits. He smiled and calmed down. The brother started screaming. Monkey people started to take advantage of the daughter. I felt something cold on my head and turned to see the Korean with a rifle barrel aimed at my head. I closed my eyes and woke up in real life and found myself stuck watching the movie.

TheJack38,"Two years ago, right after Skyrim came out, I had this weird dream... I was in some kind of canyon, inside a *gigantic* warehouse, and there was a shitload of dinosaurs fleeing from one end to the other. Puzzled as to what they were fleeing from, I looked that way... And cue a gigantic skyrim-style dragon, except with Justing Bieber's head. I panicked, and it shouted at me (a la Skyrim) ""BABY BABY BABY!"" and I died. A black screen with ""GAME OVER"" followed, before I somehow managed to click ""retry"". The exact same thing happened again, except this time I had an axe (some kind of one-handed war-axe), which I promptly used to kill dragon-Bieber once it appeared, leading to a ""YOU WIN!"" screen.

After that, I cut down on Skyrim somewhat.

Just happened this weekend actually.  *Warning: not a happy story.* kinda long- there is a TL;DR.

Chatted with the guy via the dating app for a while. Moved into texting/phone calls. Decided to meet up for a drink (about 2 weeks after we started chatting). I didn't see a single red flag. The date was great, we had an awesome time, he really seemed like someone I could actually be with. Smart, funny, obvious that he liked me but completely respectful. I have a pretty good read of people, and all my impressions of him were positive. And it wasn't even so over-the-top as to seem too good to be true- just seemed like a really great, down-to-earth guy. I ended up bringing him back to my place to continue talking. We had agreed that we would want to wait for sex, but that fooling around wasn't out of the question.

I am currently covered in bruises and bite marks, clumps of hair are missing from the back of my head, and I have stitches in my labia. I'm sad, scared, and doing my best not to feel like this was my fault, but I still feel like it was. I shouldn't have continued anything after he was rough with me the second time (after I told him it was too rough.) I shouldn't have let him sleep in my bed. I should have googled him ahead of time, so I would have known that he had been convicted of assault previously and spent time in jail. Should have, should have, should have. I feel dirty and broken.

Ultimately, this could have happened with someone I met in person to begin with, but the anonymity of starting online gave me such a positive view of him- it's very difficult to see red flags over text, and very easy to lie. Because we met online and talked for a while before meeting, I was much more willing to be sexual with him on what was technically our first date, as I felt I had already gotten to know him a bit. But I know that if I had met him in person to begin with, I never would have slept gotten sexual until I got to know him better.

Many people have positive experiences with online dating. Obviously my experience is rare (although not as rare as you may think). Even after all this, I may still recommend online dating to others. But I certainly won't be doing it again myself.

Sorry to be a downer, but it never occurred to me in a million years that this would happen to me. I think it's important for people to be aware of situations like mine before they end up where I'm at now. I also realize maybe my post is a bit off topic for the thread, but I haven't actually revealed the entire story until now and really needed to get it off my chest.

TL;DR: Was sexually assaulted by someone I met online, despite having a pretty good bullshit detector.

**Tips and Tricks for the non-medicated student**

Do you play an instrument? If no, then pick one up. It will dramatically help with your ability to focus on a pleasurable, but complex and demanding task. It will improve your cognitive abilities and aid your attention span.

I play four instruments, and the piano is what pretty much got me through boarding school and three years of magmatic and metamorphic processes. 

**Own a watch? Then take it off and start reading/revising/learning your material, and only look at it when you genuinely want to know how long you've been working for.** 

Glancing at your watch is a surefire way of breaking your concentration, and becomes a impediment to your ability to let yourself relax and truly focus.  
If you want to work in only 30 minute bursts, then take your watch off, and put a countdown timer on your phone and throw it onto the bed.

**Work at your desk, not on the floor or bed.** 

Think of your posture and note that a slouched, eased-back position subconsciously makes you sleepy and less serious about the task at hand. 

**Clear your desk of clutter. Like seriously, buddy!**
 
The only things on my desk are the pen I need to write with, a notepad, a textbook and my laptop with notes. You will waste so much time fiddling and staring at the most mundane of all objects lying about which are of no relevance and serve only to distract you.

**Post-it notes.**

I think these are the saviour of many a college or university student, and even myself at my place of work. They're invaluable for jotting down a key point, fact, equation, number, quote, date. I use them daily for a lot of things, and after glancing at them a few times, you will start to subconsciously learn to picture what is written on each tab, before you even have to look at it.

**Earplugs. Now you're laughing.** 

But background noise is a real bitch and one of the biggest distractions for any person. Add ADD to the mix *(&lt;-- see what I did there)* and you're in for a killer combo. 
I work in a newsroom where I write up my articles, while all around me printers print, phones ring, people talk and laugh and the sound of leather soled shoes on hard floor is a pain. Outside I can hear traffic, aircraft, and birds on the window ledges. But when I work with my earplugs, almost all of that is cut out and I can just focus on what is needed. - I cannot stress to you just how much this one alone will help you.

**Physically log yourself out of Facebook/Twitter/Reddit whenever you are setting down to study.** 

Train yourself in the following - If you decide to open a tab to see what the latest kitty-cat picture or Bitstrip on your friend's feed is, then you'll have to type in all your login details again. Let that moment of typing make you feel guilty, and it'll help you cut down the amount of time you waste browsing the pointless shit which you can do in your down time.

**Set yourself out a work plan for a single day.** 

Try it. See if it helps. Read your books and makes notes that you can read back but which aren't long lengthy paragraphs like I've done here because of how I'm formatting.

**Finally, get a good night's sleep.** 

It's possibly the most important thing of all that you can do to help yourself focus. If you're tired from being up all night you're pretty much fucked unless you're an absolute hero in the IQ and determination department. Sleep well, but don't oversleep. 

Remind yourself of what time you want to wake up, and if you ever wake up minutes before your alarm, like I have done pretty much every day since I was 15 years old, switch the alarm off and get straight out of bed. It's a little psychological ego-confidence boost that lets you think you're in better control of your mentality than you believe.

**So, umm, we were talking about cats, right?**

When I absolutely needed to use the internet, I'd come up with a breakdown of minor tasks with bullet points, and a reward system.

HeloRising,"OBLIGATORY WARNING: I am not now nor have I ever been a doctor or medical professional. Consult your doctor before taking *anything*.

With that out of the way, I started taking Citicoline (the brand I use is Cognizin by Health Origins) about two years ago for adult ADD and it's been nothing short of miraculous. I seriously could not function without the stuff. It's (relatively) inexpensive and available over the counter but it's somewhat difficult to find, I have to order it online.

It's considered a dietary supplement but I haven't noticed any serious side effects from it at all. I started at about 250mg per day in the morning and now I've been at 500mg in the morning for about a year and a half.

It works quite well and I highly recommend researching it. It's a bit tough to talk to a doctor about it because they're generally highly dismissive of these kinds of things, if they know anything about it at all (most do not).


Another thing that helped immensely was to stop watching TV. Seriously, stop. Watch Netflix or YouTube if you want but **stop watching cable TV**. I notice my thinking gets *way* more scattered and hard to track after I've watched TV for a little while, something about the editing and the staccato of the commercials jumping subjects almost encourages an ADD-like mindset.

ethelraed,"Today is a clear, cold day in London, just like the day I learned to fly. I was 22 years old, it was a Saturday and I was at Camden Lock Market. In the crowd I caught sight of the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. At first I could only glimpse her face among the bobbing heads, and I struggled to keep in her view. Then she turned, we caught each others' eye. She could tell I had been watching her, but she didn't mind. Her entire face blossomed into a warm smile, a smile of recognition although we were strangers. She weaved towards me and came and took my hand. I can still remember the feel of her green woollen glove against my own bare hand which was almost numb with cold. She leaned against me and whispered into my ear the secret of flight. It was both simple and irresisistible and at at once I rose up almost as if it was against my will. Up I went to roof level and beyond and once I had stopped marvelling I looked down and marvelled again at the heads of the people below like a field of part balloons. I realised I was a swimmer in thin air, I could twist, turn and flip like a high diver who will never land. With gravity conquered so was time and everything seemed much slower.

King_of_the_Dot,"I worked for a common US chain restaurant company, as a server.  Our entire staff was full of stoners.  Several of the managers even joked openly about this.  It wasnt a secret that at least 1 of the staff members was selling pot at any given time.  Anyways...

My friend and I had just gotten stoned prior to going to work together (like always).  I personally love serving high, I find it comes more natural, and going to work high makes the transition from relax to work mode much easier.  

I get my first table, about 10 minutes into the start of my shift.  I go out and greet 2 gentlemen, and take their drink order, and return to the kitchen.  Before I had a chance to fill their drinks, the manager on duty, pulls me aside into the office.

The first words out of his mouth are *""Why are you high?""* to which my response was, *""I wasnt aware that I was.""*  This manager is the youngest manager, and by far one of the more cocky managers I have met in the industry.  I also use eye drops religiously when I go to work high.  He then says something like *""I just fired your buddy Paul, he said you two were high.""*  I responded *""Ok.""*  

I know Paul very well, and I know that he would never ever admit something like that, especially to such a schmuck like that.  *""So why are you high?""* he asks again.  *""Im not high, and I dont believe that Paul said we were.""*

He quips back *""Well I just fired him, and you're fired too!""*  That's fine, because I know that he was just using me and my friend as scapegoats.  I also was dating the girl he liked, so I think he wasnt very happy with that either.

I walk to the front of the restaurant, where the host stand is, and there's a open area in front of the doors.  Im looking for Paul, and that manager has apparently followed me to the front.  *""You need to get out of here.""* *""Ok, ill get out of here as soon as I find Paul.""* I said.  He says *""Well I could call the cops, and have you arrested.""*

At that point I knew that he was just being even more ridiculous, because I hadnt warranted anything that was deserving of his actions at this point, or at any point throughout this.  *""You can go call the cops, but im going to look for Paul, and ill be gone by the time they show up, so have fun.""*  This was all said in the same similar low tone I had taken throughout this situation.  

He apparently didnt like my response because as soon as I finished that he lunged at me and started shoving and attempting to man handle me.  He never swung on me, so I didnt swing back on him, but after several of the staff broke us up, I decided to leave the premises under my own free will, rather than in an unjustifiable set of silver bracelets.   

I linked back up with Paul, and I went back to the house, and smoked some more..

The one I find the most believable -as well as the most comforting- is that it just ends, our consciousness comes to a complete halt.

Then one day it just hit me, what was my life like before I was born? Well, it wasn't *like* anything! It just *wasn't*. Suddenly, the concept of just not existed didn't seem so hard to grasp.

Maybe it's done by reincarnation and living the lives of the dictator, the serial killer, the martyr, the peaceful activist, the revolutionary, a mother, a father, etc. Perhaps by living so many different lives do we understand life.

jonfromsydney,"I worked for a week as an extra on a film called ""The Quiet American"", based on a Graeme Green novel and partly shot in Sydney's Fox Studios. It was about Vietnam's change from Colonial French rule in the 1950's and starred Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser. It was released at just the wrong time in history so never received much publicity.

The scenes were quite large and involved hundreds of extras. Most, if not all of the Vietnamese extras were originally refugees from vietnam and now lived in Sydney. Many did not speak english and were bussed in from the suburbs.

The catering on set was very good. Soon after lunch on the first day a few of the Aussie extras started complaining to each other about the Vietnamese not cleaning up after themselves. It seems they were leaving plates of food leftovers on the catering tables when they got up to go back on set. One Aussie even said to me words along the lines of ""No wonder their own country is in such a state"" without a hint of irony.

A few of us started explaining to the complainers that Vietnam had a larger population, less resources and far lower levels of pay than in Australia. If we were in Vietnam there would be people on very low wages cleaning up after us. To 'Bus' our own plates would effectively be putting people out of work. In Australia it simply did not occur to the Vietnamese extras that leaving their plates on the table would lead to unnecessary extra unpaid work for the catering staff. Once the Vietnamese extras were politely informed of this they were embarrassed that they had appeared to some people to be so lazy and they behaved like the rest of us.

This was all just a slight cultural misunderstanding but some of the Aussies got very racist in their hushed conversations with each other until they were informed of the true situation.

eighty_billion,"I went through therapy during a period of depression and I found it personally to be incredibly helpful, if only to gain outside perspective. I was also blessed with an awesome therapist—talking to my peers who have also undergone therapy, finding the right therapist for you seems to be critical in how effective the process will be.

In any case, I earnestly hope that you find the help you need, whether it be through therapy or elsewhere!

Oh, one last thought, you mention worrying about alienating yourself from friends and coworkers. I don't know what you mean, but there is *nothing wrong* with having therapy and in no way should it be stigmatized. Many people who go to therapy are not even ill in any way; it can be a helpful tool to help gain perspective on one's life. There is no shame in looking for outside help for any problem, particularly one that relates to your emotional, mental, or physical well-being.

I was involved in terribly abusive relationships (verbal/emotional) for all of my dating life.

shamalamb,"I can't necessarily say that this is specifically caused by alcohol but I have heard similar stories from many other children of alcoholic parents; both of my divorced parents had a tendency to get wasted and flatter me gratuitously growing up.  Every mundane accomplishment and talent of mine was touted.  Somehow a bad mother (according to her) managed to raise the two best kids on the planet.  I feel it is part of the reason why I have a tendency to become arrogant unless I check myself, and yet still somehow have a hard time receiving praise.  I don't mean to complain, I believe I had a much easier childhood than most.  My parents are both genuinely good people, but they have their shortcomings, as do I.  However fulsome flattery year after year does mess with one's head to some extent.  Upon first reaching adulthood I used to drink with my parents, and eventually alone.  The relative chaos of my home life would often lead me to an attitude of ""screw this, I'm gonna get drunk too"".  I am not bitter (anymore).  On a brighter note alcoholism in the family has prompted both my big sister and I to be more aware of our own drinking behavior.  As a result we both gave up the hooch in our twenties, we pray for good.  Alcohol itself is not the problem in our opinion, it's how people interact with it.

LiquidGen0cide,"Best  Black Friday story 
                 By, LiquidGen0cide

Once upon a time, the day after thanksgiving, a 22 year old man was siting in his parents basement. He was an avid gun enthusiast and used all of his income to buy weapons instead of his own house. Siting there the man realized what day it was. Black Friday. More people in the stores.""more people to kill."" He thought. He went over to his personal gun safe and unlocked it. He took out one of his many assault rifles. he loaded them and then put them in his car. As he was going out the door he yelled something about shopping in the general direction of his mother. As he arrived in the parking lot he noticed it was full. The many cars caused him to smile. Due to the sacristy of parking spaces he pulled up in front of the automatic sliding glass doors. He grabbed the assault rifle from the passenger seat and got out of his car. he walked in. He aimed his gun at the nearest shopper. He fired 8 shots into the mass of frantic mothers and screaming americans. He fired some more emptying his magazine. He quickly reloaded shooting anyone that got close to him. after ten minutes and thirty seconds he ran out to his car. He got in and drove home to his frantic mother going on about a shooting downtown.

We get to this girl's house and while we're hanging out another guy named Casey shows up in his big pimped out pick up truck.  This guy is pretty cool and we're getting along just fine.  We start talking about his truck and we convince him to do some doughnuts on the street.  I; probably thinking I wanted to impress this girl, decided I wanted to stand in the bed of the truck and hang onto the spot lights above the cab while he did his doughnuts.  So while he's doing the doughnuts with me standing in the bed of the truck the dude loses control of the truck.  He said his foot got caught underneath the break pedal.  The truck runs into the front of my mom's car and I go flying over the top of the cab.  Luckily I'm alright and pretty juiced up on adrenaline at that point but my mom's car has a pretty nasty dent.   

My brother, Casey, and I are freaking out. He begs us not to call the cops or even report it to the insurance company because he's got no money.  My brother and I decide we're going to let him off the hook by staging a hit and run.

We pick up some of the pieces off the road and drive the car to a local grocery store down the street and park the car.  We strategically spread the bits and pieces on the ground around the car near where the dent is and then go inside the store.  We walk around a bit pretending like we're actually shopping and then buy a soda and a candy bar and then walk back out into the parking lot.  We act like we see the dent and freak out and go back in the store and report a hit and run to the manager.  He calls the police and a police officer shows up to check it out.  He notices the bits and pieces on the ground and declares it a hit and run and it gets reported to my parents insurance.

My brother and I got in trouble for taking my mom's car without permission but that's as far as it goes.

tl;dr: Took my mom's car without permission, get in a minor car accident with a friend, stage a hit and run so friend doesn't get in trouble.  Broke the law.",null,0,cdn8kwr,1rh9eq,AskReddit,top_day,3

Anyway, so I went through with my plan, dove, and landed on my stomach. I wondered why it was so cold when I realized the tunnel pulled down my shorts AND my underwear. It took me 15 seconds to realize that. Without even thinking, I rolled on my back and stayed like that for 5-10 seconds before realizing what was going on. There was a huge line behind me.

Well one afternoon I had just gotten off the bus when I noticed those damn smug turkeys. They scare my dog so they annoyed me, and this day they just would not get out of the road for the bus to leave. So me being an idiot took it upon myself to clear the road so the bus could leave. 
I ran striaght into the flock of turkeys and they scattered. That is until they turned around and started chasing me. I ran and ran and jumped right over my fence into my back yard, two turkeys made it over and at this point my dog went nuts on them. Once I made it inside she came running in after me.

eodryan,"USAF EOD here.

The Good:  

I get the nice living quarters and quality of life of the Air Force with the outside the wire mission of the Army.  

EOD is a pretty cool job when you get to do it.

The guys I work with are pretty much the military version of Super Troopers.

I have been to Iceland, Germany, Kenya, Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belgium, Czech Republic, India, Italy, Switzerland, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Quatar, Hungry, and Romania because of my time in the service.

Very rarely, do most people have the chance to show up and ""save the day"".  It's an awesome feeling to know that some kid gets to go home to his wife/kid/mom/dad because you found/disarmed an IED.  This goes for US, Coalition, and Iraq/Afghan people.  I'm an equal opportunity life saver.

Nabbing real, no shit, bad guys is the same feeling.  Getting to be a part of a mission that takes known shitheads out of play is a good feeling.


The Bad:

Most people in the Air Force don't really understand combat, real danger, or even what it's like off base.  It makes it difficult when you get together for stuff like NCO academy because your experience is so vastly different that saying how you really feel will alienate you and get you into trouble.

They say things like, ""my job is just as important as yours, EOD can't win all the awards, or you can only submit 10 percent of your flight for an award due to the quota system"".

Other services rag on us for being Air Force, usually young Sergeants that don't know better.

There are some dumb people, some of them outrank you, many of them are officers.

The Army tends to run all the Task Forces, which means you're always the bastard child at the table.

The draw down has me worried.  I'm not sure I can mentally deal with stuff like bingo night and washing the trucks on a deployment over all the adventure of my other deployments.

BulletCatofBrooklyn,"Optional options. None of this warrants actual replies, but are things to think about.

Find join and participate in a video chat
By far the easiest of the options it does not require you to leave your space. Casual acquaintances to practice body language and talking without any exposure of self. Join a language group, help someone learn English or have someone help you learn another language is a good place to start. 
Reason: People in other countries are less likely to recognize you at the local grocery store and recount something stupid you said. Always a plus to be able to pretend you misunderstood something when you wish to avoid a topic. 

Random social survey : find the closest bar. ask a stranger a question without a clear answer. ie ""Top five things that you believe to be under appreciated"" or ""Worst invention of the 20th century"" you can say its a survey for a class or whatever excuse you want. ask someone who is also alone or a small group of people 3-5 best bet for answers
Reason: Its not to create a group of friends out of nothing but to practice talking to random people. 
not the best choice for starters

Daily walks / Drives / outdoor time
Go outside once a day. find out what your limits of range and duration are, just like with anything else, practice is the only thing that will increase your ability. Figure out what your triggers are and recreate them in control able doses.
If you are afraid of open spaces nothing will change that until you change it. 
dont expect to be able to live in montana or nebraska the first time out.

Research trust. 
What does it mean exactly to you, and how good are you yourself at maintaining that level with other people? What are the elements of trust that you feel are required to be comfortable with others? and think about what the effects are of each of those items if broken. What is your ""Grand scheme of things"" ""in the long run"" and other such standard phrases for contemplating the future and which items of trust you require vs what you want. 
Reason: develop a hierarchy of accommodation which can be applied to people around you, realization of actual expectations can lead to a better understanding of why people seem to disappoint you and whether or not that can be ok.

Activity
Learn a hobby. be it model airplanes or cooking. doing something that requires some research and or asking someone (through email or forums) creates an identity you can shed or expand depending on how you feel it should go. Games forums is a good place to start as there is something that you can all agree or disagree on which means relatively little.

TobiasNorth,"I think it's to do with equality.

I know, time and time again has proven that communism/socialism can never truly work, because somebody always has to be in control and then that person gets greedy etc etc. But look at America now - the 'democracy'. There is still rampant inequality in all areas of life: whether it's women not getting paid as much as men, an ethnic minority being discriminated against, passing legislation that seeks to attack the LGBT community; it goes on and on. The ever-increasing divide between the 'upper class' and the 'working class' in America continues to grow each and every day, with the rich getting richer and the poor falling ever deeper into poverty.

In theory, the idea of a communist or socialist society would have to mean everybody and everything being equal, correct? Well, the power brokers and decision makers in America can't have this - they have to have total control, to keep all those pesky women, minorities, members of the LGBT community, the poor, the elderly, the young, the middle class… anybody they can, hostage to their ideas. If a TRUE communist/socialist society was implemented, it would mean having to regard the very people they despise as equal to themselves, and that's something they're never going to admit.",null,0,cdn7vgz,1rh79u,AskReddit,top_day,1

Blaster395,"The Red Scare and Mccarthyism in hindsight were stupid, but they had legitimate reasons for existing and a reasonable hypothesis, they just targeted the wrong things.

Firstly, the USSR had a self-proclaimed expansionist strategy. They indeed wanted to turn every country in the world Communist, it was set out in the founding of the USSR and carried out in practice where possible. Furthermore, they wanted all communist countries to be under the full influence of the USSR, hence the Brezhnev doctrine, opposition to Yugoslavia and Sino-Soviet border conflicts. During the start of the Red Scare, proposed democratic and transitional governments across Eastern Europe were being toppled at a rate of several a year to become Proletariat Dictatorships in the soviet bloc. This was, quite obviously, terrifying.

Secondly, The soviets were responsible for directly funding Communist parties across Europe. It was not a secret, it was done openly and these parties were far more powerful in most cases than they are now, and had revolutionary / hostile manifestos should they have been elected. The main thing that prevented them from coming to power like they had in Eastern Europe was that the USSR could not directly intervene as they had not occupied Western Europe.

Thirdly, there were soviet spies all over the US, which is what allowed the USSR to build the nuclear bomb so quickly. The US was really bad at actually finding them and accused the wrong people all the time, but they were right to recognize their existence.

Lastly, published information from the US released at the time, when describing the USSR, often recognized the legitimate terror tactics used by the USSR against it's own population, including Gulags, Holodomor etc. Left-wing academia in the US often spoke about these as being right-wing propaganda, but the accusations were later shown to be very accurate following Gladnost giving insight into what was occuring in the USSR during the 50s and 60s.

Given the reality of how awful Communist governments were, I am honestly amazed that they are not seen as worse than the Nazis, who are seen as entirely evil maniacs and anyone who says they still hold their political views are seen as the most vile humans in existence. In death toll they certainly were worse than the Nazis! I think part of this can be attributed to historical revisionist hard-left leaning academics repeatedly espousing views that deny Communist-influenced crimes against humanity, especially Holodomor Denailism. An example of this Holodomor Denialism is when the deputies of the Communist Party of Ukraine voted against a law that would officialy recognize Holodomor being a Genocide in 2006.

**Side note for everyone before I get raged at**

No, I don't care if your own pet sub-section of communism claims that none of these were ""True Communists"" ^tm or that true communism has never existed, I am talking about governments that declared themselves Communist between 1918 and 1992 and talking about why the US feared those.",null,0,cdolv7o,1rh79u,AskReddit,top_day,1

n11dz,"I lived in the Gulf for over 10 years, and though I've never been to Kuwait, from what I've heard from those who live there and have been, the culture is in many ways similar to the places I've been (KSA, Bahrain, UAE). 

There are plenty of expatriates, so being a foreigner wont make you stick out unless you go out of your way to draw attention to yourself. Sticking to the main high-end shopping areas and malls is probably safest, and though its always advisable to travel with someone if possible, the gulf states are relatively safe, maybe even more so than bad neighborhoods in the West. 

If you can get an [abaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaya) to wear around it would certainly help and reflect respect for the local culture, but dressing modestly (long sleeves, pants, nothing tight fitting) is likely fine. Assuming you're visibly white, you wont be expected to cover your head/hair, but consider carrying around a scarf or shawl in case you feel uncomfortable somewhere. As in other Arab countries, avoid physical contact with men you don't know, and don't be taken back if some men wont offer their hand for a shake or in rarer cases don't address you directly.

The local men will probably leave you alone, especially if you are dressed modestly. Local moral constraints on gender interaction are strong in the gulf, and talking to unrelated women in public can be taboo. This does not apply as strongly in shops or with vendors, but the only thing you might have to worry about from them is trying to get some extra dinars out of you. Foreign workers (most from south asia, some from egypt) are more interested in your money than you, but always try to haggle a bit as you will likely save some. The rapid and extreme growth of wealth in the gulf has resulted in large malls all over with many high end boutiques, so if you like shopping, there should be plenty of international brands, as well as some local flare. If you take a taxi, they might not run the meter. Always try to decide on a price before you get in, as is common in many of the arab states (and elsewhere). I wouldn't advise renting a car unless you are accustomed to very aggressive driving and many reckless drivers.

As for entertainment, the only places to ""go out"" will probably be hotels and restaurants, in which you'll probably find many westerners/foreigners. Alcohol is illegal, but that doesn't mean it isn't available. Avoid being drunk in public, but your friend probably knows all this. If you like fast food, in my experience, the same restaurants are for some reason way more delicious in the middle east. It might have something to do with the fact that the employees are generally older males with families to support through remittances, as opposed to teenagers working for pocket money, so they have some incentive to care more about the product they make/sell. 

I hope you find at least some of this useful. The gulf really is an interesting region with hospitable people and rich culture, I hope you enjoy it.

mikjryan,"First of all man I've been exactly where you are right now, I almost went back to this stage just a few weeks ago. The way I see it comes down to a few small things:

Are you having a drink or are you getting drunk?

Would you be drinking this much of you were happier?

And it sounds silly but what are you drinking, a good sign you might have a problem is when you are drinking cheap but strong spirits",null,0,cdn7e1n,1rh5v3,AskReddit,top_day,1
deathbybrownies,"As someone clean and sober from booze/cocaine for two years and some change. You should give AA another shot. AA is actually not assigned to any religion at all. It is a program of spirituality. Whether you choose to be spiritual or not is up to you.

There are athiests and agnostics who are in AA and while I could never go down that route they are sober today. It's about a God of your understanding, not Jesus or Allah or whatever. It could be a lightbulb that you refer to as a higher power.

If you think you might be an alcoholic, you are probably an alcoholic. If you decide to come to another meeting to find out for yourself, ask someone for a pamphlet on ""Who is an alcoholic"" and I'm sure you will find the answers you're looking for. Try to bring an open mind as well.

Sorry if this was annoying but I had to say something. People often are scared of AA because of the whole God thing or because meetings are often held in churches (because rent is cheap) but it is not at all like that.

Good luck to you and I wish you the best.",null,1,cdn7jd8,1rh5v3,AskReddit,top_day,2
RabbitRobotica,"If, when you honestly want to, you can't stop drinking or when you start drinking you have no control over the amount you take, you may be an alcoholic.

&gt; I've been to AA but it was way to religion oriented for me. Are all the places like this or just the place I was? 

Try other meetings. Go to different ones around your county, go to evening ones, go to noon ones. You'll get a different vibe depending on where and when you go. Find the group that's right for you and keep an open mind. Don't try to work Step 2; you haven't even finished Step 1 yet. 

I've been going to AA for almost three years (12/5/10 is my sobriety date) and I can tell you, there is room for you. 

Good luck to you OP. If you feel like you have a drinking problem and that you want help with it, you know where to find us. Hell, message me and we'll find meetings together!",null,0,cdn8qp6,1rh5v3,AskReddit,top_day,1

taintsauce,"I'm suddenly the handsome new Prime Minister of Britain in the early 2000s. One of my secretaries has an obvious crush on me, and I use my innate foppishness to disguise the fact that I reciprocate these feelings. Meanwhile, the whole of the UK is taken up in the fervor created by a washed-up rock star's (shitty) new Christmas single - and his promise to perform it in the nude should it become the #1 track by Christmas Eve.

The secretary and I go through a number of humorous situations before I finally decide to show up at her place in a grand romantic fashion. Of course I know the street, but not exactly which house this is despite the fact that A) she is my employee, and I would have access to her records and B) I'm the goddamn British PM, and could just utilize my intelligence agencies to find her. Because...terrorism? (And boobies). 

Finally, I find her, and take her to the most elegant and romantic event in the land - a children's Christmas pageant. We make out backstage, only to have the curtain lift, exposing our secret snog to the gathered parents and families.

One could well say it was a saccharine tale, but I'd have to say that it was love, actually. ",null,1,cdn7cux,1rh5cd,AskReddit,top_day,8

fuufnfr,"The Global Collateral Accounts.

 This is, quite literally, the greatest secret of modern history.

World Wars I and II were fake.

Both sides were secretly being run by the same people -- with the same goal.

Over 100 million people died -- for a completely different reason than they thought.

Both sides fighting these wars -- Axis and Allies -- were owned and controlled by the same international bankers.

These world wars were used to plunder central banks and private holdings of their gold -- worldwide -- and turn them over to the Federal Reserve.

The official number for all the gold ever dug out of the earth is 166,500 tons. This is a lie. The real amount is:

2,420,937.4 metric tons of gold.

The idea was that in order to stop war, we needed to collect all the gold in one place, and then use it collectively to better humanity. Of course, it was all a ruse.

The bankers who sold this idea to the ancient families and governments of the world gained access to what is now referred to as the Global Collateral Accounts. This is the source and true assets for all of the western central bank printing presses. This is why they're IMF and World Bank are all powerful and can do almost anything they please.

Instead of spreading the wealth throughout the world, the hoarded it for themselves and used it to continue the wars, disease, and poverty.

This group of nasty people are what most people call the Illuminati. Many will argue that it is the Masons, or the Vatican, or the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers, or the Bushes, or the Queen of England, blah blah blah.

It's all of them. In various levels of involvement and performing certain tasks they all collude together.

They're aim is nothing short of complete world domination. The most current plan is to reduce the population of the planet to about 500 million people total. It will then be much easier to control things.

They're a thousand more details but I'll cut to the fun part.

Most of you have heard this story in one form or another, but what you have not heard is this:

There is another group, even more secret than the others, and they are about to flip the world over

You see, all along, the ancient secret societies, together with small bands of very well connected people, have been building a plan to stop them.

It is simply called The Plan.

Without revealing any details of the actions about to take place, here ore some of the results you can look forward to in the very near future.

Round up and arrest ALL the bad guys. The list is literally millions long. You know the FEMA camps they built for us? That's where they'll be stuck.

There is literally about 7 semi truck loads of evidence to convict these people. The ""good guys"" have been collecting it for a LONG time.

The Global Collateral Accounts will be used to stop hunger and poverty, clean up the environment, provide homes for all, and create jobs for everyone.

At the same time, the hidden technologies will be released and developed. Free energy, replicators (or constructors), and incredible healing techs (think growing back of limbs).

The USA will move to a system of common law, with much of the world following in our footsteps soon after.

The global financial system will be overhauled to be what is should have been all along. Real and transparent. All things will be based on actual assets. No more gambling with phoney FIAT crap. The good guys have already cut off access to the Accounts, this is the real reason for the global financial crisis.

Wars will no longer be tolerated by anyone, anywhere, for any reason.

And here's the best part

We're not alone, never have been, and this is where the rabbit hole really starts to get deep...

Wasn't allowed listening to rap music, never taught us patois (which was to our detriment as communicating with our relatives proved difficult at times and it has been a source of torment for my cousins to repeatedly pick at).  In hindsight I can't blame my father for believing that the ""whiter"" he made us the more advantages we would have in life.  

The only time in my life someone had said something to me that I felt hurt to the core was when one of my best friends had called me ""whitewashed"".  I'm glad I got over that while I was young.

Though, I'm a vinyl hip-hop DJ, I typically date white women, and I love fried chicken.  I guess you can't avoid all stereotypes.

In 2008 I attempted suicide 3 times in 6 months, I was severely depressed and had a lot going on in my life. I don't view those attempts as cries for help as I had every intent on dying. 

What pulled me out of it, I can't really say with 100% certainty. I know that doesn't help very much but it was a combination of things for me. I started seeing a therapist, made some new friends, went back to school, spent more time with my family, but most of all I TALKED about it. 
I always kept it bottled up because I didn't want to burden anybody or bring them down. The thing is, your friends and family WANT to help. Talk to them, work through your issues. It helps more than you know.

It's been 5 years, I have no idea how I'm alive but I feel like I'm alive for a reason. I don't believe in god, but I should be dead... I don't know how I'm not but I am forever grateful that I survived. These past 5 years have been tough but they have also been the best 5 years of my life. 

It might be hard to believe that things will get better but trust me... when you pull through you'll look back and realize that in the grand scheme of things life may have been tough but you'll be stronger. And you'll thank yourself for not giving up

My boyfriend is somewhat overweight and if I judged him by looks, I probably would never date him, not to mention he's 12 years older than me. He never thought a girl like me would have any interest in him either, but a few months of hanging out and getting drunk while playing video games proved us both wrong. He always makes me laugh, keeps me grounded when I'm being unreasonable, and inspires me to work hard for the things I want. It's been over a year and we are living together and talking about our future together.

To put it simply, he got with his personality.

ChefBubba,"*sorry for the wall of text*
I was 17. My girl friend lived about 20 minutes away in the city from me in the burbs, and here mother and her partner were out of town on a small vacation.   I called Jenn (not real name) just like I do every night and could tell something was up.  She was speaking in a hushed tone and you could tell she upset about something.  I finally got it out of her that Bill ( an ex boyfriend, 3 years older) was there with her and he refused to leave.  He has a violent past and has had at least 1 restraining order against him in the past I knew about.  

Well, she said he forced himself on her and then hung up without saying goodbye.  Next thing I know my step-brother and I are at the end of her road, I have him park (he's a little guy and I didnt want him getting involved in any type of issues.  I told him to leave if he heard police) and I run down the street to her house with a crowbar in my hand.

I get to her house and see the door slightly ajar.  I run inside and see her crying on the couch.  I immediately drop the crowbar and run to her.    

After she calmed down we called the police, filed a report and got a restraining order.  He didnt rape her, only ended up restraining her and holding her against the wall while trying to kiss her/feel her up.  ( Not that thats ok, just that it is better than rape...i guess? ).

She later would tell me she felt both incredibly frightened and safe when she saw me run in that door with my crowbar.  I dont like scaring the people I love and decided then and there to only Hulk-out when absolutely necessary. 

Another of her exes, who was a good friend of hers and later, mine, found out and got together with me.  We figured out a plan that made all offended parties satisfied.  ",null,0,cdn69se,1rh1d7,AskReddit,top_day,1

anddrksaid,"I spent the summer after my freshman year of college fucking around.  I had always been a pretty good kid, but that summer a close friend of mine got me to start smoking with him.  I'm the type of guy who people love to get high around, so this guy would smoke me up all the time.  I didn't have to pay once.  
So we'd been hitting his bong with various groups of people in his bedroom every day for the whole summer, and nothing really happened.  Finally, during the second to last week of summer, I got way too high.  It was strange because I'd taken way less hits then normal.  Driving home, my heart starts beating REAL fast and hard.  Being high as fuck, and consider my poor eating that summer, I thought I was having a heart attack.  I pull over and me and my buddy get out.  I have no idea what's happening.  I'm asking him if he knows what's up and when he tell me its ok, I don't believe him. 

A cop pulls up out of nowhere, asks what the fuck we're doing.  I tell him I'm dying.  He calls an ambulance and they pick me. The paramedic didn't do shit the whole ride, just chilled on his laptop playing games.  At the hospital they tell me the weed wasn't laced and that I was basically just an idiot.  They gave me an IV with some fluids and let me leave.

The doctors told my parents it was heart palpitations and didn't mention the weed.  I had a conference over the following weekend for my bullshit Cutco knife selling job that I got to skip.  So all in all, a great experience.

rvbrindle,"Amsterdam. Circa 2008. 17 year old me and a box of 'ATLANTIS' magic mushrooms.

me and 7 other of my friends were staying in an apartment and decided to take magic mushrooms.
The setting was good, we had food, orange juice and it was all good mates so no sketchy feeling before hand.
I took them, had an awesome high for like 4 hours (or 10 minutes, or six years i find with mushrooms the first thing to leave is a concept of time).

Towards the back end of the trip, one of my friends had half a box left, so i decided to eat them. Everyone went to bed. I came up again.
For an unspecified (but what felt like an eternity) time i spent running around the halls of our apartment crying, trying to win the battle.
i worked out that i had around 2 minutes 'panic time' in each room and then i had to move, by the end of the two minutes my heart would be beating out of my brain and every time i shut my eyes i saw a vivid picture of me screaming with my wrists gashed open in the hallway, with paramedics and my friends holding me and carrying me out of the door.
 
after a while i put 'Knocked Up' by Kings of Leon on my iphone and just sat there staring at the timer, each time knowing 7 odd minutes had past.

I must have listened to that song 15/20 times just on loop, then i woke up, never felt so glad to be sane in my entire life!!

took too many magic mushrooms, had a bad un!

The post was a reply to someone who had been having doubts about their gender identity. My reply had started out as mostly bullshit saying that these thoughts were completely normal and not to worry because I have the same sorts of thoughts and I'm normal. Whilst writing that crap I realized that they're not normal thoughts to have. Much introspection followed. My delusions that I was normal and therefore didn't have to worry about anything shattered. I realized the truth within me that I am transgendered.

All it took was a bit of typing to shatter the facade I'd built over 17 years that fooled even myself. I only needed to write out my thoughts for me to see how asinine they were and that facade to crumble to nothing. That was a rough week.

I would spend the night there sometimes, and always felt watched.  The watched feeling was always malevolent.  Drawers would open and close, cabinets would open and then slam shut, that kind of thing.

The weirdest thing that happened was with my friend's answering machine.  It was one of those that recorded things to a tape that you would have to erase after awhile.  In between two messages, when normally there would just be silence, was just something saying the word ""no.""  The sound of the voice was terrifying because it didn't really sound human.  Also, we had listened to the tape before, and no voice was present.  Then one day, as she's going through it, making sure she wouldn't delete anything important, the voice just popped up.

One day I had this grad student come in saying he lost a bunch of files on his computer and he didnt know what happened to them.  His computer was miserably slow, most likely had a virus because it was a pretty new laptop at the time, so I didnt think it was a hardware issue.

I recommened that he leave the laptop with us so we can clean it for him, he said he couldnt do that so I said we could try a system restore if he wanted to wait around for a little bit.  It seemed to work, he said his files were there, I am thinking he moved them on accident or something.

So, I was about to get up and leave when he said...""hmmm are you sure this worked? I still seem to be missing things""  I see him open up a folder called ""Homework"", all the files were called ""economics notes 11.7.11"", ""Marketing notes 11.8.11"" and so on.  So he barely tilts his computer away from me and clicks on one of them and a picture of an enormous black women bent over pulling her butt cheeks apart comes up.  He quickly closes out the window and gives me a glance to see if I saw (of course I did) but I played it off like i was looking at my watch or something.  He then proceeds to scan the list.........it goes on forever, and I notice they are all image files....  Every now and then he stops and opens one up, and my eyes are met with another image of ridiculous BBW porn.  This whole time he thinks that his technique of turning his computer 1 degree away from me worked so that I could not see any of this...I had full view of what was going on.

This guy holds strong, doesn't give a shit that I might be seeing this.  He keeps saying things under his breath like ""hmmm not seeing it"" or ""maybe this one?"".  In my head I am like dude just stop, please just stop.  

The last image I saw was of some dude fucking a fat fold of a big black women.  The guy didn't even close the image when he found it.  He just said thanks a lot, got up and left.

Layers are very important for surviving the cold. Also, invest in a nice, warm winter jacket. It makes a huge difference.

1. Snowboarding. The best sport. 
2. Snow makes things beautiful. Nature in the winter time seems to gorgeous. 
3. Snowball fights/snow forts. 
4. Sometimes work/school gets cancelled. Love unexpected days off...

dowwwnvote,"I love the fall and winter more than words can say. I prefer the crisp, clean air. There's substantially less bugs. There's Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, and Valentine's Day to celebrate. I'm in the south so I get to see a lot of pretty birds that migrate here, and because there's less leaves on the trees, I actually get to see them (and the squirrels and the chipmunks!) so much better. If it actually does snow, it's so awesome, pretty, and peaceful to take a walk in. I'm very sensitive to heat, so being able to control how warm I am with clothing rather than just being hot and suffering because there's nothing I can do is a godsend. The fashion is all around better looking and more comfortable. I have a lot of social anxiety and being covered in layers of comfy clothing makes me feel so much more secure in public. The food is all warm, wholesome, comfort food. Sleeping in late becomes 10x more satisfying when you're all snuggled in against the cold. Especially if you're snuggled up with someone and you're both just basking in the body heat like awwww, yiss.

I'm 5'7 and only weigh around 115 lbs, so as for staying warm, layers are definitely my friend. The key is to wear soft, tightly fitted leggings and thermal shirts underneath your clothing, and tuck everything in! Tuck your thermal shirt into your leggings, tuck your leggings into your socks. Layer on jeans and a sweater, then also a hat and a scarf, and you'll be toasty in no time. If you want you could also do gloves, but I don't like how gloves feel usually, so I go without and it's typically fine. Layers can be done indoors as well obviously, minus the scarf and hat. Hot tea, coffee, and hot chocolate are always helpful. Also living on the top floor so you get all the free heat that rises from everyone else's apartments, haha.

Vinnaht,"For me fall-winter was the start of one of the best things in my life. It was the start of hockey season. The only time of the year you could wake me up at 4am and I wouldn't care. You work all week in school for the 90 minutes you get at the end of the day to clear your head. The wind in your face while your skating down the pond. Its your time to shine. And once the weekend comes you get to feel like a pro. You get to travel through some of the most beautiful scenery in the country. Snow covered mountains, countless ponds with  kids from all around. Giant rinks to play against teams from different parts of Canada, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York. Playing the rink where the US won the 1980 gold metal, knowing this is it, this is why you worked all summer on running or getting in your gear to have your brother rip street hockey pucks at you.  You get to sit in front of a 4x6 opening knowing the next 60 minutes of life doesn't matter. Winter brings the sound of fog horns, the clink of the puck hitting the net and the dreaded right light, the worse sight in the world. Its forgetting about the chemistry project, or math homework. All that matters is a tiny rubber disk. Its skating between the defense and beating the goalie high glove, making the game winning save and hearing the crowd go wild. Its the time of year when everyone knows your name, girls get jealous of yours', she gets to wear a varsity jersey. Its knowing it doesn't matter that your having problems at home or with girlfriend. You have make some of the best friends, the ones you can call family. The ones who share your pain because you missed your shot, they share the glory when you get the medal at the end of the week. Then as you grow older and your friends who you have had since you where about 5-6 are off at different schools, but now you can show off, you can hit em as hard as you possibly can. Then you come home for winter break and wake up to the text messages of ""get to the pond NOW"" and the cycle repeats. It doesn't matter that your playing d3 in college and some of them went to d1 schools. Its missing the net by a mile and bringing up the stories of how you won the game, or the times you got sent to the hospital for countless broken bones. Its the time of headed to Boston to watch the pros score, drinking a cold one and remembering what it was like to be on the ice while the crowd went crazy when you laid that kid out, or ripped the slap shot to win the game in overtime.

Learn to dress in winter, and the cold won't affect you. I'm from Alaska, and moved to the Midwest.  Dressing warm in the Midwest is difficult, because everyone spends money on style and not warmth.  I see all sorts of people freezing because they bought a nice looking fall jacket, and wear it all winter.  You don't just add gloves and a hat to your usual fall gear, and call it winter gear.  

Here's what you look for when buying winter clothes:  
Polyester sock liners, to keep your feet from itching.   
Wool socks, to keep your feet warm.   
Waterproof boots, to keep your feet dry.  
Long underwear pants, to keep your legs warm.  
Long underwear shirt for your torso.  
At this point you are set for most Midwest winters. Throw on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, and you'll be plenty warm in the snow, at about 30 degrees.  People will look at you like you are crazy walking around in a T-shirt in the winter, but you'll be warm.  Add a jacket or sweater if you'll be outside for awhile, or if it's windy.  
For colder temperatures, add a hat, gloves, and/or scarf.  In most cases, it's the wind more than the cold, and you just want to cover any exposed skin.   
Down coats are excellent for warmth, or wool, if you want something a little more formal looking.  Fur is nice, but heavy, and not terribly practical. 
Basically stick with animal products outside, with polyester underneath.  Cover up for wind.  Keep your feet dry.

NongminNess,"My favorite season...

Today was 39F and I had the windows and doors open while I was lounging around in my boxers.  My hands get a little cold, but that's it.  I wish I had a picture to contrast my wife and I relaxing on the couch; me wearing just my underwear and her wearing a sweater tucked under a big blanket.

The winter months where I live are mild, usually 30-45F.  When I walk out of the gym, my body steams for several minutes.  I look like there's a fire under my hoodie and smoke is billowing out from my neck.  I own a thin leather jacket and that's enough for me.  Sometimes I put on a pair of gloves when I ride my bike.  During the winter I spend hours outside, exploring, walking around, exercising, and enjoying life.

The summers are brutal to me once it's above 75F.  I sweat like I've been exercising, I feel weaker and dehydrate quickly even though I up my water intake.

Galaldriel,"Insurance should be purchased with catastrophic loss in mind ONLY, not for minor maintenance. This goes for home, auto &amp; health.

Insurance companies make money on EVERYTHING you buy through them. They know the likelihood of almost any loss, so self-insure as much as possible because you will be pocketing their profits. Don't buy the frills &amp; carry the highest deductibles offered.

The one exception to the above is to carry high liability limits. It's cheap and worth the additional cost. Even if you have a low net worth now and think you have nothing to protect, remember your biggest asset may be your future earnings potential-and it can be garnished forever.

Life insurance rates go up midway through each decade @ 25, 35, 45, etc. years old. So if you get your life insurance @ 24, 34, 44, etc. you'll be saving.

Term life insurance is all you need. Don't buy universal or variable. Keep your investment money separate from life insurance.

FightingUrukHai,"Kind of long, but bear with me....

So, there's two kids in high school. One of them's named Will, the other is Kate. Will's kind of shy and socially awkward, but he has a huge crush on Kate. Prom is coming up, and Will builds up his courage and finally asks Kate out to the prom. As it turns out, Kate has a bit of a crush on Will as well, so she says yes. Will is overjoyed, and goes to get tickets. The problem is, there's a huge ticket line. Tons of people are standing there trying to get tickets to the prom. Eventually, Will gets to the front and buys two tickets for him and Kate, and then runs to his next class as fast as he can. 

Will has never been on a date before (socially awkward, remember?), but he decides he needs to rent a tux for prom. That afternoon, he goes to the store to ask for a tuxedo rental. The problem is, there's a giant tux line, and it takes him an hour to get to a salesperson. Eventually he gets measured and is told that the suit will be ready in two days, the day of the prom. 

The next day, Will is looking in the mirror and decides that he wants to look good for Kate, so he's gonna go out and get a haircut. He goes to the barbershop, but there's an enormous haircut line. It takes him ages to get into the chair, but eventually he manages to get his hair cut. The barbers are very overworked, and it's definitely not his best haircut, but he thinks it will do just fine. 

The next day is prom day. He goes out to the store and grabs his tux, then goes home, takes a shower, and puts it on. It fits just fine, and he's ready to go to Kate's house. Suddenly he realizes that he forgot to get flowers! He races over to the florist's, but there's a *gigantic* flower line. He stands in line for nearly an hour trying to get a bouquet for Kate, and by the time he makes his purchase, he's already running late. He jumps in his car and starts skirting the speed limit, trying to get to her house on time. In the end, he's about five minutes late and really worried. Kate however, is perfectly fine (if you'll recall, she had a crush on him, too), and really appreciates the flowers. She gets into his car and they drive to the prom. 

When they arrive, Kate is really excited. They dance a bit, and Kate has to lead him all the way -- Will is all nerves and has no idea how to dance. She has a good time anyways, and after a while the two of them sit down to talk. They spend a lot of time talking about this and that, and Will is feeling a lot less nervous. After a little while Kate starts to get thirsty, so she asks Will if he could get her a drink. Will gets up from the table and heads for the refreshment table.

I'd prefer cremation and a cinerarial park (not sure about the word, I mean those green parks with trees where your ashes get deposited in the roots of the tree) but my parents might prefer a burial and that's fine by me if that works for my SO.

                 By, LiquidGen0cide

Once upon a time, the day after thanksgiving, a 22 year old man was siting in his parents basement. He was an avid gun enthusiast and used all of his income to buy weapons instead of his own house. Siting there the man realized what day it was. Black Friday. More people in the stores.""more people to kill."" He thought. He went over to his personal gun safe and unlocked it. He took out one of his many assault rifles. he loaded them and then put them in his car. As he was going out the door he yelled something about shopping in the general direction of his mother. As he arrived in the parking lot he noticed it was full. The many cars caused him to smile. Due to the sacristy of parking spaces he pulled up in front of the automatic sliding glass doors. He grabbed the assault rifle from the passenger seat and got out of his car. he walked in. He aimed his gun at the nearest shopper. He fired 8 shots into the mass of frantic mothers and screaming americans. He fired some more emptying his magazine. He quickly reloaded shooting anyone that got close to him. after ten minutes and thirty seconds he ran out to his car. He got in and drove home to his frantic mother going on about a shooting downtown.

professorfarns,"Depression is a part of the spectrum of irregular moods that I experience as part of my Bipolar Disorder. I have experienced mania, hypomania, and depression, and each mood-state is definitely distinct, but depression is perhaps the most difficult to deal with: while mania tends to be marked by lapses in judgment, irritability, extreme sensitivity to sensory stimuli, anxiety, and nervous energy to the point that I need little sleep, depression comes with a total lack of love and emotion of any kind. 

This sucks, for lack of a better word. I am usually an emotional, expressive person who likes to lavish love and affection upon those I care about, and when my ability to feel love disappears, my relationships with family, friends, and my long-time boyfriend definitely suffer. To clarify, it's not that I lose the ability to feel emotions associated with love: if someone does something kind for me or shows me love or affection, I feel gratitude, and know logically that I love them too. But I do not feel the welling-up inside that is usually associated with loving another person, and this is difficult for all involved. 

My family are supportive, and try to keep me active: my parents take me to movies, have me help them walk the dogs, and come over for dinner frequently. I'm a college student and don't live with them but am thankfully close to home, and my mom has almost an intuitive sense of when I need their help, but it is a struggle, because I collapse in upon myself when I'm depressed, and I can tell they are frustrated by the fact that their best and most well-intended efforts aren't enough. They've helped most by helping put me through cognitive therapy, and just letting me know that I am loved, no matter what, even if I am disconnected from the ability to show them the same. 

My poor boyfriend struggles a little more: he is NOT an expressive guy, and is not particularly emotional, but he is protective and nurturing, and I know he cares for me more than much of the other stuff in his life. This, unfortunately, turns into him wanting to fix the problem as soon as possible: he means well, but is not always excellent at realizing that sometimes I just need him to lie with me on the couch and watch a movie, or to let me cry, or to just *be.* I always improve, and always get better, but sometimes withdraw into the shell of the girlfriend that he fell for when we started dating. It definitely wears on him, and we sometimes end up fighting when he tries to take action to help that ends up not being what I needed from him, though all he wants is to help. 

Regardless, I am so grateful, every day. My family, friends and boyfriend (and years of therapy to teach me how to successfully cope with my triggers and moods) are the reason why I am still alive. I love them, always, even if I can't feel it for a time. 

**TL;DR, mental illness is hard for those who struggle with it and for those who love the mentally ill, but by showing simple support you're helping by leaps and bounds.**

I was pretty little so this was a very traumatic experience for me.  

I also once saw a guy on top of those huge signs on the side of a tall building (I'm sorry, I'm tired and can't think of the proper term). He was threatening to jump and I was mixed in with the crowd below. My brother had just attempted suicide not long before this so I was really distraught and wanted more than anything to scale that building and hug this person and tell him how much I cared about him and didn't want to see him jump. The crowd of people however decided it would be funny to yell at him and tell him to ""do it,"" or ""jump already!"" I was horrified at how comical this all seemed to everyone and started to express my disgust with everyone until my husband pulled me away and got us far, far away from the situation. I'm still haunted to this day not knowing if that poor guy ever jumped or not. :( People can really be assholes sometimes. ",null,0,cdn6wq3,1rgx4j,AskReddit,top_day,2

aDinoSupremacist,"**DREAM 1:** Last night I had a dream that my family and I were walking through what my mind thought Venice looked like. At one point my mom goes to do a porno. She doesn't but I watch where she is walking with a Halo Radar system. She's in the water, but all the other dots appear to be fish.
For some reason I'm a kid and I go to a fancy house with a bunch of other kids. I then walk onto the boardwalk from the beginning of the dream which is a gang attack going on from GTA5. I can see the radar with the red dots all over the place. A airplane then flies by that has a Doctor Rockso (the rock and roll clown) face where the propeller should be. There's two clown girls standing on the wings who shoot at me and there's an explosion. The explosion knocks me into the water. 

I then get back to that fancy house and begin to knock criminals out. Then Ron Perlman's character from Blade 2 is holding me and I'm explaining why I was knocking his people out. I say that if I was older I would kill them like The Crow. I then point out that The Crow is on TV. I get away from him and throw some weird tapeworms at them. The tapeworms shoot themselves into their mouths.

A couple of guys run into the room carrying a crocodile (prehistoric one too) and ask me to throw a tapeworm in it's mouth. I throw it in there and the croc closes his mouth.

The dream then jumps to me walking around in the BlockBuster from my town (before it was shut down.) There's original Xbox's on sale for $3-8. But I want a PS3. The store then manages to shift shape, and I throw a pineapple tree through the window. The whole area and shop looks like it's from Fallout 3. 

Police show up and I am standing in the back of the building with them. I have my phone pulled out so I can call Lester and get rid of my wanted level (they don't know I stole the PS3.) They arrest two kids and put slave collars on them. They then put a slave collar on the daughter of the store owner. I go inside and tell them that I can take off the slave collars and free the innocent boys if they promise to never say that I was the thief.

The girl then gets up on top of a cabinet and begins to scream a lot. I call her a crybaby and a tornado comes by. She runs for the basement as the walls are ripped away around her. Her mother's skin on her face is ripped away. I hold onto her while I hold onto a cabinet door. Now I'm suddenly Armin from Attack on Titan. I look over and Eren is looking at me then his voice is suddenly the Catalyst's. He says ""Your time is at an end."" I yell ""no"" while the tornado is trying to suck me up.

My alarm goes off and I'm awake. I don't do drugs btw. 


**DREAM 2:** When I was a kid I had a dream there was a pod of Orca's swimming at the surface. I slid into one of their mouths and it's throat was a long tunnel filled with cutting tools. I reach the stomach and there's a cut up boy sitting there. I have no idea what happened after that.

**DREAM 3:** Sometime after 9/11 I had a dream that I was inside my old BlockBuster fighting off Mummies. The outside was normal but in the inside it was a whole different world. It was a desert with giant Mummies saying ""Osama"" over and over again. I think we were preventing them from reaching an opening to Hell which was right behind my squad of 2 other guys. I was using a pump action shotgun. But whenever the pump came off, it exploded. When it exploded a second time we died.

**DREAM 4:** I lied to my family that I was getting married. I'm standing by the entrance of my High School (interior) with my Grandma fixing my bowtie. So it's the day of the wedding. I then tell her that it was all a lie and that there was no girl.

Although the attacks on the WTC had already happened before we arrived at school (I happened to be there early due to chorus rehearsal and listened to a radio news report of it with my teacher) and some of our parents who worked downtown in Chicago had already been evacuated, they did not cancel classes. 

I lived in an upper-middle class community and many of us had parents traveling that day for business Little information and wild imaginations led to a lot of worried kids at recess before lunch. Enter: the weird kid. When you're that age you don't really look at people as above or below you, but he wasn't the same as the rest of us. His parents were divorced and he wore rattier jeans and lots of dated, hand-me-down clothing. 

One of the kids in our class had a parent traveling out of Boston that morning and was incredibly worried (his flight never actually departed due to the attacks). The weird kid, capitalizing on this rare moment of vulnerability started dancing around the playground praising the attacks, saying he was happy about them, and smiling. 

It was really strange. Looking back, I know that he had no idea the weight of what had happened that day. After elementary school no one I knew kept in touch with him and he didn't go to school with us, so I don't know if he grew up to be an actual weirdo or if it was just a childish reaction.

   Well one day him and his buddies get the idea to spray paint their airsoft guns black, and flash them around to students at a local highschool. The students called the cops, and all schools on that half of the city were locked down. Students tell police the car they left in and what road. The police shut down the ENTIRE stretch of road, and pull the guys over. Police at the time didn't know the guns were fake, so the stop is executed by the Tactical Unit (SWAT team pretty much, if it suits your fancy) with full body armor and assault weapons. One of the guys pissed himself, the other cried like babies-who wouldn't with assault weapons aimed at them.

   Needless to say, he didn't get to finish the semester at my school, and his mom probably hasn't let him borrow her SUV since, that is, if he isn't doing time.

Aches and Pains or Sore Muscles? Hot bath and Epsom salts. Gone. 
Headaches? Drink water. Didn't help? Drink coke or something with caffeine. Headache because you're Congested? Have some super spicy mustard (usually found at Chinese restraints) that'll clear you right up. Or massage your sinuses and do the whole cold washcloth over the eyes thing. Also if you pinch the skin between your thumb and index finger that works as a temporary fix. 

Don't wanna get a cold? Honestly take your vitamins. I eat super healthy but I used to always get sick, especially when I'm stressed. This year I started taking a teen one a day vitamin and even though I've had finals, college apps and auditions all last week, I'M OKAY!!! I am so shocked. So I get it if your aren't into drugstore stuff, but seriously, take vitamins. 
Also on the ""general health"" note, buy a humidifier/mister and put it by your bed. It helps so much. 

I get vaccinated for the flu so I don't really have that problem but BUNDLE THE HELL UP when you go outside. Buy a cute scarf or something, whatever it takes, protect yourself, you are worth it!! 

However when I used to get bronchitis (all the goddamn time) I would use my humidifier, drink tons of ice water to send all the mucous and drainage into my stomach and soothe my throat. Trying to keep your throat, chest and face warm are the most important. You don't want to shock your system by going from warm to bitter cool oh my god this is hell because that's just gonna make you vulnerable.

For colds, especially in the winter, boil cinnamon sticks on the stove in some water. Not cassia, actual cinnamon. Smells nice and breathing it helps you get over the cold quicker.

Coconut oil for blemishes - it sounds crazy but it will keep your face moisturized and also get rid of the infections causing the pimples. It's also SPF 5(iirc) and is amazing for dry lips in the winter. Coconut oil can also get rid of flakes from dry scalp and, bonus, makes a great hair mask treatment.

For headaches (and also nausea), balm with peppermint oil works wonders. Badger Balm makes a lavender &amp; peppermint balm for headaches that works better than Excedrin Migraine for me.

Gehalgod,"Lady here. You should definitely buy the fanciest fedora you can find before the date. It's basically a signal to us females that you're well-read when it comes to science. Also, make sure to hold the door a lot. Not just for me, but for *every* lady we run into while we're out. You should also complain if the woman you hold the door open for doesn't immediately show sexual interest in you. That gets my panties *soaking* like you wouldn't believe.

You should show a general hesitation toward touching me in any way. Even if we take a picture together you should put your arm around my shoulder but just sort of hold your hand above my skin nervously without actually making contact. When a man does this to me it makes me think he must really respect my physical boundaries.

I'm also impressed by a man who is uncomfortable around children. I love it when I'm on a date with a man and we see a lost child in the park, and instead of trying to reunite the poor kid with his probably very worried parent, the man just sort of walks faster and acts like he didn't see the child. A real man knows that rescuing a child from distress just isn't worth the awkwardness of having to talk to it.

Also, let ME pay for my own dinner, dammit! But NOT for yours. Why do so many guys get this wrong!? They all try to pay the entire bill and that just sends the wrong message. What are we-- friends? If you're going to date me, we're going Dutch. On second thought, you can just leave your wallet at home in your mother's basement (where you are certain to live if you're the kind of man I'm into) ;)

Lastly AND most importantly -- Always, I repeat, *always* get a little tipsy before driving to pick me up. When I see a guy step out of his car with a little alcohol on his breath, it lets me breathe easy and know that he isn't a complete stiff who is afraid to be himself.

2.  Learn from your mistakes and work backwards.  If it takes you 45 minutes to get ready in the morning and you have to leave by 8, you'll never get out the door on time if you get up at 7:30.
3.  When using google maps or something similar for estimated times, add 25% to their estimate, 50% or more if you're traveling during rush hour.
4.  If you're constantly late to a social event, get some accountability with a friend -- for every minute (or 5) you are late, you owe them a dollar.  If you show up on time, they owe you a drink.
5.  Set a goal of being on time for things for 7, 14, 20, however many days.  Pick a reward to give yourself if you are on time for that many days in a row.
6.  Going back to #2 -- don't make excuses.  Everyone will be late at some point due to factors they can't control.  Admit that it happened and learn from it.  Like all things we can control messing up one time is okay, but learn from it and don't screw up a second time.
7.  When you have a set time to get ready before you leave don't procrastinate, check email, twitter, reddit, turn off the music and focus on getting out the door at the right time.

theclosetwriter,"A lot of people are saying to change your clocks.  I've tried that but the problem is that I *know* I've changed my clock; it doesn't work to trick me.  I would just automatically make the calculation in my head, so it had no effect on me.  

Know how long it takes you to do things.  Know which things you plan on doing the next morning, and adjust how much time you allow yourself.  

The most important thing (at least for me) is to not hit snooze.  Put your alarm clock in a different room.  Get an app that makes you solve a simple math problem in order to turn the alarm off.  (Sometimes I'll still set a 'fake' alarm for 30 mins before I really have to wake up, but that's just so bad, because even when my 'real' alarm goes off, I'll just keep hitting snooze.  That forms a bad habit.)  Get up when your alarm goes off.  And you'll know each morning that you have to get up at that time if you've already calculated how much time you need for that morning.

For example, me:

* 10 mins- quick shower, makeup, scrunch hair OR 35 mins- shower with shaving, makeup, blow dry and iron hair  (Yes- the night before I will actually think about: 'can I take a quick shower or are my legs hairy' or 'how do I want to style my hair' because different options take different amounts of time. IF it's late and I want as much time as possible to sleep, I'll take a quick shower before bed so I can get an extra 30 minutes of sleep.)  It's all about maximizing your time where you can; being smart with time.

* 15 mins- breakfast  (Again, if I want some extra sleep time, I'll know ahead of time that 'oh I'll just grab this banana in the morning and eat it in the car on the way to work' (disclaimer: don't eat and drive; i've heard it's dangerous.) and then I can sleep a bit longer.)

Figure out how much time it takes you to get ready to go out the door.  Then add an extra five minutes (to your wake up time); I usually use them doing something like looking for socks or the keys or just trying to make sure I have everything I need.  

* DRIVE TIME- It takes me 7-10 minutes to get to work.  I'll leave the house 20 minutes before I need to get there, and I'll usually get there right on time.  It's not just about time spent driving- it's about the time walking to your car and from your car (for me, that can eat up 5 minutes) and what if there's traffic?  What if you need gas?  Pre-plan!!  Pre-plan!!  (I think that language is repetitive but whatever.) 

* Drive time part II- How much extra 'drive time' you give yourself also depends upon where you're going.  For example, I went to a wedding that was 1.5 hours away, so I left the house with an extra 45 minutes to spare.  Worst case: 'great, I'm here 45 minutes early.'  I had never been to the area before, and if I got lost, I wanted to have time to be able to find it.  Also, I wasn't sure how traffic would be.  I got to the wedding about 7 minutes before the ceremony began.  45 minutes extra drive time seems like a lot, but in that situation, it was necessary and wise.  

* Put it all TOGETHER- What's going on tomorrow, you ask?  A job interview?!  Great!  Better look good for that: 35 minutes getting ready time.  Probably should do the breakfast thing at home too: only 7 minutes because that banana doesn't need a lot of prep time.  It's an interview; gotta arrive 15 minutes early.  Drive time? It's near where I work, so 20 minutes.  What's that all together?  77 minutes, or 1 hour 17 minutes.  Now in this situation, knowing that I might be nervous and change my mind about what I want to wear in the morning, I would go ahead and wake up 1.5 hours before I want to arrive for the interview, and I'd make note of the time by when I plan on leaving my house.  (All of these calculations will be easier to make once you figure out personally how long getting ready, breakfast, whatever takes you.)  THEN when your alarm goes off in the morning, you KNOW you've gotta GET UP!!  Or... okay, maybe I'll sleep in 10 more minutes and just not eat breakfast.  :)

**TL;DR**: CALCULATIONS: [How long does it take me to do all necessary tasks in order to get somewhere (getting ready, eating breakfast, driving)] + [how long it takes me to do stupid stuff (walking from car to work, finding keys, whatever)] + [at least 5 mercy minutes (but maybe more depending on situation)].

edkaelsy,"&lt;- Cop. I HATE answering hypothetical questions in terms of enforcement as there are just so many variables in the real world....but I figured I would give this one a go lol.

I, personally, only pull over two vehicles at once if they are drag-racing. Trying to coordinate two different vehicles into the exact same spot is very difficult to do and often very unsafe for everyone involved. Drag-racing is MUCH different then two folks who happen to just be speeding at the same time or ""going with the flow"" though.

It depends on my detection method. If one is behind the other, our in-car radar will pick up on the front vehicle. It's basic line-of-sight rules, so naturally that's the only one I can say with proof was speeding. If I'm roadside using a handheld LIDAR and physically point it at both vehicles and observe they are operating at the same speed, I will simply go for which one I feel is safer to stop. I realize this is a terrible answer but again, real world conditions vary. When I say the safest, I'm talking which one will I have to drive less aggressively to stop, etc. EVERYONE around watching me pull over that vehicle gets the message as well. We all do it...driving down the road and see a cop flip a u-turn and go after someone, even if it's not you...you still get the pucker just a bit lol. It's all about safety, man. That's why I'm out there making stops in the first place. I could care less if the city gets money, I just don't want someone getting smashed by a bad driver. Speed limits are set in place by engineers for a reason depending on the roadway, taking into consideration reaction/stopping times and average amount of traffic.

My best friend tapped me on the shoulder and pointed out a flight attendant crying and hyperventilating into a paper bag, and our teacher yelled at us from across the aisle and made us put our heads back down. Everyone was quiet, some adults were crying but all us kids were just...waiting. We landed, really roughly, but otherwise okay.

bobroland,"The thing about this kind of question, is that as you get older you realize everything you did or didn't do helped shape you into who you are. Wanting to change the past is a bit like saying ""I don't like who I am""...and, well, I happen to like my life. It's pretty good.

I should have appreciated the fact that I didn't have all the answers when I was young. The sneering arrogance of youth is a story told every generation. The old bastards merely smile, knowing that someday the young turk will realize what a fool he was.

There's the little things, of course. I should have gone to the dentist more often. Would have saved me thousands of dollars in the future. I wouldn't have allowed myself to become an emotional wreck after my fiance left me (I would see her twenty years later. She was still beautiful. We had a nice fling for a few months then went our separate ways with no hard feelings.) I can't say I would have continued college. Hitch hiking, working in a carnival, as a repo man, as a poker player, etc...I never would have got to experience any of those things if not for the choices I made.

You regret not spending enough time with people you love. I would take a few more hours to appreciate my daughter before she passed away in my arms. Instead of the pain I felt, I would have taken more moments to enjoy the happiness she brought me, instead. I would have spent more time with my Grandfather, and hear his stories. Figure out what he knew of life. I would spend more time getting to know my Father. You never realize how short your time is with people.

I guess the biggest regret aren't the things I did, but the time I spent NOT doing things. How much time did I spent stoned off my ass, sitting on a couch? How many people did I not get a chance to meet because I felt doing nothing? How many years would be cut out of the story of my life because I wasted time on video games or comics? I would hate to find the answer.

I'm rambling, but that's one of the pleasures of being old. You can afford time to navel gaze. There's no great wisdom to be discovered, but each man and woman has to find the key to their own happiness. ",null,100,cdn3t4j,1rgth0,AskReddit,top_day,605

Education: got my bachelor's degree despite a shameful amount of partying and procrastination. Luckily my last boyfriend in college was a good influence in that respect and helped me study and graduate.

Traveling - Went all over North America and Europe, including tons of hiking/backpacking in the US, and a month-long bicycle tour from California to Colorado. I've seen a mock viking ship get burned on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, gone snowshoeing in the Vermont mountains, and gathered pieces of the Berlin Wall. I'm so glad I did it while I was young and unencumbered, because family life while awesome really ties you down! Go find adventure.

Wild life: sex, good drugs, rock'n'roll, motorcycles, clubs, etc. played Frisbee on the beach in a bikini every week while I was still young enough to get away with it, no one wants to look at my mom butt any more. Glad I got ogled and fondled and made my conquests while I was young and beautiful :)

Thinks I do regret: the unprotected sex, the bad drugs, the self-loathing - I wish I had loved myself a little more back then, not in the megalomania of youth way, but believed I was a truly good person worthy of love.",null,12,cdn4kra,1rgth0,AskReddit,top_day,47

Start off rational, figure butter is good, so I throw some butter in there. I think, what else do I like? I'm in the mood for something sweet... how about sugar! And what else always makes things better? Cheese! So I put tortellini, dollop of butter, pour some sugar, and a cheese SLICE all in a bowl, microwave it for a while then mix it together.

putyerdickinit,Depending on what you're looking to draw I would recommend tracing pictures. It's actually good practice and helps train you how to make certain lines and shapes and shading.

Zevorrus,"One of the biggest things I had to draw in the beginning was still lifes. If you draw what you see in front of you every day, like food, scenery, trinkets, people, you start to get a feel and understanding of how real world shapes work and will be able to convert it to 2D styles easier. Also you can look up drawing techniques for shading and lines and proportions to help that you can incorporate into your drawings. Things like press release lines, shadows and highlights, pencil strokes, and types of pencils.

Spheres are very common and helpful for shading techniques. Here's a few videos that may help:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDWK1PWbyS8

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD6WNg2yDbI

The advice the others gave you are good too for getting the basic shapes and ideas down. I'm mostly giving advice for giving your drawings more form haha But technique is an important part as it's what makes it cleaner and more advanced/realistic looking. Once you get some techniques and understanding of forms down it's easier to transition into other styles like cartoons and the sort. Hope this helped :)",null,0,cdn85a9,1rgsxa,AskReddit,top_day,2

Also, any accent can be cool if you say cool things with it. I'm a sucker for dialects, the more idiosyncratic it is, the better.

I like funny words that only exist in a particular dialect or have a very specific meaning. These are the best and most useless words to know. Words like prochling, and gaveril and fokken. BUT if I HAD TO pick, I'd say that from the good old Commonwealth I'd choose Irish and from the Colonies I'd have to say the New Orleans frenchy southern creole thing they have going on.

Go to school, but go to summer school and finish as quickly as you can. You can normally take 5 classes over the summer, and one in January...

volk1,"I'm only 24, but I think I can give a good answer.  For clarification, I was a CS major in college and I'm a software developer now.  I couldn't do what I do now without a traditional degree.  Not only did it allow me to get hired, it gave me the training to do my job.  No amount of self training could simply replace my degree.

The answer basically comes down to what you want to go to school for.  If you are going to school for engineering, CS, or Pre-Med, you are probably doing a good thing for yourself.  You can get out with a 4 year (minus premed obviously) and start working.  If you are looking for another degree, think long and hard about whether you really want to do that, because if you want a job in that field, you might be looking at at minimum, a Masters.  You should think long and hard about any degree, but its a lot harder to find a job with a degree in history than Mechanical Engineering.

If you aren't sure what you want to do, try Community College.  If you aren't sure if something is for you, don't just jump right in.  Take a class or two in it.  Make sure you enjoy it.  Remember, what you get a degree in is probably going to be what you do for at least 5-10 years of your life.",null,0,cdn35n2,1rgrnb,AskReddit,top_day,3
3dogs3catsandahedgeh,"I majored in English and worked in advertising sales for many years. I earned very good money despite my major, but not everyone is so lucky. Go to college, if you wish, but with an end in mind-don't major in psychology, for example, unless you plan to get your PhD and become a psychologist.

  It's also possible to make quite a bit of money running your own business without going to college, but you would have to enjoy working in plumbing, electrical, or drywall trades. Other options can be working for a small business, like a septic tank company, and eventually buying your own business. I can tell you that the business owners I sold to were very well off, predominantly, but they had worked many long hours to get that way. Very few of them had college degrees, but they all had skills. It can be very lucrative to own a storage facility, for example, but it takes a great deal of money to build one. Plumbers need to be journeymen for six years or so before they can be master plumbers, and only a master can work independently. I get frustrated that business ownership isn't offered as an option for high school students. Most really wealthy people own or owned their own business. There's a lot of risk in it, but there's a lot of rewards too. ",null,0,cdn3fv9,1rgrnb,AskReddit,top_day,3

One day she left work early because she wasn't feeling well, and she found him in bed with 2 other girls at 1 in the afternoon. Apparently he'd been hitting up Craigslist for all sorts of no-strings-attached sex for a few months. She freaked (naturally) and broke up with him. Somehow he talked her into reconciling. Pretty much her entire family objected, and they all walked out when she remained at the altar. It was very awkward. None of the bride's friends were aware of this drama until we cornered some drunk cousins at the reception. They are still married. ",null,0,cdn3dzv,1rgqci,AskReddit,top_day,4

I also recommend Geocaching. Someone else recommended it too, but it is pretty fun. If you have any kind of smartphone or a GPS, you can do it. You could even do it, albeit more limited, with google earth. You have to navigate your way to certain locations, and then find a hidden cache of goods at that location.

Honestly, I think I may have had more fun than him. He said it felt good but it was different from actually getting your penis sucked. His reactions were kind of spasmic, when I would tongue flick one of them, and I enjoyed being in control.

TupperWolf,"Late to the party but this one is too good to pass up:

I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in.  This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel.  He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious.  My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face.  He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today.  It's painful to watch.

But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge.  In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ""heeeey.  It's OPS.  Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five.  Thanks."" And puts the phone down.  And then he just sits there.  Squinting.  Waiting.
  
And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him.  After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me.  By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face.  He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel.  I am in awe.  

He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour).  But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",null,26885,cdn2go6,1rgpdf,AskReddit,top_day,31039

_vargas_,"A couple years ago, there was an instance where I had the day off *and* my girlfriend at the time was away at her grandparents until later that night. This left me free to sit about the apartment with absolutely nothing expected of me, so I just sat on the couch all day and watched TV. Within twenty minutes, I decided to rub one out. 

Bringing up a video of a young Japanese women being massaged by another young Japanese woman, I merrily stroked away. Ninety seconds later, I felt ready to bust a nut. I searched frantically for a receptacle. Finding none, I frantically removed a sock and slid my penis in it just in time for the climax. Instead of getting up to put the sock with the dirty laundry and maybe giving my hand a bit of a wash, I opted to toss the gooey sock on the rug in front of me and continue watching Whale Wars. 

About an hour later, I was watching an episode of True Blood. In it, Anna Paquin was completely nude and more importantly, not talking. I felt an involuntary twitch down in my loins.

""Again?"" I asked my penis in a tone that I normally reserve for when my dog has to go outside even though I just walked him a couple hours prior.

Taking it out of my boxers, I went to work on another flogging. Halfway through, I again realized that I would need another place to blow my load. I looked at my foot without a sock. Then I looked at my foot with the sock...

After I had finished violating it, I threw that other sock on the floor next to its twin. I thought about rising from the couch to tidy up a little but instead I changed the channel (Sookie Stackhouse is never more annoying than right after you finish spanking it to her nude body). 

A couple hours go by when I stumble upon the Food Network. Giada is on. She's making something. It's Italian and saucy. Giada with her beautiful hair, perfect teeth, and tasteful amount of cleavage. Her breasts jiggle in a subtle, nearly imperceptible way when she's chopping artichokes. 

""Oh, Giada,"" I think. ""We would make such sweet love. Leave that douchebag, Todd, and run away with me.""

""...and remember to make sure the *mascarpone* is room temperature before using it.""

That's when I noticed my rock-hard Tom Jones poking out of the pee flap of my boxers. It was so hard that I swear it was vibrating or something. I got to work immediately on making it go away. As I neared the conclusion, my eyes were darting everywhere, searching for someplace to catch my wad. No use, though. I came all over my Matchbox 20 t-shirt. By now, you've probably figured out that I didn't get up. I just took the jizz drizzled shirt and tossed it with the two socks. Then, I took a nap.

I awoke around 9pm. My girlfriend was home. She asked how my day was.

""Very, very relaxing. I really needed it.""

""That's good. I want to take a quick shower and then I'll sit down and tell you how my day was...Uh, why are there clothes crumpled up on the floor?""

I could climax without spreading gooey stuff everywhere.

DeniseDeNephew,"&gt;This seems a bit unfair


It is, but society isn't going to change their attitude about this any time soon.  As a girl I feel that you have every right to hit someone back if they are genuinely hitting you in anger.  However, I don't make the rules.  If you had hit her back some people would see you as a coward (don't ask me to explain; I can't), some would see you as a pussy, and some would see you as an uncivilized monster.


Either stop being her friend or tell her to never do that again.  If she (or anyone else, for that matter) does, make a fist and act as if you're going to punch her.  You'll be amazed at how effective that threat will be.  Follow it up with something like, ""I don't *want* to hit you but I'm not going to stand her and be your punching bag.  Knock it off or I'm hitting you back.""  She might feel that she has every right to punch a guy for the same reasons you stated.  ""It couldn't have hurt that bad"".  Explain to her that she's wrong.

The producers saw they could stand to make some money in it, so they tried getting involved. Rather than letting the producers ruin their creation, the writers just refused to continue.

Inside I picture a time machine, again with great detail. I picture how I step inside of that time machine, and picture everything about it inside. The dials, the readouts, the smell of the leather seat, the smell of the oil used to lubricate the mechanics, e.t.c. Then I picture how I use that time machine to travel in time. I picture how I step out of the time machine, in a different time and sometimes different location. I picture what I see, hear, smell, sense..the wind..I picture how I walk around in a different time, observing the world around me.

The first time I was caught in it, I tried thinking about my funny Biology teacher. But that made me think of the skeleton in the classroom that he would use to make jokes. Sure enough, a rattling hissing groaning skeleton started crawling toward my bed on the floor.

The second time I tried thinking about my crush and how beautiful she is. Before I could do anything, I saw her in the corner of my eye (always the worst in sleep paralysis), pale, flesh falling off, messy hair, wide eyes, and rattling voice, almost straight out of the Grudge movie.

But worst of all was in my junior year of high school. In an attempt to get out of sleep paralysis, I tried thinking of the sweetest, most innocent thing I could: the Teletubbies. Lo and behold, my brain wouldn't have it and immediately the shadowy form of Tinky Winky was at my bed. The TV on his chest was a shadowy static, and his eyes were gone, a pale pinprick of red all I could make out. He was grinning, his mouth full of sharp teeth, and some ungodly voice was whispering his name into my ear. ""Tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnkkkky Wiiiiiiiiiiiinnnkkkkyy"" (yeah it sounds stupid but back then it was downright terrifying.)

drunkenjazz,"My best friends girlfriend was murdered by the maintenance guy in her new apartment. We helped her move in the day before, so we were the last to see her. My buddy for some reason quit his job the next day and called her, I worked early in the day so we went and did all the laundry. When we returned home the police were all over our house. We circled the block and parked and when we did the police came and got us. As 22 year old kids we were super stoned doing laundry. When the police wanted to talk to us we both were really nervous of course. We didn't know what had happened at the time. They took us both ""downtown"" and left us in rooms alone for hours. When the officer walked in the room, I asked him what had happened to our friend. After hours alone I put it together that it had to be about her. ATM receipts covered my friends story and I had worked early in the morning. We did have to give dna samples and fingerprints. We were contacted by the police no less than once a week and questioned thoroughly each time. As a matter of fact they came to our apartment first thing Thanksgiving morning and when I asked why they were there on Thanksgiving they said most people would be home on Thanksgiving. After everything was over, I went back to her apartment and helped moved her belongings out, it's something I will never forget seeing. Missing parts of carpet, blood soaked into the floor. Light switches removed, drain pipes from the sinks all missing. Since then my friend has lost everything to heroin, we all had struggled with some sort of self medication after she was killed. Her roommate who found her is dead from a drug overdose, again she had been struggling for years, she had stopped calling a year or so after. I think she couldn't be reminded of her when she saw us. I'm typing this with tears in my eyes, fifteen years later. If people could see the devastation that follows when someone is murdered, follow the family for ten years, see what it does to someone... I think there would be less homicides in the world. Happy Thanksgiving and remember to hug the ones you love.",null,0,cdn4j3b,1rgl90,AskReddit,top_day,2

haaaalp_,"I have an autistic brother. Honestly, it isnt easy. Expeciay being young and wondering why everyone paid so much more attention to him, and why he ways got to stay at the ""special hotels"". He is 20, i'm 18. I cant stand living with him. He steals, screams, yells, and can be very violent, but because he is autistic, he isnt able to learn why what he is doing is bad. It's really hard living with a mentally challenged person, and gets very frustating. I have many storys about the kind of stuff he has done, if anyone is interested.

Edit: story time!- *story 1* The most recent thing that he has done, was stealing a gun from one of his friends father. He lied to the police about it, but finally confessed. He doesnt have it. 

*story 2* There was also a time where my boyfriend and I were sitting in the front room of my house, and he had walked in with a big knife and held it over his head as if he were going to stab one of us. He has done this a few times with mw, and has even done it with a hatchet.

*story 3* when we were much younger he was on A LOT of medication. These pills did not mix well, and evidently caused some bad habits in my brother. He used to get up into te middle of the night and take fish out of the tank, and watch them slowly die. He had also done this woth the newts we had. At one point we had a box tourtise and he had ""accidently"" dropped a brick on her. But the one that hit me hard was when he took my cat, Dusty, and threw her out of our window, which is about 6ft off the ground. It broke her collar bone and we didnt know about it until it was too late.

EDIT 2: *story 4* here is a more happy story. My brother is funny as hell! there was one night what was really foggy out, and he comes waltzing into the living room and states that he can smell the fog disappearing. there were also times where we have been out to eat at a chinese place, and they were playing foreign music. out of nowhere he states that he knows all the songs in english(he only knows english) shit was funny as hell/
he is also very protective and has many times stood infront of my father so he wouldnt beat me anymore.

there has been many bad times with him, but there has also been many good times too. Living with and autistic person is never easy, but it also opens your eyes and gives you more chances to be open in life, and have more expierences. 

EDIT 3: Because many of you have been asking about the situation with my father, I will just put it all out there in this edit. Now before you read this, you should know it may disturb some of you. Since I can remember until I was about 8-9 my father would beat me all the time. Same with my brother. I was left in a crib for days, filthy, with no food or water. I didnt learn how to walk until I was about 2 1/2. But the worst that he did to me was rape me and molest me until I was about 9. I finally told the police about it last year, because I was always afraid, and if he EVER comes near me now his ass is thrown in jail. Being shut out during the first decade of my life, I have developed poor social skills, and there are times where it is really hard for me to even be in a room with someone and actually hold a conversation. I am a very soft spoken girl, so that doesnt help either. I have no harsh feelings towards my father. I have forgiven him for all that he did to me, but I will NEVER forget what he put me through.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you all may have!",null,27,cdn3qht,1rgl2r,AskReddit,top_day,246

I love him and have never regretted him. But I wonder if I did something wrong to cause him to be so different. I occasionally wonder what he would be like if he were neurotypical. But it's not something I dwell on because the way he is- is the only way I've ever known him to be. And I love the person that he is.

I wish life wasn't so hard on him. He's often bullied by other children. My son is able to understand how wrong their actions are, but unable to defend himself. He breaks down instead. He takes everything so personally.

He doesn't have meltdowns so much anymore (working with a therapist has helped so much with that)- but when they were bad, he used to hit himself in the face and tell me he wanted to die. It killed me to see him feel that way. If he suffers so much now, how bad will it be when he's a teenager? When so much emphasis is put on social activities and he just won't be able to do it the way other kids can.

I have never, ever regretted my son. But having a child with autism makes me worry so much more for him.",null,23,cdn2asy,1rgl2r,AskReddit,top_day,179

Hyltonisfunny,"I had a brother on the autistic spectrum. He was non-verbal up until his later years and then relied heavily on very basic sign language. It lead to no end of frustration and heart-ache. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, because of how tragically trapped inside his own mind and body he was, and having him around (especially when he was older) meant that you were required to be constantly vigilant, because the moment to stopped to catch your breath and watch full-house, my brother was ripping up a whole roll of toilet paper, or something far more dangerous like turning on the gas stove. Having an autistic sibiling means being tired, it means that you have to grow up, not when you feel like you are ready, but now, immediately, without question or pause. When my brother was diagnosed it had a jarring effect on my family because he also had a severe reaction to his DPT shot. 21 seizures in 16 days, he would turn blue and try to die on us, I was 5 at the time and it was impossible to process, but that's not how life works, it happens and you deal and you have to learn to handle yourself after the fact. Especially so because my father, COULDN'T handle it and ended up moving away and divorcing my mother, so in a home with a single mother who is working constantly to handle the specific and insane prices of having a special needs child, I was all that was available to help. Do I sometimes regret having him as a brother? Absolutely, I would have killed for any other sibling to throw a football with, talk about girls, play video games with, anything, absolutely anything with, living with my brother was a pained existence.

However, my brother, and living with him have taught me many things that a normal home won't know as deeply and intimately as I've learned. He taught me the beauty of simplicity, no one can have as much fun doing nothing like my brother, no one can enjoy sun as much as my brother, no one can be entertained for hours delicately and meticulously ripping up tissue paper into little strips. He taught me not to take people at their appearance, or what was skin deep, by virtue that I absolutely was incapable of it with him, you have no idea what is going through his mind so you have to feel them out, I try to apply this when working with all people, special needs or not. He taught me patience and emotional endurance, because you can't quit, you can't pause, you can't stop. He needs your help and he (most of the time) doesn't understand the danger/significance/gravity of his actions. He taught me compassion, real compassion, when someone NEEDS you, when someone looks to you as a person they trust with every fiber of their being, especially when they can't put the rest of the world together, is incredibly daunting and touching all at the same time, and when you honor it, it gives a great and warm satisfaction. He taught me not to be so hard on myself, I'm not perfect and I can't expect myself to be, so if no one is hurt (and sometimes if they are) you can't hold it over your head. He had a way about himself that brought people together, even if he was angry, his method of being 'violent' would be to pinch people, heh, he would hug people as soon as he saw them and was far more lucky with women than I could manage. He had this habit of slipping his hand under the front of women's shirts when they would carry him, to which they would just laugh off. Which would only result in me angrily cursing the gods as to why I wasn't given this superpower.

In his mid teens, my brother would spend time at a sort of special care facility, a respite care facility. They would take him for the weekend so my mother could have time to breathe, one particular weekend, she went to go ski and blew out both her kneecaps. She couldn't walk let alone wrestle an autistic teen to get him still enough to change his britches. So with her unable to pick him up from care, he was declared an abandoned child. A long and strenuous battle with DHS proceeded, tearing my mother apart by the seams. I'll spare the details because they are fuzzy. Though my father has since told me that she had staged it to get extra help in some form from the state. I don't know how to process it, if my dad is full of shit then life goes on, but if he isn't, I can't exactly forgive my mom for giving him up, but I can't exactly blame her either. Ugh, another time maybe. Anyway, he did eventually get a loving and caring foster family that was paid to take care of him full-time and had a good and open relationship with my mother, they were his second family and I still care about them dearly for everything they did for my brother.

I empathize with a lot of other siblings out there as I was having the same questions come up. How am I going to handle this sort of responsibility? How am I going to raise enough money to pay for adult diapers? My decisions were quickly leaving my own hands, I couldn't go after my own pursuits because I had to worry about getting a job that paid enough to handle this sort of heavy burden. This was when the unspeakable happened but in the oddest, most comforting way possible? I still am not sure how I feel about it, but one day while I was at college, I received a call from my mother a little over two years ago that my brother had laid down to sleep and passed away. I had assumed that he might have been hurt, or in a medical emergency, it wasn't exactly a foreign concept to me, but he was legitimately and really gone. He wasn't in pain, he didn't struggle or whine, he just... left. It's unexpected, it's jarring, it hurts, but it was also relieving. Who of us could say we wouldn't want to go out like that? My mother used it as an opportunity to get closer to God, claiming that her angel was here for a short time to affect the lives that he did and that he was needed back in heaven. That's a nice picture but I've never had my mother's faith, so it was much more tragic for me, or not, I don't know. I miss him, but not the work and heartache he brought, I miss his warmth but not his pain. I feel like I owed him so much more, that I won't be able to deliver on, but at the same time I feel liberated in a way that feels wonderful and miserable all at the same time. I drink heavily on his birthday and deathday. I want there to be a light at the tunnel, I want there to be a positive note to end on, and for him there was, he was a light that brought so much to so many. And he's given me strength to pursue my goals now that I'm free of the looming responsibility, a goal to focus my goals as it were. I want to be funny, I want to add joy to the world, and sometimes remembering him gives me that strength.

However, he can also be the sweetest person you will ever see-- he often dances around, absolutely giddy with excitement, babbling and singing along with his Blues Clues radios and singing trumpets.

Even though he has drastically different moods, I still find myself despising him more than I see a brother I love. Even though I have despised him on many occasions, I always feel so guilty afterwards. I know that somewhere in my heart I love him, even though he cannot talk and can be a pain at times.

I can tell that my parents get very frustrated with him at certain times, but they absolutely love him with all of their hearts, with absolutely no regrets. I just feel bad that he will potentially occupy their time for the rest of their lives and that his behaviors will potentially get worse.

Philbo_Baggins,"I used to work with kids who had autism and were extremely low functioning, it was a 24 hour residential facility. It was one of the most stressful and hate filled time of my life. Each day it was fairly likely I would be attacked in some way or experience violence on some level. Parents had given up on these kids and shipped them off to be dealt with by 20-25 year old staff who tried their best to provide some quality of life at first, then tried to survive the work week, then tried to not kill one of these children, and then who finally got out.

I have seen a lot of people who are talking about higher functioning autism. This is great, I am glad you are doing great, you have a struggle ahead of you. But low functioning autistic children are... Horrible. Just horrible. If I had one in my home I would put it up for adoption, send it to be raised by 20 some year olds, or what have you. No one should be expect to come home to that. I would work as much overtime as possible to never again be forced to experience that again in my life.

caethiel,"It's interesting that all of the compassionate responses are coming from family members of ""high-functioning"" kids.

My brother is on the not-so-lucky end of things. He is almost entirely non-verbal, he only mimics short phrases to get things, like food. I'm painfully aware of the fact that he will never be independent. I don't want to think about it really.

I try not to think about him as much as I can, but when I see him, there is still love in my heart for him. He is an innocent kid, and it seems that most of the violent trouble he had growing up has diminished, at least to the point where I never hear about it.

It just pains me think about my parents. They have handled it as well as they can. For all the years I lived with my parents and with my brother, I never saw them blow up at him. Frustrated, yes, but they never shouted or got angry, even when he would get violent. They have never said anything bad about him, never shown signs of regret. The first few years were hard, yes, but their frustration has always been framed in the sense of what was the cause. This or that food, this or that therapy (speech and something else I don't remember), a specific video. They never blamed him. My mother is so sweet, sweet and naive. Got caught up in every fad cause, the vaccine thing especially I remember. Just so desperately looking for things to make it easier, to make her son talk to her. She is never regretful, just tired.

I've wished my brother didn't exist many times. The time he embarrassed me in front of my friends, every Christmas when he was the elephant in the room. And the guilt and hating myself for thinking it has eaten away at me too. I was a terrible sibling to him and I know it.

hippydestroyer,"OK...I created an account just to respond to this post.

I am not the parent of an autistic child, but my younger brother has severe autism. I am 22, and my brother is 21 (realizing that he had come of age to drink made cry on his birthday). I can say with confidence that my parents do not regret having my autistic brother. They take care of him and cherish him dearly. 

Going off to college and leaving my parents to take care of my brother made me realize just how much I wish he never existed, both for his sake, and for my parents'.

I love my brother. He and I were little rapscallions with the world ahead of us. He wasn't born autistic, but slowly lost his mental capacities for unknown reasons (I don't want a debate over the possible causes...too much heartache comes from years of speculation). It happened when he was about 3, so it was traumatic enough for me to remember parts of it. My parents and I had front row seats to my brother forgetting his own name, how to talk, and how to socialize. He has not advanced mentally in 18 years as far as I can tell.
I know that my brother still possesses some intelligence. Like any intelligent person, he becomes reasonably angry when he has a legitimate need that he cannot express properly. This usually erupts in violent outbursts that have taught me how to defend myself from the dirtiest fighting tactics imaginable. A violent outburst to someone with no social norms means they're out to inflict as much pain as possible. I'll admit I've hit back at times growing up, but I always regretted it. I know that his life will always be one that I cannot comprehend, because I can never imagine a life where I have that little control over my faculties.
My brother has very few, but very consistent pleasures in life. He doesn't want anything to change around him, and he'll fight any small change in his environment (this includes the people in his life). He has a set routine that he likes to follow throughout the week, and my parents oblige this. It's become a bonding experience for my brother and my parents, or so they'd have me believe. Being in college for 4 years and coming back every few months gave me a startling perspective on the effect that my brother has had on my parents.
My mother has been, for lack of a better term, under house-arrest because of my brother. For 18 years, she hasn't been able to travel or leave the house for extended periods of time. This has left her isolated, lonely, and in denial. Her entire family lives in Europe, and she has not seen her relatives in 19 years. She missed her father's funeral.
I have pleaded with my parents to have my brother placed in a facility where he can be properly cared for. They always become emotional and dismiss me. My parents are doing a disservice to themselves and my brother by not having him placed in a professional care facility. My parents do not take proper care of themselves anymore, and the house has become appalling during my time at college. They are becoming too old to keep my brother in line.

I'm going to stop there for now. I have plenty more I could say, but it's late. I love my brother. I miss the way he used to be, and I weep over what he could have become. It haunts me daily. I might look at this post tomorrow and regret it, or at least amend it to talk about all the reasons I still love him, but it doesn't change the fact that I wish he never existed.

hiroshima23,"I have 3 kids, my middle child is Autistic. He is 11 and on an educational level of maybe a first grader if that helps put things into focus. He can communicate decently, but you cant hold a true conversation with him although we work on it daily. For example, when I leave for work he asks:

* him: where you going? 
* me: I'm going to work. 
* him: why you go to work?
* me: why am I going to work ""son's name?""
* him: to make money?

* him: why you make money?
* me: why do I make money ""son's name?""
* him: to buy stuff.
* me: thats right.
* him: why buy stuff?
* me: you tell me.
* him: cuz we need stuff.
* me: right again.

Then I tell him to be good and I go to work.

The challenges with my boy comes from his inability to or his lack of wanting to control his temper. Especially around those whom he has yet to test. His mom and I aren't together, I'm a strict disciplinarian and she is a softy. Things he could never get away with around me, he can around her.

SoF4rGone,"No, I don't regret having him, but the situation can break a person. The one piece of advice that struck at my heart when I first went through the mindfuck that is a diagnosis of your child was, ""I think you'll find you're stronger than you think you are.""

We had our son fairly early, under unplanned circumstances. Typical 'had kids too early' situation, I'd just started a career, had no money saved, etc. Just when things were starting to get better, it became clear something was wrong. I would say he's mild-moderate on the spectrum. At first, before we started throwing every spare penny at behavioral therapy, there was nothing but screaming and no talking.  It's taken a large amount of work, but it's really rewarding.

Thanks to therapy from both our own funds and help from the government, we've been able to make a big difference in his life. I worked like crazy to get a better job in a better state where coverage is mandated and there are some good schools if you move to the right place (i.e. outside my paygrade, but who needs savings if your kid isn't getting what he needs). 3 Years ago, he couldn't even speak, now he's reading and sounding out unknown words. Few things feel as amazing as having your world turned on end and rising to the challenge. And the feels I get when that little dude runs up to me at the end of the day when I get home are better than any look from any girl ever.

Then there's the other side. The side where parents and kids alike stare at us non-stop when we're out. The part where you sit back and watch as the person you love more than any other thing in the world struggles and tries so hard, but you have to watch as other people cringe and avoid him because he moves his arms a certain way. The other hard part is all of the healthy kids every place you go. It's not self-consciousness, it's seeing all of the little things everyone takes for granted like their kids talking a mile a minute, interacting with no help, or just generally being a kid and doing kidstuff. This is all so painfully foreign to me.

Some days I just feel like Sisyphus, pushing this huge boulder up a hill, and it's harder and harder to just block that shit out and focus on my job. It's like an ever present background humming, all of the shit I've seen and see coming for him. This past week my wife was at school and noticed three little boys making fun of the way he flaps his hands. I'm pretty impressed she didn't literally kill them. I remember school and I'm terrified thinking of the way people were capable of acting, the way I was capable of acting before I'd gone through this experience. 

Following the teasing episode, the grief stages feel like they're rearing their heads again. I come into work at some point and my friends are all talking about how they're going to a huge music festival and the mansion they're renting. I just feel like I no longer occupy the same plane of existence as many of my closest friends. Sometimes, I wish this would happen to someone I'm friends with so I could have someone to talk to about all of this with, but honestly, I hope none of them ever have an inkling of what this feels like, how hard it is, because it's really painful.

I've had to drag a lot of friends and family members along on a crazy path, kicking and screaming. I'm told that the way we're living financially is unsafe, and precarious, and they're all right, but what else can we do? Having a retirement fund isn't going to matter much if he can't function well enough later in life. We moved across country, and I was the only one who was confident this would be best for him, and it's worked out, but the financial strain I anticipated is also hurting us all the time, so that's come at a pretty high cost.

Still, even when the depression hits me hardest, when I want to give up, throw in the towel, or just feel like killing myself because I don't think I'm strong enough to take the things I see coming down the road, I think about how he looks at me, how he hugs me. To him, I can't fuck up. I'm his awesome dad, and I'm a giant in his world. I keep going because I'm one of the two most important people in his life, and that's probably never going to change. I just try to tell him as much as possible that I love him and that he means the world to me. All I can do is endure

So no, I don't regret having him. I was worthless 5 years ago compared to who I am today, but there's a lot of scar tissue there too. I know I'm a great dad, and in the grand scheme of things, few of our problems matter. I've adopted a much broader view of the universe. We're not individual people competing to succeed, we're all very tiny parts of a very beautiful whole. So little of this matters, but the love definitely matters. And I love him more than I ever have any other being, so I can't really say I regret this. I just wish the rest of the world was better informed or more compassionate so I didn't have to feel like I was getting emotionally punched in the dick every day.

Phalloidin_,"Not a parent, but the younger sister of an autistic kid.

It's unbearable, and I used to imagine ways to kill him or myself. It's only now that I'm away in college that I can get treatment for all the psychological issues that living with him has caused.

I think he could have someday become self-sufficient. He's very smart and he was diagnosed early (I don't know why they even decided to have me since they had four years of taking care of him before having me) and has always been in therapy, but our parents ruined him. They never set any consequences or boundaries for him, or even so much as told him he was doing something wrong. My mother is especially guilty of this, if he hit someone, broke something, threw a fit, it was always someone else's fault. His disorder was the excuse for anything, so he never had to be accountable for anything. She would go on and on about how special he was and how much she loved him and how hard it was on her that no one understood.

I have very few positive memories of him, and most of those are from us playing together when we were younger. Between his violent outburst and long stretches of noncommunication, he would be fascinated by silly random things and he would share his happiness with us. Still, he would steal my toys and grab food off other peoples' plates, and he never understood why that was wrong, because my parents would always tell me I was being selfish and I should let it go because he had it hard enough already, so he just did it more and more. It only got worse when he hit puberty because he got big enough that only my dad could physically overpower him and he started to try to molest me. My mom turned a blind eye to it even though he would get grabby with her too, and she called me a liar the one time I tried to tell her. I feel like at that point both of them shutdown and just tried to do the bare minimum to get by. I hated coming home from school because I knew he would either hit me or touch me and I wished every day that I'd never been born. I started having panic attacks by freshman year of high school, but my mom told me to stop faking it for attention. The four years of high school were a haze of misery and the only thing that kept me going was the thought of getting away from it all. Even after getting into a lot of really good schools, my parents said they would only pay for it if I went to the local state school because me moving out would ""stress your brother out and you know how he can't handle changes and it would be so hard on him,"" so I gave up on my dream school (NYU) and went to the one that gave me the full ride instead. When I broke the news to them, we had a huge fight and they accused me of being selfish and terrible and all sort of crap, but I didn't care. My mom cut me off right then, but my dad still slips me money and calls me once in a while. I spent the last few months before school starting crashing with friends as often as I could, and then I packed up all my shit and drove away. I haven't visited or spoken to my mom or my brother once since leaving and I don't plan to. I took advantage of the school health insurance to see a psychiatrist for the first time, and I was diagnosed with major depression, PTSD, and anxiety disorder. I save money wherever I can and work part time to be able to afford therapy and medication.

I'm reading through all this and it doesn't at all say what I want it to. I didn't mean for it to be all about me, or for it to sound so...clinical and detached.

To answer the question, I think my parents do regret it. My mom was always more concerned about looking like a good parent than actually being a good parent. My dad makes six figures, but his job is stressful and he works long hours, and he hates that he has to come home to a war zone. Both of them are exhausted and are very unhappy people.

I regret ever being born, and even though it's a shitty thing to say, I don't know if I love my brother or not. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate my brother (not anymore at least), despite everything he's done to me. I know he couldn't help being the way he is, and I mourn the person he could have been. I don't think I even hate my mom, just how selfish and blind she was.

RickRussellTX,"I see a lot of people talking about high functioning children.

My son is not high functioning. He is significantly cognitively disabled.

If my wife and I could go back knowing what we know -- yes, maybe, we would have decided not to have a child. We might have adopted or something. 

But I'm not sure that translates to regret for having him. He laughs, he smiles, he craves affection, and we just want a decent life for him. He's a good kid, he tries do the right thing even when his skills don't make it possible. Yes, he can lose control of his emotions, and does so pretty frequently through no fault of his own, it's just he way he's wired.

I suspect that my hopes and desires and feelings for him are different than they would be for a typical child. At this age (11), it's clear that there's no miracle cure in sight. He will most likely end up in state care, and it will be up to my wife and I to find something that works for him. But if we can find a situation that works, I won't regret it.

p_iynx,"We've suspected my little sister has autism. She's been tested (years ago) and she was borderline so they basically just chalk it all up to *terrible* ADHD. She literally cannot follow one order. If you ask her to brush her teeth, she says okay and then walks off and watches TV. You ask her again, and she gets irritated. Says ""I WAS"" and still doesn't do it. Rinse and repeat an average of *six times*, just to get her to **brush her fucking teeth**. As you can imagine, getting her to do anything *actually* unpleasant (homework, clean something) is almost impossible. My mom will be in tears by the end of almost every night. My dad either totally checks out or snaps and becomes this angry monster. 

She refuses to eat a lot of the time, can't connect with peers, says incredibly rude and inappropriate things, sometimes just randomly snaps and throws things at you for no reason...it's exhausting. I have fibromyalgia, so I'm already over-stimulated. Being around my sister for more than ten minutes makes me want to kill myself. She's a selfish energy sucking vampire who feeds off me and my mom. We are in a constant state of exhaustion from trying to deal with her shit. She won't talk to therapists (we went months with her just sitting silently in therapy, refusing to talk) and the medications aren't helping. She never stops moving. My parents can't or don't punish her; it has no effect on her, she doesn't connect her behavior to the punishment and just asks why we are being ""mean"" to her. Won't take responsibility for anything she is doing. She throws huge tantrums (screaming, kicking, throwing things, slamming doors over and over, insulting us) for no reason sometimes. She just loses control. 

My life was so much better 11 years ago before she was born. I was actually happy, my dad wasn't as emotionally abusive, my mom wasn't having a mental breakdown all the time.

TL;DR
An Autistic family member, whether it be child or sibling etc, can be a huge strain on everyone.  It wore me down.  It wears my parents down.  But in the end, we love each other and none of us would have it any other way. 


I'm not a parent, but a sibling of a child with Autism.
I am 24, my brother is 21.

Growing up in my family was very difficult.  My parents never actually told me why my brother wasn't ""normal"".  I found out through eavesdropping on my parents' conversations and medical information, and looking it up in the library.

I love my brother dearly.  With that being said, I had a very frustrating childhood.  It's difficult for a young child (5-7) to understand why all these people would come over to your house with these new, shiny, exciting toys and only wanted to play with your younger brother while your parents told you that you weren't allowed in the room.  You had to be downstairs, alone, while everyone else seemed to be having the most fun playdate ever.  I never understood what I had done that made my mom and dad not want me to be a part of the group.

I had to grow up very quickly.  I needed to help care for my younger brother.  This was also very frustrating.  My brother was non verbal for the first few years.  My parents and him communicated through sign language.  No one ever taught me.  I was unable to talk to my brother.

At the same time, I wasn't allowed to grow up.  My brother was a perpetual 3 year old, and my parents continually treated me like I was the same age.  It was frustrating.  I acted out.

My brother continued to grow older.  Eventually he was able to learn how to talk.  He was main streamed in school until grade 6, having a CEA along side him he was able to attend classes with all the other students in his grade.  Many years, his CEA wasn't the greatest.  They would lounge about on lunch hour and not tend to him.  I ended up adopting this responsibility.  I would spend my lunch hours with him instead of being with my non existent friends.  I was known at my school as ""The Retard's Sister"".  No one wanted to be my friend.  It was almost as if people thought it was contagious or something... Back at home, my brother would deal with his frustration and anxiety by breaking my things.  My parents' room had a lock, so my possessions were easy pickings.  Even to this day, I don't visit my parents' with anything more than a coat as something will be broken during my visit.

Eventually, I had to change schools, and was separated from my brother. I was able to make a few friends.  But my responsibilities at home kept me from really evolving them into anything more than hanging out at school.  My parents tried my brother on a new drug.  He had a horrible reaction to it.  In his anxiety attacks he would become incredibly violent.  I'm 5'2"" and about 110lbs and my brother was pushing 6'2"" and about 190lbs.  He would attack me on a regular basis.  Chairs thrust at me.  Punches.  Headbutts.  Bites.  I felt guilty trying to defend myself.  How could I hurt my younger brother?  I wore a lot of long sleeved shirts and cover up.  

I spent my entire childhood both loving and resenting/hating my brother and wishing he was never born.  It makes you feel like an absolute monster.

I have since moved out.  He has graduated high school on an IEP.  He has 2 jobs that he works 4 hours every two weeks and has a social worker supervising him.  He loves his jobs.  

My brother is the sweetest thing on the planet.  Despite the frustrations, he wants to make you feel better.  While he will never say  ""I love you"", you can feel it in the way he comes up and embraces you when he sees you're sad.  He loves cars and learns all about them on YouTube.  He will be the first to help you with a dead battery, tire/oil change, or doing the breaks.  He loves spending time on the computer.  He volunteers repairing bikes for the thrift store in town, and also at a private run library owned by a senior lady close by.  He loves to tell you all about what he's learnt on YouTube that day, in fact ~~sometimes~~ most times, it's hard to shut him up.  While my brother has speech, he can't really have a 2 sided conversation.  He will tell you about something, and that's it.  

I now live with the feelings of guilt from everything I've written above.  I am old enough to understand now, and I no longer resent my brother, but it's taken a long while.



My brother  will never be able to live on his own.  Sometime soon, there will come the day when my parents will no longer be able to care for my brother and it will become my responsibility.

That very idea absolutely terrifies me.",null,1,cdn3y0d,1rgl2r,AskReddit,top_day,9

I still cringe at the awfully awkward actions and reactions that occurred daily in my life. Now that my dad is gone I am worried I might not be up to the task of being as successful and loving as him. I have AS so I am high function but it still doesn't make it easy to accept the things I've done that I view as harmful to my family.

autismbrotherthrowaw,"I'm the brother of a child with severe autism (about as severe as you can get before physical disabilities start coming into the mix). I'm tired and don't really know where to start, so I'm gonna ramble a bit.

So, the state of things in the family. I'm a university student. My father is the major breadwinner for the family. My mother is relatively well known in the autism community, and has just published a very well received book pertaining to training children with autism (she adapted an animal training technique called clicker training to raising children with autism). They're still married happily which, after 17 years of raising a kid with severe autism, puts them in a minority. In fact, my mother has done very well. She's found something she's better at than anything else she had done in her life. She tutors kids with severe disabilities for virtually no money to tremendous effect, and as previously mentioned, has written a book.

We've always been in a somewhat unique position. We're not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination, but my family has always had a policy of living well below our means, and my father has a very stable job. This put my mother in a position where she could afford to be the stay-at-home mom and take care of my brother. In addition, my parents are unusually stubborn. You'd have to kill them before they gave up on each other or the family. Even then they'd probably rise from the dead. So my mother saw how disabled children were treated in disabled programs in the public school systems. It was incompetent babysitting at best. My brother was never going to make progress in there. He would have just remained a mess, spaced out, spinning around in circles, running around shrieking and throwing self-injurious tantrums. So my mother pulled him out of the school system and decided to homeschool him. Long story short, he's made a lot of progress. He's still functionally nonverbal and prone to stims and extreme behaviors, but it's manageable. He loves horseback riding, hiking, classical music, screwing up the family computer, and eating. He can do basic arithmetic, reading, writing. He generally behaves himself very well when we go out, to the point where those passing wouldn't know there was anything wrong with him. Probably the greatest source of pride in my mother's life is the progress she's made with him. His functionality far exceeds that of the most generous estimate made for . My parents say they don't regret having my brother, and I believe them. It is unlikely they would have had him should they have known he would be born with severe autism. But philosophically speaking I don't think that's regret in the manner being discussed. The manner in question is what I understand to be a resentment toward the child for their condition.

That aside, I consider my family something of an outlier. I've met a lot of other families with autistic or otherwise mentally disabled children. In my own observation, I see a cracked facade in a lot of those families. The parents are visibly struggling with their relationship. Often times there's at least one parent who doesn't have their heart in it, who feels that they've been given more than they bargained for. Some hate themselves for it. Others want an easy life and just want out. And of course, there's everything in between. Then there are those who want to do everything they can with all their heart, but some other aspect of life (primarily finances) holds them back. An autistic kid in the family also affects any siblings. For reasons involving either the amount of attention that an autistic kid needs or marriage troubles (or I suppose both), the normal children of the family are affected. Many of them are incredibly socially stunted. Others have gone completely wild. Those problems, too, throw a weight around the necks of their parents, and extra weight doesn't make for much benefit when you're already sinking. 

While there are many families out there who don't regret their decision, who do dedicate their lives to taking care of their children, I'm not so optimistic that I would deny the existence of a large number who regret their decision. Autism just has that potential to tear your world asunder, and humans are what they are. It's a shame, and I can't really think of anything to do about it. My mother believes there should be an expansion of care programs. Much as I want to agree, I doubt social security will be there for me in the future, let alone any specialized programs for the disabled. I can't find a pretty picture no matter how I crop it.",null,1,cdn4ogy,1rgl2r,AskReddit,top_day,8
tempsenti,"Other side of the coin here- I'm a (probably) autistic lady. I'm not officially diagnosed, since I never had very evident problem behaviors to my parents. Ended up going to a therapist with a lot of experience with autistic folks as an adult and she said that I fit the bill so that's a close enough confirmation for me. At this point a diagnosis wouldn't be helpful anyway.

I'm basically the star child of my family, actually. I was always quiet and into reading and pursuing my interests- which, being animals, probably never hit that ""trainspotting"" concern. (What little girl doesn't love animals? Though I don't think quite as many 8 year olds compiled highly organized systems of folders about various species of reptiles.) I was bilingual and reading by three, so my parents got to brag about me. Did great academically, not so well socially but I never told my parents about stuff like that. 

My brother is a diagnosed aspie and we are as different as it gets- he is highly extroverted, hot tempered, and active, so he's been the one to get the attention in terms of psychological care. Many more behavior problems on his end, as he is quick to anger and extremely argumentative. Though we basically have the same sort of conditions (autism, anxiety, depression) we present as vastly different personalities. 

I guess where I'm going with this is that even within the same family autistic people can be vastly different and I don't think that it's cool to talk about us like we're some burden on humanity. I'm sorry that we don't have more support systems in place for raising neurodivergent children and that it can be hard, but it can be pretty upsetting to see questions like this when neurotypical kids can often end up being awful as well.

seven2eight2,"Friend of mine had an autistic son. Her sister and myself were chosen as Godparents. He was a pretty extreme case. He couldn't speak a word and communicated with hand gestures and made up noises. He drowned when he was 5. Someone on the scene was able to get his heart beating via CPR and the hospital kept him alive for two weeks. They eventually asked my friend what she wanted to do. She chose to take him off life support and feeding tubes. He died a few days later. She told me something a few months after his funeral that she told no one else and it caught me off guard. Basically, she was glad he died. Not that she didn't miss him but she was saying that it was like a weight was lifted off her chest. She didn't cry much after his death. I was devastated.

It's somewhat of a loaded answer.

Of course there is concern to a certain extent (especially if time is a factor in probability of recovery), and some cases will cause different emotional reactions, but ultimately the goal is to not carry that emotional reaction with them. They feel it and move on. They won't be pissed, they may just privately believe the patient is wasting their own time, but they completely respect their right to do so.

willthinkformoolah,"It's a matter of degree. If it's something serious or potentially life changing/threatening or something that might impact you socially in a significant manner-we understand. 

Any reasonable person would seek out multiple opinions before settling on such a decision. You'd better believe we would if we found ourselves in that same position. 

Sometimes though, patients (read: people-including doctors!) can be fucktards. If, for example you come in with the sniffles and insist it's super-duper-mega-AIDS despite all clinical evidence pointing to a cold, then we're going to have a problem.

I have to travel out of state to see doctors because what I have is so rare/misunderstood/under reseached/barely touched on in medical school. 

Medicine is a practice and it's impossible for doctors to know everything. They are human. 

In fact, I am flying from Atlanta to LA next week to have surgery with a new doctor because my doctors in ATL don't think I need it, but I am in pain, and I will try anything. He's 1 of 3 doctors in the USA who does this type of surgery and acknowledges my pain. 

Get as many opinions as you need. YOU MUST BE YOUR OWN HEALTH ADVOCATE. It's not that doctors don't care-they just see too much to be 100% invested in you. You have to own your health.

Add in anchovy filets or paste, your call--paste is easier. Continue to mince (I always err on the side of more garlic). Pour in virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, worchershireshwew sauce, yellow mustard, kosher salt, pepper, raw egg, juice of 1/2 a lemon (sometimes more to taste). Stir.

Meliae,"Before I took a break from the industry, I had four years of bartending experience under my belt. At my last gig, I worked in a tiny, private owned Mexican lounge and tequila bar. We had over 200 tequila brands and types on our wall, all 100% blue agave, all delicious, some of it very expensive. 
We attracted some interesting customers though. 

One slow summer Friday night, myself and the other bartender, who was a hottie, were filling our empty time with taking shots out of our private bottle for the night (it was a Friday tradition), when a longer customer walks through our doors. Fuck. We had been looking forward to closing early, but money is money. I grabbed his chips and salsa and made him his requested Pisco sour, and he got to talking with us. Friendly old guy, had to be in his late 60s. Anyway, he's telling us about his day and he mentions his wife is at home. I ask him why he doesn't bring her and he says,

""She waits until I'm gone to call my brother, so they can fuck around."" He says it do matter of factly, he could have been talking about the weather. 
I ask him why he doesn't leave her if she's cheating on him, especially with his brother, and he frowns. 

""I love her, but she says I don't make her happy, and he does, so I just try not to think about it and get shit faced. She seems a lot happier this way, and I still have a wife, I could never go back to being alone.""

Hot bartender and I exchange a pained glance, when things start to get weird. 
""You too sure are cute together. Why don't you kiss?"" We laugh it off because although we have our share of sexual tension, we're both taken and don't believe in hurting our partners. 

He later propositioned us with 500$ each if he could watch us fuck. From tragic to whoa... in about five glasses. ",null,0,cdn1szs,1rgis3,AskReddit,top_day,11

I had been dating a girl for the past two years, and we had been best friends for three years before that. One day, I got a text from a leader at my church saying that my girlfriend had passed out at her track practice and needed a breathing tube, but I didn't think it was that serious. She had collapsed at her track practice a few weeks before, but she was fine and had even been medically cleared to go back to practice. When I got to the hospital, her parents were in the waiting room, and everyone was unusually worried. After spending two days on life support, the doctors told her parents that she was brain dead and wouldn't be able to live a normal life again. Her parents pulled the plug on March 9th, 2011.

it was about 6:30 am and my dad came flying into my room as i was asleep on the floor. He scooped me up while crying his eyes out.
He tired telling me my mom passed away in her sleep but i thought it was a cold heartless joke, until my brother came in and spoke up for him.
She died in her sleep from an accidental drug overdose.
she had a gastricbypass surgery, then had it reversed years ago which messed her up pretty bad.
She sometimes forgot she took her pills.
I gave her her night time pills, told her i loved her and went to bed.
part of me still thinks i played a huge part in her death and no matter what anyone says i have to believe i didnt kill my mother myslef and im not quite at that point yet.

Later on in the day my Grandpa (moms father) picked me and my brother up and made me call my family to tell them all about my mom.
luckily they all already knew and tried to console me.

Chemicalzoo,"The night before my most excruciating day, I got super drunk off of a lot of gin and wine. (I was 14. I know, I know.) I had school the next day (I know, idiot) and I spent the whole day completely miserable, dashing to the bathroom to puke. Well after emerging from the porcelain throne during lunch, all the girls in there doing their makeup and such got all quiet and kind of stared at me, and I later found out they told everyone they saw after that I was bulimic.

Things get worse. School ends and who shows up but this really manipulative girl who was like my only friend and always got me to do bad stuff like smoking cigarettes and shoplifting. Well I had to walk home and she decided to tag along. Fucking great. So we're walking and I have to keep stopping so I don't throw up, and she makes us go an hour out of our way so she can steal a Monster from Albertson's. So we get her stupid monster and head back to my house. Luckily my mom is out but my sisters are home so I have to hide this girl in my shed. 

Basically we used the shed for smoking and drinking and I had wine stashed in there from last night. So we're sitting in the shed after hours of walking, sweet relief. She bullies me into going inside and getting her a drink even though I'm afraid my sister will call my mom because she's mean like that. I finally go and get her a drink and of course my sister sees me and I'm just like ""I'm smoking in the she'd leave me alone"" and she's suspicious but whatever. So I go back to the shed and some random ass guy is in there and I'm like okay who the fuck is this, no. But somehow she gets me to go back for snacks. Can't believe I did it. When I go in, my sister tells me she called my mom and I'm in big trouble, tell the girl to leave.

So I tell the pair to fuck off and my mom comes home and yells at poor hungover me for being such a pussy and I'm grounded et cetera. I later found out the guy fingered the girl in my shed and the fuckers drank the last of my wine.

JunkBoy187,"This is a story from 7 years ago I still remember almost vividly.

I got on a train and saw this teenage girl, probably a few years younger than I (me being 20 at the time) sitting across from me, crying heavily. I tried not to make it obvious she was causing such a scene, but as I sat there the crying got heavier. My stop was the first one so I got off, and she got off also, in front of me. When we got on the platform she collapsed, crying harder. At this point I and other passengers step in, make sure she's OK and asking if she needs help. She says no, insisting she is alright and tries to walk it by herself, the other passengers go, but I see her needing to hold the wall to walk. 

I go up to her, tell her that it's clear she is not alright and that I think she should get a taxi to wherever she is going. The girl shakes her head, insisting she isn't walking far, but I tell her it'd be better for her. There's a taxi rank round the corner and it's clear she can't walk on her own. I walk with her, admittedly a little awkward at this point, keeping the talk general; names and where we're from and whatnot, before she began crying harder, leaning into me and hugging me. I instantly hug her back, holding the girl and trying to say something. I don't want to say ""it'll all be OK"" because I had no intention of asking what happened. So instead I keep it to a generic ""breathe slowly"". 

She calms down a little, she reaches for her cigarettes and I pull out mine instead, offering her one, saying they were a little stronger. The girl looked me in the eyes and asked me ""why do people do horrible things"". Completely lost for an answer, still no idea of the specifics, I just say ""because people have horrible things happen to them. Some people can only cope by doing something horrible themselves, but then others cope by making sure something horrible doesn't happen to others"" (or something to that effect). This made her silent for a moment, and then asked me the most beautiful question someone has ever said to me in my entire life. She stood there, and asked me ""are you an angel?"" I stumbled out some mumbled answer approximating ""no"" and we walked on.

I got her in a taxi, I offered to pay but she insisted that she had the money. She asked me for my address to send me a thank you card, I told her she didn't need to. She got in the taxi and that was it. Never found out what had happened. I never saw her again. Yet this story remains with me. That question has really stuck with me. Even now it makes me cry a little to remember how she asked it. With genuine curiosity in her face, like she expected me to say ""yes"".

My personal favorite: People found out that she was cutting herself. When confronted, she claimed that doctors were flown in from Japan the night before, as they were the only experts of their field and she needed special help for her diseases that were still unheard of in the US. These doctors allegedly told her that she had to cut herself to save her life. Supposedly she had 'too much blood in her body', and there was no way to get rid of it all. 

The saddest part was the people believing her numerous stories, writing pity 'I'm sorrys' and 'hope you feel betters' all over her facebook wall for her 'various conditions'.",null,1,cdn0b6v,1rgi5y,AskReddit,top_day,9
the_bestpolicy,"I dated a guy who was a compulsive liar, and the lies slowly unraveled over the course of 9 months.  They grew to be so horrifyingly crazy that I still believed them, because who would lie about #5?!  

1.  His age - he was 29, not 26.
2.  His education - he claimed to have a master's degree, but hadn't completed his undergraduate degree.
3.  His experiences - he claimed he toured with a band that had become relatively famous in the indie scene from my college town.  He claimed to be in Chicago while I was there, touring with said band.  He didn't think I'd make it out to the show.  When I surprised him and said I could make it, he suddenly had a fever and the stomach flu, supposedly from eating a bad hot dog at a Cubs game (he was specific with details), and had to go to the hospital.  I stepped up my game and offered to drive immediately to the hospital, but his cell phone signal mysteriously dropped at that moment and I didn't hear from him until the next day.  Of course, he'd been discharged, and was onto his next tour date...
4.  His fetishes - I wore glasses, so he lied and said his biggest fetish was girls wearing glasses and that almost his entire porn collection was just those videos.  His sole overwhelming collection of ""Stop My Ass Is On Fire"" -esque videos determined that was a lie.
5.  CANCER - this motherf**ker took xrays from an old neck injury and claimed they were recent xrays from his oncologist, and that he had neck cancer.  He used this line when I told him our relationship wasn't working out and that I knew he was a compulsive liar, in an attempt to manipulate me into staying with him through the ""treatement.""  After we broke up, I found out he used the cancer lie on another girl - instead of simply telling her he wasn't interested in her anymore, he lied and said he was undergoing chemo so he couldn't see her.
6.  Fidelity - he lied many times I'm sure, but the best coverup attempt was when I found a facebook message from him to a girl two days before we were supposed to move across the country together, telling her it was one of his last nights in town and that they should get drunk and f**k.  I left him the second he got home, and he claimed it was an elaborate setup from someone who was out to get him.  He'd gotten in a fist fight a few days earlier - I know, I know, he was a real winner - and claimed the guy he fought hacked his account and made it look like he was cheating on me.  He even had a friend get a pre-paid phone and had them call me, pretending to be that guy, apologizing for framing him and telling me I should get back together with him.  Months later, the friend came clean to me when I gave the friend's mom the dog we'd adopted together.
7.  He claimed to be really tight with the ENTIRE Wu Tang Clan.  He had a photo of himself with GZA and their producer, Mathematics, from when they played a small show at the bar where he worked.  He posted it online and made up stories about how they were really close.  Really, he'd just posed for a photo like one of many fans when they played their show there.
8.  He once called me, drunk, and claimed he was hanging out with Robert Pollard of Guided By Voices, that they were playing Russian roulette.
9.  One story that's true is that he VERY distantly knows Leonard Cohen - some distant relative married into Cohens family.  I immediately thought that story was bullsh*t too, but it turned out to be true.  Not an impressive one, though.
10.  He claimed he'd lived in L.A. and was in a gang.  He even went as far as to say he'd shot people in gang-related fights.  He later admitted he made it up.
11.  We were talking about turn-ons once and he said that he hates having his nipples touched.  He made up an elaborate story about being molested and how that was a trigger for him.  He also lied about having then molested his sister.  He eventually came clean about that when - after we broke up - I confronted him about all of his lies and asked him about each story I'd doubted over the months.  He held out for a long time, but for some reason eventually came clean about most of the lies.

He was absolutely insane.  We talked a few years after the breakup when I sought closure and he said he didn't really have a reason for the lying, but reassured me that ""not every guy lies.""

Call it bullshit but from that day on I thought about things completely differently, spoke differently, my personality changed...

coolsoundingme,"I've just typed up a rather long response to this which is something I hadn't actually planned on doing.  Things just kept coming out and I'd say things that reminded me of other points I wanted to address and lo, many a tangent path are stayed upon.  I have (or, that it to say, **will**, since you haven't read it yet) stated many things which will probably be somewhat inflammatory - please understand that the remarks are not intended as such.  As is often true in text, the true emotional intent can be somewhat hard to derive so I will state it here:

As a whole, the following text is written in the tone of a serious response from a long winded (read: rambling) adult male who often relies (poorly) on abstractions to address points that have been developed (also, poorly) in his mind and periodically attempts to toss in some levity (again, poor - you get the idea).  I, as we have seen, will often overuse parenthesis to soften a point in an attempt to make it clear that my primary intent is not to insult, insinuate or attack and that I fully understand that generalizations are not 100% true.  I have learned that this subject can become very sensitive.  This is all sort of restated at the end **DISCLAIMER** (where I also added a poor joke).

***

Not in the least.  I very much dislike small children (teenagers I'm fine with, but like all things - so long as they're not my own).  They can have brief moments of fun - much like a terrible movie - but overall I find them annoying, displeasing and do not wish to share a presence.  That does not mean I'm rude or mean to children - I simply do not like them.

I've friends that have kids.  While they'll never say it in mixed company, on the race occasion I've gotten them away from having to do all the billion other things in life that need be done - *as well* as taking care of a kid - long enough to put down a few beers as some old dive bar we used to hang out at, several of them have admitted that they're a bit jealous of my freedom.

And I have to explain to them that I'm not as free as they think I am - I'm tied to my job because I need to pay my bills, put gas in my car, [feed the cat](http://i.imgur.com/2sbLOdm.jpg) (isn't she adorable?), etc.  I don't have a lot of free time because I have to do the dishes and the laundry and cook meals and so forth.  I live alone so if there's a dirty dish in the sink it'll stay there.  Being child-free does not mean I can just walk out the door at any time and disappear off to the Mediterranean (mostly because the have extradition, I don't speak the language and can't afford to).  I'm an adult.  I have responsibilities just like they do.  Also, my girlfriend would murder me if I did that and didn't take her along with (obviously the cat will be coming along).

I also know that I'm the kind of person that will regret having children.  I'll dream of the things I could have done rather than buy school clothes and change diapers and field calls from the teacher about how [/u/coolsoundingme, jr.](http://www.reddit.com/user/coolsoundingme/) shit his pants (again) and pulled someone's hair - I **DO NOT** want to deal with that and I **ESPECIALLY DO NOT** want to look at my spawn with the knowledge that in my heart of hearts I wish they were not there.  No matter how much joy you may think having a kid brings, I promise you that does not go for everyone.  Seeing parents who are slaves to their kids depresses the shit out of me.

I choose not to have children because I actively do not like children enough to ever want one.  I know people that don't like dogs so they don't want one.  Or cats.  Or Volvos.  And that's the thing many (but not all) parents don't understand: People like me look at children as something that needs to be desired - not required - and many of us simply do not desire.  I don't desire a dog because I don't want to take it out several times a day (upstairs apartment) - especially in the cold northeastern winters - or pay another vet bill or find someone to care for it when I have to travel for a day or two.  I love dogs.  I grew up with a dog who passed a decade ago and I still miss dearly - but I don't want to deal with owning one.

Often you'll hear,

&gt; If you had one you'd think differently

but a) that's a horribly insulting thing to say to someone and is beyond ignorant and b) there is absolutely no guarantee of that.  I'd much rather not take the risk and bring a unloved, unnecessary and regretted child into the world than go without.  That's sort of a reverse pascal's wager, I know, but the

&gt; think differently

argument is one I can make about nearly everything:

- I'm a pilot.  Why aren't you?  If you were one you'd understand.  What do you mean you don't want to jump out of an airplane?  If something can be done, you should do it!^No, ^but ^seriously, ^skydiving ^is ^cool ^as ^shit.  ^Go ^do ^it!
- If only you owned a Mac you'd understand.  It just works^^YMMV.
- Once you buy a motorcycle you'll realize how much fun you were missing out on.  Don't worry about the maintenance costs.
- You should adopt a cat from the pound - I did and I love her.  If you did that you'd think differently about them and do whatever it takes to overcome your severe cat allergy and won't at all regret it or think about taking it back to the shelter regardless of whether or not they'll kill it. You'll find a way.

&gt; You'll find a way.

That's the same as telling me that not only am I going to go to a store to spend money I can't/shouldn't/don't want to be spending, but that I'm going to spend it on being punched in the balls *really, really hard.*  Oh, and that I have to figure out how to get there on my own.

I guess the last thing I'll say before getting to the end of this here tirade is that many people also choose not to have children because they simply aren't in a position in life at a time when it's reasonable to have children - especially in my generation.  Many of us are buried under crippling amounts of student loan debt and the world isn't exactly developing in a way that makes it easy to pay down those principles.

I live comfortably and am not wanting - toss a kid into that and I'll be signing up for all kinds of government assistance not because I want the free handouts (of which there are many), but because I'll explicitly **need** them to support two people (assuming the wife/girlfriend/babymama isn't working because she's at home taking care of the kid, or vice versa).  I don't want that.  And many people that have children shouldn't have in the first place for exactly those reasons as well.

But what keeps me most of all from ever wanting children is the look some of my friends get in their eyes when I tell them all that and they lean in and slur,

&gt; Yeah, but I wish I had *that* kind of freedom.

**DISCLAIMER:** I know some amazing parents (mine to start with along with several friends) who had children when they were ready - when they knew they could handle it and had everything in place.  They **wanted** kids.  They're **incredible** and **wonderful** people who love their children and are raising them to the betterment of society.  I know not every parent is in the situations I've enumerated above, but much like that really hot stripper who swears it's just a cold sore and you should *totally* [buy some ""alone"" time with her](http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzkyL0Jsb3dpbmcyME1vLmJYQi5naWYKcAl0aHVtYgk4NTB4NTkwPgplCWpwZw/28db3262/a05/Blowing%2520Money%2520Fast.jpg), for some of us the risk is just too great.

For others, they're not even going to the strip club in the first place.

ajefx,"In 1996, my friend called me up during the Home Run derby and told me to come over.  My mom and I walked over to find they had 4 tickets to the All Star game in Philadelphia (I'm assuming she already knew).  It was an amazing surprise, and I quickly raced home to pack.  We left the following morning in time to do some Fan Fare stuff, and we met lots of legends like Rollie Fingers and Steve Carlton, and got them to autograph stuff.

The game was the next day, and we had an absolute blast.  It was a night game and we were 9, so we didn't do much after the game, but the following day, we went to breakfast at the hotel many of the players were staying at.  After the meal, my buddy and I went and played on the pinball machine in the lobby.  It's his turn and he's absolutely killing it - he's approaching the high score - when all of a sudden his dad comes and and almost yanks him away.  ""Come here, guys,"" he says, but my friend protests because of his success at the game.

He insists that we go outside and now explains that Andy Pettitte is out there.  My friend is a Yankees fan, so this has his attention.  We race outside and catch up with Pettitte in the parking lot, and we remove our commemorative hats to have him sign them.  Being an Orioles fan, I'm half as excited as my friend but shrug it off because Pettitte was having a great year and was a Cy Young contender.  We head back toward the lobby when I notice a duffel bag with the San Diego Padres logo on it.  I tug on my friend's dad's jacket and point it out, saying we should wait a second.  It might be Tony Gwynn, I'm hoping.  Turns out it was Ken Caminiti, but he was the NL MVP that year so not a bad consolation.

By now, a crowd is beginning to form outside the hotel.  A guy informs us that he got a Greg Maddux autograph earlier, which bums me out but I still met two ballplayers today so whatever.  Then we see another Yankee, John Wetteland, leaving, and add his signature to our hats.  Wetteland, Pettitte, and Caminiti! What a score, even if I hate the Yankees. My friend is pretty stoked about having met two Yankees, so we continue to hang out by the entrance before we see one last player.

Ozzie Smith.

I grew up playing shortstop because, as an Orioles fan, Cal Ripken was my hero.  Who was the only other shortstop worth admiring at the time? The Wizard.  Oh yeah, Philadelphia was his final All Star game; he retired following that season.  So even though we had the eventual NL MVP, the eventual World Series MVP, and the eventual runner up in the AL Cy Young award all sign our hats, Ozzie fucking Smith did, too.  I like to think that you can't pick out a better group of 4 people to represent the 1996 All Star game/season than those 4, but Smith was transcendent.  It wasn't just about how he played in '96 or that it was his last All Star appearance, the dude was simply a legend in his own right.

Even though I ended up inheriting some really cool pieces, including handwritten letters from guys such as Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner to my grandfather which I think are super cool, the memories the hat, with its 4 All Star signatures, evokes just put it over the top.  Everything from walking over to my friend's house shortly before the sun went down during the Home Run Derby to meeting the legends of the game to being at the All Star Game itself, it was just an amazing fan experience.  I'm so grateful my friend and his parents invited me to share it with them, so the signatures are only a portion of why that hat is awesome.  As things came out about Caminiti and his '96 campaign, and Wetteland's career petered out in Texas, the hat is (probably) no longer a collector's item, but it means so much more to me than it could anyone else.",null,0,cdn0puu,1rgh6k,AskReddit,top_day,3

Thedrunkgaymongoose,"I got my bachelors degree at a major state university. I was accustomed to seeing many-o walks of shame on campus, but this one takes the cake. 

I was unfortunate enough to have class on Fridays. Sucked. Especially after a particularly busy Thirsty Thursday.  One Friday morning, I was walking through the arboretum back to the bus stop after giving a poor showing on a Spanish exam. Walking a few paces ahead of me was one of the typical sororitutes: drenched in yesterday's makeup, half-smushed off her face and last-nights' black cocktail dress, wrinkled and sloppy from floor of a frat house. 

My school is known for having these huge muthafuckin squirrels. They were beasts. They regularly ate out of the trash, stole food off of picnic tables. Basically, they weren't afraid of people so crossing paths with one of these bastards while on campus was a normal occurrence.  

The Tri-Delt in front of me was talking loudly on her phone, walking too slowly causing a foot traffic backup, and generally being a douchette. Suddenly a squirrel darts out in front of her path and she steps on it full force. She happened to be wearing a pair of knee high boots with heels as thick as drinking straws. She starts screaming hysterically and that's when I see it. The squirrel has been completely impaled through its torso by her hooker heels. She's jumping around in a circle on one foot, tearing at her shoe. The squirrel is still flailing about, trying to escape certain death but to no avail. Throughout this whole time she's still on the phone narrating the current situation in high-pitched screams. The guy standing near me looked over at me in shocked eyes. ""Whoa, dude."" He said.

Being in the gulf in the summer time all you do is sweat. Taking a shit? yup you're sweating. Eating? Yup you're sweating. Sleeping in your rack? Yup you're sweating and as a bonus you always woke up in wet sheets.

Taking a shower was terrible. It was so hot and humid it was really hard to keep the showers clean. Plus the drains would like to backup if the ship was rocking in the ocean. You would hear a gurgling noise in the drains and then it was time to hop out before you were standing in a pool of nasty water.

same thing when taking a shit. you would hear the toilet start to gurgle  and you had to hop up and hold yourself up on the stall in case it started to overflow with shitwater.

doing maintenance was terrible too. nothing like coming out of the plant with your uniform completely soaked in sweat.. not a single dry spot and sweat would actually be pooling at the legs.. you could see it.

But when I was younger (I lived in a small town and never moved) there was a girl that died in the pool. The pool I worked at could be rented out for private parties and it was a pretty popular thing to do with elementary school kids. Before the kids were allowed in the pool, there's a big safety talk that's given about not running on deck, having to pass a deepwater safety test to swim in the deep end, etc. During this talk ( it was given in a lobby by the lifeguards) a little girl went on deck instead of coming to the lobby. She slipped into the deep end with her clothes on, and was found dead after a panicked search occurred. The lifeguards in question were found not to be negligible, but one of them quit. The pool then installed locked gated doors at the entrance of the locker rooms that lead to the pools. It was a sad day. 

TL; DR: little girl drowned while lifeguard was giving a safety talk to all the children at a private party. Guard was not found to be negligible.

Well this day for what ever reason she was with her ""Mom"" (It was her God Mother at the time I did not know) and they were swimming in the 5ft area across from me. We had like 12 people in the pool at the time so our SOP was 1 life guard on duty. (I do not remember what the SOP was to have 2 on duty). Anyways I just got done putting a kid in time out for running or something. Than looked for her and only saw her mom. The black racing line across the pool looked weird but with waves on the service across the pool trick you sometimes. The Girl was black and had a Navy blue one piece on. I looked at the ""mom"" like ""hey"" and than she just smiled at me. I than Just stood up to get a better view. Right when I did that her ""Mom"" started screaming where is my child.

She had a pulse but was gagging on her food she had just eaten...Then her jaws locked up...We were not trained how do deal with that. We just kind went threw the motions as food was coming out of her mouth and I believe nose (it has been awhile). Than just looking at my watch...I knew 4 min that they could be brain damage or worse. around 4 min hits and the ambulance came we just went to crowd control...I ran to the bathroom and sobbed after words...I was shown after the investigation to have done the right thing...But fuck...

Smockadero,"I actually had to save a kid a few months back.

I have been working at a pool since I was 17, I am 24 now, and we have never had an accident in the pool (except poop and vomit).

So one weekend I was on guard, and there were a lot of families and some exercise swimmers. This one asian dad had three kids there but left two young boys (age 5 and 8 perhaps) in the kids pool while he went to swim in the large one with his daughter (12). After a while I notice the dad is looking up from the pool and can't seem to find his son, so I go into search mode too. But the dad leaves for the locker rooms so I guess the kids went to the toilet.
 
Then I see someone in the big pool, right by the side, under the water. It looks like a dark haired kid so I get up to investigate. At first he seems to be swimming and playing, but after a few seconds while walking closer to him to have a look, I see that he is not able to get to the surface by himself. So at first I grab a pole hanging on the wall right by me to help him up, but as I am about to reach it to him he goes limp.
I just dropped the pole and jumped in. As I lifted his little body out of the water I remember think he was so light. I put him on the side of the pool and tried to speak to him, but his face was getting white and his eyes where rolled back. His lips were blue and pressed together making this horrible bubbling sound. Then I called for help and started to do mouth to mouth, and after the first blow-in, some water leaked from his nose and mouth and after the second he started to come to. 
Then a colleague came running and held the kid until his dad came half a minute later. The kid just said he wanted to go swim with dad.

All this felt like it took just a few seconds and I have never been so full of adrenaline in my life. But afterwards I feel like I made a lot of mistakes. But then again, I did save him so I guess it worked out okay in the end.

The thing I think about most after is the few seconds when I just watched him drown before I jumped in.

I reminded everyone that they should walk and not run. Well someone decided not to listen and they thought it would alright to run near the pools 0 depth entrance. The kid fell face first and cracked open his head. At the same time he was drowning in about 4 inches of water. Since this happened near the 0 depth entrance there wasn't a lifeguard near that area.

Jean Chretien was our PM from Nov 1993 to Dec 2003. He had suffered facial paralysis (Bell's Palsy?) in his childhood and so spoke using only one side of his mouth.
 During his first election campaign, the Tories ( who weren't doing so well in the polls) attacked him in ads in which they mentioned his facial paralysis and mocked his way of talking out of only one side of his mouth, likening it to dishonesty and charlatanism. They also used different pictures of his face in another ad, in which voice overs talked about how they would ""be embarrassed' to have him as Prime Minister.


In response, Chretien spoke of how he was teased by the other children in his youth, how he felt God had given him other 'qualities' and that he was 'grateful'. 

Many Canadians saw these ads as an attack on the man's appearance, not on his politics, and felt that the ads were in bad taste, and indicated poor judgement on the part of the Tories.

The song is mainly instrumental, but ends with a quote (Not sure if real or fictional; It might be read by someone other than the author) from a diary of an antarctic voyage, which gives the changes in mood and tempo meaning.      
     
I could see this being a great adventure-survival film about a young man/woman who join's Ernest Shackleton's crew journeying to the South Pole. It would be set in an alternate universe where the Antarctic took up most of the southern hemisphere. It would be an epic journey into a wilderness that resembled the Taiga, Alaska, the Rocky's, and the Poles all combined.
     
* 0:00-0:44 We meet the protagonist. He's not very big(this pronoun could be changed, but since I don't want to type (s)he constantly, it'll be 'he'), and seeks recognition from his peers, to stand out as an individual. He gets an opportunity to join Shackleton on his adventure, and decides to go to the South Pole.

* 0:44-1:12 The expedition lands, and they go ashore. The majesty of the place overwhelms him. Mt. Erebus greets them, giant and smoldering.

* 1:12-1:35 He gets used to the place, and becomes familiar with the harsh landscape. He walks through thick forests buried in snow, swims under ice sheets, and climbs mountains.

* 1:35-1:45 The expedition is at a stalemate. A mountain range and predators block the path. Shackleton becomes annoyed at the character's stubbornness.

* 1:45-2:27 falls in love, or finds camaraderie. Either way, the relationship is quiet and non-sexual, just a warm connection between individuals. 

* 2:27-2:39 Butting heads with Shackleton, the captain sends him to follow snow gorillas through the mountains to find a path to the other side. He and his friend/lover go out by themselves to track the gorillas.

* 2:39-2:59 A rivalry builds between him and his friend. He begins hunting alone. One morning...

* 2:59-3:20 He gets stuck in a crevasse and his leg breaks. His ego issue becomes small beans in the face of death.

* 3:20-3:52 His friend/lover arrives to save hum/her, and as he gets out they find the gorillas, and realize they know where they are headed, and how to get through the mountains.

* 3:52-4:24 They head back and tell Shackleton. They head to the pass.

* 4:24-5:05 The crew passes through, and realize they have made it further south than anyone ever has before. A giant flat plain is all that's left between them and the pole. The sun isn't setting, and it's non-stop dusk/twilight. 

* 5:05-5:42 They reach the pole through a team effort. The protagonist has either fallen in complete love or is at the peak of a bromance, and realizes his dependence on other people, but doesn't fear or hate it like before; instead, he realizes that unity allows him to complete greater tasks than anyone could do by themselves.

* 5:42-end The protagonist remembers the trip fondly with his friend years later, recalling how life changing it was.

krinklekut,"My best friend and I were out in the mountains in colorado at night.  We are from the city and had no business being out there, but we were young and have since spent a great deal of time in the outdoors. Anyway, we were hiking through the mountains.  It was super dark. No moon that night (cloud cover must have been really thick). I remember thinking that it was a good night for predators like mountain lions to hunt because of their night vision.  

We started to get close to our camp and then all of a sudden, my friend says ""OH FUCK!! THERE HE IS!!!!"" and points to a huge set of glowing eyes staring at us from the bushes. I assumed that this was a lion and wanted so badly to turn and run for it, but I knew not to do that.   I tried to back up slowly. The thing starts growling and my friend pulls out a stupid little knife and says ""get behind me dude"" and starts bracing himself to fight this thing.  We managed to back away enough that the animal didn't attack.  It turned out to be a bear, but we were terrified and dude was ready to scrap it up with whatever came out of the trees at us.  He's got serious guts.

Now the really random thing is that they have a spur on their back foot that has venom that causes extreme pain to humans...like really..?  This venom/toxin actually is found among Starfish, snakes, lizards, spiders and Sea Anemones.  The Platypus actually has 83 different genes in the toxin yet only three are actually unique to the platypus. Now this creature is pretty weird but here is where it gets even more random, it is classified as a mammal however it lays eggs and gives the offspring milk.  This is truly a random animal and blows my mind how different it is personally.

However, due to my freakish growth spurt during freshman year, my calf muscle did not stretch out like it is intended, leaving me with this condition. It's essentially a death sentence to runners. The timing couldn't have been worse. My track and cross country coach was arrested for sexual misconduct (that he was later found guilty for), but he truly was a great man.

hrafnar,"A FWB relationship is, first off, a Relationship, just like a friendship, a partnership, a marriage, or having a co-worker.  The key to maintaining a good relationship is good communication about everybody's needs.  Now, a FWB relationship can still end, like any other relationship, or change, like any other relationship.  Be aware of this.  

Some precautions:

* Sexual relationships will usually deal with a cocktail of awesome body chemicals that last for about three months or so.  This is called New Relationship Energy (NRE) and is usually a time for bonding.  After three months (give or take) you'll probably notice a shift in the relationship.  This is normal.
* Good sex is a key component to a FWB.  Learn about sex, make sure you communicate sexual needs and boundaries, and don't put up with bad sex.  Imagine if this was your tennis buddy (or other activity) and he or she completely sucked at tennis and was not willing to get better.  You'd drop that person in a hurry and find a better tennis buddy.  
* Some people will judge you.  Depending on where you live, the ratio will skew.  Fuck those people. (Not literally, unless for some reason your town does a yearly hate-orgy.  If so, call me.)  There are people who will shit on anything good that happens to you for no reason.  These people are toxic and deserve to have no say in your life.
* Some people will be concerned.  This will be not in their cultural wheelhouse, and they will need to try to understand your mindset.  Take their advice with a grain of salt, because they might genuinely care about you.  Maybe they will change their minds, as people often do.  Be the gracious person.
* Educate yourself.  Read books on sexuality, relationships, and communication.  Human relationships are not figured out instinctively, they are *learned*.  Everything from a friendship to a polyamorous quad marriage with eight stepchildren can be improved by learning about relationships and communication.  *The Ethical Slut* is my go-to starter for relationships featuring more than one person (i.e., all relationships).
* Above all, enjoy yourself!  If it works for you, hooray!  If not, change things!  Life is long and hard (heh).  Enjoy the little things (heheh) that bring happiness.

filipinohitman,"In my experience, I've had a few FWBs escapades - some turned out fine and some turned into relationships. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think unless you're still in high school and worried about it getting out there. Otherwise, it works out depending on both parties (if they make it awkward or not). I've had sex with several of the girls I'm friends with and when we encounter each other, it is as if nothing happened then maybe later on we hook up with no emotional attachment.

StevelKanevel,"I assume based on the language you are using that you are female and somewhat young (forgive me if I am wrong in making that assumption). As a man in my 30's with a daughter, I can't help but give you an answer from my perspective as a father. It may not be popular, but I've been around the block enough to believe this to be true.

Here's the deal: If a guy wants to be FWB's, it means he wants your body and not you as a person. It means he doesn't respect or value you enough to commit to any sort of relationship. I don't care who you are, YOU ARE WORTH MORE THAN THAT! 

Yes, sex is fun, but the best part of sex is the intimacy that comes from it, and intimacy develops when two people love each other (as whole people) and continue to learn more and more about each other. I'm not going to tell you not to have sex, I'm just trying to get you to see that you deserve better than FWB. 

You deserve to be loved, not used.

Why do I say tell you all of this? Because I used to be that guy that pursued FWBs, and it was never with just one girl. If this guy wants to be FWB with you, he wants to be FWB with other girls as well. If you're honest with yourself, you don't like that. 

My former promiscuity has effected my life in many unfortunate ways, but even more so, it hurt many, many girls along the way.

I stopped talking to him a few weeks before I went to college so I could get him out of my system. It was all going great, then he texted me the say before I left for school. He asked me he missed me and wanted me to come over. I did.

I then went to college and I didn't even think twice about him. We texted a few times but I was just too busy and with my other friends. I hooked up with a few people at school and it totally pushed the other guy from home out of my system. Then it was coming time for break and he knew I was coming home. He wanted me to visit during break. I told myself that I wouldn't but I ended up doing it. 

I went to his house a few times and it was actually more fun than before because there were not more feelings involved. My friends absolutley hate that I went back to him because he used to be a dick to me, but not it is just totally fun. I enjoy it, it is something fun to look forward to when I come home.

People at school had branded her a slut, although it was more of an offensive joke than actual hurtful remarks- and we were both only 16 at the time... we were each other's firsts, too... In hindsight I don't think it could've been more messy.

I don't really want to talk about it, the wounds are still open- but my point is that this kind of relationship is very difficult to uphold properly. Somebody almost always gets hurt, really hurt, and I don't think you can really continue being normal friends- the relationship will elevate and crash. And when it does, it sucks.
That being said, nobody knows how you feel better than you do, and it's really your call- but for this to work out you have to know yourself, this sort of relationship is not for the naive, sensitive, or the insecure.

jichagoury,"It depends who you're being shy towards. If it is girls, or boys, or whatever your preference, I always advise my friends to just speak to the person as though they were just a friend. For example, one of my friends saw a really pretty lady sitting on her own at a cafe. When i asked him why he didn't want to go speak to her, he just gave me loads of excuses like 'oh she's probably busy', when in fact, if she's sitting at a cafe alone, she must certainly not be busy. I just told him to speak to her as if she was a fellow guy or whatever, because that relieves the fear of barrier of rejection. He spoke to her and eventually got her number (turns out she was checking us out the whole time). The next step is to also accept that rejection is a common thing. It doesn't necessarily mean that he or she does not find you attractive, but maybe they swing the other way, or maybe they're already in a relationship. It comes down to probability and that's vital. Another important thing to consider is location! If you're at a club and you go up to a girl, the first thing she's gonna think is 'oh he just wants to pick me up. Loud music, dim lights and he's probably half pissed anyway.' Often girls don't go to clubs to get picked up (though there is a big percentage that do), so once again it comes down to probability and also treating them as though they were a guy (or whatever gender you're comfortable).

The issue of low self-esteem is a common and can simply be ridden with by simply accepting that nobody's perfect, not you or me, or Mila Kunis (maybe Megan Fox, but even she had to get some plastic surgery done). Often case a woman doesn't care about looks, she likes personality, charisma, charms, and confidence. I know it's like reading off a textbook and i'm probably over-generalising but it really is that. I have many friends who are girls who have gone for guys that have a big belly and spots across their face because they're extremely polite and compassionate, but not pushovers - they're still men, they have to stand their grounds. Just as they have rejected men with six packs for being so up their own end they can find no way out. 

I should have you know that most of my guy friends who are NOT all muscled up and spilt with fake tan get more girls than the ones with the aforementioned aspect. In the end, it comes down to feeling secure with you and not a threat (after all, you would probably be a stranger).

If you are shy about telling someone the way you feel, just remember this quote: if you never say, you'll never see the day. The point here is you tell that person the way you feel, it's always 50/50 (i.e. Yes or no). If they say no, it'll suck for sure, but at least you took that 50% chance for there to actually be something. If they say yes, well there you have it, you took your chance and there it is. It is not uncommon for the person you have feelings for to also have feelings for you but never show it for the same reason as you: fear of rejection.

In the end, like all fears and phobias, the only way out is to overcome it, and the fear of rejection is often (though not always) the cause for being shy and having low self esteem. As a great person once said: ""Just do it!"" (Actually it was Nike, but hey it boosts morale, man!).

They walked inside and stood the guy up and he was wearing handcuffs before he even knew what was going on. He told the police that he'd taken the car to New York and back because he wanted to know it was good on long trips.

And when I found that person, I married her and I was happy for a very long time. In this case, money didn't buy me happiness, another person's love did. She always makes me happy, but I started to become very unhappy when we struggled for years before being able to buy our first home together. I felt like a failure, and was very frustrated. Then we finally scraped together enough money for a down payment, with the help of my parents, and we finally bought our first home and that made me happy for a few years.

So in one of those cases, money truly did buy me happiness. But I'm old enough to realize now that happiness is just a moment. It's not a permanent state of being.",null,0,cdmwkz7,1rg3vb,AskReddit,top_day,1

The quilts are patchwork with colors ranging from reds, oranges, greens and yellows. There's one window and there's a warm light filtering in through it and it pours in rays of caramel colored sunlight. There are two or three bean  bags lining the floor and stacks of books everywhere. There are colored pencils and crayons scattered around the floor and a basket of peaches that are warm and juicy.

The building would be in ranch like cluster about a mile apart from each other with 3 to 4 buildings in each cluster. This is in a huge valley with huge beautiful mountains around. The skies are always blue with some white clouds. It is always summer, but it never exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The people in this valley are in three groups, Family, Friends and random people who are always nice and loving to each other. My family all gets along and always enjoys their stay. My friends are there and are also having a good life. The strangers are nice to everyone and enjoy their lives as well. There are also natives who take up most of the valley. They are prosperous and are also very happy. Our activities consist of lounging around and quadding around the mountains every once in a while. Also we would go shooting about twice a week. But there is no time in my valley, the only markers are night and day. When we plan a meeting everyone will just somehow know when to show up. There are also lots of beautiful woman who always love me and are very calm and enjoying. This whole scene is in a time before the colonization of America by white settlers, but we somehow still have access to computers and modern technologies, but they do not invade our lives. This whole place always has a warm fuzzy feeling to it and is always comforting. There is no school and no work and the crops and food finds itself.

ExterminateTheJuice,"To answer this question, I'm going to have to define love as I see it.

Love is such: Coming home from a hard day at work. You got fired. You have absolutely no idea how to make this months rent and you are beyond stressed. All you want to do right now is to get home, get in bed, and sleep. When you open your front door, you see that your dog has spent the last few hours using his teeth to destroy your brand new sofa, well, just because. What do you do?

You walk over to his food dish, and you *feed the dog*. This, for me, is the true definition of ""love"". Doing whats best for the person or thing *regardless* of what they have done to you, because *it is what is best for them*. 

Now, most people, i'd honestly go so far as to say something like 80% of people, have absolutely no concept of what love is. Love is a mother going to see her son in prison who raped and murdered 23 children, not a pink heart shaped valentines day card. Love is the constant and unquitting reminder in the back of your head that no matter what happens, you will continue to do what is best for that person. Love is something *rare* and *special*.

People often confuse lust and love. That happy feeling you get at the start of a new romance? That is not love. Coming home from a hard day at work when your husband has forgotten your anniversary for the second time and cooking dinner for him and your children is love.

So you ask, why does someone stop loving someone else? I would say that this actually never happens. Love is not romantic. Love is not sexual. Love is a desire to be with, exist for, and provide and care for an individual or thing. People don't fall out of love, they just *change*, and that change can be the loss of passion.

Every 2-3 years you are a completely different person than you were previously. People change *dramatically* all the time, and this is something you are going to have to deal with. Hold no grudges.",null,1,cdmvjhi,1rg1y2,AskReddit,top_day,4
jollybumpkin,"You've got to distinguish between ""loving"" and ""being in love.""

I'll go with ""being in love."" Falling in love is often transitory. The subjective feeling of being in love is identical to ""having a crush"" or ""infatuation,"" except it's over quicker. These experiences can only be distinguished in retrospect.

As people get older, they tend to stay in love longer. Young teenagers often experience crushes that last for days or weeks. Some high school romances last a lifetime, but most fizzle after a year or so. Mature adults seem more able to fall in love and stay in love for a lifetime.

Assuming people marry because they are in love, there are some obvious reasons marriages fail. Short courtships. Youthful partners. Marriages that occur primarily because of unplanned pregnancies. Marriages in which one or both partners have problems with substance abuse or serious mental illness. Frivolous marriages, in which the partners are in love, but are not necessarily ready for a lifelong partnership.

Some individuals are more likely to stay in love than others. People who are temperamentally negativistic or argumentative are less likely to stay in love. People with a weak sense of loyalty and duty are less likely to stay in love. Impulsive people and people who are not good at resisting temptation are less likely to stay in love.

When a couple disagrees on fundamental life goals, the love is more likely to fail. For example, if one partner wants to have children and the other doesn't.

In general, ""high conflict relationships"" are more likely to fail. Happy couples with good long-term prospects typically go through a honeymoon period of at least one or two years, during which they feel they are in love and have little conflict. Couples who start arguing frequently and intensely within the first few months are more likely to break up, even though they have a strong feeling of being in love.

John Gottman, a famous psychologist who has spent his career studying these things has found that he can watch a video tape of a new couple having a mild argument and predict with surprising accuracy whether they will be divorced several years later. He looks for contempt, condescension, failure to seek consensus, failure to empathize with the partner, that sort of thing. These are strong predictors of failure in the long run.

Some personalities are predictably incompatible. When a strong extrovert partners up with a strong introvert, trouble lies ahead and love is more likely to fail. Same goes for discrepancy in work ethic and sense of duty -- one strong, one weak. In the long run, people high on ""openness to experience"" (a well-known personality trait, you can look it up) don't get along well with people who score low on the same trait.

Sadly, a couple with poorly-matched personalities are just as likely to fall in love as people with well-matched personalities.

omgh4x0rz,"Why does one get to not love someone anymore? I mean, for what reasons? When does the love feeling translate into a feeling that doesn't mean that anymore? I really don't understand. As long as you're feeling good with someone and you love that person when does that change? And why? Someone was on the verge of breaking up with me just because I had a bad couple of days. And all of that just because I was ""cold"" and somehow distant for two days. I really believe that you feel what you want yourself to feel and you believe what you want yourself to believe. I'd really want to hear what are your reasons why you can't feel love anymore despite all the good things you say about him. And I want to hear them because most of the times, people go on that path, getting away from someone just because it's easier and they think it'll be better with someone else. But it won't be, as long as you dont try to fix, and just play the ""i dont feel it, i dont know why, but i dont even want to find out, so i'll try to get away"" card. Also, signs that you don't like someone are pretty easy to spot from the beginning, and if you are honest to yourself you won't make someone believe that everything's fine and will be. Of course, it can be the possibility when you are just too needy and want someone and ignore all the obvious signs that things don't work, or the possibility that the other person will change. Other than that, it's you and your bad thinking. And dragging everyone else with you. ",null,0,cdmv8ze,1rg1y2,AskReddit,top_day,1

MacQueenXVII,"Chances are they didn't really love the other person in the first place. In order to honestly love someone, a person needs to to learn to love themselves first. To do this, they need to know themselves. Many people look for partners that they believe would be good for themselves based on their current flawed visions of themselves. What ends up happening is people don't fall in love with the other person, but rather like themselves more as far as their own muddled self image is concerned. Eventually the underlying problems that come with not loving yourself resurface, and people realize the relationship isn't what they'd hoped it'd be.

cyan1113,"Failure to appear to court on a Sunday. There is no court on Sunday. The ticket i supposedly didn't pay was non-existent. Got a notice in the mail that i had a warrant out for my arrest and to turn myself in to the Sanford jail (Trevon-town). I was only 17 and on Monday of that week i head my dad drive me there. The people there told me i just had to be ""processed"" and instantly released with a court hearing. So i go through giant door and first fat dude tells me to go left and turn in my shit. Next they do fingerprints and give me jail flipflops and funnel me to somewhere else, ending up in a holding cell with 15 other big ass dudes.

It's still early so the lights are still out and they all were sleeping. There was no where to sit except the center of the room. Instantly i had to take a massive shit. Soon some cracked out redneck scoots toward me to cuddle or something, great, i'm gonna get raped. Then the smell kicks in. the biggest dude laying all comfy on on of the few wall bench thingys had already pissed himself before i got there and most likely shit too. After what i figured to be 3 or 4 hours the lights came on and the others do the ""so what are ya in for thing"". When they got to me they all laughed and got kinda mad when they realized i was under age and didn't belong, and would yell at any guard that checked in to get me out of here, I still had to shit so bad.

All efforts to free me from this mistake were in vein, the guards didn't care and just mocked me. About another 3-4 hours later they started taking guys out and soon it was my turn. Once out of the cell i pleaded my case to any guard there to no avail. Once in particular was a real dick about it. Next was the mugshots, after filling out some paper works, god i had to shit so bad. Then, in mid picture taking some important cop comes in furious, yelling at the asshole cop. I couldn't hear through the glass but there was red faces and arms flailing while important cop pointed at me, my fucking hero. 

I got transferred to a solitary cell with a window and a clean toilet! I will never forget this shit i took that day, after holding it in for maybe 18 hours, it was nearly a religious experience. Then i checked out the sliver of a window and saw the kids at the nearby community college going to lunch. That meant it was around 12 am, i turned myself in at 8 am. I was only there for 4 hours.

Had so much fun, I decided to do it again the next night. My parents were out of town and my uncle was watching us. He tended to crash early and was a heavy sleeper so sneaking out was easy. He never even heard the car start up. So here it is Sunday night. I take out the car and pick up my buddy again. We drove around our neighborhood for a couple hours and were starting to get bored. Fortunately we found a friend at 7-11, who told us about a small get together happening a few blocks away. Excited, we headed out. I didn't know where we were going but I was following this guy in an MG. He was screaming down a residential neighborhood and I was just trying to keep up. At one point he was crossing an intersection and took a hard right turn. I had caught up to him and at the last possible second I cranked the steering wheel as hard as I could but the Cadillac (El Dorado) failed to turn. It was as if this boat was on water. It felt like a 4 wheel slid and I had no control. We went careening into parked car- a truck. And the sound was so loud. I threw the shifter in R and backed up. Surprisingly, the car moved back while the motor was screaming at me, steam spewing and scraping metal sounds could be heard. I put it in drive and tried to speed off. It was just creeping along and i didn't make it but maybe a block away before I realized I had to abandon the car. On foot, Jake and I jogged home, in shock, teeth chattering, and butterflies the size of Jack Russel terriers jumping around in my stomach. I thought I might hurl at one point.

We went back to the scene and by now the cops and firemen were on scene.  The homeowner who's car I totaled was on his porch watching. As I walked up a cop asked me if I was responsible. I said I was. He was surprisingly cool about it- although he did say I could be taken in for a number of things I did including fleeing a scene of an accident.

Often having to cover most skin minus hands, faces, necks.

Anyway we're reading through a text book when we see a section about women liberating themselves by showing off ankle &amp; lower legs. My teacher asks ""what do you think mens opinion were of women who showed off their lower leg and ankles"" to which I whisper loudly *SLUT*.  I sit in the second row from the the back so when everyone turns around to find out who said it I just turn around and look at the person behind me who's face turns tomato red.

holla15,"So I was 16 at the time this story happened. My buddy's (D for the story) family owned a skate park in my town and they were doing a 24 hour skate event. So we decided we would drink during the entire event. So we get the guy we know who can buy alcohol to buy a handle of Heaven Hills Whiskey. We then mix Heaven Hills and Red Bull in about ten water bottles and started our adventure. We head to the skate park and drink there for a couple of hours before becoming bored. So we head out back to his house and drink some more. We get bored again and it's getting late enough to where everyone else in our school is getting ready to party. So we get picked up and head to ""the corner"" (the gas station where we all would meet up and smoke cigs and loiter like the little badasses we were. So we're at the corner for around thirty minutes when one of our more shady acquaintances (M) offers to smoke us out being rather drunk we take him up on his offer, so we load our last couple of bottles of whiskey and head out. He asked where we should go and being as drunk as we were we just say wherever. 

So he drives to the community soccer/pool complex which has about 6 soccer fields that are all on a hill. We head to the top parking area and begin to hotbox. Right as D gets to the roach he's sees a light flash behind us and he tosses the roach. The light gets closer and knocks on the driver's window and it becomes obvious that this light belongs to a cop. M rolls down the window and the cop is immediately engulfed in smoke and the tunes of Yo Gotti. He tells M to step out of the car and takes him over to his cop car, where his partner is and they start talking to him. While this is going on I'm freaking out since I have no experience with the police at all. I ask D what's going to happen and he is freaking out just as much as I am. 

After what seems like hours, the cop comes back and ask us both to step out of the car and take us to different spots of the parking lot. They begin searching the car and come back with our water bottles (obviously), a handle of Captain Morgan (not mine, but to be expected), and a bag of pills (oh holy fuck me) and I know it's over. The cops take us all individually and find out our stories of the night and in our attempts to get out of this basically our whole life stories from how well were doing in school to our hopes and dreams. 

The cops then grab the bag of pills and ask what this is, and M says he has prescriptions for all of them (I never found out if this is true), but the cop says that each one is a felony. 

I think were fucked until the cop goes, ""but you seem like good kids, with D skipping a grade, M about to go to college, and you having straight A's, now here's what's going to happen, you're going to pour all of this liquor out right here and I'm going to dump the pills out and you're going to stomp on them, then you're going to turn that crack music off and you're going where?"" ""Home!"" we all yell. We eagerly grab the bottles and dump them and then stomp all over the pills, hop back in the car and start driving away screaming at the top of our lungs....and we didn't go home either, D and I separated from M and got picked up to go to some party where we told this story over and over to amazement at somehow getting out of this.

Me and my friends went to a private Catholic school. Basically they rarely kicked people out because you had to pay to go there so they'd technically be losing business. Plus, half the kids were good Catholic children and then the other half were the assholes who ruined everything for everyone. I was part of the latter.

Anyway, my favorite was when we had basketball games. We would always have a theme for the student section. This one time in particular we couldn't decide on one so we all just did whatever. I wore an American flag jacket with insanely tight pants and another one of my friends was shuffle-bot. Then our one friend who usually initiated the trouble was dressed as Jesus. 

Anyway, we always got blasted before the games and this time our Jesus was in the front row and during one of our regular cheers he fell flat onto the court. Like didn't even catch himself, busted his nose on the wood, probably a full torso's length over the line. We had to carry him out and drive away with the one friend who didn't drink before our defensive coordinator for the football team could catch us.

So 15 minutes later and about 15-25 huts with no doors anymore we found 2 golf carts with keys in them and the fun began.

Chardonnay Herb Chicken

2 boneless chicken breasts
4 TBS olive oil
1/2 cup Chardonnay (more or less depending on your taste)
3/4 cup of half n half (more or less depending on your taste)
1 cup of chicken stock
3 medium shallots, chopped fine
4 garlic cloves, chopped fine
2 TBS of spicy mustard, or Dijon will work, too. (NOT THE YELLOW SANDWICH MUSTARD!!)
Fresh herbs:
1 TBS rosemary
1 TBS tarragon
1TBS parsley
1 TBS thyme 
Again, with the herbs you can use less or more depending on your taste. I LOVE herbs!

In short, 4 TBS in pan on medium heat. Add chicken. Brown on both sides until crust has formed. Take out chicken. Put in shallots and garlic. Brown. Add wine and chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Whisk in small amounts of the half n half and mustard (if not the high heat will turn it lumpy). Whisk all together, add chicken and herbs. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until chicken is done and sauce is thick. 
I usually serve this with asparagus and some sort of potato. If you are thinking potatoes, this will be a great way to utilize the leftover chicken stock.

Everybody is guilty of treating other people wrong in some way or another, even the kids that were bullied or picked on. What's important is ensuring that your child has a strong moral compass and the desire to be a force of good in society. Clinging to titles and stereotypes is a great way to do the opposite. Teach your son to see the good in everybody and to ignore such inane trivialities and you'll have won.
