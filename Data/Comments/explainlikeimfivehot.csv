lifecereals,"The transplanted kidney would have taken damage from being transplanted in another person's body. The person who gave the kidney would have had their other kidney get bigger to compensate for the loss of one of their kidneys. There would be little to no benefit/ probably a lot more harm in trying to give back the kidney even if it was okay because the person who gave it has already had enough changes to make up for it. You would not want to give it back due to things like fibrosis(scar tissue), etc. Also when you transplant a kidney you put it in a different place than where you take it(in the pelvis area). So it's not like you can just ""put it back.""

On a side note, kidneys are VERY easy to damage, so depending on what they die from it would probably not be able to be used anyway even if it were possible.",null,256,cdmh1c8,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1216

Source:I just went through this very recently and asked the doctors the same question.  

Interesting fact:  The kidney transplant center will lie for you if you want, it's something they offer you.  For example, your close relative is in need of a kidney and asks you for one.  You agree but before the surgery you have second thoughts.  So instead of having to tell your close family member ""No, I will not give you my organ"", the kidney transplant people will lie to them and say ""Sorry, your relative cannot give you your kidney because he is not a viable candidate due to genetics/some rare condition he has/compatibility/etc...""  They will make up some bullshit so that way it doesn't look like you are refusing to save your family members life, it will look like you simply were not accepted due to whatever medical guidelines.  This option really surprised me.

But, to answer you question, [here is a relevant case-study I found](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1432-2277.2009.01031.x/abstract). It is somewhat similar to OP's question. According to the case-study, it is possible to reuse the donated kidney, but I have not come across any cases where the kidney was given back to the original donor. If any of you have, please let me know. This is an interesting question!

Also, if you do donate your kidney (as a live donor), you will be placed on a priority recipient list, should you need a kidney later on in your life. (At least, that's how our organ center works. I am not sure if this incentive is available nationally)

rearviewclouds,"The short answer is no.

The longer answer is way longer than this post, but it starts something like this: 

You hit the nail on the head with one of the reasons - transplant surgery is ""major"" - there are risks involved with all elements of the surgery:   anaesthetic, the laparotomy  (i.e. it is 'open' surgery), and the surgery is technically difficult and fiddly. 

To be allowed to donate your kidney in the first place, you must be in sufficiently good renal (and otherwise) health to operate on just the one - essentially, you are pretty much perfectly healthy, just with one kidney. Thus there is no need to subject a ""healthy"" person to the risks of a major operation/anaesthetic and the challenges of post op recovery (infections, blood clots, pneumonia etc etc)  


Another big reason is that organs need a blood supply to survive, and decay starts as soon as the blood supply is lost.  In transplant surgery there are strict time limits for taking organs out of a 'donor' and being put into a 'recipient'. Sooner is better. 

After a certain time, the organs undergo irreversible changes that mean they won't be able to usefully operate, even if they were put back in another person.   Organs are put on ice until they are ready to be plugged into the donor, which limits the rate of decay of the organs, but damage from a lack of blood supply is always inevitable. (Google things like ""cold ischemic time"" and ""warm ischemic time"" for further details.)

Essentially, most of the donors are patients in ICU environments who are 'brain dead'.  They are on 'life support' which means that machines have taken over the job of keeping the airway open and providing oxygen/nutrition to the body. Blood is still pumping around their body, getting to the organs (kidneys, liver, heart, lungs etc) - but not the brain.  

So the kidneys are still alive and working, and are suitable to be put into someone else. During the transplant retrieval operation, this blood supply is cut and the organs are removed. Ultimately, the donor dies during the donation surgery. Clearly, this is a huge thing to consider for the donor's loved ones - one of the many reasons organ donation is such a complex area. 

(The other main scenario is a 'live donor' situation such as you are talking about - where the donor has an operation to retrieve the organ,  thus normal blood supply is maintained right until the operation to donate)

So... in our scenario - it would be technically possible to get your kidney back, if the person you gave it to became brain dead in an ICU type environment. 

But you would be doing fine without it.

(Organ transplantation is a huge and complex topic - this is only the beginning of the explanation. The ethical/spiritual side is also fascinating)

[source - work in a transplant centre] ",null,12,cdmi3a5,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,29
anubis_of_q,"Unfortunately no.  When your kidney goes into the recipient, their body immediately starts attacking it.  Doctors do some testing to help reduce the amount of damage host does to the donor kidney (HLA typing), but it doesn't check for everything, which is why transplant patients are placed on immunosuppressive medications (medications that reduces the immune system of the host). 

Those drugs are also toxic to the kidneys as well.  So its a balance between drug toxicity and immunosuppression.  Thus, the kidneys will undergo damage, and over a period of years will become dysfunctional (people with transplants do not return to normal life-expectancy, it is just temporarily elongated).  Longterm causes of mortality of people who undergo transplantation will be that they either die of the infections secondary to immunosuppression, diseases secondary to the cause of the original disease requiring the transplant, or kidney failure from drug or host damage.  

so in the end the risk of the surgery does not outweigh getting the kidney back.  You would be hardpressed to find a surgeon who would be willing to do the surgery.  

Now i do remember an article published awhile back that stated that a transplanted kidney was retransplanted into another patient who needed it (not back to the donor), because the cause of death was irrelevant to the kidney itself.  The first host also had the kidney for a short period of time. But this would be the exception rather than the rule

ProSaint,"I have absolutely no expertise on health issues but the kidney functions as a Mason jar of sorts that is a place your urine passes through before it goes to the bladder.

All the homeless cells have to find a new home-usually your pancreas for males. If you're a female, they go to your pancreas too. If you get that kidney back and the gallbladder hasn't let all the homeless cells out, you will have an over abundance of vagrants in your body begging all your other organs for a dollar.

lmckl1,"Hey reddit. I work for organ transplant. Although it is not outside the realm of possibility for this to happen, if you were in need of a kidney you would likely receive one from another donor. There are a few points to take into consideration:

-The kidney you donated will likely be in rough shape from years of anti-rejection medications and other meds the recipient is likely on.
-How functional is your own remaining kidney? If you're fine and don't need a transplant, they are not going to do it. It is no small surgery.
-Speaking of surgery. Do you want another one. Many living kidney donors end up having complications after their donation such as large hernias under their incision site. When receiving a kidney, it is attached to your abdominal aorta, so you would have an incision site at your belt line.
-What did the recipient die from? If they died from renal failure, you probably don't want that kidney back.

I can only think of one organ donor that I've seen that has also been a recipient- but their heart was going for transplant, so that's probably why.

So, when people refer to Obama as black, this is what they're talking about: he looks black, *and this is relevant because it affects how he grew up.* When people refer to him as half-black, they're giving more credence to his specific family tree; both are, in a sense, correct.

DavidLieberMintz,"I'm seeing a lot of jokes and people referencing the ""one drop rule."" Race cannot be determined biologically. There is no gene for black, white or Asian etc. There are, however, genes for the pigment of your skin, the color of your eyes, how curly or straight your hair is and on and on and on. It is the combination of all these physical attributes that we as a society use to invent and reinvent race.

Obama is considered black because that is the racial group he chose to identify with. Given the time and place he was raised, I'd say he didn't have much of a choice. But the key concept here is that race is something made up by people. YOU have just as much a say in your race as society dictates.

Consider the following.
Bob is a teenage boy who's father is black and mother is Puerto Rican. Bob and his parents live in a major US city. If the neighborhood Bob grew up in is predominately Hispanic, he will most likely identify with that group because he sees himself as Hispanic. Whether he looks more Hispanic or more African American certainly plays a role in making his race, but it is not the determining factor. What if Bob grew up in a black neighborhood? What if Bob grew up the wealthy suburbs? You can understand how this might change how Bob sees himself.

This will probably get buried, but I hope it helps you understand where race comes from!

If anything, though, I would consider myself black (after biracial, of course) due to my complexion. I may not be a dark chocolate brown but... I'm brown *enough* that I have encountered racism multiple times in my life--even though I'm not considered ""fully black."" If a person sees my color, they will look at me and know that I'm definitely not white...I'm some sort of ""other."" This also posed a problem when I was younger, as white students didn't see me as white, black students see me as black, and I damn sure couldn't speak Spanish.

If I were to look at Barack, not knowing his heritage, I would see a black male. This, I think, speaks for what he was able to accomplish in a white-male dominated political arena.

aeo2013,"As with almost all foreign policy pronouncements, you should consider what audience is being targeted and what the speaker's incentives are.  In this case, there are good strategic incentives for Israel/Netanyahu to appear hardline on this deal.

First, Netanyahu's domestic political situation is dependent on him being seen as hardline on Iran.  He has staked his reputation on this position and so, *whatever deal was agreed to*, he has to appear more hardline than that.  So, even if he actually thinks that this is a good deal, or a step along the way to a good deal (good in terms of what Iran would eventually accept), he has to publicly appear ""pissed off"", using OP's language.  

Second, there is the international audience.  The P5+1 negotiators (from the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany) will be able to get a better deal from Iran if they can point to a hardline Israel stance and say to Iran, ""Look, look at the pressure we are under here.  If you don't want Israel to reject the deal (and maybe unilaterally bomb your nuclear facilities), you are going to have to give a better deal"".  The P5+1 negotiators also seem more reasonable and moderate next to a hardline Israel.  

In addition to strategic incentives, there is a thing called ""fundamental attribution error"".  Briefly, this is a psychological phenomenon that all humans are subject to to some extent, where you think that you are a good person and forced to do bad things by your environment, but other people do bad things because they are bad people.  So, even though Israelis trust themselves to only use their nuclear weapons defensively, they think that Iran would use nuclear weapons offensively, even if that means effectively committing suicide (through nuclear retaliation).  This means that they are far more concerned about *ensuring* Iran doesn't have nuclear weapon capabilities than is reasonable/rational.

Israel not getting what they wanted from the US in regards to an issue like Iran is very unusual, and so they're likely just as upset about that as they are the actual terms of the deal.

On a more personal level, the Israel Prime Minister (Netanyahu) has generally campaigned on the idea that Iran is an imminent existential threat that can never be reasoned with,  and that his leadership is the only hope that Israel has of surviving.

Those opposed to a Iran gave up some of the bargaining power.  Currently, there are economic sanctions (penalties) against Iran to pressure the country.  The recent deal agrees to reduce the existing sanctions and to avoid creating new ones.  In exchange, some feel Iran's not doing much, so the US is surrendering its position of power for very little.

Concern that Iran will continue to make efforts to develop nuclear weapons despite the deal.

Issues relating to Israel's involvement in the negotiations.  Specifically, negotiations existed for months before anyone from Israel was informed.  Israel wants its views considered when negotiations with Iran take place.

Interpretations on what the deal says about Iran's nuclear future.  Israel doesn't just want nuclear progress halted.  It wants development stopped completely.  According to the Iranians involved in the deal, the agreement strongly implies that recognition that the country has a right to nuclear capabilities.  This is directly against the views of Israel.  

Limitations on what Israel can do.  In the past, Israel has made unilateral strikes against perceived nuclear threats.

Once the state declares it's intention to seek the death penalty, a defendant will automatically be appointed not only an attorney (assuming he's indigent), but probably a couple attorneys as well as a mitigation investigator. That person will go back to the defendants roots and dug up everything they can from the persons life that would help sway a jury to recommend life. There will likely be a sanity commission to determine whether he is competent to stand trial, consisting of several doctors. 

The state is also hiring experts, and will be spending extra man hours to ensure everything goes exactly right so a later court has no reason to reverse. Same thing goes for the trial court. 

So all that happens before trial. Day one of trial starts an exhausting version of the standard jury selection. Before the normal process starts, each juror may need to be media qualified (have they been biased by prior coverage of the case), and will need to be death qualified (whether they could vote for death under some set if facts or are they too against the death penalty to consider). Only then can the attorneys start regular jury selection. 

Trial will probably run 1-2 weeks. If guilty, then the jury comes back and hears testimony about the mitigating an aggravating factors (this is where that investigators work becomes relevant). Then they will vote on life/death. 

If death, (at least in my state) the defendant gets an auto appeal to the state Supreme Court. He will be appointed a different attorney for this, who will have to learn the case, go through the whole deal. Defendant argues anything and everything that he says went wrong from the moment the crime happened. 

If affirmed, he can petition the US Supreme Court to hear his case. Unlikely here. Then he starts state post conviction. New attorney, goes back to arguing constitutional challenges in the same court he was convicted. If affirmed, back to state Supreme Court and the petitioning the US Supremes.

 If he hasn't managed a new trial yet, he will file a petition for habeas corpus in fed district court, again arguing constitutional issues. If affirmed, he can go to the appellate court, and then petition the US Supreme Ct again. 

Only when the supremes deny his petition or affirm does his conviction become ""final."" Meanwhile, this whole time he's been housed in an ultra secure area of the prison by himself, rather than in the GP. 

Every appeal (except US Supreme Ct and maybe US Appeals) are of right. He gets them regardless, and taxpayers are paying his attorneys and fees (think of all the copies, for instance). If any court finds a a significant error, process restarts. Also, it's in the defendants best interest to fight to delay all of these, waiting for new rulings, new facts, or just more days on earth. 

Most defendants will then file some sort of 1983 claim alleging that the method of execution is unconstitutional. Usually some interest group pays his fees here, but the people still pay the state and the federal judge that'll hear it. 

Overall, it's not hard to see how the costs pile up.

AshRandom,"The claim that is so often trotted out, is that there are a tremendous number of man-hours spent by lawyers and judges during the appeals process. While this claim is true for a single event, it's not as meaningful as one might imagine, especially when the total ledger is examined. 

A death sentence trial, with appeals, when totaled up in number of days averages around 1500, as compared to about 500 days for a life sentence. Three times as much. But the kicker is, recidivism. Yes. Recidivism! The term used to describe a failure, the failure to reform criminals, who serve their time and go free, only to end up back in jail as repeat offenders. The recidivism rate in the U.S. within three years of being released is over 70% in every state. [B.J.S. Bureau of Justice Recidivism Statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=17)

Brelya,"The death penalty in most states results in a bifurcated trial where the same jury (most of the time) sit through two ""trials"". The first is the guilt phase where they decided whether to convict a person.  The second is the penalty phase where the State and defense counsel each present relevant evidence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances so that finally the jury may decide whether that particular defendant should get the death penalty.

Defense counsel should invest a lot of time in looking for mitigating information prior to the case even going to trial because if convincing enough and if in the right place, the State may waive seeking the death penalty.

In some states the decision to impose death is then automatically reviewed by the State's supreme court for a proportionality review. They decide whether this person truly deserves the penalty in light of every other defendant that has received it.

During this time, appeals and post-conviction motions run wild. The defendant can assert many claims such as : ineffective assistance of counsel, unfair trial, etc. There are many avenues to have not only state courts but federal courts to review the case and claims the defendant might have. In every instance the State most likely will defend their position.

The prosecution (State) is financed by the state government and where the defendant is being represented by public defenders, that is also financed by the state government.

It is a long and arduous process but it costs money because **death is different**. It is a lot more sensitive and dangerous to put someone's life on the line without making sure the process is fair.

benofepmn,"After a lengthy jury trial with two phases, one for guilt and one for punishment, that results in a death sentence, the defendant has a lot of due process rights to exhaust before he can get executed. First, is a direct appeal to the state's high court. After the conviction is affirmed, the defendant can then ask for postconviction relief such as a writ of habeas corpus. When that is denied, he can appeal. If the denial is affirmed on appeal, his state remedies are exhausted, but he still can't get executed. 

Now, he can go to federal court and ask for habeas corpus relief. When that is denied, he can appeal. Then he can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. When they choose not to hear the case, the defendant often tries desperate measures such as contesting the method of execution or claiming that there is newly discovered evidence that warrants a new trial.

All these appeals and due process take time. Transcripts of proceedings need to be ordered and created. Briefs need to be researched and written. Oral arguments are heard. The courts' written decisions need to be researched and written. This results in these appeals taking years.

Lizzipp,"Because if you want to kill someone, you've got to be *really really certain* they're guilty. An innocent person who was sentenced to life in prison could come out twenty years later when DNA evidence shows they were innocent, or the guilty party comes forward, or they could successfully appeal. That's not *ideal*, of course, but the point is it's not irreversible, where the death penalty is. If someone's been sentenced to death, you want to get all your appealing done *before* the sentence is carried out, and you have to delay it for as long as possible to ensure no one is going to come forward with new evidence that could potentially re-open the case, and also you *want* to delay it for as long as possible - you're going to demand every single appeal and retrial and whatever you can because at the end of all that you're going to die. You're going to be the biggest pain in the arse you possibly could.

Add to this the fact that the death penalty isn't legal in most countries, and in the ones that it is which are also a functioning democracy (the US) it's only legal in a handful of places. Say you commit your crime in Texas and flee to the UK, even if you're arrested in the UK you've got to be extradited back to Texas with is an extremely lengthy and therefore expensive process. The touchy nature of the subject is a real hindrance, since lots of countries believe the death penalty is immoral and may refuse to extradite someone if they believe they would face execution, in the same way they do for potential torture victims.

Also, ""life in prison"" is not always *life* in prison. Where I'm from, ""life in prison"" more often means 25-30 years although you can be sentenced to a ""whole life order"", which means there's no possibility of parole. It can easily take fifteen, twenty, thirty years on death row before the actual execution, maybe even more. So although the cost of an execution itself is pretty low, you're already adding that to what's essentially a life sentence, and that's before you take into account the cost of thirty year's worth of legal work.

poppop_n_theattic,"The level of judicial process to execute someone is much higher than for a life sentence, for three main reasons.  First, you cannot take back an execution.  Second, the public wants to believe that we only execute guilty people.  Third, the Supreme Court has said that only certain crimes and criminals are eligible for execution under the 8th Amendment, so there are additional legal issues in death cases that are not present in life-sentence cases.  The result is a very expensive legal process that usually goes on for years.  This is all aggravated by the fact that states often appoint lawyers who are inexperienced, underfunded, and in over their heads to represent capital defendants in their initial trials.  This leads to subsequent challenges that the trial was unfair due to inadequacy of counsel.

MistaSchlong,"Ok, so you know about digital devices.  Think about a binary switch: something that just turns on and off.  That's what a neuron does: it just turns on and off.  At the end of a neuron, there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too.  These signals are made of molecules, and we call these molecules neurotransmitters.  We won't need to talk about these neurotransmitters, but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them, they're really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn on.

OK, your brain is made of neurons.  (It's also made of other types of cells, but the most simple, straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail.)  ""Knowledge,"" is stored in these neurons.  Now, because a neuron can only, essentially, turn on and off, the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easier.

Making the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms.  You can make the neuron more ""sensitive"" to neurotransmitters.  (This can, for instance, happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor.)  Likewise, you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing ""sensitivity"" to neurotransmitters.

Note: you may have heard of the term Action Potential.  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns on.

Now, knowing that a neuron can turn on and off, and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off, I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar.  Chords are made up of notes, and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings.  Basically turning them on or keeping them off.

However, and this is the key, with just a few chords, you can play millions of different songs.  It's just about how the chords are played; the timing, the tempo, the coordination.  Similarly, the firing of neurons, on and off, in combination, generates recall of stored knowledge.  And knowledge is stored in how easily or difficult these neurons are fired on and off.",null,0,cdnep8v,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,hot,3

airor,"The memories are stored in the pattern of sequences your neurons fire throughout your brain.  

A single neuron will tend to fire at a rate determined by the neurons attached to it, so groups (cortical columns) of neurons tend to fire at the same time and at a steady rate.  This rate can be influenced by other groups of neurons firing at nearly the same rate such that the two groups start to synchronize.  Patterns form as the different rates compete for synchronization throughout your brain.  

Some of your neurons are directly connected and influenced by sensory input and tend to sync to that input.  Due to the feedback of all the other neuron groups the input can be predicted: the pattern is recognized and other groups start performing the pattern that is the expected future sequence of input.  The brain is built to allow for many layers of this pattern recognition dance, each layer ""predicting"" the future output by simply repeating the patterns that occurred the previous times it received that input.

When the pattern is 'confirmed' and the input really does follow the expectation, the two groups stay in synchronization and new connections are made to strengthen that pattern.  When dissonance occurs and the input does not match with a group, the connections to that group weaken.  So in effect your brain evolves the connections between neuron groups that correctly predict the future.

How is that a stored memory?  There are areas of your brain that can 'fake' sensory input into the system and let it perform it's dance.  This ability gives us the power to imagine situations and remember previous input.  The feedback and the flurry of patterns that emerge as we 'think' is horrendously complex and not well understood because we can't reproduce how it actually works.

Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.

Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.

Celiac is a life threatening response to gluten.  However there isn't much science investigating the responses that aren't as pressing.  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance, which is characterized by a host of symptoms including ""bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain. It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo, among many others."" (from the wiki for gluten sensitivity).  ""Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food.""

Just like a vaccine, when you have antibodies against something your body sees as harmful, they stick around as your soldiers and fight for you for a long time. If you got fat/sick/unhealthy while simultaneously eating a bunch of gluten, your ""soldiers"" don't want you to go back or continue down that dangerous road and fight for you anytime they see gluten.

The theory is that autistic children have a hyper-sensitivity to foods containing gluten and that they process peptides and protiens differently than other people do. The idea behind the use of the diet is to reduce the symptoms that come with autism.

So..there's tons of studies for this, and tons against it.  I dont work with autisic kids but my son is autistic and we do things with the autism society here in my town, so i know MANY special needs kids and their parents that are advocates of this theory, and say it helps.

I'd attribute the boom in gluten free products to this theory coupled with the rise of kids with autism, awareness of celiac, and health nuts in general.

Before people start jumping to the downvote button, id like to say that i'm not advocating this theory, and im not against it.

legowife,"As a diet (as in a way you eat to lose weight) it's a fad. Replacing non-gluten free foods with gluten free foods has no garuntee to make you lose weight. One caveat however is that if you do not replace wheat bread and other gluten products with a comparable gluten free product (which are often higher in calories and sugar) then the likelyhood is that you will have actually entered into a low/lower carb diet than you were eating previously and maybe even a lower calorie diet purely because you are avoiding foods with gluten and haven't replaced them with something else. Low carb diets do have a great track record for weight loss. Whether it is a healthy method or not is a matter of some debate.

On the flip side, the gluten free diet (as in what you eat to live and sustain yourself long term) is imperative for people with Celiacs who are directly allergic to it, and some other conditions like crohns which are deeply irritated by the gluten protein, and it can also be beneficial for those who have or suspect they may have other digestive sensitivities as they work with their doctor to eliminate possible causes.

In no case is purchasing a gluten free product a necessity for eating gluten free as the number of foods that are naturally gluten free is enormous, but it does make the transition easier for some.

Perhaps beautiful things can be so striking to us that it fires off a ""noticeable change in the environment"" signal.

maestro2005,"Okay so, nobody here is right.  Not even doovidooves with his 110 upvotes.  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording, and ""classical"" versus ""modern"" isn't the right way to break things down.

First, some terminology.  I'm going to refer to it as ""Classical"" versus ""Popular"".  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music (e.g. Gregorian chant), certain types of Renaissance music (motets, madrigals, etc.), the Baroque period, the Classical period, the Romantic period, and modern periods that we don't quite have the historical context to classify yet.  It continues to be written today.

Popular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created, which today involves the rock combo with guitars, basses, drum sets, keyboards, etc., but includes folk music all the way back.  It actually predates Classical.

Popular music has always been meant to be easily imitable.  In the days before recording, it was meant to be played/sung by amateur musicians in the home, or around the campfire, or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be.  It's simpler music, not that impressive in its composition, so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer.  And usually, there aren't that many performers, which makes it simpler still.

Classical music is not meant to be easily imitated.  The forms are longer and more complicated, and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master.  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits.  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor.  We marvel at the composer's ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece.  We still marvel at the performers, but we marvel more at the composer.  Many people can both write and play Popular music.  Few can play Classical music, and even fewer can write it.

Recording and distribution has changed things a bit.  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular (we do still use that but not exclusively), we can record the world's best Popular musicians and distribute that recording.  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction (see: Metal).

And Classical music has certainly leveraged catchiness to become popular (see: Mozart operas).  So the lines have always been a bit blurry and may have gotten blurrier recently.  But that's the basic distinction.",null,4,cdnlzvj,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,38
49ersFaithfulForLife,"Commercialized music is more about marketing an image and selling an identity than it is about the music itself. It's easier to take a good-looking singer, stylize them and build a brand around their face and name, than it is to do with the songwriters who may have a less marketable image. In some cases, especially in hip hop, the producer's name may be well-known and liked enough that they'll make a point to associate it with the album, but this is an exception to the rule.

For the most part, the music industry doesn't want you to be consciously aware of the fact that the majority of the music you hear isn't written by the performers, but by marketers in suits and ties applying a formula fine-tuned to maximize the likelihood they'll get your fifteen dollars for the album. That doesn't look as good. Yeah, most consumers know or have been told this is the case, but it's not something the consciously think about every time they listen to a song.

zerozed,"""Lots of modern music"" (as you phrase it) is fairly disposable pop with no gravitas.  It often is one dimensional lyrically, and the producer normally dictates both the sound and structure.  In a nutshell, such music is more akin to a commodity, not art since it is produced for a mass audience by a whole slew of people on the corporate payroll whose single goal is to sell records, not convey a composer/artists original vision.  

Although your question specifically asks about the different standard with classical composers and ""modern music,"" I'd like to correct you a bit.  You might be too young to remember the explosion of the singer/songwriter movement of the 1960s/70s.  Prior to then, almost all pop artists just sang/performed other people's songs.  As artists like Buddy Holly, to the Beatles came around...audiences discovered the unique profundity when an artist performed their own work.  Bob Dylan was the first major artist to really cross this bridge--a number of artists popularized his work (e.g. Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--Blowin' in the Wind, The Byrds--Mr Tambourine Man, Jimi Hendrix--All Along the Watchtower) but there was no mistaking how powerful an artist Dylan was once you heard him (with all this non-commercial idiosyncrasies) perform his own compositions.

Finally--to more directly respond to your question regarding classical composers...the answer is simply that their compositions were uniquely their visions...transcribed precisely for artists to render without improvisation.  ",null,3,cdnfat3,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,3

What you're talking about mostly happens, I think, in [""Popular"" Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music) (I hate that term) and Jazz, where bands often cooperate in composing and performing their own music.

This means you stop caring so much about who wrote the music -- it's likely to be the person who's playing anyhow -- and just focus on the performer. So when you do have stuff that's not actually written by the performer, it's really not that well known.

It's worth noting that this isn't always a black and white distinction. Look at famous Louis Armstrong songs.

It's simple, the composer of the classical piece is of course the one to have his name associated with the piece, he/she wrote it. 

The popular artist may not have written the song, but they are performing it, they are the artist and it is on their album. It *does* say on albums who wrote the song. But you know it by the artist who performed it and it appears on their album. For example, it wouldn't make sense to say, ""Thriller"" by Rod Temperton, because it was ""made popular"" by Michael Jackson. Thriller is a part of Michael Jackson's catalogue because it was written specifically ""for him."" He performed it on his album. 

Imagine saying, I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Burt Bacharach. That doesn't make very much sense, but ""I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Dionne Warwick makes sense because she is the performer. Stating the composer tells nothing about the particular version of the song for popular music, where on the other hand: I 'm going to listen to ""Moonlight Sonata"" the performer is not as important because each version will be the exact same rendition of the piece written by Beethoven, who also made it popular. 

It doesn't have anything to do with the times being different or money, orchestral music is still composed today, but it's the composer's piece, therefore his name is on it.

Classical music has no lyrics, and therefore the only person who stands out is the conductor (someone who doesn't actually play or write the music, rather, interpenetrates between the two). Currently, the main focus is the singer, and therefore they get the credit. Each singer also brings their own interpretation and emotion to the composition, unlike in classical music (or at least to a lesser extent). This means that actual composition it the focus.

If you heard music by Mozart, you never actually heard Mozart play because he couldn't/didn't tour around with his music, it was sent to different orchestras.

Now we have recordings and easy travel so if you hear one of Katy Perry's songs, chances are it's her singing, not someone else.

* He subtracts the carrier signal

afcagroo,"There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.   
   
To broadcast a radio signal, we make an antenna that will resonate at the frequency we want to send. This is done mainly by controlling its length, so that as a wave travels down to the end and bounces back, it does so in a way that provides constructive interference (rather than destructive). The wave in the antenna creates a field that propagates out into space as an electromagnetic wave.  When it hits an antenna of the proper length, it induces a wave in it, and again constructive interference helps to keep it strong enough to be amplified and demodulated.  
  
Electrical current doesn't follow the path of least resistance.  That is an oversimplified saying that is not accurate.  Electrical current follows *all* possible paths, with more current going where there is less resistance.  
  
But in an antenna, there generally isn't a lot of current flow, because there's no place for the current to go. What happens is that the electric *field* propagates down the conductor.

JohnSmith1800,"Your airway (trachea) and food ""pipe"" (esophagus) run parallel to each other down your neck. The problem arises because of an evolutionary fluke, the esophagus is behind the trachea. This means that in order for food to get down it, it has to pass over the trachea's opening. If it goes down there, it can obstruct your airway, and you choke (to death is optional).

Normally you don't choke. This is because of a handy flap of tissue at the top back of the trachea, which flops down and covers the opening when you swallow. Most of the time this works and you don't choke, occasionally it doesn't. When it doesn't, the food will undergo one of a few possible outcomes.

It'll usually be expelled by coughing; The lining of the trachea is very sensitive to foreign objects.  For very small particles (or water) it'll pass down into the lungs. Here it will usually be destroyed by macrophages (little cells that absorb stuff, a lot of them hang out in the lungs for just this purpose). Option 3 is that it doesn't come out at all. This may or may not be fatal. For example, bones from meat can lodge in an airway and not actually kill you (although you're at high risk of infection).

First and foremost, Almost all connections used nowadays are digital.  coaxial cable use an analog signal, but that's usually just to carry a digital signal over long distances (IE, to your cable box).
The difference there is analog acts like a wave.  It weakens the further it travels and the worse the medium.     if it gets weak, the end result is fuzzy.
Digital, though, is just 1s and 0s.  Literally. A series of on states and off states.
If that comes through weaker, it's still just 1s and s.  
So, with digital, it's an all or nothing thing, so, signal quality does not matter as much.            
Secondly,  and this one is why people get so about it, is that all those quality enhancements on monster cables? They are complete lies.  Gold plating does nothing to enhance signal, and almost nothing to enhance the connection.  If they used gold the whole way through, it would, but it would also make the cables heavy and far too expensive to be profitable.     
The extra rubber around the outside? it does nothing for the signal.  Just makes the wires more physically durable.    
Those fancy connector heads? all for show.  They do not enhance signal at all.        
In short, monster cable has always lied about why monster cable was better; In modern times, even if they're promises were true, they'd be irrelevant, because the way we send signals does not care about strength much anymore.          
Oh, and the 200 monster cable is not only indistinguishable in quality from a 4 dollar one-

josh4rim,"**Jaw Impact**

A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin around. This quick motion of causes trauma to the brain that knocks the recipient out leaving him unconscious. Points on the jaw that are especially vulnerable to knockouts are the sides of the chin, and where the jaw is attaches to the skull.

**Acceleration and Deceleration**

When the jaw is punched, the head quickly accelerates around. After a fraction of a second, it quickly decelerates as muscles, tendons, and bones prevent the head from spinning any further. The brain inside the skull is floating in fluid. It accelerates slower than the rest of the head. This forces it to crash into the inside of the skull when the head stops.


**Brain Trauma
**
When the brain slams into the inside of the skull, it suffers trauma. It then bounces off the inside of the skull and slams into the opposite side. This causes even more trauma. Depending on the force of the punch, this can happen several times before the brain comes to rest inside the skull.

**Nervous System Response**

The trauma to the brain stimulates an overwhelming number of neurotransmitters to fire at the same time. This essentially overloads the nervous system sending it into a state of temporary paralysis. The person who is hit in the jaw loses consciousness and his muscles relax. The injured person falls to the ground with no memory of being hit.

**Recovery**

A person who is knocked out by a punch to the jaw suffers a severe concussion. It can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes to regain consciousness. It all depends on the severity of the brain trauma. In mild cases, the person who is knocked out can shake off the punch with little more than a headache. In severe cases, brain trauma from a knockout punch to the jaw can cause cerebral bleeding and death.

This isn't the only reason however, as the brain also perceives you getting hit as a threat that you could possibly make worse by acting out of fear or knee-jerk reaction.  
So your brain hits the wall of your skull, decides ""If I'm working too hard while this keeps happening it can cause serious damage so I'm going on standby until I feel safe.""  
This is why some people can pass out from being frightened, as they perceive a threat and the brain wants you to just relax and stay still, that is what it feels is the safest.  
Hope this helps, I'm no doctor I just trained MMA and thought I'd do some research.

maeon3,"What happens during a head injury event?

School, Movies, Sitcoms, Religions, Youtube, Fraternaties, and everywhere else you go, the mind is treated like a shake-toy.  Roller coasters at Disney: ""the Hulk"" bash your head sideways against hard plastic.  Roller coasters have people push their head against a vibrating car.  Children are encouraged to hit the soccer ball with their head.  Kids put their heads in hard plastic spheres and hit it against others as the crowd cheers.  Take your jet engine and wrap it with some padding and throw it off a one story building. Your brain has the consistency of jello and your skull has the consistency of stone.  If I take your brain and pour it into a square bowl, it will take the shape of that bowl.  Vibrating your head will cause ripples and vibrations in that jello.  Shake hard enough and you get scarring, blood clots that expand and push and leak between the modules to cause destruction of neurons.

Getting knocked out causes undiagnosed subdural hematomas which is when blood leaks out of the arteries to flood the neurons and it suffocates a sub-net of your mind as scabbing occurs to stop the leak.  The brain being the most remarkable instrument on the planet can remap old functionality onto new hardware in an instant.  Normally scarring occurs anywhere along the edges of your mind, and your dedicated employees of yours (the 30 million layers of hierarchical hidden markov models) disappear.  Car accidents.  Getting punched.  Hitting your head on the ice.  Contact sports, falling out of the crib cracking your skull open.  Being ""Knocked out"" or a having a concussion.  If your brain experiences a shock of more than 7 G's, you may get brain damage.  The brain can re-map functionality (quite quickly) to other parts of the brain, it will heal itself, but you will be running your hardware system with fewer resources.  Why are boxing champions retarded? Because they have multiple brain injuries.

noptotsch,"Basically, a person knocked out is saving energy for primary body function by blocking functions strictly unnecessary to survival. It's physically processing a (huge) blow (to that person). This can be mentally, coming from a shock or otherwise difficult context of input to your brain, this can be physically as a reaction to a huge slam, bloodloss or otherwise. The result of knockout is in any case a physical reaction where the body physically switches back to survival mode by disabling secondary physical body functions such as seeing, smelling, moving. Sometimes the body already does this to prevent further damage by say assessing and processing any mental or physical (most often sudden) blow to its perception of reality (you can get knock out as shock, no physical blow recieved here), so this can happen as a precaution where physically your body doesn't necessarily needs to shutdown these secondary functions. 

BTW, going more directly into your question, assuming 'trend game' is something like people kneeling down and suddenly stand up to faint; this is like physically draining the oxygen from your head, people sometimes do it by kicking each other in the lungs or stomach too, by suddenly standing up your brain notices decrease of oxygen in bloodflow and shuts down to save the energy for primary function, sort of survival reflex.

PRATFO,"I don't know about any of the explanations that the brain ""shuts down"" for protective reasons, I just don't see the adaptive benefit to this unless you're arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult. This simply is not the case, if anything, the blood flow is increased following impact. This is the basis of second-impact syndrome. When there is concussion, brain function is altered, resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time. Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate. As a result of this dilation, there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edema.

As to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness, I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement. There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal. The details probably aren't worth going into. But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries. This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness, likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants, such as the Moro reflex, which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change. This reflex originates in the pons. 

ELI5: Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem, where the arousal network is. This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed, this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem, this is called the fencing response.

SoWhatIfImChristian,"Just like a lot of the posts here have explained, it has to do with either you brain receiving trauma or damage, an overload of sensors or insufficient oxygen levels reaching the brain. 

Whether it be getting hit on the jaw, being in a car crash, etc, all of this causes a fast acceleration to your head. Your brain is suspended in fluid and there is nothing else that keeps it apart from the skull. When sudden acceleration or deceleration happens, it will cause the brain to smash against the skull. This will cause trauma or damage and result in being ""knocked out.""

Another way can be when your brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters. Whether it be pain, flashing lights (epilepsy), and so on, if the brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters it will overload and shut down for it's own safety. 

In the case of an oxygen deficiency, do people remember the ""game"" where people used to play by choking each other until they pass out? In order for the brain to function, it needs a continuous stream of oxygen being . When oxygen is cut off, it results in cerebral hypoxia. When you get choked either by someone else, a belt, a rope or anything, it cuts off the blood supply to your head. The oxygen is carried through your blood, thus it results in cerebral hypoxia. If this lack of oxygen/blood is cut off long enough, you will die. Even if you don't die, it will possibly result in permanent brain damage. ",null,0,cdo18uy,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

The Galaxy Nexus simply stopped being supported as Google now has multiple devices to support, it has already supported it for a very long time, long past its prime, and the Galaxy Nexus is no longer a leading developer device.

Why porting Android to a device is a hassle is because it's not as simple as just compiling it against a certain version of the OS. Pretty much all of your time is spent making the kernel work properly with the new version of the OS. This can be hard since some of the code and features are proprietary and require either authorization or custom modifications from the companies that manufacture or design a component (like the GPU or WLAN chipset) for the device to even boot or support a new feature in the OS. Even if somehow all the pieces fall into place, and all the companies submitted brand new code with all the required modifications (or gave their code for Google to modify) it would still require extensive testing and polishing for a general release.

First of all, it is somewhat of a misconception that only men are susceptible to heart attacks.  It is true that more men fall victim to fatal heart attacks than women, but the disparity is not a big as most people think.  Some factors that influence this difference include eating and lifestyle habits between men and women, the size of the individual (often times bigger people require more effort from the heart to push blood and thus more fatigue and ware), size and composition of arteries where larger arteries found in men are more susceptible to atherosclerosis, inflammation and blockage. When it comes to symptoms, women posses a much larger tolerance to pain.

Heart attacks are caused by the heart not getting enough oxygen to itself, so parts begin to suffocate and die. 
Because the heart attack your step mum suffered from was not sudden and quick in duration, the symptoms she experienced were perhaps less intense, but prolonged.

Fairleee,"The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history - it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures, because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing - this universally agreed thing is called a standard. There are a number of different standards, and sometimes we don't have a single one. Consider something like transferring data between devices. The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer, but it isn't the only one - however, because it is so popular, most devices will have a USB port.

In terms of distance, these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do - basically, if we didn't have a standard system of measurement for length, then mass production of components couldn't exist, which would mean that we wouldn't be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform way.

The meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length. This is similar to the celsius system of temperature, which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system. However, the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough, or constant enough, to be fully acceptable. So, part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant. To measure time, a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom - I can't remember details off the top of my head. For distance, the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain (incredibly tiny) period of time.

As for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere, yes, there is! There is a prototype meter (kept in France, I believe), and a number of almost identical (with the tiniest, tiniest variations, and the variations of which are recorded) meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards. So basically, precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter. Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these, and so on, and so on. 

So, a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate, but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing. However, if you are doing a job that requires a very, very, very high degree of accuracy (such as precision engineering), then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration. And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the world.

Unfortunately, some people are intolerant to gluten.  This isn't an allergy, per se--allergies refer to a specific set of reactions (IIRC there are people who actually are allergic, but they are much more rare).  However, these gluten intolerant individuals do have a valid medical reason why they should not eat gluten.

There are also lots of people who are always looking for the latest health trend, though.  These are generally well-meaning people who are misguided.  They typically have a friend of a friend who is gluten intolerant who had some great health benefits from cutting gluten out of their diet, so they figure they ought to take the ""healthy"" step and cut it out from their diet, too!  This has all the logic of you getting transfusions when your friend has lost a lot of blood--getting a transfusion is a good move for them and has valid medical reasons, but it just doesn't make sense for you.

You haven't heard much about gluten intolerance because there simply hasn't been a lot of awareness until fairly recently.

TedTschopp,"TL;DR:  Van Gogh is considered good because he tricks you into thinking you are seeing a painting of a flower, when in reality you are looking at abstract brush strokes.

Let's take his [Irises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gogh,_Vincent_van_-_Irises_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) painting.  The reason he is so considered to be so good is that the painting above generates inside of people the impression of seeing a field of Irises while not actually using all the forms and colors of an actual purple [Irises](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BWtpA40ghG4/TaNyV4qcyCI/AAAAAAAAASk/6-5q4Rq2hHY/s1600/purple_irises.jpg).   

To see where this started; painters at one point were basically cameras and someone like Martin Johnson Heade produced a painting called [Birds and flowers](http://www.painting-analysis.com/oiseaux300.jpg).  Then people like Monet started to question this dogma with paintings like [Nympheas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nympheas_71293_3.jpg).  When Van Gogh and other painters at his time came around they pushed these questions harder and with more rigor than those before.  Following Van Gogh people like Picasso pushed this idea even further [Flowers in a Grey Jug and Wine-Glass with Spoon](http://www.artgalleryabc.com/images/stories/P/Picasso/picasso232.JPG).  In all of these images you get the idea and feeling of a flower and that is what an artist does.  Its not their job to reproduce a flower as it is seen.

i_accidently_reddit,"To understand this, we need to look at the history of writing in the west.

In the modern day western world, we use the Latin alphabet. The Romans however first wrote in Greek.

But maybe you know, just how much of a chip the Romans had on their shoulder about not being seen as as smart and as cultivated as the Greeks. So while Greek still was lingua franca in the Roman Empire, they got really obsessed with their own culture and language and tried very hard to make Latin the dominant language in the Mediterranean.

And of course, developing a own typography goes a long way in setting the two languages apart. This led to what we now know as the Latin alphabet, excluding J, W and U, and all upper case.

Seeing however, that it is quite tedious to write all those big capital letters all the time, the written language evolved into what is called a uncial script.

All the letters are still majuscules, but the beginning of a sentence or a important wort is capitalized. so essentially its smaller capital letters, if that makes sense?

Now this is were the fun part starts: typographers are a weird bunch of people, they are both artists and geometers. Back then, every written text was basically a piece of art, with the capitalised letters being carefully ornated, trying to reflect the tenor of the writing. And the typographer himself knows how the properties of some letters within the text, impact the whole synthesis of his art work.

And seeing that he has some sort of artistic freedom, he just cant allow a A, H or R to destroy the natural flow of text he is trying to convey.

Fun fact on the side: there are Latin papyri dating back to around the turn of the eras, that include lower case letters for the before mentioned a, h or r.

So from there on, it is basically just years and years (two thousand and counting) of improving on the given letters. And this is still happening, for example the upper case S used to have two lower case letters, "" s  "" and "" ſ "" which we got rid of basically just recently, in the beginning of 20th century. Or the english ""th"" used to be the a rune called thorn and fell out of favour in the middle ages.

For example the words ""PENNY"" and ""PENCIL"" are hard to differentiate quickly when they're all caps. However, ""Penny"" and ""Pencil"" are much easier due to the shape contrast of ascenders and descenders.

You're not aware of your surroundings, but you're aware enough to know when there's an edge near you, or a predator, and you move away. Incidentally, if you ever get the feeling like you're falling when you're going to sleep, this occurs in N-REM 2 where ""sleep spindles"" happen. A sleep spindle is a sudden massive burst of neural activity that usually jolts a muscle and wakes a person.

The real pain of braces is far less acute, and far more annoying-- when they replace the wire with something really stiff, she's going to get that awful ache as the new wire starts to bully her teeth in the right direction. It's not pain, just eternal uncomfortable pressure on your teeth.  (Actually, it lasts a few days after each wire-change.)

Good luck.  And tell her it's worth it.  And when it's over, tell her to wear her damn retainer! Teeth move of their own accord if you let them-- that's how they got this way in the first place.

Throne3d,"Speaking from past experience, braces which are not removable do not really seem to have sharp points on the individual brackets (the metal pieces glued to the teeth), except for on those brackets where elastic bands could be required (in my case it was the third tooth from the middle on both sides, on both the top and bottom of the mouth).

The wire, however, which is attached to / threaded through these brackets, is made of some sort of memory alloy which (when bent away from its ""set"" position) will try to bend back to what it was ""set"" to (the 'correct' shape of the mouth / layout of the teeth).

Sometimes the wire is not cut enough towards the back of the mouth where it pokes out at the end of the brackets, and is (usually) able to cut the inside of the mouth. If the gum scrapes along it (while chewing or speaking, for example), it is likely to damage the inner lining of the cheek. 

Alternatively, as the teeth move into position, the wire may end moving around in the braces (as it is not fixed into position, from what I can tell, but instead is kept close to the brackets by being enclosed). This could cause it to be fine when the orthodontist first puts the wire in, but then get worse as you go along (until the next time the braces are 'tightened' / rewired).

Oh, and as /u/Sunfried has mentioned - there are two main types of pain with braces, in my experience. A sort of ache which is usually worse just after them being rewired (and for a day or two afterwards), and the cutting pain which the ends of the wire cause. Just after I had my braces put on, however, the ache lasted for approximately a week, but was not as bad afterwards.

For example, after the 3rd tooth, all my bracers have hooks which are damned sharp. Those are used at a later stage in order to correct the whole jaw. Rubber bands are put on those hooks in order to exert pressure and correct the jaw.

To be honest, to say that no one has come up with a solution to the problem is bull crap. You just didn't research on the matter enough. When I did put my bracers, I was allowed to choose from multiple designs. I chose titanium, mini bracers which resemble the classic ones - just smaller. However, there were all sorts of other materials and designs. There was these ones made of some kind of a ceramic material, which was the same color as the teeth and the manifacturer claimed that they are way smoother. The most interesting ones where a type of bracers that were glued to the inside of your mouth, rather than the outside. Initially, I though of getting these, but my dentist told me that the classic design is the most efficient.

If your little girl suffers from the bracers, there is another clever solution - dental wax. You can get it from every drug store/pharmacy etc. It is a bit like chewing gum, but more dense and hard. You just take a bit from the dental wax, roll it into a ball and stick it to the the places that cause pain to your little girl. It's purpose is actually to smoothen the bracers so they dont tear the inside of your poor girl's mouth. This clever thing saved from countless of sleepless nights.

Good look to you and your little girl.

debman,"There are several parts to braces that can be sharp. The braces themselves, which may cause some irritation at first but her lips will get used to. The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth, like others have noted. However, they also have to be cut to fit her mouth— sometimes if the wire is too long, they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain. This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire, bending the tips of the wire, or using dental wax as others have suggested. I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself- it's a few cents to them, free to you, and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter. 


As to why it's metal, there are several other statements that essentially address the issue. The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth, yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire. Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheap—there simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility, cost, etc. Unfortunately, cutting metal leads to sharp edges, unless it's treated with something to smooth out the edge. As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out, they don't do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut.

restricteddata,"[The same question came up on here a day or two ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rf3m3/eli5_why_can_some_countries_decide_who_can_and/); here's what I wrote there:

In the early 1960s, the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb. Maoist China had just set one off, and was considered a pretty looney ""rogue state"" at the time (Cultural Revolution and all that), and was a mutual enemy to both. Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism, there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future, as opposed to the five that then existed (US, USSR, UK, France, China). They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence (e.g. once China has nukes, you can't threaten China with nukes without being threatened back), and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to all-out nuclear war (which neither the US or the USSR wanted).

But the problem is that they didn't want to give up their own nukes. They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation. Once a country has nukes, a whole new (potentially stabilizing) political order emerges. They didn't want to give that up, they just wanted to stop _new_ political orders (which they saw as destabilizing) from cropping up elsewhere. 

The countries without nukes, of course, were like, wait, you guys get nukes, but we don't? Lame. So they made the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) include sections that said that the so-called Nuclear States (the ones that already had them) would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well. This is Article VI, which states:

&gt; Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.

Well that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding. All of them are willing to say, ""sure, we'll get rid of our nukes if everyone else does"" but they all know that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So why would a non-nuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is? Not so much because of the disarmament clause, but more because the NPT also says that non-nuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of ""peaceful"" nuclear energy as well. So they get help with reactors and things like that, as long as they agree to safeguards that won't let them weaponize any of it. It's also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region — if everyone in, say, South America agrees to not get the bomb (and this is enforced by means of the NPT), then that means you don't have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get one.

In practice things have always been messier than that. For one reason, not everybody signed the treaty. There were _many_ non-signatories/non-ratifiers until the end of the Cold War. Among them were two of the named nuclear states (France and China, both of whom did help other states proliferate), and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear (Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa), as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear (i.e. Egypt, Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil).

rsdancey,"After WWII ended, the United States thought that there were only two options.  Either nuclear weapons needed to be turned over to an international agency for use only in the enforcement of collective security, or there would be unlimited proliferation leading in short order to a nuclear Third World War.

The civilian benefits of nuclear technology were overstated.  People thought that nuclear power generation would replace conventional power generation very quickly.  The potential of nuclear medicine was just being investigated but hopes were high.  So most countries wanted access to nuclear technology.

The problem is that nuclear reactors using uranium, the easiest and first technology available, produce plutonium as they operate.  That plutonium can be removed from spent fuel and reprocessed to make nuclear weapons.  There is no good way to allow unlimited nuclear power generation without creating a nuclear weapon proliferation risk.

Once the Soviet Union developed its own nuclear weapon, it was no longer possible for the US to imagine giving up its own weapons to an international body.  In the end, an international treaty was developed that traded the right of a country to operate nuclear reactors for the enforcement of rules that prohibited the development of nuclear weapons.  This treaty called on the powers that had nuclear weapons as of the date it came into force to eliminate those weapons ""as fast as possible"" so that eventually no nation would have nuclear arms.  Those countries were the US, the USSR, the UK, France and China.  Coincidentally, those countries are also the veto-wielding permananent members of the UN Security Council which, via the language of the nuclear weapon / nuclear power treaty serves as the arbiter and enforcer of that treaty.

A small number of countries have never signed the treaty, or have withdrawn from it, which is how India, Pakistan, North Korea and Isreal have built their weapons programs.  Technically they should face crippling economic sanctions and potentially military action to force them to comply with the treaty even though they are not signatories, but practically the decision has been made to enforce those penalties ad hoc or not at all.

The problem with the treaty is the danger of dual-use.  A country can remain within the limits of the treaty while preparing itself to make nuclear weapons.  It can create enriched uranium or extract plutonium up to a limit.  It can conduct research on the triggers and controlled explosions used in nuclear weapons.  And then it can break the treaty and ""dash"" for a weapon, trying to get the work done before it faces international consequences.  North Korea shows that once you have nukes you probably can't be forced to give them up.  This is why Iran is so worrisome.  They are following the classic path to use the legal limits of the treaty to position themselves for a quick sprint to a bomb.  In fact they have repeatedly violated the treaty,and been caught, which reinforces the world opinion that they are planning to make bombs.",null,2,cdnkqx7,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

Federal law enforcement officers cannot enforce state/town/city ordinances or laws. The opposite is true for local officers and federal laws. Additionally, most police officers enforce only criminal (statutory) laws, which is a small portion of the law as a whole. 

The laws that are enforced are usually agency and division specific. This means that the San Francisco Police direct the majority of their patrols to fight San Francisco-specific crime, whereas the California Highway Patrol focus on the highways that run through San Francisco and California, and the BART Police focus on crime occurring on the transportation systems of the San Francisco/Bay Area. Furthermore, different divisions of different agencies have different focuses. Examples are drug enforcement units, gang units, alcohol licensing units, etc. Individuals of those divisions will know their specific areas better than they would other laws.

For example, if you see someone snatching a purse and running away, you don't need to know the specifics of the law that was broken to respond, you know that a law was broken (don't get me wrong, you SHOULD). You can stop that individual/deal with the situation, and look up the most-specific charge afterwards.

TheRockefellers,"There are about a million ways of scoring tennis, but I'm assuming you're talking about what you see in the pros. Here's the big picture:

To win a tennis match, you must:

* Win a majority of the **sets** (best of 3 for women, best of 5 for men);

* To win a **set**, you must be the first to win **6 games**, and you must win by two; or if both sides are tied at 6 games each, they play a **tiebreaker** (a specific type of game) to win the set;

* To win a **game**, you must win four (or more) points, and **you must win by two points.**

Now, as for game scoring:

* 0 points = love

* 1 point = 15 (or sometimes called ""5"")

* 2 points = 30

* 3 points = 40

* A tie at 3 points or more = deuce

If both players reach deuce, we kind of stop keeping track of the total number of points, since all that matters at this point is winning by 2.  So at this time, you abandon your numbers. Instead, the score is:

* Deuce, if the players are tied (as noted above)

* ""Ad in"" or ""advantage in"" if the **server** has one more point than the receiver (in which case the server wins the game if he wins the next point)

* ""Ad out"" or ""advantage out"" if the **receiver** has one more point than the server(in which case the receiver wins the game if he wins the next point)

Also, before each point serve, the score will be announced. The order of the numbers matters; the first is the server's score, and the second is the receiver's.  So if you hear ""30-15,"" you know that the server has two points to the receiver's one.

So here's an example of a single game being scored between S (who's serving) and R:

* Game starts at 0 (love) all
* S wins the point; 15-0
* S wins the point; 30-0
* R wins the point; 30-15
* R wins the point; 30 all
* R wins the point; 30-40
* S wins the point; deuce
* S wins the point; Ad-In or Advantage S
* R wins the point; deuce
* R wins the point; Ad-Out or Advantage R
* R wins the point; R wins the game

Also within these rules there are a few aberrations.  For example, in Wimbledon, there is no tiebreaker in the final set of a match. You have to win by two games. This can result in some loooong matches, like the championship a few years ago, which lasted something like 11 hours.

TurtleHerder_,"Tennis is broken down into 3 components; These are points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games(usually 6), and games consist of points. It takes 4 points to win a game. The points however, have different names.
0 points= love
1 point=15
2 points=30
3 points=40
4 points=60
Once a player reaches 4 points, the game is over, unless the game was tied at 3 points a piece beforehand(ex:40-40). This occurance is referred to as 'deuce'. In this case you can only win this game by becoming 2 points ahead of them. Once a game reaches 'deuce', it stays in deuce until the 2 point margin is reached.
An example of an in-progress game score would be:
Player A has 3 points and Player has 2 points. Therefore, Game score=(A)40-(B)30.
If the game is tied, the score is followed by 'up'. Ex:15-up

Overall tennis matches are usually played best of 3(women) and best of 5(men) sets. In order to win a set, the player must win 6 games by at least a 2 game margin. Ex. 6-4.

afcagroo,"When a CPU reads an instruction, it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer. It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips ""Give me the information at this address"". It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus - high voltage means 1, low voltage means 0. The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion. It toggles some control pins to say ""Here ya go"" and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the 1s and 0s corresponding to that binary data. The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory. (This description is actually vastly simplified, but hopefully gets the idea across.)  
  
Similarly, the CPU (or other devices) can move data/instructions from the HDD into DRAM, or to/from network interface chips, etc. One thing asks for data stored in a particular set of locations, the other thing says ""OK, here it is"" and sends it, and the first thing (sometimes) says ""Thanks, got it!"". Or, something says ""I'm going to send you some information to store/work on"" and a similar handshaking goes on.  
  
All of this communication is built up in layers. The lowest layer that I described above, where voltages change to represent something, is called Layer 1, the physical layer.  Sometimes a ""1"" is sent via a high voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage simultaneously on two different wires.  There are lots of different ways to do it, and some are better for some uses than others.   
   
Higher layers define the protocol for decoding that information and deciding what it means and how to use it.   

These generic layers are described in the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). But there are various different bus protocols (SATA, PCIe, Ethernet, etc.), and to understand any one of them you'd need to read up on its specifics.   
  
Processors tend to have their own proprietary or semi-proprietary bus protocols for some things; this has been a recurring issue for companies like AMD who are trying to compete with the 500 pound gorilla in PCs, Intel. For other things (like DRAM) they tend to use protocols that the industry has agreed upon (like DDR3).  
   
Wireless communication adds a bit more complexity. Since things aren't connected with wires, information must be sent by modulating a radio signal. There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
One simple way is to use signalling. You can pulse the light on and off like [Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code, you can transmit information.  This is actually done in some fiber optic systems. (They don't use Morse code, and it is much much faster than a human could do. But it's the same general idea.) This technique isn't really used with radio broadcasts, though. 
  
Another way is to *modulate* the signal.  If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.    ",null,0,cdnjdst,1ricgj,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
lumpy_potato,"Depends. Are we talking wired or wireless?

Wired, its all just electrical signals representing binary digits, 0 and 1.

Lets say I have a chip that has 1 input and two outputs. The two outputs go to a red light and a green light.

When the input is off (0, no current) the red light stays on. When the input is on (1, current) the red light turns off and the green light turns on.

Electronics, when you get down to it, are a lot of red-light-green-light sort of operations, turning things on and off until you get the required output from a particular input.

With wireless, its the same thing, only you use some form of wireless medium - e.g. radio waves. You take your binary 0s and 1s and transmit it via radio, the same way you transmit music from an antenna to your car radio.

The receiver picks up the signal, decodes it, and turns it back into electrical 1s and 0s.

At the base of it all, its nothing but electricity (or light, in the case of fiber optics) representing 1s and 0s.",null,0,cdnjbog,1ricgj,explainlikeimfive,hot,1
OrangeCrack,"A cell phone is actually a radio -- an extremely sophisticated radio, but a radio nonetheless. 

Before cell phones, trucks would talk to each other using CBs, however, this was limited to the number of people that could talk at the same time due to the  range and the fact these typically only had about 25 channels. 

The genius of the cellular system is the division of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously.

In a typical analog cell-phone system in the United States, the cell-phone carrier receives about 800 frequencies to use across the city. The carrier chops up the city into cells. Each cell is typically sized at about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers).

Because cell phones and base stations use low-power transmitters, the same frequencies can be reused in non-adjacent cells. 

Here are the basics:

 - As you drive through the city areas are divided into cells
 - The cells read a unique ID on your phone to identify you and what carrier you are with.
 - If your ID matches that of the tower, you will be considered in your home network.
 -  Along with your ID, your phone also transmits a registration request, and the cell tower keeps track of your phone's location in a database -- this way, the tower knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone.
 - The cell tower gets the call, and it tries to find you. It looks in its database to see which cell you are in.
 - The cell tower picks a frequency pair that your phone will use in that cell to take the call.
 - The cell tower communicates with your phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use, and once your phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected. Now, you are talking by two-way radio to a friend.
 - As you move toward the edge of your cell, your cell's base station notes that your signal strength is diminishing. Meanwhile, the base station in the cell you are moving toward (which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies, not just its own one-seventh) sees your phone's signal strength increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each other through the cell tower, and at some point, your phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies. This hand off switches your phone to the new cell.

tl;dr - Your phone acts as a radio and cell towers communicate with your phone and each other to automatically transfer your call.",null,1,cdnjtsw,1rid4r,explainlikeimfive,hot,9

A sociopath is one who is affected with a personality disorder marked by antisocial behavior. A psychopath is a person with an antisocial personality disorder, manifested in aggressive, perverted, criminal, or amoral behavior without empathy or remorse. The two might sound the same to some, however the differences between sociopaths and psychopaths are very real.

Characteristics of a sociopath are as followed :

    Sociopaths are very charming.
    Sociopaths can be extremely manipulative and will try to con you whenever possible.
    Sociopaths feel that they are entitled to everything.
    Sociopaths will lie continuously to get what they want. They can even sometimes manipulate a lie detector.
    Sociopaths have no remorse, shame or guilt.
    Sociopaths will show love and happiness only when it serves their purpose. None of the feelings are genuine.
    Sociopaths have no room for love in their life.
    Sociopaths need to have excitement in their lives or live on the edge.
    Sociopaths have lack of empathy hen their victims suffer pain that they have caused.
    Sociopaths believe that they are all mightier than tho, there is no concern on how their behavior impacts others.
    Sociopaths usually have a long history of juvenile delinquency as well as behavior problems.
    Sociopaths will never take blame for anything they have done to anyone no matter if it is family or friend.
    Sociopaths have many sexual partners and tend to act out many sexual acts.
    Sociopaths rarely stay in one place for a long time (home/work).
    Sociopaths will change themselves if they know it will keep them from being found out.

Characteristics of a psychopath are as followed:

    Psychopaths use superficial charm to lure their victims.
    Psychopaths are extremely self-centered.
    Psychopaths must always do something to keep themselves from boredom.
    Psychopaths are very deceptive and tend to lie continuously.
    Psychopaths show no remorse of guilt towards their victims.
    Psychopaths are very predatory and usually will live off other people.
    Psychopaths have many sexual partners in their lifetime.
    Psychopaths are very impulsive with their lifestyle.
    Psychopaths are always blaming other people for their actions.
    Psychopaths never have a realistic view of their lives. (king of the world or from another planet)
    Psychopaths always want psychological gratification in sexual and criminal activities.
    Psychopaths tend to try suicide, rarely succeeding.

devodeevs,"Like one user said above, the DSM-IV does not list a diagnosis/criteria for ""psychopathy"". Antisocial Personality Disorder is the real disorder and most similar match to psychopathy. Additionally, see the Hare checklist for psychopathy here: http://www.arkancide.com/psychopathy.html 
This is not included in the DSM but was created as a test for psychopathy. Each criterion gets a score from 0-2 and all are added up to determine psychopathy.

Additionally, the following is a direct excerpt from an interview I did with Dr. Peter Langman for a research paper of mine about active shooters (Cho, James Holmes, Columbine shooters). He is the author of ""Why Kids Kill"" and is a leading expert on school shooters. He has an interesting perspective.

I asked:
Psychopathy has not been included in the DSM-IV. If you were to include psychopathy as a personality disorder in the new DSM-V, what would the criteria be? 

It's hard to say. In some ways, psychopathy seems like an extreme version of narcissistic personality disorder. One thing I might add as a possible criterion would be sadism, though this is not one of the traits Robert Hare includes in the Psychopathy Check List. Possible criteria might be extreme narcissism; disregard for rules, laws, social norms, the feelings of others, etc.; lack of guilt/remorse; meeting own needs at the expense of others; inability to engage in mutual relationships. Violence and criminal behavior would not be necessary for the diagnosis, but are often part of the picture.

The word ""psychopath"" tends to be more clearly defined in accordance with [Dr. Hare's checklist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_Psychopathy_Checklist), while ""sociopath"" is more up for grabs, so, while both words can be used differently by different groups, sociopathy tends to be the one more liable to a given groups own interpretation. There is no official definition for ""sociopath"" while there (kind of) is an official definition for psychopath, laid out by Robert Hare. 

Different groups will make their own distinctions but these distinctions are not official or universally accepted. A common one is to say that psychopathy is rooted in abnormalities of the brain while sociopathy is rooted in environmental causes. Sometimes a field or group will prefer one term and simply not use or define the other term. More often than not the terms can be and are used interchangeably.

While we're at it, sometimes both terms are used to refer to someone with Anti-social Personality Disorder, though this disorder is not synonymous with psychopathy in the sense that Robert Hare conceived it.

Every additional piece you add complicates the ability for the business to operate. Complexity is typically not good for manufacturing - simplicity is almost always cheaper.

In India, my grandfather has ownership of a steel mill. The mill used to have a forge area, a cutting area, a chemical treatment area, and an assembly area. All in a single compound. The chemical fumes from the area where they nickle plated piping would float all around the factory floor, so that the guys who were grinding and cutting away at the metal pieces would get a good strong whiff of it themselves.

There were minimal safety features involved (not uncommon for manufacturing work in India), but that is what made it possible - if you applied U.S. Health and Safety standards, every worker in the factory would need chemical protection for hands, body, feet, eyes, they would need masks, etc. This is huge expense for the guy whose only job is to cut the metal sheets as they come down the line.

That doesn't mean that chemical/processing/manufacturing plants don't have such agreements to move waste material around - they probably do, especially if there is a financial advantage to it. But I imagine there are regulations on that as well, and trying to sell the byproduct of factory 1 to factory 2 might end up complicated so much so by regulation that its cheaper to dump it than it is to sell/transfer it.",null,0,cdnk340,1rif4q,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
H335,"In addition the EPA regs now usually mandate that any infrastructure changes that are over a certain percentage of square footage, or dollar market value (or any of several criteria) require full environmental review and permitting and are treated as entirely new facilities. 

So essentially this means that to raze a smelter and combine it with a coke production facility would require them to get a full environmental review, permits, and mitigation plan for razing the smelter - which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars (to ELIMINATE a facility). Then to add on to the production facility the EPA and other agencies would treat it as new construction of BOTH plants, and require the full process for each. Again running into multiple millions of dollars for EACH facility.

This is why there haven't been hardly any new refineries built in decades, and why there are so many shuttered and abandoned industrial facilities rather than selling off the land.

The Act also prohibits possession of such knives on federal or Indian lands or on lands subject to federal jurisdiction. It does not prohibit the ownership or carrying of automatic knives or switchblades inside a state while not on federal property, nor does it prohibit the acquisition or disposition of such knives in an intrastate transaction or an interstate transaction that is noncommercial and/or does not substantially affect interstate commerce (as defined by recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court).

Schnutzel,"**Stack overflow**

Whenever you call a function, memory for that function is allocated in a place called the call stack. When the function completes its run, that memory is released. A stack overflow happens if too many functions are called, and there's not enough room in the stack (which has a hard size limit) to allocate more memory.

How can this happen? Look at the following code for example:

    int foo() {
        return foo();
    }

When you execute foo() for the first time, memory for it is allocated on the stack. But then the function calls itself - so memory is allocated again. The 2nd invocation of the function calls itself a 3rd time - and so on, to infinity (and beyond). Eventually the stack will run out of memory and the program will crash.",null,3,cdnm8mi,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,18
Schnutzel,"**Buffer overflow**

A buffer overflow when you try to write data into a buffer (an array), and the data exceeds the size of the array. For example:

    char buffer[8];
    scanf(""%s"", buffer);

The function scanf reads a string from the user into the buffer, which is 8 bytes long. However, scanf doesn't limit how many characters will be read - it will read until it's done (until a whitespace character is reached). So what happens if the user enters ""helloworld""? The first 8 bytes are written into the buffer, but the rest are written just outside the boundaries of the array.

Now one of three things can happen:

1. The overwritten memory can be unimportant, and nothing bad will happen (for example, the memory could have been used previously in the function but not anymore).
2. The program is not allowed to write to this memory, so it will report an error (and probably crash).
3. The worst case is that the memory being overwritten is important, but the program continues running. This allows the user to change parts of the memory they shouldn't normally have access to, which is a security flaw (thanks /u/BrQQQ for expanding on this!).",null,3,cdnmsqz,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,14

MEaster,"Buffer Overflow: Any random piece of data has a certain size. For example, an ASCII character is 1 byte. So if you have a string of 10 characters, you would need 10 bytes to store it. A buffer overflow would be when you write data past the end of this string overwriting other data.

Stack overflows are a bit more complicated. Firstly, a stack is a way of storing a list of data. It's what's known as a last-in-first-out list. Basically think of it as a stack of plates. You add data to the list by putting it on top of the stack, and then remove data by taking it off the top.

Another thing to explain is that in programming your code will generally be separated into subroutines. A subroutine will generally be things you want to do multiple times without having to rewrite it every time.

When a program enters a subroutine, it needs to keep track of where it came from so it can return. It does this by adding the current address to the stack before entering the subroutine. If you keep going into subroutines without returning the stack gets bigger.

In an operating system such as Windows, I believe each program has its own stack of limited size. If the operating system detects that the stack is full when the program tries to add something to it, then it will halt the program with a ""stack overflow"" error to prevent the program from causing problems.",null,1,cdnmnhf,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
RandomRobot,"The two can be combined or independent, depending on the context. A buffer overflow is very common in the C/C++ languages. It just means that you try to fit more data into a buffer than what it can holds. In those languages, you can access memory directly, so a string can be shown as 

    char myString[10];

If you try to copy more than 10 chars into it, then it will overflow. A stack overflow means that the data was on the stack when it overflowed, like in the previous example. However if you dynamically allocate memory, that memory will be on the heap, a large chunk of RAM that your program has access to. 

    char* myString = new char[10];

This string will be stored on the heap so when you overflow it, it will not be a stack overflow but a heap overflow, which is handled slightly differently by the program.

Overflowing the stack is especially bad since the program stores a lot of useful addresses on the stack, such as return addresses. If you carefully craft your 10+x chars, then you can potentially control the execution of the program. If your buffer was large enough, say... char[1000], then you could embed assembly code in the buffer and control the return address to execute the buffer. Those assembly codes are usually called shellcodes, because what an attacker want(ed, back in the days), was to get a shell, or a command line to the infected computer. There are whole books dedicated to this, how to write them and how to detect them.

Another way to generate a stack overflow is to call too many functions. The stack is a limited place, with around 1M (depending on tons of factors, such as your OS, your language, your compiler...). Recursion is a common mistake to generate a stack overflow like this.

    void func(){
      func();
    }

Those kinds of overflow are not as dangerous as the previous ones, first because they are easy to detect, even by just reading the code. The first execution will also crash fast. Secondly, the first kind of buffer overflow is more tricky to detect and an overflown buffer might not cause any problem to the execution of the program, while leading an attacker to complete control of your machine.

There is a very good tutorial about buffer overflows and how to execute arbitrary code with it called [Smashing the stack for fun and profit, by Aleph One](http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=49&amp;id=14).

Modern OS such as Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 have built in protections against those attacks, since they are so dangerous and difficult to avoid. A common protection is a canary on the stack. It means that the OS puts a special, magic value at strategic places on the stack. After some instructions, the OS checks if the magic value has changed. If it has, then the stack was smashed and some kind of error is returned to the user.

There are other kinds of attacks that are directed toward the heap overflows, but they are more difficult to execute properly.",null,0,cdnv0ez,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,1
kyz,"The implications:

""The stack"" is some memory that keeps track of where you are in the computer program. Every time you call another function, it saves your current state on the stack, and where to come back to.

The called function runs, and when it finishes, it restores the state to before you made the call (stored on the stack) and jumps back to just after the call instruction (also saved on the stack).

If you *run out* of stack, the program simply has to stop running. Where can you store the details of the next function call? Nowhere, you're outta space! The OS has to abort the program.

However, there's something worse. Imagine you take input from the user, and put it into space located *on the stack*. What if the user tricks you into putting more data there than there is space for?

... it means that the end user gets to control what's on your stack. They get to overwrite it with whatever they like. They now control the *state* of your program. They get to control *where your program will go to* once the next function returns.

If it's easy enough to guess *where* the stack is (if it's at a predictable location, like it used to be before [address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) was promulgated), you can tell the program to jump to... the stack data itself, which is something you, the attacker, have control of thanks to the buffer overflow. This is called **[smashing the stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smashing_the_stack)** (for fun and profit). The stack data which is actually code is called ""[shellcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode)"".

So now you have *complete* control of the program. Just from supplying input to a program, you have made it start running your own code, and you get to take on the privileges it had and access the resources it has.

One fix against this (as well as ASLR and not writing exploitable code) is to mark the stack memory as ""[No eXecute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit)"", which means that if the CPU is told to run code on the stack, it will immediately end your program.

One of the big advantages a multicore processor has is that power management becomes easier.  If a core isn't needed, it can be (mostly) powered down. That's not as valuable for a desktop PC, although it does help with thermal management. Different cores can also be run at different frequencies, which also helps with power management.  
  
Some smartphone chips are even more wild. They can use a mix of some very small, wimpy cores and larger, more powerful cores.  This can really help optimize how much power is used.

Chances are that if you are arrested and want to bring up entrapment, its going to be very situation specific, taking into account a lot of context and investigation to figure out if the police/agents involved in the arrest provided too much pressure, to the point where the intent was more strongly influenced by the government, rather than the accused's actual predisposition to commit the crime.

Edit Edit Edit: Lots of scenarios - guys, look, when it comes down to it, if you are arrested by an undercover cop, its going be centered around how you defend yourself in trial. You have to prove that you simply would not have done it if it were not for the pressure on you, and it has to be believable. You have to convince the judge, or the jury, or both, that you were coerced. Whatever scenario, tip, trick that you have, when it comes down to it, if you're arrested, then its all up to how you defend yourself and how much proof you can bring to the table.

I'm going to explain this like you're all 5, so please hold onto your hats folks. 

**What is entrapment?**

Entrapment is an illegal act by authority figures to MAKE people do bad things (Illegal). An example of this would be: An undercover Police Officer begging a person (Not a drug dealer in this case, just for example's sake) to sell them drugs. This person, who actually just so happens to have drugs, repeatedly refuses the Officer's requests, until he finally gives in just to shut him up. The Police Officer then arrests the person for drug trafficking, takes the ""offender"" to court, and then has to duck as a Judge throws his little mallet at him for entrapping some poor person. 

**Entrapment is the act of reasonably forcing a person to commit a criminal act they would not have otherwise done.**

Understand that so far? Good. Now. What the general problem is, people don't have a basic grasp of what entrapment isn't. Entrapment IS NOT:

- Being an undercover hooker.

- Operating a child porn website

- Being a drug dealer. 

""But why, internet anon? Surely, the Police are luring these poor, innocent people to their doom!"" LOL. No. See. Get this: People suck, and actively seek these things out. And when they do, it's no longer entrapment. That John looking to get his dick wet with undercover Suzie? He willingly tried to solicit her. Yes, she could have asked, and all he had to do is say no and go on his merry way, and he wouldn't be handcuffed. Uncle Robert getting his door knocked down in the middle of the night by the FBI? No one FORCED him to watch little kids get fucked on the internet, he was looking for it. Your dumbass friend Marley who asked the wrong guy for drugs? He shouldn't have been asking ANYONE for drugs. Nor should he have accepted any offers.

**ENTRAPMENT IS: LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCING SOMEONE TO COMMIT AN ILLEGAL ACT, OR PRESSURING THEM INTO AN ILLEGAL ACT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE COMMITTED.**

**ENTRAPMENT IS NOT: PLAYING UNDERCOVER HOOKER ARRESTING EVERY JOHN, DICK, AND JOE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR POON. IF PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO COMMIT CRIMES AND THEY STUMBLE ACROSS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER, THEY'RE SHIT OUT OF LUCK**.

Additional fun fact: Undercover officers can do nearly anything to keep their cover, just short of killing someone (Presumably, they might actually). No, they don't have to admit they're cops just because you asked. Yes, they will deal drugs and kick you in the face. With undercover agencies, the ends justify the means.

He tells the man to go to the dealer around the corner and buy some meth. Father does so, and the dealer happens to be a cop as well. Father is arrested.

This is entrapment, because had the police officers not set up this scenario, Father never would have made the purchase. As well, the officers lied and they used a random civilian.

He also came home to find the babysitter left earlier than she was supposed to, and that Mother's maxed out the credit cards for the fifth month in a row.

neanderthalman,"Simplest terms with some inaccuracy - atomic nuclei are made of little particles called protons and neutrons. The protons themselves are made up of quarks. The quarks are held together by the strong force, to make the protons and neutrons, and the protons and neutrons are also held together by the strong force to make the nucleus.

The weak force is tougher to explain, but one thing that it does is keep a quark 'stable'. Quarks can change 'color', which can in turn change a proton into a neutron, or a neutron into a proton. In doing so it will release energy in the form of an electron or positron, which is ejected from the nucleus as radiation.",null,1,cdnmpfi,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,hot,3
Infinite_Ambiguity,"The strong and weak nuclear forces are two of the four fundamental universal forces.  As you mentioned, the other two fundamental,universal forces are electromagnetism and gravitation.  There are many interesting theories about why we have four and how they started, including that they all,started as one combined fundamental force and separated over time after the Big Bang.  

In any event, the strong nuclear force allows for the otherwise counter-intuitive formation and integrity of an atomic nucleus.  An atomic nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons, but gravitation doesn't operate a sub-atomic scales (and is a very weak force in any event) while electromagnetism says that protons should repel each other in such close proximity and prevent any atomic nuclei from forming.  Obviously, without atomic nuclei forming, we would not have anything we see, including life forms. So, the strong nuclear force is what overcomes electromagnetic repulsion among protons and allows atomic nuclei to maintain structural integrity and thereby for atoms, molecules, and things we see.  The strong nuclear force is very strong, but only within very short distances (such as atomic scales).  So, in summary, the strong nuclear force is what holds atomic nuclei together allowing the formation of atoms and obviously molecules by extension.  

The weak nuclear force allows for radioactive decay. It is different from and weaker than the strong nuclear force.  The crucial practical effect of the weak nuclear force is that it allows for nuclear fusion within stars. Nuclear fusion within stars is essential for fueling the stars and for ultimately allowing for the formation of the higher elements.  ",null,1,cdnn7on,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,hot,3

Pandashriek,"This pretty much depends on the spaceship.Usually, those rocket engines contain not only fuel, but oxygen also as this allows a detonation to take place and power the rocket in the respective direction. Technically, if you take a shuttle with its rocket engines still attached to its hull, teleport it into deep space, tore open the rocket engines and light the match you will witness some great fireworks. Those tanks will provide enough oxygen for the fuel to ignite and explode.

As for implosions - those are impossible to occur on a space ship. The fact that the Cosmos is a vacuum means that there is no pressure, which means that there is no force being exerted on the ship, making it implode. Actually, the main force being exerted on the ship is coming not from the outside, but the inside. The ship is actually a pressurized container and all that pressured air tries to escape in space. This is the reason why when a rupture occurs, everything is sucked out into space - you should've seen it in the movies and that is actually true.

Things that do implode very oftenly are stars. However, they collapse because on themselves due to the huge ammount of weight that is being exerted. However - this is another story.",null,0,cdnndj6,1rinpb,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

Anthropophagite,"You have to remember, most things in the movies are using technology far more advanced than our own. The Death Star was a massive space station the size of a moon. The power core was large enough for ships to fly in. Most things in the movies use exotic means of power. Take Star Trek for instance, they use anti-matter generators, warp cores, singularity cores, and other exotic things like that. It's not unlikely that the explosions seen in Star Trek are realistic to some point. Most explosions are caused by either a warp core breach, self-destruct, or from the detonation of a photon/quantum torpedo. For comparison a quantum torpedo is rated at roughly 1380 gigatons; a asteroid that passed at 38 lunar distances yesterday had 231 gigatons of energy. The secondary means of self-destruct on a Federation ship is the detonation of explosives around the ship. This is equivalent to 1,500 photon torpedoes, or roughly 42000 gigatons. Strangely enough, a warp core breach is rated at 100 megatons. One would think such an advanced engine capable to bend space would create a larger explosion. One would only need to look at our own test of nuclear devices in space to imagine what would a much larger one would look like. Without the shock wave, most of the energy would most likely vaporize everything within the explosive radius.

As for your second question it becomes trickier to use sci-fi as a resource. Assuming a hull breach occurs then the atmosphere in the section would vent and assuming the section seals itself, not much else would happen. You would merely have a section of the ship that was exposed to space. I believe most of the explosions seen in sci-fi is caused by a hull breach occurring in a place near a critical (explosive) component, such that whatever has pierced the ship has also pierced and compromised the component. Explosive decompression is also a possibility, but how likely it is I don't know.

Say, how about a bit of food for us?"" attitude, amonst other things like ""coal tunnels"" under the demilitarized zone.  
Still, what entitles anyone to screw with a souvereign nation just because they don't like their way of handling things?

* China. China doesn't want war for several reasons, the least of those is because they actually like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They have actually told the US ambassador how annoyed they are by the childish sabre-rattling of then still Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il, as illustrated in correspondence somewhere in the Wikileaks documents. It is highly unlikely China would actually perform a military intervention if the DPRK started hostile actions, their main focus is having a buffer zone between them and the pro-US ROK, even if it means occasionally supporting a crazy dictatorship at huge losses. China wouldn't mind a change of regime as long as the two Koreas stay apart.

* The DPRK basically has held Seoul hostage for decades. They have hundreds of long-range artilleries and rocket artilleries aimed at the city constantly ready to fire. The ROK knows basically every bunker's position and can retaliate and destroy them but that still means several volleys hitting a major population centre, even if said city is riddled with bunkers. Although Seoul is full of Chinese diplomats, CEOs, important politicians and their kids so the DPRK probably screws itself over with that bombardment.

* War. War is hell. The DPRK may be under-equipped, under-trained, with fuel reserves for a few months at best and material mostly made up of handed-down Soviet stuff and some of their own but that doesn't mean they can't drag it out into bloody genocide before they surrender. Their Navy is crap from the 60s and in direct battle could probably be dealt with by a single Ohio-class sub, their pilots get about 20 hours of flight training a year in old equipment because of constant fuel shortage, conscriptees and partly even professional soldiers can't be properly equipped because they lack enough weapons for everyone and their supply chain is so ineffective and train-reliant it's ridiculously easy to completely obliterate.  
*But* they have vast hidden bunker systems, thousands of defensive structures with well-equipped artillery bunkers and hidden explosive charges all over their south border, territorial advantage and a big pool of dedicated and indoctrinated infantry (plus 5-10 times that in general population reserves) that will fight to the last man if necessary. And even if they don't use nukes, which would be foolish as even China would immediately get to business on them, they have one of the biggest arsenals of chemical and biological weaponry in the world and are quite capable of deploying it via rocket artillery over several hundred kilometres.

&gt;1. The special virtues of the American people and their institutions;

&gt;2. America's mission to redeem and remake the west in the image of agrarian America;

Mooi_Weer,"The most used anesthetic in surgery is propofol, 

Propofol works by making it harder for your nerves to transfer signals. If your nerves don't transfer signals you won't feel pain, can't move, are not conscious and you don't make memories. 

Propofol can make your nerves stop transferring signals through (at least) two pathways.

1. Neurons (the cells that are (mostly)your nerves) communicate with each other through neurotransmitters. There are neurotransmitters that make a nerve cell send a signal, but there are also neurotransmitters which prevent a neuron from activating. Propofol makes your nerves more susceptible to an inactivating neurotransmitter called GABA. By doing this it makes sure signals don't go from neuron to neuron. 

2. To transfer a signal through a single neuron, an electrical charge must pass through it. A resting neuron has a portential (voltage) between the inside and outside of the cell of ~-70mV when activated this is raised to about ~+40mV thereby sending an electrical signal through the cell. The potential goes form -70 to +40 by opening sodium (Na+) channels which makes Na+ flow into the cell increasing it's potential. Propofol blocks these channels making it impossible for neurons to transfer a signal. 

So basically neurons are less able to send send to other neurons and are less able to send information through the neuron itself.

lumpy_potato,"/r/buildapc  is a nice community :)

Anyways, here is how I break down the basics whenever I'm going into a PC Build:

* CPU - the brains of the outfit. While most modern CPUs are plenty powerful, there is something to be said for picking quality AMD/Intel processors for your gaming needs
* Motherboard - tied closely with the CPU. Newer motherboards act like the nervous system of the computer, tying everything together. High quality or new motherboards often have newer features, better speeds, etc.
* RAM - the memory (well, fast memory) - the more the better, but you aren't going to be hamstringed if you only have 4/8GB. for gaming 8GB is good enough for most applications
* Hard Drive - this is where your long term storage is. Size is good, speed is also good - SSDs are fast, but storage is expensive. traditional hard drives are big, but not as fast. There are some hybrid models out there - go with what you can afford first, you can always upgrade later
* Power Supply - you can't run a computer without power. Gaming requires juice, and i've rarely seen a gaming PC with less than a 600W power supply, especially with the newer high-end video cards. If you can afford a big PSU, you might as well future proof yourself. Look for good warranties on these puppies, they can burn out on you!
* Case - where you store all your PC crap. A good quality case is easy to install components into, has good airflow, fans, and usually looks aesthetically pleasing. My Antec 900 was my favorite gaming case, and it survived a UPS cross-country kickball match to NYC, keeping the internals of the computer mostly intact. 
* Video Card - now is where things get interesting. You need good card to game. Mid-range will last you, but sometimes there is something to be said for buying high. I like to buy one generation back, and the highest possible where I can. Some people argue this is stupid because graphics cards come out practically yearly, but for me, I keep components for 2-5 years at a time, so if I don't buy high, it might cause problems in the future.

Memory (aka RAM): Short term storage with a faster access time than the hard drive. If an application needs more space than you have RAM for, it will run a lot slower as it has to grab data from the disk instead.

Pandashriek,"First, a bit of introduction: Voltage is measured in volts, current is measured in amps, resistance is measured in ohms and power in watts.

Watt is the actual power an electrical unit, lets say a light bulb, consumes. The higher the watts, the more power is needed to feed the unit. Engines power is also measured in watts - 1 horsepower being around 700 watts.

As for volts, ohms and amps - water pipes are a good analogy. The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure, the current is equivalent to the flow rate, and the resistance is like the pipe size.

I hope that it makes more sense now. I am not so familiar with electricity and if you want a more detailed explanation, I'd suggest asking wikipedia or googling the topic. ",null,0,cdnolc3,1ritvw,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
meldyr,"Usually people start using the water analogy. I have a couple of problems with it.

1. You have positive and negative charges. That would be the equivalent of water particles with positive and negative mass.

2. Current goes in circles (at least in circuit theory). Water doesn't do that necessarily.

3. Usually they say voltage is height or pressure. The problem is that voltage is just energy. It is thus a little bit of both, that can complicate the thinking sometimes.


**Charge**

Particles can have a charge. You have positive and negative charged particles. Two particles with the same charge repel each other. Two particles with an opposite charge attract each other.  Charge is expressed in Coulomb. E.g: An electron has a charge Q=1.9x10^-19 C.

Q is the symbol of charge and C is the symbol for Coulomb.

**Current**

Charged particles can move. If charged particles move through a wire you have current. Current tells how much charge goes through a wire in an instant of time.

If 1 Coulomb of charge travels to a wire in 1 second you have a current of I = 1C/s =1A

Where I is the symbol of current and A the symbol of Ampère/Amps.

**What is voltage**

An electrical particle causes an electrical field. Suppose you have a non-moving electrical charged object. Let's call it object A. 

If you bring another electrical charged object close to it. (This is object B). Object B starts to move. Object B starts to gain speed. You could say that just because B is put on a given start position it has some kind of energy. When it starts moving that energy is converted in kinetic energy (energy because it gains speed).

The voltage represents the electrical energy that particle has because it is on in that position in proportion to its charge. To every position in space we can assign a voltage V.

V = E/Q

Where V is the voltage, E is the energy an electrical particle would have on that position and Q is the charge of that particle. 

E.g:
Suppose the object B has a  charge Q=1C. Because of being at that place it has an energy of E=1J. We say that on that place the voltage V=1J/C=1V.

Note that the first V represent the voltage. And the second V stands for Volts.
.
**Resistors**

In this [figure](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/OhmsLaw.svg) you see that on the top is a high voltage called V^+  and on the bottom we have a low voltage (V^- ).

We know from the previous section that a charged particle that is in the high-voltage area will flow down to the low voltage area and gain speed. The problem is that it doesn't go that simple.

When the particle goes down it has to travel trough a resistor and the particle will bump against a lot of other things. How more things that it will hit when going through the resistor the slower the current will flow.

We can characterize a resistor by using Ohms Law.

V=I.R

If the Voltage difference over the resistance is 6V and the current I=2A the resistor has a resistance of 3 Ohm.

**Watts**

Previous I explained that a charged particle has trouble to go trough a resistor. 

The particle will lose speed as it goes trough the resistor. This means that the particle lose energy. Because the current runs in a circle we can assume that at any place the speed of the particle should be the same. (The kinetic energy doesn't change)

So the amount of energy that is lost in the resistor equal to 

E=V*Q

Where V is the voltage and Q the amount of charge that went trough the resistor.

If we want to know how much energy we use for a given time instance we can do the following. (dividing trough a time t).

P=E/t = V*Q/t= V*T

P is the power that is lost in the resistance. The power is expressed in Watts. 

**Buying a light bulb**

* Voltage: The light bulb is designed for a given voltage and the wires in your house provide that given voltage. (So nothing to worry about)

* Power: This is the amount of watts. The more power it uses, the higher your power bill will be. On most light fixtures you can find something like 53W. In that case you should put a light bulb in it that consumes less than 53 Watt.  If your light bulb consumes more power than your light fixture can provide you could damage/burn your fixture. 

* Light Intensity: The more Lumens (L) the more light it gives. Don't assume that because a light bulb uses more power it will produce more light. 

* Color Temperature: It is expressed in Kelvin (K). But it's tricky, what scientists call a low color temperature describes colors which normal people would describe as warm. So if you buy a light-bulb choose one that has a low co lour temperature to keep your house cozy. If your light color is too high you will have an unpleasant hospital-like light. A right choice depends on the atmosphere you want in the room. I wouldn't go above 4500K.

**Buying a microwave**

Here you have to be careful. You have two times a number in watts which describes different things.

* Power consumption: the microwave consumes 1100 Watt. (This is the number that ends up on your bill).

* Microwave Power: this is how much of the power is actually used to heat your food.

An average microwave oven uses about 1100 Watt to provide 700 Watt microwave food. If you buy a microwave oven you should check that it provides enough microwave power and the efficiency.

**Buying a generator**

For a simple generator you shouldn't mind the voltage. (It produces the same voltage as a power plug).

Power: The more power it can produce (In Watts). The more electrical appliances it can support at the same time.

Efficiency: How much fuel it needs to create one Watt. Sometimes given in liter/Watt, sometimes just given as a number. (Note: don't compare these two different numbers.)

**TL:DR; The power in Watts you see on your appliance ends up on your bill. Something that gives power (e.g: a light fixture) has a maximum power it can supply. Don't attach anything to it that uses more power or you might break something**

Long answer:
We weren't always at the top of the food chain. Once upon a time, the ancestors of mankind had to stroll around in the steppe and woodlands of Africa scavenging for food or sneaking up on some large and slow animal to kill it with a rock or maybe a spear.

Imagine doing that when coloured in a bright purple. It attracts a lot of (unwanted) attention, as if screaming ""I am here! Please eat me, oh large predators of Africa! I taste oh *so great*!""

drunquasted,"It's not really the eye movement that is important. REM is just a side effect of dreaming, which is the important process. Our eyes move around quickly while we dream because our real eyes actually follow what we're looking at in our dreams. As for why dreaming is important, there are many theories as to why this is the case. For one, dreaming is pretty well correlated with memory consolidation. So a person who doesn't get much sleep, or doesn't dream, is likely to not retain knowledge gained the previous day, which is why sleep is so important to students, and why pulling all-nighters is a terrible idea. It's also been found in animal studies that if an organism is completely deprived of REM sleep for too long, it will simply die. It's not well understand why REM deprivation causes death, or even if this would be the case in humans (since such a study would be unethical). It's actually pretty amazing how little we still know of sleep, and why we need it, but there's a lot of fascinating literature on the topic, and I definitely encourage anyone to spend a bit of time looking into it, if only because it's so interesting",null,0,cdnpxy6,1riwaj,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

PasswordEqualsDog,"&gt;Do animals with poor oral structure die quickly, and we're less likely to see them?

That's it. They are more likely to die because (severely) crooked teeth make fighting, eating and holding things with your mouth (think dogs) a lot harder. Also, malformed teeth are more likely to break and cause infections. That means they don't get to live as long as ""normal"" animals and don'T have as many babies. (evolutionary success) 

Humans only have them because we grew less dependent on our teeth as tools. I never had to kill my meal with my teeth and I am quite happy about that. Especially because I needed braces.

Also, in the good ol' times, before the invention of braces, you where maybe a bit less like to have sex with crooked teeth. However, since the invention of tools to fight the misalignment of teeth and universal healthcare ""they"" have a fair chance of reproducing.

It all comes back to [Wolff's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff's_law), which states that chronic strain on a muscle causes the bone(s) to which it's attached to become stronger. 

Over time (especially since the agricultural revolution), the human diet has become *much* softer. Our ancestors used their jaw muscles a lot more than we ever do. Going back to Wolff's law, this means that their jaws adapted to that use and became larger, stronger and (most importantly) wider than ours, meaning that their teeth actually had room to come in straight.

Vox_Imperatoris,"No. What you are saying is referred to as the idea that the world is a **zero-sum game**.

A negative-sum game is one where the total value of the players' assets is less than it was before the ""game"" was played. War, for example, is negative-sum: one side may end up better off than it was before, but the total wealth is less. All of the dead soldiers, and the production of (now) useless tanks, bullets, and bombs is a loss. If one side ends up better, it is only because the other side got *really screwed*.

A zero-sum game is one where the total value of the players' assets is the same as it was before the ""game"" was played. A poker tournament is a zero-sum game. Everyone buys in at $50, and gets 50 chips in front of him at the beginning. After the tournament is over, one guy has all the chips and wins.

A positive-sum game is one where the total value of the players' assets is more as it was before the ""game"" was played. A market economy (including the modern global economy) is a positive-sum game. Some individuals and countries get richer. Some may even end up poorer than they were before, if they make poor choices. But overall, the total wealth is greater than it used to be.

If China gets richer, it does not hurt countries in Africa. In fact, it makes it easier for them to modernize, since all of the goods they need are now cheaper than ever.

The only sense in which one country getting more powerful hurts other countries is in a *relative sense*. For example, after WWII, every other country was smashed, but the U.S. was untouched. Americans were vastly richer than even Western Europeans. Later, Western Europe caught up, but it was not because Americans got poorer. Europeans just got richer, too.",null,2,cdnqfoo,1riyx7,explainlikeimfive,hot,5
Infinite_Ambiguity,"Not necessarily, but possibly.  Assume that each nation is actually one person for simplicity.  

If I (representing my nation) walk into your house (representing your country), put a gun in your face, and take all of your stuff, then I'm necessarily richer and you are necessarily poorer.  There are also external effects on people who become aware of this event, but we can ignore them for purposes of your question.  This is a case where my wealth increase correlates precisely with your wealth decrease. 

However, assume that I walk into your house and offer you to sell you a car for $10,000 and you agree.  Assuming that's the car's actual fair market value, then neither of us are better off at all, but we're both in the same positions at that transaction's moment.  But then, I take that $10,000, invest it, and get $20,000 back from the investment.  I've now increased my wealth by $10,000 while you haven't lost anything.  And, presumably, my investment has also benefitted third-parties who are also better off also without you losing anything.  

Now, further assume that you use the car to get a lucrative job that would have been too far away for you to take in the absence of having an affordable and reliable car, which I sold to you.  This new job pays you much more than anything you had before, and so your wealth increases without diminishing my wealth. Presumably, your employer has also benefitted from your labor too in amount that exceeds your cost to the employer.  And let's say you then leverage this job into even better jobs while also accumulating investment capital, which further enriches you.  

In this second scenario, I'm richer, the recipients of my investment are richer, you're richer, your employer is richer, and the recipients of your investments are richer -- and nobody is poorer.  

These same scenarios with an infinite number of permutations happen every day at national and international levels.  These free, voluntary, and consensual transactions -- overall -- lead to better aggregate wealth results for all, assuming full information, zero coercion, and zero fraud. Obviously, there are individual exceptions, but the system overall -- with inherent disadvantages that we work to minimize -- seems to be the best devised and implemented as a practical matter. 

So, if there's force, coercion, trickery, or violence, then one nation's wealth will probably come at the expense of the other nation's wealth.  With free, consensual, voluntary, and informed trade, then it's likely that all participants will benefit (although it's unlikely that they would benefit in exactly the same amounts).

Le_Squish,"Oooo me..me!

I grew up in a movie theater and I think more detail about the process required.

Everyone makes a lot of money but who gets it all depends on how well the movie does. 

There are a lot of people paid up front for their services. 
Many of these people are technical/support and are often paid at a flat rate but depending on their talents might be able to negotiate royalties. 

Actors, producers and directors often receive their pay in a combination of flat pay and royalties over-time. Even if the movie flops, they already get some cash. This is why this group has to negotiate, because if the movie does really well you don't want to have worked for too cheap and screwed yourself out of ass tons of cash. 

Next we move to the theaters and producers. 
For theaters deciding what movies to show are a gamble. Producers don't take a flat cut of sales. They take different percentages over time and these percentages vary from company to company. 

A producer will present a movie they want to distribute to the theater operators. The producer may ask for something like 80% cut of the profits for the first 2 weeks of box office receipts and then maybe bring it down to 50% later. (random imaginary numbers). The theater owner then looks at the movies being offered and tries to ascertain how long the movie will stay popular or if it will be popular at all. If theaters think the movie is too risky and turn out will be poor they haggle down the price or refuse to show the movie in their theater. Now that the terms have been decided, theaters have to pay up front to purchase rights to show the movie. Then they hope to god that they movie will be popular for more than 2 weeks because they won't really be making any money before that time period. 

So now the movie premiers and the producers starts to make bank. The first weekend is the most important because that is when studios mop up the biggest cut of ticket sales. 

2 weeks pass, movie is still popular and now the theater can mop up without the huge cut going to the producers. if it turns out to be a movie popular as long as the Avengers, theaters will make ass tons of money on top of their concessions that is their primary source of income. 

But what if the movie flops immediately?
The reputation of the all the people that made/starred/worked in the movie is diminished and you lose your bargaining power with the theaters and hence can loss access to key markets. 
The producer absorbs the loss. 

If the movie flops later, the theater takes most of the loss. Sometimes people lose interest in a movie after a week of it being out. The theater next time will be wary of this producer and probably negotiate a shorter run and less seating for that producer as well as a larger piece of the profits.

_The_Editor_,"To expand on what /u/squeevey said a little:

Broadly speaking - When fluid flows through a pipe (or straw in this case), the driving force is a pressure difference between one end and another; from high pressure, to low pressure.

When liquid is flowing vertically upwards, the pressure difference between the two ends of the pipe (high pressure at the bottom, low pressure at the top) has to work against the weight of the liquid in the pipe itself.. Thus for taller pipes, the water flows more slowly...

When you suck liquid up a straw, you create a ""low pressure"" zone in your mouth. The glass itself is open to the air, so the pressure on the fluid there is [atmospheric pressure.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure)

The problem is that atmospheric pressure isn't all that high for a ""high pressure"" zone, and the very minimum pressure achievable is absolute 0 (a.k. perfect vacuum). The difference in pressure between atmospheric and a perfect vacuum is only enough to draw water up 31.7 feet.. Unless you supply more pressure at the base that is!",null,0,cdns52a,1rj4n5,explainlikeimfive,hot,4
squeevey,"When you are sucking fluid up a straw, it's not actually you sucking UP the fluid, but sucking out the air.  The fluid goes up the straw because the outside air is pushing down on the fluid in the container. 

Now, if you have a 32ft straw, there is only enough outside airpressure to push the liquid up the straw, before the liquid is too heavy to go any higher.  It will almost make it to your mouth.

This prevents the water from boiling, even when the pressure goes negative! Water is evaporated from the pores, but the holes are so small that surface tension doesn't break, maintaining several atmospheres of negative pressure. This pulls water up to replace it, over 100 meters (330 feet) in the tallest trees.

AyCarrumba,"Stereoscopic vision is only one component of how we perceive depth, and not even aparticularly good one! Because our eyes are closely spaced, it's only really good for close depth perception. Combined with convergence (How much our eyes have to look towards one another to focus on a close object) these ""binocular"" methods of depth perception are really only effective out to about 10 metres.

Monocular methods of depth perception that don't depend on having two eyes include:

* Parallax - things move relative to one another as out point of view changes

* Relative size - smaller things are further away, example in a field of cows

* Familiar size - Ships are big, dogs are middle sized, insects are small. We know this.

* Perspective: Line converge to a point which indicates the size of an object.

* Occlusion: If one object passes in front of another, blocking our vision of it, we have perception of their relative size and so distance.

* Defocus Blur: As our point of focus shifts, different ""depths"" are resolved in and out of focus by the eye. This gives important depth information.

* Distance to horizon. In a natural landscape, the closer something is to the horizontal horizon, the further it is away. This is a function of our elevation above ground level.

There are more...

So, as you can see, our depth perception is NOT limited to ""stereoscopic vision"". We use many subtle effects to judge depth. One of the reasons 3D cinema can be nauseating or confusing is because it uses simple binocular effects to ""brute force"" our perception of 3D, which is uncomfortable when other queues are  mis-placed in the footage we're viewing.",null,5,cdnvtoc,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,hot,29

Rakaicius,"I'll take a crack at this one.  

The brain uses several different cues for judging distance, some of which only require one eye.  

- if object A is partially covered by object B, our brain assumes B is closer than A.  
- the more detailed we see something, the closer we think it is.  This is why studies have shown people tend to underestimate distances in foggy conditions
- our brains already have an idea of the size of familiar objects due to past experiences.  
- objects closer to the horizon appear bigger because we assume it is closer to the ground.   Next time you see a low-hanging moon that looks big, curl your hand into a very loose fist and look through it, you should notice the moon now looks smaller.  

The brain will use these cues to give you an idea of the relative distance of an object but it's not a perfect system.  If you ever try to play a sport with one eye closed you'll notice a huge difference.  Nothing beats having two perspectives to compare differences.

/u/justanaprilfool is correct that we can perceive distance with motion.  It is called optic flow: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow which is where you determine distance based on how stationary objects move in your field of vision when you change perspective.  For the ELI5 part: pigeons do this when you corner them.  They will bob their heads around while they watch you to get a better idea of how far away you are.  The amount that you appear to move by will tell them how far away you are.

/u/nos_esse_quasi_nanos is talking about relative size comparisons and is also correct.  If we know about how large something is we can gain some perspective on it based on how large it appears in our field of view.  This is also one way that we can perceive depth in 2D images like drawings or paintings.  ELI5: the closer something is, the larger it will appear.

There are other clues that we can use as well.  I'm not super sure about how our brains process all of this information, but I do know that they have many different sources they use to compute the information we perceive.

Well, little Timmy, just like you have muscles in your arms and legs to move you around, you have two muscles inside your ear! But these two muscles don't move anything you can see. The muscles in your ear can actually block sounds and make them seem quieter to you. For example, when you hear a really loud sound, they will tense up to help make the sound seem quieter. This helps protect the insides of your ears when your sister sneaks up on you and screams as loud as she can. Those muscles stretch tight, and that's why you have trouble hearing out of that ear for a few seconds after. The muscle that makes your ears rumble is called the tensor tympani muscle. Mostly, it makes your chewing sound quieter to you (like when your mom and I tell you to stop crunching your cereal so loud, and you have no idea what we're talking about). Now, why does it make that sound when you flex it? Because all muscles vibrate when you flex them. Make a fist as tight as you can. See your hand shaking? The muscle in your ear does the same thing.

Cogythea,"Condenser microphones work by having a metal diaphragm right next to an electrical circuit (http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/microphones/condenser.html). Put simply, when the sound waves hit this diaphragm, they push it back onto the circuit (as sound is a vibration), thereby completing the circuit. This then sends an electrical signal down the wire the microphone is connected to (or the sound card in the case of the camera), and this signal is then interpreted and converted into its original form. When a microphone is exposed to wind it is constantly pushing that diaphragm back onto the circuit, so the signal is being sent when it ordinarily would not be. This creates an anomalous sound. The volume of this sound depends on the windspeed - a higher speed means that the signal is being sent more times per second. 

I would assume that we don't hear wind as loud because we have evolved to filter some of it out. Not 100% sure though, but that's my explanation as to why microphones pick up wind very loudly.

Nope.  Everyone seems to think this, but it has nothing to do with the phenomenon.

What's happening is that you're compressing a nerve, disrupting its function and stopping it from being able to send signals to your brain.  Thus you can no longer feel your foot.  Once you relieve the pressure on the nerve, it takes a little while for the electrochemical gradients that the nerve uses to send signals to stabilize, and you perceive that as the ""pins and needles"" sensation.",null,0,cdntk5o,1rjaif,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

These models assume four different types of people:

* people that are not sick, but can become sick - S
* people that are currently sick - I
* and people that are immune to the sickness - R
* people that have died from the disease (this is omitted in many models)

It is obvious first of all that if you are an S, and you become infected, the number of S people goes down by 1 and the number of infected goes up by 1. We also know that, in order for someone to become infected, a S person must come in contact with an I. If there are no infected people anywhere, no sickness will happen. Similarly, if everyone is sick, no one else can become infected.

Based on the above logic, we can make the equation that the change in the S group goes down based on the number of S*I. We also though in a constant to be able to fudge around the numbers (such as if you meet someone with the flu, but don't catch it).

This gives the first equation there, dS/dt = -rSI.
In other words, the change in the S population over time declines based on the number of infected and susceptible.


Looking at the change in the infected, we know, fairly obviously, that if you become sick, you add to the I population. We already figured this out, and it is just the formula above. But instead of subtracting from the population, it adds. Now think about how you get rid of an illness. You just wait it out. You don't have to meet someone that isn't infected. So this part of the equation will just depend on the amount of infected people, and a constant again. The constant here tells you how long it takes to recover.

We sum these terms to make an equation that says that the change in sick people is equal to the number of sick people coming from the S group minus the number that are getting healthy again.

dI/dt = rSI - aI

Now we should think about whether we want people to die from this illness or not. For this interests of saving space, I won't mention anything further than this, but it works using the same principle as being healed - you just go to the dead population rather than the resistant population.

Give me a minute or two and I can make an example figure.

Finally we are on the third equation. Using the same logic as the S-&gt;I group, we know that the number of people being healed is equal to the number becoming resistant (you body gains immunity to the disease in fighting it off). Therefore, we can say:

dR/dt = aI

In order to figure out what happens to each of these populations, you have to solve these three equations simultaneously using some initial value for each of I, S, and R.

DashingDipper,"I'll explain agriculture commodities markets because that's my area of knowledge, but other commodities are traded similarly. Futures contracts are essentially a document that says ""I, Bob the Farmer, agree to sell Paul the Processor x amount of corn, soybeans, etc."" These contracts are typically traded in set amounts (5000 bushels is pretty standard for agriculture) at an agreed upon price. These futures contracts help to reduce price risk because the person can ""lock in"" a favorable price, months or even years in the future. The farmer knows what he will be paid ahead of time so he can plan his expenses accordingly and the processor will know what they are paying for inputs. Most contracts are never actually settled through the physical commodity, but rather in cash. Because they can be settled in cash, many investment firms speculate on these contracts almost as if they were stocks. What most people find lucrative is the fact that when you purchase or short a contract, you only have to post a percentage of the value of that contract. Example: 5000 bushels of corn at $6.00/bu=$30,000 but the buyer might only have to supply $3,000 when they buy the contract. They can complete the payment when they sell the contract.

original VTEC system worked by using oil pressure to push a locking pin that locks the intake valve and exhaust valve together above a specific RPM.   by locking the valves together, you create more valve overlap, where the exiting exhaust gas creates a vacuum that sucks in more intake charge.

iVTEC adds onto this by using oil pressure to continously vary cam phasing.   that means the intake valves still open and close at the same time relative to each other,  but the when they open and close can be moved sooner or later in relation to the crankshaft angular position, which is synonymous with piston vertical position.

VTEC-E is a seperate version used for economy cars where the engine normally operates as with only 1 intake valve opening and closing.   upon reaching a specific RPM above ""cruising"" rpm, the second intake valve opens giving more intake charge.

AyCarrumba,"Back in the olden days, computers were expensive. Really Expensive. They also took up a huge amount of space, and energy.  To make investment in buying and running a computer worthwhile, organisations had to make a single computer available to a number of people simultaneously. It would have to be able to access data, process it, and return it to ""users"" via screen outputs. This was a ""mainframe"" computer. It was multiuser. Things like old UNIX terminal are just that: you can think of a UNIX (or Linux if you've played with that) as a user terminal connecting to your own home computer, which is behaving as a multi-user mainframe. More than one user can log into a Linux operating system at one time, and the operating system shares resources between them.

As computers have gotten more powerful and much cheaper, most people have a computer capable of day to day tasks on their desk. There are still specialist requirements: You might need to compute very complex problems quickly, or you might need to store and retrieve huge files. This is where ""supercomputers"" and ""Servers"" come into their own.

Supercomputers still look a bit like the mainframes of old: Power hungry, taking up rooms with rack after rack of parallel processing boards. They do things like computational fluid dynamics for Formula One racing teams, calculate the effects of time on the yield of a nuclear warhead, or do stress analysis on complex machines.

Servers are a bit more abstract. Many programs operate on a server-client model. The server stores and retrieves files, the client asks the server what it wants and displays the results. Minecraft works on this model whether you play it single player or on a remote server. The entire internet is based on the principle of computers communicating and sharing files via an agreed protocol. Servers can also be massive - Google data centres for example take up whole buildings. It all depends on how much data you need to store and how you do it. But virtually any organisation (or even home) that holds large amounts of data but needs it to be accessible by multiple people or devices will use a centralised server so that files can be viewed, shared, updated and backed up efficiently.",null,1,cdnxzxc,1rjiib,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

panzerkampfwagen,"German has gender.  While there seems to be some rules, such as nouns ending with 'chen' are neuter and words ending with an 'e' are usually feminine, it can be quite random and there's always exceptions to the rules.  Plus in different parts of Germany local dialects can consider the same noun as having a different gender than elsewhere in Germany.

Germany though does have an official version of German known as Hochdeutsch and that's the German that legally much be taught to all school children.  

But yeah, pretty random and doesn't always make sense.  Man (Mann) and boy (Junge) are masculine (omg, look, an exception!), woman (Frau) is feminine and girl (Maedchen) is neuter.  Ships are neuter until you give them a name and then suddenly they're feminine even if the name is male.  

And the funny thing is that the gender of a noun determines how it's seen.  A bridge (Bruecke and thus feminine) is usually described as having feminine traits while table (Tisch and masculine) is usually described as having masculine traits.

So at the end of the day there are some rules to determine gender but it's still pretty random and even things that have biological gender sometimes don't have the equivalent grammatical gender.  ",null,0,cdnw8ve,1rjjlt,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

For example, the word *metropoliten* (subway) is masculine, and so the colloquial *metro* was masculine initially. It clashed with the pattern we are used to and eventually *metro* became neutral.

In secretory diarrhoea, your body essentially expels water into you intestines. This occurs in cholera. Too much water in your gut = diarrhoea

In osmotic diarrhoea, the concentration of particular nutrients is too high inside the intestine. Water is drawn from the body into the intestine to lower this concentration. This happen in crohns disease where a person cant absorb a particular nutrient and thus have a high concentration of it stay in their intestines drawing water. Too much water = diarrhoea

BioCRN,"You have to go out of your way to get sued. Here's what happens...

It's suspected that you have GMO crops on your land, this is usually reported by other farmers or by seed elevators that buy crops from farmers.

The owners of the technology (Monsanto, usually (thanks to their patent portfolio)...but can be Dupont/Dow/BASF/Bayer/etc depending on the crop or technology) will approach the farmer/farm and ask for voluntary documentation on their seed source and/or a sample of their seed/crops.

Things can go a couple ways from here...either they comply or they resist. If they resist, things can go into legal wrangling (especially since pretty much everyone who denies to comply in order to investigate the issue is in the wrong). If they comply (or once compliance is legally won) then they send the samples off to labs to test for priority genes. Sometimes it gets to the point where it's a case of ""well, go ahead and harvest and then we'll take samples"" when farmers are adamant they're doing nothing wrong...they will be busted or cleared once sampled after harvest without any impact to the value of the farmer's crop or harvest if in the clear.

Here's the thing about GMO accidentally ending up on your land...Monsanto/etc. have programs in place which will pay for the contaminated crop, it's clean-up, and the labor/chemicals used to remove it from your land...even in border lands like ditches and runoff-protection areas that aren't in production fields.

Here's the other thing...there is no way on this planet someone accidentally has 70-80-90%+ GMO contaminated seed in their fields. This only happens when buying illegal seed or (more commonly) cultivating, selecting, and saving GMO seed when you notice it's shown up on your property. If I happen to be driving a truck holding 10,000 copies of MS Windows and a copy falls off the back of my truck you don't have the right to install that on 1000 computers at your business or go around installing copies on other people's computers because you found it on the ground.

Monsanto has never lost a case they've sued a farmer over...and it's only been a few dozen farmers in the past 18-ish years...and well over 1/2 of them happened in the early years of GMO adoption before a lot of people knew exactly what was up with the legal limits of using this technology.

If you're farming 100s-1000s of acres, you know exactly what you're getting into when you choose to cross the line into stealing intellectual property. The only farmers that have gone up against this system were either testing the system for it's limits and/or were simply trying to steal intellectual property. It's a very deliberate act in either case.

Beyond all this, it's a case of farmers who WANT to crop GMO crops without actually paying the higher seed price for GMO seed. They are no different than GMO seed purchasing farmers, use no more or less chemicals, nor are they somehow saintly or innocent for wanting to do this...they just want to cut out the ""paying for it"" part that helps brings this intellectual property to market.

I'll paste an excerpt from Monsanto's FAQ:

&gt;**What is Monsanto’s standard policy if we discover a farmer is violating his or her seed contract? **

&gt;If there is evidence of seed piracy, we work with the farmer to confirm the facts and discuss how to resolve the issue quickly, amicably and professionally in accordance with our Commitment on Farmers and Patents. This commitment clearly outlines a strict code of conduct we must operate under if we are investigating possible violations. In particular, we do not threaten farmers, we respect their privacy, we do not trespass, and we do not pursue farmers for the accidental presence of our patented technology in their fields or crops.


From my knowledge (I worked on a farm for quite some time), the vast majority of farmers sued by Monsanto and similar companies are for what is known as ""saving seed."" Under the contract for using the GM seeds, the farmer promises not to save seeds from the harvested crop to plant the next year. This is so that farmers cannot expand the seeds they bought earlier and is the farming equivalent of saying that you cannot pirate music.

In the case of Food Inc., one of the main farmers interviewed claimed to run a small family farm to have been harassed by Monsanto unfairly. Despite this, his farm was worth several million (I could be in the wrong range, but it was by no means small), and there was audio evidence of him trying to convince his neighbors to save seed.

There is a reason why those in the farming community have a significantly more positive viewpoint on average than the average member of the public.",null,5,cdnw33i,1rjkfk,explainlikeimfive,hot,20

Seed piracy is common because [Monsanto doesn't use terminator genes](http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/terminator-seeds.aspx). The small fraction of these farmers that Monsanto brings to court are [guilty as fuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser). There is no way the contamination was accidental, and the court agrees. US Courts do not hold farmers liable for accidental contamination and the burden of proof lies with Monsanto.

AyCarrumba,"There are a number of reasons.

Firstly, cost. A high quality system is hugely expensive. IT takes good quality optics and highly sensitive cameras to work well in low light conditions, and high definition is very memory intensive, meaning you need large arrays of hard discs. Whilst some organisations are willing (or legally obliged) to fit such system,s the vast majority aren't. Is a small store owner going to pay $10,000 or even $100,000 for a multi camera high definition system with 3 month recording? No. He'll buy the $1000 system.

Secondly, detail is inversely proportional to field of view. If I want a camera with a 90 degree field of vision, to cover a parking lot, for example, then it will necessarily be too low resolution to capture faces or numberplates - unless I spend a lot of money. If I want to capture numberplates or faces, then I need to place the camera accurately at a ""choke point"". Bear in mind that even 1 megapixel resolution, 1000x1000, if a persons face only ever occupies 1/10th of it, we will get a 100x100 pixel image of their face: This may not be enough to conclusively identify them especially in poor light.

So, to cover your last point:

&gt; if low-quality cameras fail to catch criminals, then they are worthless and a waste of money from the start anyways which would defeat the purpose of installing the low-quality cameras in the first place.

CCTV is used primarily as a deterrent. You put in your $500 Home Depot chinese sytem, rig up some cameras, and stick up your stickers saying ""You are on CCTV"". This might just be enough to put off those who were thinking ""should or shouldn't I rob this store?"" And overtime hopefully your investment will pay itself back. IT may also be that your insurance stipulates that you must have a functioning CCTV system to be valid - but no mention of quality.

CCTV doesn't ""Fail to catch cirminals"" POlice caught Criminals before widespread CCTV, and they continue to catch criminals where there is no CCTV evidence. However, even if CCTV doesn't capture a recogniseable facial image, it can still be very useful in the investigation of crime and the prosecution of criminals.

So it's easier to stock up on lots of the popular cars with the popular options rather than go one at a time.

&gt; They could easily have crazy virtual reality or something to show what each option would be. Even a simple picture.

The biggest thing with buying a car is feel.  You can't replicate it with VR or just a picture.  You've got to be able to sit in it, push all the buttons, drive around to see how it handles, and kick the tires to see if it's something for you.

Case in point.  I have this tiny Chevy Cavalier as a kid that was a hand me down when my mom got a new car.  She (5'1"") loved it, fit nicely...me (5'9"" guy) also liked it.  My 6'3"" step dad (who actually picked it out and bought it for my mom originally) hated driving it for more than a half hour or so because he's just a huge guy.  So for him he knew going into it that he'd hardly be driving it and wouldn't have bought it for himself but it fit my mother nicely.  You wouldn't be able to know that with VR or a picture.

EDIT: Not to mention that if all you had were picture of cars, even if you could sell one then you'd have to wait for it to get ordered, built and delivered.  Also, I'm sure that another huge reason is that if dealers buy X amount of cars they can get wholesale deals rather than buying just enough to have one on the show floor.

panzerkampfwagen,"Torrents are where files are split into smaller pieces.  You run a program that finds these pieces from other users and downloads it from them.  Those who have the complete file are called Seeders.  Those who are downloading are called Leechers.  Together they're known as Peers.  You get your copy from both Seeders and Leechers.  Obviously the only way to guarantee that a complete file is available is through Seeders.  This is why it's recommended that once you obtain the whole file you remain as a Seeder instead of hitting and running which is where once you get the whole file you stop torrenting it to save your own bandwidth.  This is a common problem on open public torrent sites which is why a lot of people go to private torrent sites where you have to obtain a ratio of at least 1 (meaning you've uploaded as much as you've downloaded) to be able to use the site.  If you drop under a ratio of 1 for too long they ban you.

The torrent programs aren't illegal so you can just look for their names, such as uTorrent, and download them.  Wikipedia would probably give you a long list of different torrent programs.  Quite a lot of MMOs, for instance, use Torrents for downloading.

One of the advantages of this is that someone, a person or company, doesn't have to host the complete file on their own server and spend a fortune on uploading it.  Instead once enough people have the file and are uploading it the faster new people can obtain the file.

The downside is that by splitting the file into smaller pieces more popular files can literally slow down the internet for everyone.  When popular TV shows and movies are released on torrent sites the overall speed of the internet slows down.  The internet can handle larger files more easily than lots of smaller pieces.

TimeTravellerSmith,"&gt; where could I download it?

Google ""Tor Browser"" or ""Videlia Tor"".

&gt; What is it?

Basically it masks your IP (the number that identifies a specific computer on the internet and where it is) by assigning a random one each time you open the browser.  By doing this it makes it hard for someone looking at your IP to figure out where you are.  For example, my IP says I'm in Plainsville, Nebraska but when using a Tor browser it tells people that I'm in Swampington, Texas.

It also masks your traffic coming back to you by encrypting the data and bouncing it off of other computers.  For example you browse Reddit and open up an Imgur link.  Instead of your computer directly opening the link it's bounced off of different ""nodes"" which are essentially other peoples computers.  So the link goes from Imgur to (each node is letter) A then B, M, D, F, G, back to A, then R, Y, S, Q, back to D, then to your computer.  So when someone is watching to see what your doing they would have to track it off of every computer that the link bounces off of (which is hard).

Tor, which stands for 'Tor Onion Router"" is a privacy system. When you make a request, the encrypted request is sent to a Tor gateway, or exit node. The Tor system then bounces your request between a number of Tor routers, making it impossible to trace where it came from. The request finally arrives at the server, which sends back a reply, which again bounces around various tor routers before exiting tor at another exit node, and making it's way back to you.

lobster_conspiracy,"Most of the mathematics you learn, once you've learned about fractions and decimals, deals with values that can be fractional (or even imaginary), not just integers. For example, in trigonometry, you can calculate the sine of 30 degrees, but you can also do it for 30.5 degrees, or 30.561 degrees. Whether the values are fractional or integral doesn't really matter to what you are doing, and since we often use mathematics with fractional values (for example, measured from the real world), such methods must be equally applicable to any real number values to be useful.

On the other hand, there are some things (think not just mathematics, but more generally), that do not make sense with fractions. For example, how many ways are there to arrange the three letters A, B, C? The answer is six, and there are ways to figure out what the answer might be for any number of letters, but the answer, as well as the input (the number of letters) can only be an integer, never fractional. There are many areas of mathematics that deal with such things like ""if we have this many of something, how many…"" or ""if such and such, then is so and so true?""

colin-broderick,"Like most physics problems, you solve it with a cleverly placed triangle.  There's a reason you spend so much time learning trig in school, you know!

Basically, at some point in the year you measure the angle between where the sun is on the sky and where the star is in the sky.  Exactly half a year later, you measure the angle again.  What you now have is a triangle where you know the length of the base (twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun) and you know both of the base angles.  From this information it is very easy to calculate absolutely everything else about the triangle, including the height, which will be the distance from the Sun to the star.  If you want you can also calculate the distance from the Earth to the star.  Which distance you really want probably depends on what you're it using for (and actually the *time-averaged* distance between the Earth and the star will be the same as the distance between the Sun and the star).

It looks something like this:

        X
       / \
      /   \
     /__.__\

The dot at the centre of the base is the Sun, the X is the star in question.  As mentioned above, we know the length of the base and the two base angles, so we can calculate everything else about the triangle.
    
    
It's called [parallax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Parallax_in_astronomy).

This is just one method, and only works well for relatively nearby stars.  For things that are further away, we use the brightness.  For certain types of star we know *exactly* how bright they really are at the source, so by observing how bright they appear to be from here, we can calculate how far away they are.  Brightness decreases with distance in a well-understood way.

Edit:  By the way, this is almost exactly the same principle that allows us to judge how far away things are.  Because we have two eyes our brain gets two slightly different images from two slightly different angles, and the two images together allow the brain to calculate how far away objects are.  Again, this only works for quite nearby objects, up to about 20-30 feet; for more distant things we have to rely on things like our knowledge of scale (i.e. if it looks smaller it's probably further away).",null,1,cdnxvy6,1rjqro,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

GMO's are plants and like all other plants they like to make more plants.

The other issue is that someone owns the rights to the strain, and the strains are designed to be very good as what they do (surviving against disease or drought, growing very dense) and thus tend to be such great money makers that it drives other traditional strains out of business.

There were no bell peppers thousands of years ago (at least, not the beautiful shit you pick up in a grocery store), likewise for pretty much anything else you eat. From cilantro to chicken to avocados to almonds, humans have artificially selected traits that they deemed most beneficial, and it is unlikely that natural evolution would ever produce something similar.

Koooooj,"You just need a Bitcoin wallet.  Note that in Bitcoin the word wallet means several different things, including:

* The application or website that manages your balance

* The file that stores your private keys (the data that indicates that you own the Bitcoins)

* The collection of addresses that you own

For this post I will be using ""wallet"" to refer to the first definition.  There are several options to choose from when selecting a Bitcoin wallet.  You can change your mind at any point, though, so don't stress out about it too much.  I would recommend Electrum for a new user--it's a wallet that will store all of the sensitive data 100% on your computer, meaning that you have zero reliance on any website, while it allows 3rd party servers to store the ~30 GB of data from the Bitcoin blockchain.  If you want to use a completely standalone wallet then either Bitcoin QT or Armory would be a good choice (the latter is built on the former but has more features for advanced security).  You could also consider using something like Blockchain.info's online wallet, which can be done carefully to minimize risk of losing your coins due to the actions of a 3rd party.  If you have a smartphone then the Android or iOS wallets would be a good choice since they easily allow you to see that you've received a payment without needing to carry around a laptop.

When you select your wallet application there should be some button that says something to the effect of ""generate new address.""  When you hit that button you'll be given a string of numbers and letters that represents the new address, something that looks about like 1ABsAj8enaBjyPx6y95Tjvk2Bhp65re8JT (this is an address I own).  When you go to sell you just have to give the buyer that information and tell them how many bitcoins to send.  When they send the bitcoins you should get a notification that there is a transaction incoming, and some time later the transaction will be confirmed by the network.  Once confirmed the odds of the buyer scamming you are virtually zero, although many buyers will not want to wait for the confirmation--it can take a while.  For most transactions it is reasonable to consider a transaction as being complete when it is first received, unless you stand to lose quite a lot of money in the event of a scam.

As always, make sure you use good common sense.  Don't meet people in locations where they can easily rob you and what not.  If all you give the buyer is an address and an amount to pay then there's not much they can do to scam you, though.  Honestly they'll probably be more worried that you're scamming them, since there's no way for them to un-send the bitcoins once they've paid--they have to trust that you'll hand over the goods.  Keep that in mind to keep the buyer at ease.

You should also look into securing your wallet (2nd definition).  Most wallets (1st definition) have the ability to encrypt the wallet (2nd definition) with a password.  Be sure to use a strong password--a good choice would be a phrase that doesn't appear in any literature or anywhere online; nonsense makes a good choice here, *provided you will remember it.*",null,1,cdo1xky,1rjs58,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

Basically the Charter guarantees a number of individual rights (similar to the US constitution), however there is one controversial provision -- the notwithstanding clause.

The clause basically allows parliament or provincial governments to temporarily override certain portions of the charter in extreme circumstances. It is therefore highly controversial because, theoretically, the clause can be exploited to violate rights and freedoms which would normally be guaranteed for all persons.

So far the notwithstanding clause has never been invoked by the federal government / parliament (to my knowledge), however a small number of provinces have used/abused the clause in the past.

Some people like complex, experimental jazz where hundreds of notes are played seemingly at random, some people like 4-note pop music. Harmonic patterns are slightly more easy to classify. Smaller intervals (half step, whole step) are generally (HUGE generalization here) less pleasing than larger intervals (major 3, perfect fifth) because larger intervals produce more ""even harmonics"" (double, or quadrupal the frequency), that is to say, the harmonic frequencies support each other, rather than producing the ""beat frequency"" of uneven harmonics (Think two guitar strings playing the same ""note"", one string slightly out of tune)... Another level to this question is the human perception factor. The inner ear (where sound is collected) has tiny little hairs (called cillia) that vibrate when a sound reaches them, These hairs are sorted by length into 'critical bands', frequency ranges to which the ear is most sensitive. People don't like hearing two notes very close together because it stresses the same critical band, which is physically irritating. Now a good question to ask is why our brains developed this way...

They are trying to combat this now with TAPS (Transition Assistance Program) and other programs like that - yet it's something where you'll only take out as much as you put in.

For a normal, unmarried enlisted member of the military there is a lot they don't have to worry about.  You get a meal card so you can eat at the chow hall (food is taken care of.)  You get a barracks room (housing is taken care of.)  This leaves them with pretty much all of their income as disposable.  Young members of the military (not all, but I'd be willing to bet that it's 50%+ from personal experience) basically pay for cable/internet, junk food, alcohol and whatever else they want to spend their money on (video games, weekend excursions, etc.)

Imagine doing that for 4+ years straight, then being shoved to the curb quickly (as helpful as their transition programs can be, it's really a 'check in the box' and they don't care what you take from it as long as you do it and GTFO when it's your time) to now having no real-world education (though leadership training in the military is better than any college classroom can prepare you for), a lesser income WHILE having to pay for rent/food/etc.

The GI Bill can help take care of some of this, but it's a toss-up as to if the person wants to use it.  Not many 22 year-olds fresh out of the military feel like going to university if they didn't feel like going before they joined.

Each type is sensitive to a different range of wavelengths of light, though there is some overlap between ranges. One is most sensitive to what we perceive as red light, one to green light, and one to blue/violet light. When a combination of these cells is activated, the brain will perceive it as a different color than if one type were activated alone. For example, we see yellow light when red and green sensitive cells are activated at the same time.

bahanna,"Well, Judges set bail and defendants post bail. Not sure why those are the words, but anyway:

Bail is set before trial and people are innocent until proven guilty. We can't very well throw people in jail because some cop though the guy ""probably"" broke a law, only for a jury to come along three months later and say ""Oops, we're really not sure you committed any crimes."" By that point it's too late, they've served 3 months in jail for a crime they didn't commit. 

Bail is a compromise. The idea is that the court holds on to such a large amount of money that we can be reasonably sure the defendant will show up to get it back. IDK about Kyron Templeton, but when it comes to $2.6 Million bail the idea is that if anyone is willing to lend this guy $2.6 million dollars, then we know they're not going to let the him out of their sight. They'll have bounty hunters following him 24-7 to make sure he shows up at the trial.

Of course, bounty hunters cost a lot of money. So between that at the risk they could fuck up and lose the bondsman's $2.6 million, Kyron would have to come up with a few/several hundred thousand dollars to make it worth their while.

So the judge figures, ""The state could allocate officers to keep an eye on him 24/7 for the next # months, but that cost the equivalent of $500k in man-hours we can't spare. So, I'll let him see if he can hire someone else to do the job and take the risk. Since bail-bondsmen charge #% that 500,000/ .# = 2.7 Million. If he can't find someone to do this great, if he can, then all the better. In either case, no one can say we didn't try to let him out with reasonable precautions - the precautions were just too expensive.""",null,0,cdo0zpp,1rjz8z,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
pythonpoole,"The point of the bail system (in most jurisdictions) is to ensure that the accused shows up to their scheduled court date. 

It's not supposed to be used as a form of punishment or detention (since you have not yet been convicted of any crime), but rather is intended to make sure that you will attend court and go to trial to assess your guiltiness for the crime(s) which you have been accused of.

Technically you should be awarded bail at a low amount whenever the risk of you being absent for your court date is considered low (even if you are suspected of potentially violent crimes).

You are only supposed to be denied bail (or be set a large bail amount) if you are considered a flight risk (e.g. the risk of skipping court dates and/or leaving the jurisdiction/country to avoid punishment is high).

There are many factors which may be considered when assessing flight risk (the risk of skipping court) including such factors as whether the person has a passport and the financial means to afford travelling out of the country, whether the individual is settled and socially connected with others (e.g. has a family to provide for etc.), and whether the individual has an established place of long-term residence (as opposed to someone just living on the street or in a hotel).

Edit: Of course I forgot to mention the key point which is that you get the money back after you attend the court date(s) you are scheduled to show up for. So bail is really just a way of saying ""we don't know if you're guilty yet, so we'll let you go for now... but you have to pay us a security deposit so we know you're serious about returning to court and we'll eventually refund you the bail amount IF you fulfill all your court duties.""",null,0,cdo0rdc,1rjz8z,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

The problem is that the countries involved have similar, and hard to document competing claims. And some treaties that should have resolved things didn't.

pythonpoole,"Most phone calls are not encrypted, and it's my understanding that it was Merkel's personal phone (not her secure phone) that was being tapped.

When a call is transmitted 'in the clear' (unencrypted) it can be tapped into at many different points.

Firstly, it's possible for the device (i.e. the phone) itself to be compromised, such as by the installation of some sort of malware/spyware.

Secondly, the call can be intercepted at the local mobile phone carrier level (typically with assistance from / co-operation with the carrier).

Thirdly, the call can be intercepted by tapping into / splitting fiber optic lines carrying phone calls at the intra-provider level (e.g. on back-haul links from cell towers to the carrier's central routing facility), the inter-provider level (e.g. at carrier-neutral facilities where telephone call traffic gets handed off from one carrier to another), or at the undersea/international level (where there are only a limited number of cables carrying data/call traffic between countries and tapping these lines provides access to virtually all data/call traffic entering or leaving the country).

When calls are encrypted, basically the only way to get the unencryped audio is either to compromise the phone of one of the parties (i.e. somehow get malware installed) or to gain access to the encryption keys (such as by forcing the mobile manufacturer to hand over the keys if they retain such records). Brute force cracking is largely ineffective (virtually impossible) unless there is a particular weakness (or backdoor planted) in the encryption algorithm being used.

Note, however, that it is technically possible to perform statistical analyses on encrypted calls (particularly when the calls are encrypted with weak encryption algorithms and transmission methods that 'leak' information they shouldn't) whereby you can determine such things as the (likely) sex of the speaker, the (likely) language being spoken and the talk-to-silence ratio simply by looking for certain variations/patterns and statistical anomalies in the encrypted call data.",null,0,cdo1che,1rk1qx,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

djslinkk,"Freemasonry is a philosophy of moral standards, mutual understanding and brotherhood in which all men are on a level and equal. While many people talk of secret conspiracies, the truth is that many aspects of the craft are not secret at all. Freemasons believe that:

Since God is the Creator, all men and women are the children of God. Because of that, all men and women are brothers and sisters, entitled to dignity, respect for their opinions, and consideration of their feelings.

Each person must take responsibility for his/her own life and actions. Neither wealth nor poverty, education nor ignorance, health nor sickness excuses any person from doing the best he or she can do or being the best person possible under the circumstances.

No one has the right to tell another person what he or she must think or believe. Each man and woman has an absolute right to intellectual, spiritual, economic, and political freedom. This is a right given by God, not by man. All tyranny, in every form, is illegitimate.

Each person must learn and practice self-control. Each person must make sure his spiritual nature triumphs over his animal nature. Another way to say the same thing is that even when we are tempted to anger, we must not be violent. Even when we are tempted to selfishness, we must be charitable. Even when we want to ""write someone off,"" we must remember that he or she is a human and entitled to our respect. Even when we want to give up, we must go on. Even when we are hated, we must return love, or, at a minimum, we must not hate back. It isn't easy!

Faith must be in the center of our lives. We find that faith in our houses of worship, not in Freemasonry, but Freemasonry constantly teaches that a person's faith, whatever it may be, is central to a good life.

Each person has a responsibly to be a good citizen, obeying the law. That doesn't mean we can't try to change things, but change must take place in legal ways.

It is important to work to make this world better for all who live in it. Freemasonry teaches the importance of doing good, not because it assures a person's entrance into heaven -- that's a question for a religion, not a fraternity -- but because we have a duty to all other men and women to make their lives as fulfilling as they can be.

blehonce,"""lose so much money"" is false. most consoles which lose money, lose less than 4 games worth of revenue to get back to netural.

which is why they don't collaborate. the money lost on the console is small relative to the money brought in through games, music, videos, and services (like xbox live or psn).

so why not collaborate? the profit model is specifically against collaboration. it would be nice to be able to play mario games on xbox. but nintendo knows only a couple titles will sell the game console in order to play the games, and those same games will lead the console distribution to be neutral. and then since the end user already has the console, the user will be more likely to buy more content for it as there is a relative pay wall when going with the competition.

this is good for the companies which make the consoles because it allows them profit monopoly. whereas only getting a portion of the revenue of games would mean they would lack profit negotiation (or cost to develop) capacity. and the only games they could tax would be ones which only and exclusively use their controller.

imagine if a dev made a FPS game which only ran on PS4 and wiiu because xbox was being greedy. they would potentially lose out on allot of sales. but even if it was for all three consoles, the one with the best hardware would dominate the game sales which benefit by having the highest performance. that is, while angry birds would sell about the same for both ps4 and wiiu, a fps when benifits from every little bit of graphic processing would orient consumers (in general) to buy their brand. so it costs more R&amp;D to make a console which has that zing i need the game for it rather than competition, but it also brings in a larger portion of the lot from sales.

consoles aren't just machines but also methods of excluding others compatibility. so rather than trying to argue with some counsul that their preferred feature needs to get added to the standard, they can just go off and make their own product and let the consumers choose which base feature set they prefer. do you want to be able to snap multiple chats, or do you want ps4's social networking stuff?

and with community projects you can't exclude a support for a product against the will of the majority. and it gets even worse if the code is open source so free alternatives are competing with standard stuff. which leads to brand confusion. do you want a proprietary wiiu game pad, or a tablet, or kinect, or a wiimote, or xbox/ps4 controler to have games designed for it? do you want to bundle them?

going to OS features, will the all in one console have a profanity filter? is a feature like that a demographic niche you could profitably pander to?

Like you said it really depends on placement.  For example, just because your oven makes some waste heat doesn't mean it's going to heat the right parts of the house.  Same could be said of your dryer or whatever else makes a decent amount of heat.

Otherwise I do something similar to this all the time (or at lease I did).  When I lived in an apt that had drafty windows and bad radiator heating in the winter I'd just run my desktop computer and make it do things to run up the CPU (I used SETI@home) which would put out a decent amount of heat actually.  Problem is that it's not very energy efficient to do something like this.

&gt; Or is there some other way the energy could be wasted that's not useful for home heating?

There is still a mechanical efficiency that doesn't create waste heat, or any proper amount that you'd be able to feel.  For example, in a washer or dryer it's got to spend a lot of power to get the drum moving and then fight air resistance, imbalance and friction to keep it going.  Transmitting the power to the drum and pumping water in and out all include some losses and it adds up.  Same with just about any electrical appliance...there is an efficiency loss from all sorts of things and the lost energy might not always be in the form of ""usable"" waste heat.",null,0,cdo2dz4,1rk6rf,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
t0mbstone,"Before you can answer ""What is Github?"", you must first answer ""What is Git?"".

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005.

Basically, Git provides a mechanism for multiple people to work on different offline copies of the same code project, and then (relatively) easily merge the two copies of the project together at a later point in time.

The Git server (in addition to many client-side implementations of Git) is open source and anyone can run their own Git server and Git repositories for free.

Github, on the other hand, is simply a company that provides Git hosting. They handle all the server-side stuff and provide a nice web interface. This makes it easier for people around the world to just focus on their code projects (instead of worrying about server administration).

Github hosts public repositories for free, which means they are a great place to put an open source project. This friendliness towards the open source community has greatly increased the popularity and adoption of Github over the years.

Due to the massive popularity and growing adoption of Git (and Github), many companies nowadays are expecting candidates to have a working knowledge of Git on their resume. It is not uncommon for a company to ask for your Github username when they are interviewing you, so they can look at your open source contributions to try and gauge your competency.

Git (and Github) are both fairly easy to learn and use once you get them set up.

aadhar2006,"So a skeletal muscle cramp is a painful overshortening or contraction of a skeletal muscle.  It can happen due to a variety of reasons.  Some of the most common ones are fatigue and electrolyte imbalances.  

Many people who play sports or run, experience a cramp from a fatigued muscle. I'll explain this one.  Basically, your individual muscle cells run out of their energy source (ATP) as they become fatigued.  This energy source is needed to actually detach the linked contracting fibers in your muscle cells.  This would normally allow relaxation of the muscle.  If the energy runs low, they can't detach.  So your muscle temporarily gets locked in a contracted state which causes the pain.  So obviously it follows that resting the muscle is a good solution for this cause of cramps.

I can explain the electrolyte imbalance (particularly calcium and potassium imbalances) cause as well if you'd like but it involves a much more in-depth explanation of skeletal muscle physiology, so I'll skip it for now.  Suffice it to say that staying well hydrated can help prevent this cause of cramps.  

As for what most likely happened to cause you to wake up with a cramp in your calf, here's my guess.
Your calf muscle was probably contracted in the position you were sleeping.  That particular muscle helps you move your foot so that you point your toes down like you're standing on tiptoes.  And basically, because your foot was in that position for a long time while you were sleeping, the muscle cramped due to the fatigue reason I explained above.",null,1,cdo30cj,1rk6zy,explainlikeimfive,hot,3
yakusokuN8,"For finite sets of numbers, we say that the cardinality of that set is equal to the number of members of that set.  So if A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then |A| = 4.  

When we get into infinite sets of numbers, it gets a little bit trickier.  Let's start with the counting numbers (non-negative integers), that is, {1, 2, 3, 4...}.  There are an infinite number of members of this set.  We call this set countable if we can make a one to one correspondence with the set of counting numbers.

So, the set of integers is also countably infinite.  

We can order them like this:

0 1 -1 2 -2 3 -3

and pair them off with all the counting numbers:

counting numbers:integers

1:0  
2:1  
3:-1  
4:2

6:3  
7:-3

Yet, there is a larger kind of infinite size of a set.  The set of real numbers can't be grouped in this kind of one to one correspondence.  The real numbers are all the rational numbers plus the irrational numbers and we can't pair off all the irrational numbers the way that we can the rational numbers.  Rational numbers are written as x/y, where x and y are both integers, but irrational numbers cannot be written as a fraction.

They built steam engines to drive massive water pumps that couldn't have operated without a machine.

If you ever close your store, traditionally those three days are the bare minimum. And Thanksgiving was the only one that wasn't explicitly religious. Even in the recent past (last 10 years) it was hard to find anything that was open. Even gas stations would close for the holiday.

The only people that would work Thanksgiving were those that were absolutely needed. Even vital facilities like hospitals and utilities would run on minimum staffs. And those people were treated almost like heroes. I worked it for a utility about 15 years ago. I was paid 2.5 times my normal hourly pay rate because I sacrificed to cover it. And a lot of companies have senior managers who would cover shifts to let as many plebs as possible have the day off.

It is one of two days where people gather as families (Christmas being the other). And the entire country shuts down as we all gather to eat, watch football, and fight with our families.

So people are offended to see this tradition end. It is one thing for important services (like gas stations) to remain open. It is something entirely different for an electronics store to remain open. And until about 2 years ago, they wouldn't. But now the stores are opening on Thanksgiving. And instead of being a voluntary sacrifice that would be richly rewarded, working on the holiday is mandatory in some stores like WalMart.

It takes far too long and too much specialisation to reach the level of skill/knowledge on something that would make you globally notable these days. 

As mentioned by others here, what makes them notable is their *relative* knowledge levels compared to the rest of the world. They didn't know much, but jeez, compared to everyone else back then, they knew everything. And they got there without the internet, supportive government and societal infrastructure, and without a lot of the inspiration we have now.

That sort of knowledge and skill monopoly concentrated in one person is unlikely to happen again, due to the sheer amount of time and effort it takes to be the best at something these days; to be great at something means sacrificing the necessary time to be good at something else. Also back then they didn't have electric lights, appliances, modern transport, communications and information infrastructure we have; just daily life was so time consuming that there was far less time for creativity and learning. The standard of skill and knowledge among everyone else was far lower. The amount of free time we have now allows people to specialise in a skill and reach levels of proficiency in months what would have taken years for someone many years ago, there are now people with after-work hobbies that are better skilled at them than people who were once considered the best in the world in that field.

EDIT: A lot of people have taken my view of Da Vinci as that he was not an incredible genius with equally or even more incredible drive and focus. This is not my view, he was indisputably an unprecedented genius who hardly slept and worked incessantly. If Da Vinci were alive today, he would almost certainly be still doing very notable things.

When you think of those artists, you think of them doing classical sculpture, paintings, architecture, etc. People still work with those classical, naturalistic styles, but they're not the styles that are really in vogue anymore. 

There are artists that work in--even master, depending on what you think of them--a variety of art forms, but they're not going to do it in a way that looks like the naturalistic paintings or sculptures of the Renaissance artists.

A good example off the top of my head: Kurt Schwitters was a Dada artist who invented hundreds of subgenres of art. He painted, made ""house-sculptures"" (see Merzbau, Merzbarn, etc.) did poems, stories, music/sound poetry, etc. There are a lot of other artists that had crossovers into more than one type of art. John Cage did music, but also poetry; Warhol did painting, but also photography and films. If I can think of better examples I'll edit this. 

Another thing. People are saying that Da Vinci and Michelangelo were more famous than modern day artists are because skill and knowledge were more of a luxury back then. This is sort of true, but these guys were also really phenomenal.

Faustroll80,"Basically, notions of creativity, skill, and quality underwent drastic shifts beginning in the 19th century.

It is imperative to understand the word ""master"" in historical context, which at the time connoted skill, but also (crucially) described an artist who had a studio in which he (rarely she) trained other artists. Students had a fairly rigorous training in academic drawing for a few years before they learned painting. This method created a kind of consistency and helped encourage the notion that artists with large studios were true masters. The exceptions here are Michelangelo, who was notorious for not having a studio and for berating assistants until they abandoned him, and for Leonardo, who worked in relative isolation.

So, ""master"" in the Renaissance more often implied individual skill but also skill as a teacher. A notion of individuality plays a role in forming a notion of the master during the Renaissance and at this moment it meant the extent to which you could teach others to make art that looked so much like yours that it was indistinguishable. It's interesting that you picked Michelangelo and Leonardo, since neither of them had studios.

Another piece of this has to do with the Renaissance belief of where in the process creativity actually happened. Drawing was the central node of intellect at this time, it was why artists studied it for so long, and it was why assistants generally carried out the majority of painting in the studios, after which the master generally did touch up. That was your entry into the grand style, in which drawing was seen as the place where the real thinking happened. So if you were good at drawing, then theoretically you could be good at anything. Drawing in Italy (""disegno"") implied that design, the putting together of something, occurred before the execution of it. 

All of these ideas of creativity and individuality underwent a massive change in 19th century Europe with the decline of academies. Artists gradually began pursuing the idea that real creativity did not hinge on excelling in an accepted style or having a studio in which you taught others. So the word ""master"" changed drastically at the time and became a question of unique personalities. The focus on personality and emotion was best seen in unique styles that shied away from the polish of the academic style (Impressionism) and turned quality into something that was way more granular. 

So to ask whether an artist is a master, the reply could be ""a master of what?"" In determining a master, there needs to be a comparative body of less talented artists. With collective style dissolving, art was no longer something that had a collective, comparative premise. Artists were judged by their sincerity to the motif, which was a personal question. Most importantly, total emulation like the kind you would find in a studio system gradually vanished. So while a young artist was ""inspired"" by Picasso, actual copying was anathema.

Artists today create in different media, but judging mastery is based more on the taste of the viewer for different specific artists and everyone has an opinion.

Sorry if this is kind of meandering, but it is a complex issue with lots of aspects that feed into each other.

A good source for how these ideas came about in the 19th century is Cezanne and the End of Impressionism by Richard Shiff and The Academy and French Painting in the 19th Century by Albert Boime

One such modern day genius that experienced a wealth of intellectual influence across different domains/sub-domains within mathematics and science would be [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). He independently re-proved the Central Limit Theorem, solved the  open Entscheidungsproblem (when mathematical logic wasn't even his specialty), thereby subsequently founding computability theory &amp; computer science, in addition to founding artificial intelligence and founding a new field within chemistry, namely morphogenesis.  Can't forget to mention he help cracked the engima code in WWII, in addition to being a world class runner, and a mathematician that worked in very specialized areas of math most people never heard of (and ones he isn't typically mentioned for, but had influence in as well). If there were ever a modern day renaissance man, it'd be Alan Turing. Unfortunately, his accomplishments and success often get politicalized due to his barbaric treatment as a homosexual/bi-sexual (he did have a girlfriend during WWII). Whenever Turing is brought up, it is usually in defense for gay rights, not to celebrate him as a genius, it is more like 'we killed this man because he was gay', but most people don't understand why he is really well known to begin with. His story is nonetheless very tragic, and if he were allowed to have lived a full life our society would be very different.

fauxscot,"The 'many' part is the issue.  It seems folks these days are more specialists, to me, anyway.   It may be that the technical aspects of any one are much greater than they used to be.  It's hard to hit the limits of the medium when we have what we have available now.    Also, it's hard to find patrons interested in ONE perfected skill and effort expended in two runs the risk of excelling in neither.   

As far as quality artists in a single specific field, there are bunches.  I work with a marble sculptor that has maybe another 10-15 pieces in his remaining years.  His work is stellar.  He's nationally known, but in terms of raging economic success, sculpture is not the path to either fame or riches.   Art is generally only a reliable path to personal expression and satisfaction, to growth in perception, and to continuous improvement.  ( I will note that I visited a studio not long ago where a modest talent was making  a paid-for granite sculpture honoring a deceased dog.  THAT, apparently, is where some bux flow with reliability.) 

You also have to remember... the folks we know about, like Da Vinci and Michelangelo are western-centric.  (In fact, these two are who 99% of people would choose if needing to name a few.)  They are no where near the only ones.  This planet teems with the output of millions of unknown artists of all societies and media.  Lascaux cave paintings, Pacific island statues, great and still-jungle-covered-undiscovered architecture, long rotted paintings, ironwork, precious metals.  That just in the physical media.  There's poetry, dance, song, too... work of genius long dead.   Every professional artist I know has hundreds (sometimes many, many hundreds) of completed pieces crowding studios and storage.  One aging friend is burning hers.  Another sending things to the land fill.  My sculptor mentor?  Viewing a catalog of his plaster models and wondering what will become of them.)

Both M an DaV, were gifted with something equivalent to their hard-earned skills... they were awarded financial support, major assignments, prominent positions for their art, WHILE still alive.   With the vast wealth we have now on this planet, and vast number of people/artists, it seems a lot less common that it should be.    Part of extreme success is extreme assignments.  Almost no artist can afford such things on their own.  Finding willing patrons is an ever-present sub-task, equivalent in every way to the greatness arising from artistic skills.   Bernini built Rome.  You can't throw a bowling ball in Rome without hitting something he did that would cost a billion dollars to make today.   If you could, you'd need a venue.  The best are taken.

My opinion as an amateur student of marble sculpture.   This kind of question makes me pontificate and wonder and ramble, as you can tell.

From what I remember, the three big names of the High Renaissance (Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael) only became famous after their names were propagated by Georgio Vasari (who was from the same location as them, but I don't remember where that was. Florence, perhaps?). The reason he was so successful at this propaganda was because he wrote one of the only surviving literature on art and great artists (of that time period....books were just coming into popularity and books on art were rare). Vasari didn't acknowledge other artists who were of the same calibre because they either weren't from the same location or didn't suit his artistic preference.

That being said, there could have been other great artists, and there can still be great artists now, but nowadays it's all about being 'different' and 'selling the artist' instead of the art (This concept was first initiated by Marcel Duchamp, I believe, with his controversial urinal fountain-- his idea was that anything can be made into art, if you believe in the artist). 

The term art has become so subjective now that great artists are often passed over in favour of those who can produce something different and unique. Even before the Renaissance, when all you usually find are unrealistic illustrations by tribal people or eastern cultures, the capacity for realistic art was still present, but nobody believed in it due to religious beliefs. They believed that portraits should emphasize specific traits. Realistic art was considered offensive.

laioren,"So... everyone here is pretty much just posting things about their favorite artists. I think the OP was asking more for contemporary artists that would qualify as a ""Renaissance Person."" Or a polymath, if you will.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath

I'll try to contribute this. Certainly, there are still some really amazing artists and scientists out there. Now, more than ever. However, we don't generally have ""true Renaissance people"" anymore for the following reasons:

1) Lack of Forced ""Focused Education."" - Leonard and Michelangelo both endured very focused apprenticeships starting in their teen years. Both received specialized education before that. Most of the First World eschews such focused educational practices.

2) The Less a Culture Knows, the Easier it is to Be a Master of Several Basics - To attain a PhD in the United States from a respected University now requires an immense amount of specialization. The idea that you could get a PhD in both quantum physics and architecture is very rare and exceedingly difficult. The idea that you could get both of those and like... five others is unheard of.

During the Renaissance, you could point glass at a star and become a master of astronomy. That's an exaggeration of course, but today, even if you're really good at science, no one really cares unless you're the freaking best at it.

3) Financers (Rightfully) Think There is Only Enough Room in People's Heads to Think of Someone in One Way - The people that finance projects have done enough research to know that a large number of people can really only ""think"" of someone else in one particular regard. So, whereas some artists might want to be both musicians AND sculptors, the people that publish and distribute their art will generally only choose one medium to sponsor.

Look at someone like Natalie Portman. Sure, some people probably know of her work in the sciences, but most people don't. And even more people don't give a shit.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/science/01angier.html?pagewanted=all

You can find this again and again. Creative people that are good at things tend to continue trying to work. However, financers rarely back these ""side projects"" for fear that the less profitable venture may actually detract from the profitability of what they see as the more promising one.

4) Lots of Things Can Now Be Produced with the Same Skill - Someone below mentioned how awesome Kanye is. Which is true. However, everything Kanye does boils down to ""digital work.""

I'm not trying to denigrate anyone here (I myself am a ""digital artist"" of sorts), but being able to produce music digitally, movies digitally, and graphic design digitally has more in common with the ""digitally"" than it does with ""art"" portion.

Working with real, physical stone, and sculpting it is WAY fucking harder than creating a 3D image of it on a computer. Again, I am NOT saying that creating a 3D image isn't difficult or that it ""isn't art,"" or any such polarized interpretation bullshit that some people will make up because they feel threatened when their work is called into question.

But simply put, the ""copy and paste"" functionality and the fact that ""undo"" allows you to make an infinite number of attempts while simultaneously removing the scarcity factor makes all digital work vastly easier to produce. Better, too, but just so much easier.

It's because of this ease of using digital mediums that generally, no matter how many types of things you can do with them, most people will simply recognize you as a ""digital artist"" of some kind rather than a Renaissance Person.

And that's fair, because sculpting and painting the Sistine Chapel while lying upside down are two very different skills. Yes, there's still some overlap in the skills, especially with the concepts (such as the understanding of perspective, foreshortening, etc), but they require much more practice, talent, and skill to actually accomplish.

5) Void of Competition - The Renaissance produced a large number of ""grand artists,"" but nothing compared with today. Now, everyone with a computer is an artist with something to offer the world. And everyone's attention, yours, mine, art critics, everyone's, has universal access to their art.

So now people compare and argue about which was a better movie, ""Citizen Kane,"" or ""Dolemite,"" because our experiences are inundated with the work of artists.

When there are only 10 artists of acclaim working in a generation, it's easy to see all of their talents. When there are 8 billion, all you do is compare that kid's YouTube clip to the one you made of your cat yesterday and call bullshit.",null,1,cdoj4lq,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

oechsph,"Forgive my interpretation of this question, but I think that it's difficult to answer provided that your two examples had significantly different roles during the Renaissance. Michelangelo would have been considered an artist during the Renaissance while Da Vinci's role as an artist is only secondary to what made him so successful. His name would have resonated more as a scientist and engineer than an artist. In other words, it's like asking if there are any modern artists like Nikola Tesla and John Cage. The problem is that one was an innovator while the other was an artist. I'm guessing you are looking for an artist.
Also, I would like to point out that Da Vinci DID NOT do many different art forms. He did painting and drawing. He never did ceramics, sculptures, glasswork, etc. So again (and I know I'm being a stickler) it seems like your question doesn't even know what it's asking.
That being said, I might take the liberty of revising your question, then answering it:
""Are there any contemporary artists like Michelangelo who are masters of several artistic mediums?""
Simple Answer: Yes. YES! DEAR GOD YES! Not only are there a few, THERE ARE HUNDREDS. The Renaissance popularize the sentiment that the artist does not need to stick to one medium. Since the Renaissance you can find artists from pretty much every movement who were masters of their movements in painting and sculpture (but not exclusive to those two mediums). Looking to what we deem as modern art you could claim that Salvador Dali (film, photography, sculpture, painting), Picasso (sculpture, painting, costumes, theater), Boccioni (literature, painting, sculpture), Braque (sculpture, painting) , Kollwitz (woodblocks, sketching, sculpture), THE ENTIRE BAUHAUS MOVEMENT (textiles, painting, design, architecture, theater, music), the list goes on. From the perspective of art history, they were all masters of many different mediums.
We now live in the age of post-modernism and arguably post-post modernism where the idea or concept behind art is more important than the work itself (you may know this as conceptual art). In a sense, this is now the norm. An artist who does one thing and one thing only is easily swept under the carpet. Why is this? This is subjective, but we have a tendency to want something new constantly (eg iPhones). Art is no different. We want to experience new things, making a demand for multiple mediums.
Also, it should be noted that the living artists (or ""masters"")whom we consider celebrities today may very well be forgotten in a hundred years. This is pretty common practice in art history.

Steffi_van_Essen,"It would be a hugely expensive operation with little real benefit. Sure, we could do it, but a salvage operation of that scale would take some funding. Then would be the question of where to put it. Do you take it to New York, where it was supposed to be going, or take it back to the UK? Once you've decided where in the world it's going to go, you need to secure a large space on land to actually house it. Add to that the problem that the company which operated it in 1912 no longer exists, and there is no international agreement over who now owns the wreck.

But let's suppose someone makes a reasonable claim to the wreck and manages to put together the funds to haul it to the surface and reconstruct it on dry land. Now, look at some pictures of the wreck as it currently is. It's basically a heap of beaten up, rusted metal. And that's exactly what it's going to look like when you get it above water too. It's not going to be nice to look at, you couldn't safely have tourists going inside it, and locals are going to complain that you put this heap of rusty metal next to their town/area of natural beauty. Of course, you could do a massive clean-up operation, maybe even try to beat everything back into shape and put it together just like new (although I'm not even sure this would still be physically possible), but by then, the amount of money and effort you've spent you might as well just have built a replica from scratch.",null,0,cdo3uxm,1rkbtz,explainlikeimfive,hot,19

adlauren,"I don't know enough about collars to ELI5, but I know puts and stop losses are both tools used when an investor anticipates the stock will drop in value. 

A stop loss order of 10% under purchase price of an investment is the investor saying ""I think a 5-10% fluctuation in this security is normal, but any more than that I'm not comfortable with and would prefer to sell rather than hold it.""  From what I've seen, it's usually used when the investor typically is pretty involved in day to day, but plans to be less involved in the future and wants a fail safe against a drop down the line.

A put option is the right to sell an agreed quantity at a certain price for a certain amount of time. This can be purchased independently of the actual stock and is you paying a certain amount per stock or per contract (covering 100 shares) in exchange for the right to sell X amount at Y price for Z amount of time. 

Put options are a good hedge or an investment tool for people who believe a stock is overvalued or will drop soon. An example would be paying $2 a share to buy a put option giving you the right to sell 100 shares at $30 within the next 30 days. The cost of the put option would be 100*$2 or $200. 

The ""strike price"" in this case is $30. If the stock was selling at $30 (and your put is for $30) when you purchased the option, then it drops to $20, you can now buy 100 shares at $20, then immediately sell at $30 using your put. The profit would be the sell price of $3000 ($30*100) less the purchase price of $2000 ($20*100) less the amount you paid for the put ($200) for a total profit of $800. 

This differs from shorting a stock in that your total risk at any time would be only $200, the cost of the put option, rather than risking a bigger loss by shorting at $30 and having to buy and return to your broker at $40 (-$1000) if the stock goes up instead of down.

dazfive,"A collar is a method of attempting to make money on a purely options play. It is used separate from any position on the stock. There are many strategies like this, and are often named other types of buzz words (calender spread, Iron Butterfly, etc). They are fancy names for taking a position on both puts and calls, long and/or short, in an attempt to profit while mitigating risk.  

As for when to use options, unless you are a sophisticated investor, never. The options game can be dangerous, but as well lucrative (I am an options trader).  I use options to make money, usually as a seller (or writer).  The best use of options for an average investor is to protect against downside, or lock in a profit. If you are long ABC and its has gone up sharply (I would say just sell), but if you want to participate in more upside, while ensuring some profit, you can buy and out of the money put. This put give your the right (but not the obligation) to sell at that (strike) price, regardless of where the stock is trading. 

options can also be used as a cheap method to play in a stock.  IF you think AAPL is going to rise, you can buy an out of the money call, which gives you the right to purchase the stock at that price, regardless of where it trades. Effectively, if the stock goes up you can sell the call, as opposed to exercising the option to purchase the stock.  An out of the money call may only cost $5 per share, rather than the $500+ to buy the actual stock.  WARNING:  options have an expiry date and are subject to what is known as time decay.  The closer the expiry, without the equity moving towards your strike, the faster the price of the option will drop. This can be a tricky game to play. 

I hope this helps.   ",null,1,cdo6gha,1rkcbx,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
ostifari,"Options are best used by non professionals as a hedge against bets that they have already made on stocks, and as a way to cheaply enter the market without a whole lot of risk.

PUTS gain value as its underlying stock goes DOWN in value.

CALLS gain value as its underlying stock goes UP in value.

Options contracts are written (aka bought and sold) in the same bid/offer manner that stocks are traded. One buyer, one seller, agreeing on one price.

Options expire weekly and monthly. For learning purposes, lets say Weekly options expire every Friday, Monthly Options expire on the 3rd Friday of each Month. Option are listed and are available to buy for up to 39 months before they expire, depending on the corresponding Stock. All Stocks have different, and often confusing, pricing and issuing for Options due to factors like volatility and time decay, 2 things that you'll have to look up more in depth independently, and are the cause of the price fluctuation in my second example below. 

Options are issued at what is called a 'Strike Price'. General Electric, (GE), for example, has 44 different Options for the month of December, 2 at each Strike price, ranging from $12 - $31 Strikes - One for the PUT, one for the CALL.

GE stock is at $26.80. A few of the relevant 'Strike Prices' and cost for that particular GE Options-

25 Call  --- cost 1.85

26 Call  --- cost 0.97

27 Call  --- cost 0.33


22 Put  --- cost 0.03

21 Put  --- cost 0.02

20 Put  --- cost 0.01

When buying a Call Option, you are essentially *buying the RIGHT* to own the Stock at the Strike Price. So, if you buy a '25 Call' Option, you are paying 1.85 for the right to *exercise* the Option, which turns the Option into shares of Stock, for an additional $25 (or $26 or $27, depending on whatever the Strike Price is). So, it would be like paying $25 + $1.85 = $26.85 for a Stock worth $26.80 right now. Why would you pay that extra .05 (which is also refereed to as a 'Premium')? Because if the stock has bad news and plummets to $21, your Option would be worthless, $0.00, and you will lose your $1.85. However, if you had instead bought the Stock at $26.80, and NOT the option, You would've lost $5.80, ($26.80 - $21).

Now lets look at the change in Option Prices with such a dramatic drop in Stock Price.

25 Call  --- cost 0.03

26 Call  --- cost 0.02

27 Call  --- cost 0.01


22 Put  --- cost 1.10

21 Put  --- cost 0.35

20 Put  --- cost 0.08

Notice now that the Puts have gained value and the Calls have lost value. The 22 Put, which is now 'in the money', has increased almost 40 fold in value, and will continue to gain a penny for every penny the Stock loses in value. The Calls are almost worthless because the move hasn't gone in their favor. A wise investor who owns a lot of Stock in GE would want to have bought many of the 20, 21 and 22 Put Options when they just pennies each. Now that his investment in the Stock has taken a blow, he is covered on the downside by owning Puts, which gain as much value as the stock loses, once the Option is in the money. If the Stock goes to $10, the 22 Put will then be worth $12.00. ($22-$10=$12)

Now lets look at a completely different hypothetical situation. 

I'm looking at the $10 CALL options in each of the months of NOV, DEC, JAN, and FEB. The Stock is at $9.50. All the people that own these options believe that the stock will go above $10 at some point between now and the 3rd Friday of the Month that the option expires. Obviously, as time slowly moves on without any big move in the Stock, investor confidence that the stock will hit that certain number go lower. With that said, the prices are:

Nov. 10.00 Option --  .05  

Dec. 10.00 Option --  .08  

Jan. 10.00 Option --  .12  

Feb. 10.00 Option --  .23 

If you could SELL the DEC $10 Call for $0.10, and BUY the JAN for $0.10, it would cost $0 to complete the transaction. Buy one, sell one, same price. The Prices are at $0.08 and $0.12 respectively, but in an open market, there is room to barter. Buy the better, further out Call, and sell the worse, soon to expire Call for the same price. Imagine doing this 100 times. You own 100 Jan 10 Call, and you are -100 (short) Dec 10 Call.

As the stock moves, all of these prices move. And not only are the prices moving, but people confidence steps up. If the stock goes from 9.50 up to 9.75, suddenly it seems like it MIGHT get to $10. The person with the JAN 10 Call is going to be more sure of it than the guy with the DEC 10 Call because he has a whole extra Month to work with his Option. So suddenly, after a quick move, the prices look like this:

Nov. 10.00 Call --  .25  

Dec. 10.00 Call --  .38 

Jan. 10.00 Call --  .52  

Feb. 10.00 Call --  .73 

So, now we own 100 JAN, and I need to buy back my short -100 DEC 10 Calls. 

Let's review our position -

(BUY 100 JAN  at .10) cost: $1,000  (SELL 100 DEC at .10) net: $1,000. Balance - $0

Later that same day, after the Stock moved from $9.50 - 9.75 -

(SELL 100 JAN at .50) net: $5,000  (BUY 100 DEC at .40) cost: $4,000

It costs us .50 cents per option that we buy or sell. We bought 100, sold 100, then sold 100, then bought back 100 = 400 total contracts, $200 fee.

COSTS: $4000 to buy back DEC, (50 cents per option x 400 options = $200.) $4000 + $200 = $4200

NET: $5000 to SELL Jan

$5,000- $4200 = $800 profit.

If the Stock never makes a move, all of our Options will be worth $0.00 once it's their day to expire. We let them all expire, the positive position will eliminate the negative position, and we do NOT exercise our right to buy the Stock. Our cost is $100 for 200 contracts transacted at .50 each. And we go home sad and frustrated.

Fairleee,"The first thing to understand is the geography of the United Kingdom. Ireland is an island lying off the coast of Great Britain (which comprised England, Scotland and Wales). Historically, Ireland was under British rule from 1801, and subject to numerous invasions by the English prior to them establishing rule. In the early 1900s, a successful Home Rule (i.e., independence) movement arose, and Ireland became independent shortly after the end of WW1, with the exception of the top part of the country - Northern Ireland, which opted to remain part of the United Kingdom.

To put it simply, the main reason why Northern Ireland wanted to remain part of the UK was because much of the population were colonists from the UK, and were predominantly protestant. This group is known as the ""Unionists"", because they want to remain part of the ""Union"" of the United Kingdom. There was a smaller, native population, that was predominantly Catholic, that wanted to split from the UK so the whole country was part of the Republic of Ireland - this is known as ""nationalism"" (as they are Irish nationalists), or ""republicanism"" (as they want to join the Irish republic).

So, the Unionists see themselves as British, and the Nationalists see themselves as Irish. However, as the majority of Northern Ireland's population are Unionists, it is unlikely that Ireland will unify with Northern Ireland. Because the two groups are also split along religious lines (protestants and catholics), this adds an extra element to the situation.

The Troubles were at their worst from the late 60s onwards, and numerous people were killed and injured. The UK deployed part of its army to permanent duty in Northern Ireland, and radical nationalist groups carried out a number of terrorist attacks in both Northern Ireland and the UK - in 1979 the IRA, a nationalist paramilitary group, managed to kill the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten with a bomb. Both Unionists and Nationalists were responsible for a lot of awful violence in Northern Ireland itself, and the British Army didn't always help matters - Bloody Sunday is a particularly notorious example, where the army killed a number of unarmed protestors. In recent years the Troubles have become less severe, and the IRA has officially announced a ceasefire, and no longer engages in bombings or terrorist attacks. This is actually one of the lasting legacies of the last Labour government, and Mo Mowlam, a Labour politician, is credited as being a major force behind the peace process (she was the Secretary for Northern Ireland at the time). The Republic of Ireland has largely acknowledged Northern Ireland's existence, and it has been established that if unification is to occur, it has to be ratified by both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, sectarian violence still does continue, as there is a long, long history of violence in Northern Ireland, and feuds are still ongoing.

So, why is Catholicism and Protestantism relevant? Well, the fact that the two political positions (unionism and nationalism) were also largely split down religious lines was significant, because it is an obvious marker of difference. This is similar to how tribal affiliations in various other nations can be used to justify conflict. Religion is often a very important part of a person's life as it can play a large role in how they define themselves, so anyone who is not part of your religion is automatically an outsider. In Northern Ireland, the protestant and catholic communities have largely self-segregated - in Belfast for example, people know whether an area is Protestant or Catholic. So, it was not the primary cause of the Troubles, but it was another complicating factor.

I hope this answer has been helpful; please note that, bearing in mind this is an ELI5, I have simplified a lot of the issues. The fact is that the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland is very, very complex, so if you are interested in finding out more, the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) on Northern Ireland would be a good place to start.

BassoonHero,"**SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS for The Avengers and Thor**

On a surface level, your summary is mostly correct. (Although Captain America, not Thor, is considered to be the leader of the Avengers.) The Avengers is, at its heart, a big-budget action movie pitting a band of superheroes against an evil villain and his army. That's not to say that there isn't any more to it, of course.

Loki's apparent motivation in the movie was simple: to rule Earth. A simple enough motivation, and a very common one, and the characters in the movie accepted it. However, many fans believe that Loki never really wanted to rule the Earth. He wanted to rule Asgard, and never really cared about the Earth. When he sent the Destroyer to Earth in Thor, it was to kill his brother, heir to the throne of Asgard. He didn't care one way or the other what happened to the Earth's people. But in The Avengers, he suddenly wanted to rule the Earth? Perhaps it was a consolation prize of sorts, since he couldn't have Asgard, but this didn't seem to be in character for him.

So the fans speculated that Loki's scheme was some kind of ruse or diversion. Like pretty much everything else he'd ever done or said. The post-credits scene implies that he was working with Thanos (red face guy), leader of the Chitauri (the alien invaders). When Loki is openly working with someone, chances are he has already betrayed them and is already plotting to betray the next guy. So what did Loki want from Thanos, if not to rule the Earth? There's a lot of speculation. We don't know what Loki had been doing between the end of Thor and The Avengers. What we do know is that at the end of The Avengers, Loki returned to the world he desired to rule. If his plan was to rule the Earth, then it failed, but if it was to rule Asgard, then the events he set into motion put him exactly where he wanted to be – just like his ""capture"" in front of the opera house put him in the helicarrier.",null,0,cdod6wt,1rkhxo,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

gamesterdude,"A disk drive can tell the difference between a burnt disk (something you made at home) and a pressed disk (something made in the factory) because of the small differences in the disk. Because of the differences the disks have a header that tells a computer what type of disk it is so it knows how to read it correctly. 

Bonus - So when modding modern consoles like the 360, you had to load custom firmware onto the dvd drive that told it to not freak out if it noticed the disk was a burned disk. ",null,4,cdo6iab,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,hot,19
Magn3s1um,"The xbox and the ps3 both use headers/special disks that can be checked for authenticity.  When loading a game from the disc, it checks to make sure that these sections (which cannot be burned to using commerical tools) are correct.  It also checks region to make sure the disc is in the correct region (idk why they even do this anymore.  Just let me play whatever the hell I want).  

The gamecube was different because it used different discs (those small ass ones) and burned the data backwards I believe.  The wii just burns the data backwards (spins the disc the opposite way as everything else), which means it is harder to create a replica of the disc.  Also, you'd have to hack the firmware to bypass any checks/region locks still.  

They all do region checks, so basically to get around the checks, you'd have to change the disc drive firmware.  On the xbox360, some of them were easy because they stuck a samsung (or liteon, can't remember) in there with special firmware, and someone ended up finding the commercial driver for that disc drive and were able to put the firmware on there instead of the firmware that does auth checks.  There were like 4 different drives that could have been in the xbox360, and I think only a couple of them had parallel drivers that could be put over the xbox 360.  Also, they had to modify the operating system (you'd have to format your drive with a special modified xbox 360 operating system on your hard drive that would bypass checking that the firmware was a valid firmware).

The playstation 3 didn't really allow you to update the disc drive firmware I don't think until someone found a way to flash the NAND chips on some of the playstation 3s (not all of them could though). I think there was an OS hack in there as well, but I don't know much about modding the playstation 3, although I have been working on #rpcs3, so I know quite a bit about the internals, just not the operating system/hard ware exploits.  

There's also some chips you can buy that you solder onto the motherboards.  What these chips do is intercept these authenticity checks and then send back the correct data.  Really not worth it and they're detectable (I think at the hardware level consoles can tell/do stuff to discover them) so its really a shot in the dark with those.

ampellang,"Ok, I will explain how copy protection works on PS1 and PS2, since that's what I am well versed on, but I can't say definitively how it works on other consoles.

So to start, you have to understand that the tracks on CD/DVDs are not a perfect spiral.  There is a ""wobble"", which is that the track itself moves back and forth in a sine wave perpendicular to the direction of the track.  This ""wobble"" is 15 kilohertz and some change, IIRC.  The tracks exist independently of the data, which is to say, when you buy a blank disc, the track, with its wobble, is already there.  A Playstation game changes the wobble slightly on the lead-in (the part of the track closest to the center where that the drive uses to orient itself prior to reading any data).  So when the head is orienting itself on the lead-in, it follows the wobble of the track.  By measuring voltage and impedance of the motor that runs the head, the system is able to determine exactly how fast the head is moving back and forth, and determine that it is different from a normal 15khz.  If the wobble is exactly correct, a analog-to-digital converter circuit then sends the okay (this depends on the region, for America the chip sends hex the representation of ""SCEA"") to the CPU and allows the game to be played.

This is why it is still impossible to play burned games on a PS1 without modifying the console in some fashion.",null,0,cdod1s9,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,hot,3
IntHatBar,"Many methods of copy protection have been invented and cracked over the years.  An example: PlayStation 1 (remember the black discs?) have a special CD Drive that can read data from a track on the disc that is not accessible using standard CD drives.  The drive seeks to this special spot (near the center of the disc) and reads a special code from this track to verify game is legit.  Hackers quickly found ways to get around this.  The most prolific solution was to modify the PS1 to intercept the signal and respond with the appropriate code.  This logic was built into a small integrated circuit and sold online as device allowing users to verify ""backup"" discs.  If one has the 'mod chip' installed in the PS1, he/she can simply copy an original black disc using a typical CD burner then play it on the modified PS1.

When you ask your operating system to make a copy of a disk, you are essentially saying ""please take data from here and put it there in whatever way you please""

When copying, operating systems don't generally *write to a specific track or sector* on the disk. Often the native copy command, can't for instance write to track 1, sector 1 specifically. 

So when the creator makes the disk he puts a code right in that spot.  If that code is not there when the software starts up (the s/w checks with a low level command, ""is there an X on track 1, sector 1) it knows it's a copy.

Obamacare ""ACA"" is a controversial piece of legislation that wasn't even passed under a regular legislative process, but rather late at night, under a budgetary process. No debate, no reading, no discussion, just ""pass it to see what's in it."" (Nancy Pelosi, 10:30pm D-CA)
No one has read it in full, yet SCOTUS decided to uphold it. As the time passes, We The People find out about more and more of ""what is in it."" only 212 people in the House (All outgoing Democrats, most which aren't in the House anymore) voted for it, 34 Democrats opposed it and all Republican/Opposition opposed it. It was a [unilaterally enacted, single party](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml) legislation, highly unpopular, even at the time of early 2009, amid recession.
Obamacare ACA is the only ""law"" or ""tax"" (depends on who you talk to, how they chose to defend it) that will not be modifiable by future Congress (We The People) past the year 2017. This, in itself, is unconstitutional. No law, including the US Constitution itself is immune from change, by future legislation. In addition, we are now finding out that even churches need to start providing funding for contraceptives and abortions. Reason why SCOTUS rewrote it and called it a ""tax"" and thus legal. This ""tax"" raises approximately a Trillion dollars (~$1,000,000,000,000) for the Federal Government. Democrats call this ""deficit reduction through tax, [as featured in CNN.""](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/25/fact-check-repealing-obamacare-adds-to-deficit/)
 Most people are smart enough to form their own opinion, there are many other ways of reducing deficit (like, how about.. STOP SPENDING. Reduce spending, quit subsidizing corporations?)
But it's OK,..because [LOOOK! FREE CONDOMS!!](http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obamacare-event-hands-out-condoms-prizes_769034.html)

Government cannot compete with free markets where consumers make millions of decisions every day thus resulting in an efficient market. Free markets come up with innovations and products that consumers buy every day, as competitive free markets should. This drives down costs, drives up competition. Net benefit is the consumer, reflected in lower prices and high availability. Any industry. Placing limits, rules and regulations on the aforementioned results in ""unintended consequences"" such as, higher prices, cancellations, calls for reform, etc.

There never was a ""free market"" in US medical care, even prior to ACA Obamacare. There always were numerous barriers to entry, regulations, licensing, fines and rules and therefore little competition. (read: Runaway healthcare costs.) Gov’t has been in healthcare business far too long.
If this were not true, if you think you may have sprained your ankle, you could go to your local x-ray tech shop, pay for service, for a look-see. Instead, government mandates that you see ""a licensed physician with an X-ray interpretation."" Why? Because over the years, lawsuits and subsequently the government bans have pretty much deleted any entrepreneurs from offering such services, under the guise: ""for your safety.""
So now, *for your safety*, because most people are stupid, and most companies are evil and most doctors are greedy.. *for your safety*, ""the Government will be running healthcare"" the best way the government knows how. Like DMV, IRS or any other agency you'd rather not deal with, but need.
In summation, this is just a beginning. More cancellations are to follow. We now live under a government where the Executive branch has apparently seized the power reserved for Congress (writing laws) and as such, Executive branch has modified ACA Obamacare 18 times so far without any congressional input. The so called ""employer mandate delay"" was one such example. This was delayed for after the midterm elections next year, because once the employer mandate hits businesses, upwards of 70 million people could receive further cancellations, according to who you talk to. We shall see.

Do an experiment- tear up a piece of bread and toast a piece of bread in a toaster, and crumble it up. How much space does the toast take up compared to the torn up piece of raw bread? Much less..  The raw bread is also lower in sodium and fat, but we'll get to that...

When you toast the bread, you are doing several things to increase the likelihood of successfully smashing multiple sammiches. First, you're evaporating the water in the bread, decreasing its density, mass and volume, but more importantly you're adding the ""love"" by adding salt and fat through the cheese/butter/oil..

On a single threaded webserver, or a smaller website where special considerations are not taken into account this would not happen.

BassoonHero,"As has been noted, E and B do have sharps – F and C. This really isn't any different than C sharp being the same note as D flat.

But why are B and C closer together than C and D? The answer is that there are twelve distinct ""pitch classes"" in western music, but seven in a ""diatonic"" scale such as the C Major scale. When notation was being standardized, the C Major scale became the ""default"", and the seven pitch classes in that scale got simple names, whereas the other five pitch classes have to be referred to via flat/sharp names.

But why does the diatonic scale have seven notes? You can arrange the pitch classes in the C Major scale (or any diatonic scale) so that each is separated from its neighbor by the interval of a ""fifth"": (F, C, G, D, A, E, B). This is, in fact, more or less how the scale was defined. Why seven notes? Because this is the smallest scale that will contain every interval. Chop off a pitch class at either end, and you cannot form the ""tritone"" (six semitones). Chop off one more and you cannot form a single semitone.

Science is a different story. People shout from the roof tops that evolution is true because it is. It's reality. To deny it is to deny reality, and you are declaring yourself to live in a fantasy if you don't accept the science. Over a century of study has gone into this and there is no debate. All of biology, genetics, bio chemistry, taxonomy, and medicine is founded on evolution. To deny evolution is as bad as denying gravity. It's that fundimental. You're just as loony.

The only reason evolution is denied in Christian societies is due to poor interpretation of the religious scripture, which, when read incorrectly, could be strictly interpreted that everything was made and is unchanging, despite the Catholics officially decreeing that evolution is in no way incompatible with the scripture, and that we do witness evolution in nature (takes a few decades of study).

There is a very clear line between belief and acceptance, of theology and science. You can believe whatever you want, theologically, but when the science is done and it demonstrates the undeniable facts, should your theology contradict the science, the theology is wrong.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"So, everyone who receives income pays taxes on that income, whether or not they ""work"" or ""make any"" which are actually very difficult things to define when you look at them closely, and impossible to administer or,police in a large scale. 

But, basically the tax code says that all money you receive is taxable, unless something in the millions of pages of tax code, regulations, revenue letters, court rulings, and other sources.  

Essentially, every rich person pays a lot in taxes on income that they actually receive with one glaring exception -- municipal,bond investment income is totally tax free, regardless of amount received, total income, or wealth.  

So, for example, if I out $1 billion into municipal bonds that pay me an average of 5% per year! then I keep my billion plus I received $50 million in income every single year -- totally tax free.   By contrast, if instead of lending the billion to some local,government, I lend that money to a local private company for 5%, then I will still keep my billion (assuming the company doesn't fail), I will make my $50 million per year in interest income, and I will pay about 40% of that -- almost $20 million every single year -- in federal taxes plus state taxes (as high as an additional 12% or $6 million in some states).  

So, municipal bond interest income is the only real total tax code scam that wealthy people can use to actually receive,muse, and consume income while spying zero taxes. If Americans were actually educated about this, it would go away immediately.  But both political parties tolerate this game while pointing out totally irrelevant stuff and meaningless but heated sloganeering.  In addition to giving people a free ride, this municipal bond income exemption also forces residents of fiscally sound states to subsidize the fiscally reckless states, which just encourages the fiscally reckless states and their voters to tolerate fiscally reckless behavior.  

All forms of investment income, rental income, non-municipal interest income, and corporate income are heavily taxed or, where deductions exist, they were consciously chosen for public policy reasons to encourage specific behavior, such as research and development, charitable giving, expanding capital plant and equipment, exploration, construction, and similar behavior.  

I'd say that the mortgage interest deduction is also,a scam, but it primarily benefits existing home owners at the expense of renters and effectively subsidizes the realtors, mortgage bankers, and home builders.  

Edit -- literally thousands of pages can be written about how horrible the tax system is and why a corrupt federal government -- with both parties conspiring -- refuses to make it simpler and only keeps making it more complicated.

FellowConspirator,"I presume that this question specifically relates to the GAO report on the purchase of 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition by the Department of Homeland Security in 2012. That number of rounds is about 3 times what the US military used over the 8 years in Iraq. DHS was also cited for purchasing a large number of hollow-point rounds, which cost almost twice as much as full metal jacket rounds. That ammo was purchased specifically by and for the DHS without intent to share with other government agencies (like the military).

The official explanation for the purchase from the DHS was: we need ammo and it's cheaper to purchase in bulk. No explanation for the purchase of hollow-point ammunitions was given. A spokesman said ""With more than 100,000 armed law enforcement personnel in DHS, significant quantities of ammunition are used to support law enforcement operations, quarterly qualifications, and training, to include advanced firearms training exercises.""

The GAO is investigating. Conspiracy theorists suggest that it may be a scheme to reduce gun violence by tying up the ammo manufacturers, causing shortages and increasing prices (there were shortages and increased prices, that part was true). However, the most likely scenarios are: someone did it just because they could, or someone had a financial or political interest tied to the manufacturers.

Maybe they're drastically changing their training program, but they haven't said that and probably wouldn't tell us if that's the case.

Maybe you're asking why the bank doesn't get that $50,000 though?  The bank isn't technically the owner of the house.  I'm the owner of the house.  The bank just holds my debt of $80,000.  The mortgage agreement includes a provision that if I fail to pay they can take the house and sell it to recover the money.  However by law they can only collect the $80,000 owed to them.  If they foreclose and sell for $100,000 they'll take $80,000 and give $20,000 back to me.",null,0,cdo65ai,1rkmg0,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

Now let's say that the market improves, and I manage to sell the house for $230,000.  $160,000 of that is used to pay off the mortgage, and the remaining $70,000 is mine to keep, which offsets all of my payments to date, ($40,000), with a $30,000 profit.",null,0,cdo65bf,1rkmg0,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

*The equity is the part of the house that you own with your own money*.

Now over the next 5 years, you payments to the loan, your moneylender charges you interest on money still owing. You managed to stay ahead of your payments and reduced your loan to $70,000, and your house has increased in value to $105,000.

bahanna,"""The average family income in 1901 was about $1,200.""^[1](http://books.google.com/books?id=L-JCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA293&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;dq=median+us+household+income+1909) At that time, the Ford Model T cost $850.^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Price) So, that equates to 70.8% of annual income.

Since the Tesla Model S starts at $62,400^[3](http://www.teslamotors.com/models/facts) with a median US incomes are about $50k^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States) for a rate of 124.8% of annual income, you do have a point that Tesla's are relatively more expensive. They don't cater to lower-middle class, but rather the upper-middle - or at least those willing to reach beyond their means. 

Indeed by the 1920, the price of Model Ts fell to $260,^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Price) and while - due to the great depression - incomes were only at $1,500,^[4](http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/learning_history/children_depression/depression_children_menu.cfm) this still ran as little as about 17.3% of annual income.

However, it was not uncommon for cars to sell for a lot more. To start, by the time Fords had dropped to $500, a Chevrolet ran $850.^[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Baby_Grand) The 1910 National advertised at $2,500^[6](http://www.chuckstoyland.com/national/19101914/) or 208.3% average annual income. Baker automobiles ranged from $1,600 to $4,000 (roughly 130% to 330%).^[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Motor_Vehicle) A 1928 Duesenberg would have set you back $11,000 after having a coach made for it,^[8](http://www.howstuffworks.com/1928-1934-duesenberg-j-series.htm) which is something like $145,000 in current dollars.^[9](http://www.westegg.com/inflation/)

The difference is, you can't buy 22 mid-range cars (now referring to the Model A) for $145,000. Gasoline economy cars can be purchased in the high teens (Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla), but certainly not the $8,500 that 17%-of-annual-income would equate to. To stick with mid-range cars (and thus compare apples to apples as best we can) we need to look at a Toyota Avalon Hybrid or Ford Fusion Energi which sell for $37-38k.^[10](http://www.truecar.com/) Ultimately, the issue is much like /u/AnteChronos stated, compared to a $40k car is a $60k only for the wealthy?

The sensation you might feel that ""both of those are expensive"" is really quite accurate, albeit a bit backwards. As I've already noted, you can't buy 22 new mid-rage cars for $145k. Indeed, for that to be the case, then they'd have to cost $6,600 and **no** new car costs that little. In fact, the $145k is really more like 40k * 22 = $880k, which only barely gets you into the realm of ""super cars""^[11](http://exoticcars.about.com/od/toptens/tp/MostExpensiveCars.htm) that can seriously be compared to a Duesenberg. 

It's not that a $60k car is for the wealthy (if a Mclaren SLR is an A to the Bugatti's A+, and a Ford Focus is a D-, then a Tesla is priced like a D but looks and performs like a C+.), but that wealth is less equitably distributed now than it was in the 1920s.^[12](http://www.cbpp.org/images/cms/11-28-11pov-f3.jpg) The money still goes further, but someone else has all the money.

From 2008 to 2012, GM sold 12,379,944 vehicles. 

http://i.imgur.com/3Q2wkDg.png

You can't drive across the country and find a parking log full of unsold, brand new Tesla Roadsters every 5 miles, but you can do that with GM, Chevrolet, Ford, Chrysler, etc.  Tesla's are essentially built to order at this point, so the supply is at an extreme low, demand is high enough from the people that can readily afford it, and being that Tesla doesn't have decades of design to build upon, the R&amp;D cost is high, they're a small company and can't afford maximizing their bulk material discounts, so the price is high.  When they start selling more, and they increase production to increase supply and the demand is satisfied, the price will decrease, not only due to higher supply and lower demand, but the decreased costs to produce the vehicle that comes from being a bigger company, reusing part designs from the previous year (eliminating huge chunks of R&amp;D), and so on. 

Think of the Nintendo Wii.  It came out at a certain higher price, everyone wanted one, they didn't have enough to sell to everyone in the beginning.  When they had enough to have constant stock for periods of time, they dropped the price.  When the demand became too low, they created the Wii U, hoping for the same cycle, but it didn't seem to work out too great.  Alternatively, the XboxOne is $500 now, but for the next year it'll stay that price, then slowly decrease in price of the next 7 years or so until it's $150, everyone has one, and they put out the next gen Xbox.",null,0,cdoami6,1rkmxp,explainlikeimfive,hot,1
panzerkampfwagen,"When WW2 ended the 2 big kids on the block were the USA and the USSR (many incorrectly refer to the latter as Russia).

They had been allies during WW2 but that alliance was due to the whole, ""Enemy of my enemy thing,"" and not because they were natural allies.  After the war ended the USA wanted the lands it captured, along with the Western Allies of the Allies, to become democracies.  The USSR wanted the territories it captured to become socialist.  This caused a divide between the 2 Superpowers.  

The next almost half century was filled with both Superpowers trying to increase their spheres of influence around the world.  It's where the terms ""First World"", ""Second World"" and ""Third World"" come from.  The First World were those aligned with the USA, the Second World those aligned with the USSR and the Third World was those aligned with neither.  It was the Third World (it didn't actually mean undeveloped) were the countries both sides tried to convince to join them.

As both Superpowers ended up with huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons they realised that fighting each other directly was a bit out of the question, so they either fought proxy wars with each other (they'd supply guns, etc to 1st and 2nd world nations and let them duke it out) or one side would get involved in a war between two 1st and 2nd world nations, like in the Vietnam War.  The other side would then send aid to the side aligned with them.

This continued until the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.  ",null,1,cdo6hhq,1rknqj,explainlikeimfive,hot,23
suspiciousface,"In the 1950s, the world was entering a new ice age. The USSR planned to re-heat the world using love and communism, based on research done by captured Nazi scientists shortly after the end of WWII. If this plan failed, the USSR was going to simply relocate to North America to escape the deadly cold.

This was obviously unacceptable, for a number of reasons. America was already having huge problems with ""hippies"", the slang term for evil communist agents. ""Free Love"" was promoted, as microwave ovens were quite expensive, so the communist plan would have less negative impact on the common man. If the entire population of the USSR arrived in America as planned, they could use democracy's one weakness against it and simply vote a communist party into power, abolishing democracy, capitalism, and the American dream. 

Canada wasn't a big part of the cold war because we were democratic and had already massed our population on the US border in case things got too cold in the Great White North. 

America had also captured Nazi scientists, but instead of communism, they intended to fix the ""global cooling"" problem by finding a way to turn on all the microwave ovens in the world at the same time, with the doors open. Due to the lack of microwave oven related information available in the world at the time, this would be impossible until after the problem had been solved.

The Cuban Missile Crisis came about as several countries had turned to the communist side with the USSR. Unfortunately, love and communism had not yet caused the world to heat up, and desperate times call for desperate measures. Cuba determined that the moon's reflected sunlight was outweighed by the sunlight blocked when the moon was between Earth and the Sun. Their solution:

Blow up the Moon.

America had already been investigating methods of capturing ""moon heat"" and transporting it back to Earth. Obviously this would be impossible if the moon was blown up, and America wanted to use the Cuban missiles to launch giant microwave ray guns into space, to better be able to microwave the planet.

Things were very tense for a while, as blowing up the moon would mean disaster for coastal cities, and the ice age was progressing faster than previously predicted. The USSR was becoming increasingly aware that democracy and the microwave-method was directly inhibiting their communist ideals. The solution was to concentrate all the microwave emissions directly on democratic nations like the US, warming the planet and frying their enemies simultaneously. Getting wind of these plans, the US had the rather unimaginative idea of doing the exact same thing to the USSR, but first.

Various different interest groups in the USSR didn't really want to zap the US, or get zapped for that matter. They broke off and descended closer to the mantle, a warmer section of the Earth. This is also where Atlantis and Zion (from the Matrix trilogy) are located. 

Anyways, the whole thing was more or less wrapped up by teenagers who discovered that they could create aerosol flamethrowers that look totally badass. In the process and rising popularity of this practice, enough CFCs were released into the atmosphere to warm it up, halting the impending ice age.

Unfortunately, this made the Earth into something of a ""greenhouse"", so now armies of trees advance on human civilization, and we have to cut down vast forests daily just to protect ourselves. There is a lot of tension in the Middle East because pieces of the moon were transported there in secret after the first moon landing. Plants are allergic to moon-rock, which is why there are no plants on the moon, and also why the Middle East has fewer, and stranger, plants.

The US maintains interest there currently due to ""towel-heads"", a derogatory term meant to ridicule those still interested in blowing up the moon. Being that these people still live on the surface, and wear regular fabrics, the term ridicules their lack of helmets/protective gear, other than turbans and ceremonial daggers, which obviously would not protect one from falling moon-bits.

The moon is also where heaven is, so the US is still very vehemently opposed to blowing it up. The rise of secular America has resulted in the beginnings of a process that will allow California to separate and sink to the Mantle, where it will join Atlantis, Zion, and the USSR separatists.

Many aspects of this have been criticized or explored through popular culture. For example, Star Wars: A New Hope was a thinly veiled warning of what may come if we allowed the moon-exploders to accomplish their goals.

CoolStoryJohn,"WWII ended with two primary power brokers: the U.S. and USSR.  Both countries were inherently distrustful of each other for two reasons: a) their systems of government (capitalist-democratic and socialist-communist) were significantly different, and b) after having fought a bloody, prolonged war together, both countries knew what the other nation was capable of militarily. 

 It really broke down to fear.  The U.S. wanted to cement its place in the world as the sole hyperpower, but the USSR threatened that designation by being so powerful itself.  While initially the USSR opposed the U.S. on more ideological grounds (the belief that capitalism was a true evil and the U.S. was the greatest exporter of this evil), that opposition grew less ideological by the end of WWII (less about the evils of capitalism and more about also wanting to be the world's sole hyperpower).  

As the post-WWII 20th century rolled on, a lot of the world took sides.  Most of eastern Europe and some South American countries allied themselves with the USSR and generally all of the western Democracies allied themselves with the U.S. (all other countries taking a ""wait and see"" stance--neutrality).  Both sides fought each other through what are now known as proxy conflicts.  In other words, the U.S. and USSR would find a conflict (often Democracy vs. Communism themed) in the world and each would support whichever side more favored their interests.  The side that won added credibility and power to whichever country supported them.  On top of these proxy conflicts, espionage was incredibly common, with USSR/allied spies in the west and U.S./allied spies in the east. 

Eventually, the west realized that the USSR had achieved a status that would result in mutually assured destruction (MAD) if they ever launched a nuclear strike at the east.  The USSR long had nuclear weapons, but MAD requires more than for both sides to just have atom bombs--there need to be nukes AND a delivery mechanism that cannot be disabled in the event of an attack (for example, the U.S. has planes flying and submarines operating 24/7 armed with nuclear missiles in the event of a nuclear attack on U.S. soil...so, if the U.S. is attacked, it will be able to offer a nuclear response regardless of how much damage it sustains).  Once the west realized that the USSR had mastered this delivery mechanism and MAD took effect, the chance of a direct armed conflict between the two sides (which one could argue would have been very likely if MAD was never achieved) diminished to about 0%.  The result was more proxy and more espionage until eventually the USSR more-or-less collapsed itself in the 90's (a very complicated issue itself) and the U.S./allies ""won"" the cold war.

dalevywasbri,"So before WW2 there were a multitude of competing powers. The most important of them were reliant on their past economic dominance for their position ie France and England. But the US is easily the largest economic power in the world before WW2 but has yet to be able to make in roads in to the rest of the world, that is to become a global power. And the USSR, while faltering, is a massive country with a lot of potential and tons of ideological prestige (Communism both before and after WW2 was a potent ideological power).
WW2 happens.
France, UK, Western Russia, Germany, Italy and Eastern europe are basically wastelands after the war. None of the former powers (Germany, France, UK or Italy) are psyched about abolishing capitalism and are therefore natural allies of the US. The US govt is looking around the world as all of these former colonies are falling - and obviously not all of them are naturally capitalistic- and so it wants to keep the peace and make more money. And The USSR at this time is under Stalin who is so paranoid he will kill anyone doing a good job. So it seemed to Americans that if we simply contain Communism in the Soviet Bloc give it a few years and the Soviets will fall and there will be even more markets to sell our goods.

So the first generation of US military planners are pretty cynical about this - The Soviets aren't close to taking over europe, they can barely keep the lights on.

The soviets, basically completely despite Stalin, start to recover and get some of their shit together. And The Second Generation of US military planners, in the 50's, are scared shitless of communism.

And then the Cuban missile crisis happens and the US military planners realize that this is somethin that they have to tread very lightly on and so tensions resolve. Money is great and all but if we kill all fauna on earth that would probably be bad for business.

Vietnam is just about making sure communism can't expand its market power and therefore its ability to make more military hardware.

And then Reagan's advisors were like ""you know what could make republicans win alot more electoral races? If we got money from arms manufacturers."" and so they brought the Cold war back from the grave.

And all the while since Stalin died the Communist leadership is so cynical about communism there is very little real work in trying to turn the world revolutionary - and effectively the Soviets are slowly getting less powerful.

shawnaroo,"They don't, but it's very common. During WWII, the government instituted wage freezes as part of the war economy, so companies offered potential employees various benefits in order to help hire good workers. One of the big benefits offered was health insurance. For better or worse (probably worse), it sort of stuck, and health insurance via employment became pretty standard since then. It even became subsidized, because the government offers various tax breaks to companies that provide health insurance to their employees.

One result of this has been that the health insurance marketplace for individuals has been a huge mess. Very complicated and very expensive. The ACA attempts to try and make the marketplace work better for individuals, but it's still in its early days and it's hard to say how well it will work in the long term.

sacundim,"Well, first of all, somebody has to sue them, and I don't think there are many such lawsuits.  I suspect there just aren't many people who are actually turned down because of ethnicity—because most white people simply don't apply for these jobs.

Second, I don't know about where you live, but here in the S.F. Bay Area the workforce at ethnic restaurants is more diverse than what your question would imply:

1. Most small restaurants hire Latino immigrants as bussers or line cooks—but rarely as waiters.  This includes plenty of Asian restaurants—my neighborhood ramen restaurant, for example, has a Japanese chef directing a team of mostly Central American line cooks.  The owner is Japanese as is the wait staff except for one half-Japanese (who speaks perfectly fluent Japanese).  Most of the clientele is recent Chinese immigrants and Asian-Americans.
2. A lot of ""Japanese"" restaurants here are actually owned and operated by other ethnicities—most commonly by Koreans.  The reason, as I understand it, is that Japanese food has better profit margins.  (And these restaurants again usually have Latino line cooks and bussers.)
3. There are exceptions to this, still—for example, there's a Vietnamese restaurant in my town where one of the wait staff is Latino; he started as a busser, but I think the restaurant owners realized the value of having a Spanish-speaking waiter.  The restaurant is next door to an Asian chain supermarket that actually has a very good Latino products section and attracts a Latino as well as an Asian clientele.  The employees there are roughly evenly split between Chinese and Latino, though only about 25% of the cashiers are Latino.

So actually, the discrimination question out here is rather about whether Latinos are excluded from wait staff jobs.  But certainly a lot of them are undocumented, so they're not suing…

**EDIT:** Another example in my town: Peruvian restaurant, owned by Peruvians, Peruvian chef with some Mexican line cooks.  Dishes in the $12-18 range; at first most of the clientele was middle class Spanish speakers, and all of the wait staff spoke Spanish as well.  But word got out and it became more popular among English speakers; nowadays most of the customers are English-only speakers, and they've hired several wait staff that don't speak Spanish.

Then there's the shabu-shabu restaurant that used to have mostly Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian wait staff, and Latino cooks…  The Japanese takeout corner shop with the Mexican guy who makes great oyakodon… etc.",null,7,cdo9frf,1rkphs,explainlikeimfive,hot,47
poisonous_crotch,"There is a lot of guessing and misinformation going on in this thread. Every business in the United States is subject to [Title VII of the Civil rights act of 1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_VII) if they have 15 or more employees unless they qualify for a bona fide occupational qualifier (BFOQ). 

Here is the criteria for a BFOQ as defined by legal precedence:

&gt;""To prove the bona fide occupational qualifications defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the ""essence"" or ""central mission of the employer's business,"" and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative.""

For example, private Catholic schools can require teachers to be Catholic in most cases since it is their mission to teach with Catholic values. I would find it difficult to believe a BFOQ would be granted to an ethnic restaurant when almost anyone can follow a recipe or take an order. It ultimately comes down to job duties and if a special trait is needed to perform essential functions. Most ethnic restaurants get off from this rule since they employee 15 people or less.

d3rp_h3rp,"As others have mentioned, a business can claim an exception to the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act if they employ fewer than 15 people, or if ethnicity is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). Although race, as in skin color, can never be part of a BFOQ, ethnicity can be. (Eg. French chef in a french restaurant.) The BFOQ exception is narrowly tailored, however. So an ethnic restaurant discriminating on the basis of ethnicity by only hiring chefs of the ethnicity in order to retain authenticity is probably acceptable, but only hiring servers or dishwashers of that ethnicity is probably closer to violating Title VII. 

Strictly within the letter of the law, many businesses engage in what could be considered illegal discrimination every day. Why does this still occur so frequently you may ask? Well first, you have to prove that you were discriminated against on the basis of your protected status. There are multitudes of obvious evidentiary problems in proving discrimination, especially that the discrimination was committed intentionally, not inadvertently. Second, the damages suffered by the aggrieved person are usually nominal. You didn't get the job as a dishwasher at that restaurant because you weren't the same ethnicity as them? Yeah, sounds discriminatory, and maybe it was. But what are you going to sue them for and expect to get from them? A few months pay maybe? Damages in these types of cases are usually so nominal that lawyers who practice this kind of law will not take your case. Lawyers who do take these cases do so on a volume basis. Ie. take as many of these cases as you can and send out letters to businesses threatening to sue unless they settle for a lesser value. Very rarely do these cases actually go to trial because of what it costs the lawyer in his or her time spent. Third, if you do go to trial, and the employer claims BFOQ or business necessity defense, there's even more chance that the employer may actually win, and the Plaintiffs lawyer gets nothing for all the time they just spent.

Sure, there's the Equal employment opportunity commission (EEOC), whose job it is supposed to be to enforce these laws, aside from private lawsuits, but the system basically works the same as a private lawsuit. The only difference is that the government pays the EEOC lawyer to investigate complaints and file lawsuits against employers, whereas the private lawyer only does so because of the potential to profit if they win. And when you think about how many Americans are clamoring about how the government is too big and spends to much money, you shouldn't be surprised to know that less than 5% of EEOC complaints result in some legal action, and the ones that do may take up to 4 years between initial complaint, and filing of a claim.

Finally, as mentioned initially, most restaurants like this are small businesses, so if they employ fewer than 15 people they can discriminate more or less all they want and it's not illegal. 

TL;DR It's usually not big enough of a deal for people who are discriminated against when they are not hired by an ethnic restaurant to sue over it. Legal fees will cost more than the potential reward if you win. The restaurant may also claim some exemptions under the law, so their discrimination is not per se illegal discrimination.",null,0,cdohpwl,1rkphs,explainlikeimfive,hot,3

Now, say you apply to be a server at one of these ethnic restaurants and get turn down. You think you would have gotten the job if it weren't for the fact that you were a particular national origin. 

After going through some administrative processes, you get in court. To prove your discriminatory claim in court you have to show 4 things. 

One of the things that you have to show is that you are qualified. Employers have what is known as a BFOQ defense( Bona Fide Occupational Qualification). An employer can show that it would not matter what national origin you are because you were not qualified for the job. Let's you get passed over for a server gig at a restaurant in El Paso, Texas. The restaurant owner decides to hire a person of Hispanic decent and could speak spanish fluently instead of you, a person who for this example is not of Hispanic decent and cannot speak spanish fluently. In court, the restaurant owners could show that even though you could perform the standard task of being a server, you could not perform the task of being a server in that restaurant, because the majority of the restaurant's clientele who patronize the establishment place their order's using the Spanish language, a language which you for this example do not speak. 

There is also what is known as a business necessity defense, whereby if a plaintiff shows statistic that imply the employer is discriminating, i.e all of the executives at an Alaskan fishery are white, while all the people working the boats are Eskimos, the employer may be able to show that despite this statistical disparity, the employer could only hire white people because none of the Eskimos were capable of handling executive task like accounting and budgeting.

DeathMadeTangible,"Supposedly, humans lose anywhere between 50-250 hairs a day, but the hair regrows so quickly that you would never know. It's only when we reach a certain age, that the hair regrowth cycle can not keep up with the amount of hair lost. Kind of like how skin cell regeneration can not keep up as we get older, thus we age. Other factors play into this equation such as hormonal production of testosterone (which causes destruction of the hair follicles) and in some people, this can manifest into something called ""androgenic alopecia."" 
Androgen = sex hormone. Androgenic alopecia does not only happen to middle-aged men, it can happen to post-pubescent boys and girls, as well as those in their 20s.  

Hair grows and sheds in 3 stages:

* Anaphase: Life cycle of 3-7 years. Numbers vary online, but something like 70 to 90% of your hair at any given time is in this category.

* Cataphase: Cycle of 3-4 months. Hair root (not the follicle) migrates closer to the surface of your skin. If you've ever tweezed/plucked a hair, you know that some hairs come out pretty easily and others HURT and will sometimes come with a little ""white ball"" at the end of the hair which was removed from the skin. This ""white ball"" is the hair root.

* Telophase: Cycle of 3-4 months when hair growth STOPS and is naturally forced outwards from the dermal layer and ""falls out.""  


Note: doing things such as trichotillomania, combing, brushing, braiding, forming dreadlocks, blow drying, shampooing, playing with your hair, all negatively affect the Anaphase cycle, which is why we sometimes see loose hairs in the shower or on our combs. This is usually not cause for alarm, but in some people, particularly men, it can be. There are shampoos especially formulated to stop hairloss, most people have heard of ""Rogaine."" Rogaine contains a chemical called Minoxidil, dilates blood vessels in the scalp and encourages hair regrowth in this way. Minoxidil is not effective for everyone, but has a pretty good success rate. Ironically, Minoxidil can actually make you LOSE hair faster by speeding up the Telophase cycle. In addition, Minoxidil compounds are often applied directly to the scalp and are formulated with alcohol as a preservative - which can destroy hair.  

However, there are alternatives which do not force your body to artificially restart Anaphase as much as they simply encourage a healthy scalp/hair follicle environment by using natural ingredients which improve blood circulation to the scalp and kill off pathogenic fungi/bacteria which can affect hair growth. One such shampoo is ""Regenpure"" and it does not contain Minoxidil.

Salacious-,"Let's do this chronologically.

There was a guy named Booker Dewitt. He fought at the Battle of Wounded Knee, killed a lot of indians, and felt really bad about it. After the battle, he found people being baptized in the river. At first he volunteered for the baptism.

Here, the universe splits. It becomes World A, in which Booker does not go through with the Baptism, and goes back to his life and becomes a strike buster. In World B, he becomes Zachary Comstock, remains in the military and goes to Columbia. 

Booker in World A eventually has a baby, Anna. Comstock, in world B, is unable to have a baby because of experiments done by Leteuce. Comstock in world B wants to have a baby, and Leteuce thinks that she can get him one from the world of her ""brother"" (who is really her in the alternate universe, similar to how Comstock/Booker are the same person). Booker has a ton of gambling debts but no way to pay off the debts, so Male Leteuce says he can pay off the debts by giving them his baby. He agrees to do that, and they take the baby, but Booker changes his mind and chases them. Leteuece gets Anna through the rift, but part of her pinky gets cut off and stays in Booker's world, meaning she exists in both World A and World B at the same time. This gives her the ability to open portals between worlds. These rifts can also span across various times (for example, in one early scene Elizabeth opens a rift to NYC, and the theater marquis shows ""Star Wars"" being played, even though it's only 1912 in the game).

Booker sinks into alcoholism and depression after losing his baby, carves her initials (AD) into his hand, and gets into more debt. Leteuce again offers to wipe away the debts, if he goes to this city and brings a certain girl to New York. He agrees, and they bring him out to Maine, and pass through a rift at some point without him knowing. He goes into the light house and goes up to Columbia, rescues Elizabeth from her tower, they flee the city, etc. Elizabeth is captured by Songbird and brought back to Comstock's house. Future version of Elizabeth brings Booker to the future and shows him what happened as a result of not having stopped Songbird from taking her, then sends him back to stop Songbird. Elizabeth opens a tear to Rapture (from Bioshock 1) and Songbird is killed by the water pressure. Then they go up to the lighthouse. Each lighthouse represents a ""World"" created by a choice (like, Booker's choice to get baptized or not). Each world branches off from many different important choices. Anna realizes that as long as there is a world in which Comstock exists, there will be a world in which she ends up destroying everyone using Columbia. So, she opens a tear and they go back to the moment where Comstock began: the baptism. There, the many versions of Elizabeth that had all reached the same conclusion meet up and drown Booker before he can become Comstock, thus preventing that horrible future from ever happening, and that's why they all disappear.",null,16,cdo79rg,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,hot,105

You are Booker. You, due to some issues, gave away your baby daughter. The trauma of this caused you some problems, and your memory of the incident appears to be a little shoddy.

Later, you are in debt. You are given an opportunity to find a girl and bring her back to wipe out the debt. You take it, and end up on a floating island where you are seen as an outsider and everyone loses their shit. You defend yourself and begin your trek towards the girl.

Many dead bodies later you find the girl. She wants to go to Paris. You want to wipe out your debt. Hilarity/violence ensues.

Meanwhile, her daddy Comstock wants to kill you, so the city is up in arms trying to turn you into liquid goop. The girl, Elizabeth, shows you she can open up tears between worlds/dimensions, and so you use them to get around. It's kind of cool, but a little creepy. 

Anyways, she gets captured, and you try to save her, fail, get a lecture from future Elizabeth, go back, get tossed around between dimensions for a while, and end up killing Comstock. You begin to realize there is something else going on, but that you have forgotten.

Cue flashback. Elizabeth is your daughter. Comstock is you in the future, but a unique future you whose nards are toasted by overusing a machine that opens tears like what Elizabeth can do. It's one of many futures in which you become Comstock. Not all futures end that way, but some do.

RexMundane,"Since the whole story rather confuses itself a few times, most of this is interpretation as much as anything, so grain of salt.

There was a man named Booker, and during the battle at Wounded Knee he did some very bad things. On his way home he stumbles on a baptism, and participates. But, at the last minute he resists, reasoning the bad things he's done can't be washed away in a moment and a prayer. 

He grows older, becomes bitter, taking a series of jobs working for ever harder and crueler men. He marries, but his wife dies in childbirth, and in time he sells his daughter Anna to a crime boss to pay for his gambling debts. Despondent with grief, cynicism, and drink, he loses himself in his misery and ultimately forgets any happy moment he ever knew, and there he remains for some 15 years or so.

Desperate again with gambling debts, he takes another job to rescue a young woman from a city called Columbia, which is made of buildings that float among the clouds, led by the prophet Zachary Hale Comstock. The young woman in question is Elizabeth, Comstock's daughter, locked in a tower, and is herself is a bit of a mystery, missing part of her little finger, uncommonly intelligent, and posessiong supernatural powers. 

Rescuing her, avoiding the monstrous Songbird, and getting through the political struggles of a class structure at war with itself, Booker and Elizabeth, in order to affect their escape, Booker and Elizabeth ultimately destroy the tower where Elizabeth was kept, releasing all the energy that had previously kept Elizabeth's diminished, and she becomes, in effect, a kind of goddess, capable of exploring alternate universes past and present. And it is here Booker learns the truth. Comstock is, in fact, Booker, and Elizabeth is actually Booker's Daughter Anna.

All those years ago, at the Baptism, in an alternate universe, there *was* a version of Booker who decided that, yes, all his cruel misdeeds *could* be wiped away easily. That, by extension, perhaps any cruelty can be mitigated by circumstance and ambition, that any ends can justify all means. And of that mindset he pursued the construction of Columbia using the bizarre science of a physicist named Rosalind Lutece which would allow not just for levitation, but crossing planes of reality. 

To accomplish his dream he needs a daughter of his own bloodline, but the scientific experiments would render him sterile, and so he, along with Rosalind, would conspire with Robert, the version of Lutece from Booker's universe, to take Booker's daughter Anna. Knowing this, and how much trouble is caused by it all, Booker realizes the only way to stop the madness and evil Comstock would eventually become responsible for, is to back, yet again, to the baptism, to go under the water, and never come up again, sacrificing his life, which he does with the help of various iterations of Elizabeth/Anna.

After all of this, Booker awakens on the day he would trade his daughter Anna to the mob boss. Was all of it a dream? A vision of a parallel universe and bad times to come? Or all a memory of a reality undone by Elizabeth? ",null,1,cdo8bud,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,hot,5

If you tend to crave vodka more after a meal, maybe this hinders the absorption so you get less effect.

binjinpurj,"It has to do with the refresh rate (hz or *hertz*), or how many frames per second, the display is able to depict. 

On a still or slow moving image the quality difference isn't evident. However if you begin to add motion to the equation (sports and gaming most notably) you will see much more of a blurring effect on televisions with a lower refresh rate. A television with a 120hz refresh rate presents nearly twice as many frames refreshed as a 60hz display. 

I can see it most notably when playing *The Impossible Game* on a 60hz telelvision (LCD) compared to one with a 600hz (plasma). [See the difference](http://imgur.com/a/ck5OP)? The level itself is moving from right to left causing a slight motion blur while the label of attempts and the orange box-like character do not move and are stable in their quality. One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of manufacturers use things like refresh rates and contrast ratios to sell more units when it really isn't any different from the display sitting right next to it. In addition - there are often options in the display's settings to add *artificial* frames to a display's input. IMHO I have never seen these look anything but totally artificial and terrible but certain companies use them as tricks to say their set has a higher refresh rate than another.

If you're trying to put a 24fps movie onto a screen that refreshes 60 times per second, there's no simple way to do this that lets you show each frame of the movie for the same length of time - you'd need a TV that showed 72 frames for a movie frame to show for 3 screen frames, or 48hz to show a movie frame for 2 screen frames.  In practice, they use a ""3:2 pulldown"" - alternating between showing a movie frame for 3 frames on the TV and 2 on the TV.  Some people don't like how this looks.

If you have a TV that natively shows 120 frames per second, this isn't a problem.  30hz video can show each frame for 4 frames on the TV, 60hz signals can show it for 2 and movies that were originally recorded in 24fps can show each frame for 5 refreshes of the screen.

As far as I know, there's no widely used standards for video that are actually using all 120Hz.  Some TVs will try to smooth out video &amp; guess what the in-between frames are - some people like this and some think it's horrible.

First, the dengue virus has four different serotypes and post-infection immunity will not only occur *just* against the one specific serotype but also *worsen* the reinfection with any of the three other types. So it really is a case of immunizing against all four (so called tetravalent vaccine) or none at all. And then, even worse, the virus is so specific to us humans that, although they can get it, not even primates are a viable model.  
So the virus has effectively prevented effective studies on animal models for a long time (new human medication licensing without several effect studies on animals before moving on to human studies is practically impossible) and made the risks outweigh the gains by a long shot. So it was deemed easier to try and control its spread through the mosquito population instead.


However, since that didn't work at all we have developed ways to make appropriate animal infection models in the recent years. There are now several dengue fever vaccines in development and clinical trials, including one in phase 3, which is the last big human trial stage before licensing and post-licensing long-term evaluation.

So, Franz was killed by a group who want Serbia to be independent.

When Franz was killed, Austria instituted harsh measures to crack down. Russia told them to back off, which eventually led to those two going to war. Austria had an alliance with Germany, and Russia had an alliance with France, so the war involved those two countries then. And Britain stayed out of it at first, saying that they were neutral. But then Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands, who were also neutral, as a quick way to get into France. Britain then declared war on Germany for violating the neutrality.

There were a number of other factors beyond alliances. Germany was the new, growing power in Europe and they thought they could get some significant concessions from the other countries if they won the war, like colonies and other trade rights, because the other countries had snapped up the good territories before German unification. France was looking for control over Alsace Lorraine, and particularly the Saar valley, which has lots of iron and coal resources.

Well, not exactly an answer but something to chew on (for your brain)

In quantum physics and string theory, there are multiple dimensions (more than 4, changes from theory to theory). Also everything is at every state it CAN be at the same time.

Now it is claimed that these dimensions and all the possible realities exist and are 'membranes'. Think of them as balloons, each expanding as they are inflated. If the two alternate universes collide (balloons bumping into each other), they first start pushing each other then they collapse (the two balloons blowing up). The energy is so huge that, such an event can be the energy source and the cause of our big bang..

So theoretically, two alternate universes collided and the resulting energy gave birth to our universe. Now the brain fodder: If two universes collide to create another, how did the first universe come into existence? Maybe it did not require a huge energy like our big bang?

geargirl,"Printers that use plain paper (or similar paper) as a medium tend to print in one of two ways:

1. Ink is stored as a liquid. To print, the container uses an electric current to vaporize a tiny amount of ink, creating a pressure difference, causing it to eject from the print head.       
2. Ink is stored as a powder. To print, a laser beam,  projects an image of the page to be printed onto an electrically charged rotating drum. Photoconductivity allows charge to leak away from the areas exposed to light. Powdered ink (toner) particles are then electrostatically picked up by the drum's charged areas, which have not been exposed to the laser beam.

These men made sure that the US government respects all religions, and wouldn't ""tax them to destruction"" ( a phrase from the 1970 Supreme Court Case:  Walz v Tax Commission of the City of New York). The ruling of this case said that grants of tax exemptions for religious institutions.
Justice Burger stated in the ruling: ""  the exemptions for religious organizations created only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less of an involvement than would be created by taxation of churches, and the effect of the exemptions was thus not an excessive government entanglement with religion. The grant of a tax exemption was not sponsorship of the organizations because the government did not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstained from demanding that the churches support the state. The exemption created a more minimal and remote involvement between church and state than did taxation because it restricted the fiscal relationship between church and state and reinforced the desired separation insulating one from the other.

SqueakyGate,"&gt; We live in a world with advanced medicine and doctors

Actually you do...and well probably most of reddit. For many, the access to basic needs (clean water, food, shelter, medicine, dentists etc.) is a daily struggle. So for them I would say traditional mechanisms of natural selection are still very much at play.

Evolution works by two main mechanisms, natural selection and sexual selection. Traits which are *naturally* selected for improve the chances of the individual surviving to sexual maturity. Traits which are *sexually* selected for improve the chances of an individual reproducing. Evolution occurs when the frequency of alleles (gene variants) changes over time. A person does not evolve, a population does. Also remember that traits and behaviours are not just driven by genes. An expressed trait or behaviour is the sum of the genes + environment. Moreover what is beneficial in one environment can be detrimental in another. Consider this: for much of human history being able to store fat was a good thing because by and large resources were scarce. Now, for certain populations resources are in abundance thus being able to store fat is a bad thing. This is because our bodies naturally want to store fat because of this ancient scarcity, now its working against us - we have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases etc.

The [hardy-Weinberg principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy–Weinberg_principle) explores the hypothetical situation where evolution ceases. It ""states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. These influences include *non-random mating, mutation, selection, genetic drift, gene flow and meiotic drive*. Because one or more of these influences are typically present in real populations, the Hardy–Weinberg principle describes an ideal condition against which the effects of these influences can be analyzed."" Thus there is no real world situation where all of these assumptions are met even in places with advanced medicine.

Humans are always interacting with their environment, even if that is living in a big modern city.. Our population gene frequencies are always changing. Thus we are always evolving. Yes, some people are indeed surviving into adulthood who would otherwise probably die but that does not equal to a halt in evolution. 

Moreover, many diseases or illnesses that we treat, like huntington's arise or are expressed only after an individual has reproduced thus their ""bad"" genes have already made it into the next generation. In certain cases we can genotype people and determine the level of their genetic risk in which case they may or may not decide to reproduce. However, the ability to do this is limited...there are many diseases which we cannot predict from a person's genes thus they unknowingly pass these on anyway.

Finally, humans are always being influenced by sexual selection. What is considered attractive is also influenced by culture and thus can vary from place to place and through time. Not to long ago being fat was considered attractive because an individual had the means and resources to accumulate wealth. Now, in western cultures being thin is considered attractive. Be careful - some traits can be influenced by genes (eye colour, hair colour, height, weight) but others are not (hairstyles, clothing etc.). Both can change over time, and both are influenced by culture but only some will result in physical/behavioural changes to the human population. For example, there was a first human, born about 10,000 years ago with a blue eyed gene. This person was obviously considered attractive because their blue eyed gene was past on into subsequent populations (i.e. they managed to have children, and their children had children). If that first blue eyed person was considered unattractive then  blue eyes might not have been as widespread as they are today. Blue eyes do not provide any survival advantage - e.g. they don't help you see better or farther - they provide a sexual advantage in certain populations.

Edit: I simplified the blue eyed example from the true story of blue eyes arising, but the core of it is the same. ",null,5,cdo92k1,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,hot,8

entropydecreaser,"Short answer: yes.

Evolution occurs whenever the frequency of alleles in a population changes over time. Alleles are essentially ""types"" of genes that code for specific traits. For example, there's an allele for black hair, an allele for blonde hair, and an allele for red hair. The hair colour you get depends on which allele you have. This is a huge oversimplification, but it gives us a good-enough groundwork when talking about the theory behind evolution.

There are several things to keep in mind. The first is that evolution is not only governed by natural selection. There are four factors that result in evolution: mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. I'll go through each one and discuss why humans are continuing to evolve.

Mutations are the random introduction of new alleles in a population. They arise as a result of errors in DNA replication, or other factors. So, regardless of medicine, mutations will always arise. Mutations are not as significant of a factor as the other three, so I won't go into detail here.

Gene flow is the introduction of alleles to a population because of immigration. This is very significant when applied to humans. Let's look at London, for example. A thousand years ago, almost all Londoners had Caucasian alleles that coded for white skin, light hair, etc... Now, however, there are people immigrating to London from around the world (I'm going to use India in this example). So Indians move to London, and are essentially adding new alleles to the population, that code for brown skin, black hair, etc.... Assuming that there are white/Indian couples, their kids now have different set of alleles than Londoners would have had a thousand years ago. If we go back to the initial definition of evolution, regarding the change in allele frequencies in a population, this clearly satisfies that.

Next is genetic drift. This is the random change in allele frequencies over time. Though this does happen, the population of humans is big enough that we can dismiss it as being not particularly influential.

Lastly, natural selection. I assume that you understand natural selection due to your question, but I'll explain for any readers that might not. Natural selection occurs when certain alleles are ""favoured"" over other ones in a particular environment. For example, in a cold environment, dogs with thick fur will presumably live longer and have more offspring than those with thin fur. Over time, since those with thin fur die out and don't have as many kids, the allele coding for thin fur disappears from the population. The one coding for thick fur increases in frequency. This is where medication comes in. Historically, diseases frequently killed many people and those that were resistant survived. If we take the example of smallpox being introduced to the New World, many Native Americans died, but those that were resistant lived and continued to have kids and spread their alleles. Thus, alleles that caused a resistance to smallpox, or overall better health, increased in frequency. Now, medication erases many of these selective pressures. Those with diabetes in the first world don't die as much anymore. Previously, alleles that caused people to be prone to diabetes would have been decreasing over time, because those with that allele died young and didn't have kids. Now, they continue to live just like healthy people, and they presumably have as kids that inherit these alleles. So, in a sense, you have a valid point. However, there are plenty of diseases that we don't have easy cures for. Cancer and AIDS are two examples. Individuals who are resistant to HIV/AIDS are presumably going to live longer and have more kids (generally) than those who are not resistant, so we can expect certain alleles to increase in frequency over time, and others to decrease.

There is one other point I want to make about natural selection. There is a particular kind of natural selection called sexual selection. This is when females pick their mates based on certain characteristics, and those that are chosen have more kids than those who are not chosen. By having more kids, the alleles that coded for these characteristics are passed on. Sexual selection is certainly existent in modern populations. For example, women often prefer men that are muscular over men that are fat. Of course, musculature and fat are hugely affected by lifestyle, but genetics also plays a role. Assuming that these muscular men have sex more and have more kids than fat men do (on average), then over a long period of time, alleles coding for big muscles will increase and those coding for a predisposition to fat will decrease.

The issue is whether or not having those ""now survivable"" alleles in the population is a bad thing and the answer is a definite no.  With more combinations of genes there are more paths for evolution to take which means a larger ""search space"" for evolution to find beneficial combinations.  

Consider having that bad gene might be barely survivable in one person, but maybe when combined in someone with a specific other gene the two cancel out the bad and produce a new feature.  Without the new survivability of that 'bad' gene the chances of the two being found together was very small, but now that it's survivable it gets a chance to find that other gene.

Darabo,"I attended the 2010 Expo in Shanghai multiple times for multiple reasons so perhaps I can shed some light about it.

The major World Expos are every ten years, usually lasts around six months or so and are a modern day variant of the World's Fair (which brought us great monuments such as the Eiffel Tower and so forth).  

Each Expo has a theme the various countries and organizations have to follow in order to showcase it for the advancement of the future and blah blah.  As with the Eiffel Tower in Paris I think electricity was revealed in an expo about 100 years ago as were other major inventions so it's considered a big deal if a city hosts the expo.  If I remember correctly the theme for 2010 was *Better City, Better Life* and the different countries/organizations had items related to it.

Note how I also say organizations which range from Coca-Cola to the United Nations.  In the end however due to the flux of tourists into the area for the expo most of the venues for these countries/organizations will be nothing advertisements/propaganda highlighting their country and promoting tourism and so forth. 

In regards to the economy there will be thousands of buildings, venues and etc. built just for this expo.  This means thousands of construction jobs, workers, planners and etc.  Then during the expo there will be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of tourists which means even more revenue for the city.  Plus the host country tries to one up everyone else's venue since it's a sort of friendly competition and goes all out in a major fashion.  For example China's booth during the Shanghai Expo in 2010 was about ten stories tall and was easily the best building in the Expo.  

Here's a photo of the China Pavilion but it's one of those buildings where it looks sort of small until you get close and then you see how huge it it.

CoolKidBrigade,"It is better to turn down your heat when you are not home. tl;dr: The amount of energy it takes to bring your house from cold to warm is less than the amount of energy required to keep it warm all day.

To answer your question, you need to define *better*. I'll take better to mean *wastes the least amount of energy*. If each technique keeps your house the same temperature when you are home (the energy inside is constant), what we need to compare is **how much energy gets leaked outside**.

When your house is hotter inside than outside, the energy (heat) will move from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. The warmer your house is than the outside, the faster this will happen. It's the same reason why you can boil water faster on a stovetop set to high than a stovetop set to medium-high. The hotter something is (like the burner), the faster heat will flow from the source to the surrounding environment (like the water). You can look up Newton's Law of Cooling for equations that describe this effect.

So, when you keep the house warm all day, you leak heat outside at a constant rate. The only way to leak heat faster is if you heat the house above room temperature. If you turn down your heat when you're gone, at first the heat leaks at the same rate as a heated house, but as the house cools the rate of heat leaking will slow down simply because there is less of a temperature difference between outside and inside. When you need to reheat the cold house, it doesn't matter that it might feel like you are using a lot of energy, as you bring the temperature of the house up you are always leaking heat at a slower rate than if you kept it that temperature the entire time.",null,2,cdoa9lq,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,hot,30

If you're not running the AC you're not using electricity and if you're not running heat you're not using gas.  Not using those things means you spend less month to month.

------------------------

It costs money to heat the house in the winter and AC the house in the summer and either case they sit around 72 degF.  So if no one is in the house during work hours (8 hours a day) then it's not worth paying for 8 hours of heating/cooling which is what just about every modern thermostat does these days.  They let the house heat up in the summer and not run the AC or it lets the temp drop in the winter by not running the heat.

brokengoose,"I'm going to assume that by ""better"", you mean ""cheaper"". 

Think about it this way: is it better to turn the thermostat down if you're going out of town for a month? Yes. Obviously. How about a week? A day? A few hours?

In other words, what's the magic point at which it becomes better to leave the heat on? The correct answer is usually, ""Never."" You'll always use the least energy by turning down the heat when it's not needed. That usually means that it's cheapest to turn down the heat whenever you leave the house.

The one exception would be if your heat comes from a source that charges different rates depending on the time of day. (Say, an apartment with electric heat.) In that case, if there's a huge difference in price, it might make sense to keep the heat on during a cheap part of the day so that you can run the heat less during a more expensive part of the day. That's a really complicated problem to solve, but fortunately, it doesn't apply to most people.

A lot of people assume that when a multi-stage furnace kicks into ""high"" that it's operating less efficiently. That's usually not true. Usually, a furnce churning away at full power is more efficient than one that's kicking on for a few minutes every hour.

Edit to add: My experience is that people who argue that leaving the heat on is ""better"" are really more worried about how long it takes to heat the floors and cold corners. They feel stupid arguing that ""turning the heat down when we're gone makes it less comfortable to walk across the floor with my shoes off for a few hours"", so they concoct strange arguments that defy the laws of thermodynamics.

The basic equation is this:
How long would your heater be running in order to bring the house back up to temp &lt;vs&gt; How long would your heater be running during the time you are gone.  

In my experience it is worth turning down the temp a bit.  

A/C generally takes longer to cool a house a few degrees than a heater does to heat a house up a few degrees.

SoLongFall,"TL:DR- It is better to keep the temperature closer to outside temperatures to decrease power consumption, however the benefit decreases with better insulation. Edit: Don't drop the temperature below 50 or 55 F to keep the pipes from freezing.

Alright, there are several ways that your house transfers temperature but basically we have discovered that the energy in heat must go somewhere.  In this case we have four ways that the heat can transfer.

Radiation: this sort of heat transfer will happen through energy carrying electromagnetic waves. This is solely based upon the temperature of the object and not the surroundings. The higher the temperature of the object and the more surface area, the more heat/energy it will radiate.

Convection: This is the transfer of heat through flowing winds and water. This one depends upon the temperature difference of the two objects(house/outside) and the bigger the difference, the faster you try to heat up the wind!

Conduction: The other types of heat transfer deal with the walls and roof of your house, this one deals with the floor(or earth if you like living one with nature and have dirt floors.)  In this case the earth stays ~50ish degrees so some of your energy is going to heating up the the surface of the floor.

Advection: Some of the air inside of your house goes outside taking all of that precious heat with it and some air comes inside.  You will need to reheat this air and the more you have to heat it the more energy it will use.

Now all of this depends on heat getting to the outside walls of your house. See, your house is essentially two cubes with one inside of the other.  The inner cube is the floor you walk on and the drywall inside of your house with that sweet wallpaper while the outside is what you show to the world as well as the foundation of your house.

The heat will move from the inside to the outside through your walls based upon the first three ways of heat transfer listed above. This is where insulation comes into play. The better insulation you have the ""slower"" it will move through the walls and the less the inside of your house will heat up the outside of your house.

TheStudentLounge,"We don't want the government to be able to put people in jail all willy-nilly like. Being in jail will fuck your life up; we think being free is the bee's knees. We want to be very certain that the government can't take our freedom away without a really good reason.

And, unfortunately, some people will break the rules and should be put in jail.

So the government has to (simplified, in this context):

1. Put the bad people in jail
2. Do not put the good people in jail

Like everything else, the government has rules to follow so that the government can reach both goals. It's a messy world -- sometimes innocent people go to jail; sometimes guilty people go free -- but the rules we've got are (arguably) the best we've come up with. The rules are things like ""the government has to prove the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"". 

Now comes the accused. Maybe he's a saint. Maybe he's a sinner. *It doesn't matter.* The government has to follow the same rules whether the accused is a saint or a sinner.

We think that's a pretty good system. 

You're asking: yeah, but how can you defend a sinner? The sinner committed the crime, aren't you subverting/hurting justice by defending the sinner?

The answer is that the opposite is true. Defending the sinner is making sure that the government has to follow the rules when putting someone in jail. It's making sure that the government doesn't get to take people's freedom away all willy-nilly like.

You certainly aren't defending the actions of the sinner! In a way you aren't even ""defending"" the sinner. You're making sure that if the government wants to take away someone's freedom then the government damn well better follow the rules in doing so. Because the government follows the same rules whether they accuse a saint or a sinner, and saints and sinners alike deserve the same legal protections.",null,0,cdocpx3,1rl232,explainlikeimfive,hot,5
pythonpoole,"Quite simply, it's their job. Lawyers have an ethical duty to represent their client fairly (with the presumption their client is not guilty). Ethically, everyone deserves the right to due process and a fair trial to determine their guilt. Until the defendant is found guilty and convicted of the crime, they are supposed to be presumed innocent and treated as such, in order to guarantee a fair and just system.

Also keep in mind that sometimes a person may technically be guilty of committing a crime, but their actions may be ethically or morally justified in some way. So, while the lawyer may realize their client did actually commit the crime (e.g. they did kill a person), they may take moral comfort in the fact that their client only did so under (potentially) morally excusable circumstances (e.g. self defense, under duress, to save someone else's life, to end someone's suffering, etc.)

Also, not all lawyers are willing to defend a client who has freely admitted their guilt, it's really up to the lawyer to decide whether they are willing to represent such clients in court to defend their innocence. In such cases, it could be that the lawyer is not actually defending the client's innocence, but rather is hired simply to represent the client in court and to negotiate an appropriate plea bargain deal to reduce the sentence to whatever extent is possible. 

Obviously some lawyers are still willing to represent clients who they know to be guilty and will defend their innocence in court, but not every lawyer would be willing to do this. Clearly, such a job is best suited to lawyers who have psychopathic or sociopathic traits and therefore are not disturbed by the ethical/moral conflict, but rather are just there to do their job by representing the client regardless of their guiltiness.",null,0,cdoaztd,1rl232,explainlikeimfive,hot,5

Basically it teaches you about how the government works, the basic assumptions of political philosophy, and the historical and cultural context in which led up to political thought and ideology to how the government works is today. You learn about how our ideas of freedom, justice, democracy, communism, socialism etc all come from philosophers and thinkers in history and how they evolved into what they are today.

Classes you will expect to take would include:

Philosophy classes on thought and theories of government.

Government classes (how the US or foreign governments work).

History classes and area study classes.

Economics about trade, taxation, etc.

Sociology and globalization classes.

Communication classes.

Languages.

Poli sci majors are often jacks of all trades but experts on few. Expect LOTS of writing papers and essays in a political science degree. Where other degrees teach you how to solve math problems, build things, solve diseases, etc, poli sci degrees teach you how to think critically and communicate in written and oral form effectively. Poli sci degree teaches you how to write well and write persuasively.

2. Comparative government. Look at the different types of governmental systems (presidential, parliamentary, dictatorship, etc.)

3. International relations. How governments operate between and amongst each other. Different types and styles of diplomacy.

4. Political theory. Usually involves a lot of philosophy and reading of Plato, Machiavella, etc as they determine the fundamental nature of what politics is.

5. Public policy. How public policy is formed (who writes the laws, interest groups, who enforces or executes the policy).

6. Political history. Basically a history of politics and culture  in your home system (i.e. how did two parties form? Why are there different states? Why is the amendment process the way it is?)

7. Statistics. Poli sci has a lot of statistics (for polling, research, etc.) So expect a stats course or two.

When a light photon enters a layer of snow, it goes through an ice crystal on the top, which changes its direction slightly and sends it on to a new ice crystal, which does the same thing. Basically, all the crystals bounce the light all around so that it comes right back out of the snow pile. It does the same thing to all the different light frequencies, so all colors of light are bounced back out. The ""color"" of all the frequencies in the visible spectrum combined in equal measure is white, so this is the color we see in snow, while it's not the color we see in the individual ice crystals that form snow.

Basically, if you just had a big block of ice, light can pass right through it, where as with snow, light is being reflected and bounced around many many times, through many crystals of snow.",null,1,cdoasge,1rl2xe,explainlikeimfive,hot,39
Nickel5,"Expanding on criedley's comment as to give a bit more to the reason why.  Atoms aren't arranged so they're right next to each other (which makes sense, since atoms aren't REALLY round spheres).  They form a crystal, they have a pattern.  This pattern repeats across the structure.  When light waves enter a material, certain wavelengths get ""lost"" within the structure, others bounce back, we see the wavelengths that bounce back.  The crystal repeats across the entire material, so the color is consistent.

Compare this to snow.  Each snowflake is random.  The snowflakes fall in a random pile.  There is no order in a snowbank.  Therefore, all wavelengths get reflected eventually.  Resulting in white.

Compare this to ice.  When water freezes, the water molecules have time to align themselves as to reach a the lowest energy possible.  This alignment will be the same for each water molecule.  It happens that at this arrangement, light waves are able to be reflected in such a way to let us see through.

The NSA is under the Department of Defense, and reports to the Director of National Intelligence.

The CIA is its own agency (not managed by the DoD), but it does still report to the Director of National Intelligence. The Defense Clandestine Service has been established by the Department of Defense, to serve, for all intents and purposes, as its version of the CIA.

Again, neither the CIA or NSA are law enforcement agencies.

The ATF and FBI, however, are both law enforcement agencies under the Department of Justice.

The FBI, in general, investigates federal crimes, which involve laws broken at the federal level, not state or local levels. For example, speeding is dealt with in a more local jurisdiction, by city, county, or state police. Tax evasion, or the possession of banned weapons would be an example of federal crimes.

The ATF, in general, investigates (and works to prevent) unlawful use, manufacture and possession of firearms and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products. The ATF is also responsible for licensing the sale, possession, and transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce.

The ATF used to be part of the Treasury Department, but in 2002, with the establishment of the Dept. of Homeland Security, the ATF was moved to the Dept. of Justice.

The Secret Service was also under the Treasury Department. They were moved to the Dept. of Homeland Security in 2003. They investigate financial crimes, such as the counterfeiting of money and major fraud. They are also tasked with protecting current and former national leaders and their families: presidents, past presidents, vice presidents, presidential candidates, etc.

The Department of Homeland Security, simply, is like the Department of Defense, except DHS works in the civilian sphere to protect the U.S. inside, at, and outside its borders. It focuses on prevention of, preparation for, and response to domestic emergencies - particularly terrorism.

You can see from this very basic comparison that, even though there is overlap, not all of these organizations do the same thing. Because the DoD has different goals from the DHS (beyond ""protect the U.S.""), you can see why they each have their own agencies (with vastly different responsibilities) working towards the overall mission.

We also have so many laws that breaking up intelligence gathering and enforcement into different areas makes overall organization easier, even though there are disputes over territory and jurisdiction sometimes. It could probably be simplified to a large extent, but combining all of these into one huge agency would probably create a bigger nightmare. Instead, more should be done to promote inter-agency cooperation and data sharing, and reduced competition.

lumpy_potato,"The NSA and CIA are similar in that they are both intelligence gathering operations. However, the NSA falls under the jurisdiction of the DOD, while the CIA is independent. Both report to the Director of National Intelligence.

The CIA specializes in human-sourced information. The NSA doesn't do this - it has no authority to - but it is charged with managing [SIGINT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGINT), or basically electronic communications. So the CIA is human-based, the NSA is more electronic information based. Both are clandestine operations.

The ATF (Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms) is in charge of the regulation of federal laws related to Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.

The FBI generally deals with investigations of violations of federal criminal law, as well as internal investigations.

The Secret Service is primarily charged with the safety of the President and certain other VIPs.

Homeland Security is charged with a more civilian-oriented defense of the nation - less emphasis on gathering intelligence/dealing with foreign governments, more cavity searches, immigration handling, and opening your mail.

Any and all of these departments might work together on a case if it is necessary. e.g the ATF might be working a case on a firearms trafficker and end up working with the CIA if they have intelligence (or need intelligence) from the tracker. The agencies do not always play well with each other and might joust for jurisdiction, but generally speaking, they will share information / work together where necessary.",null,0,cdoc69c,1rl61p,explainlikeimfive,hot,1
Hirodo,"Well take a seat this post may take awhile.  As states elsewhere each organization was originally created for a specific purposes.  Sometimes these purposes could not be combined for legal reasons, an issue I'll explain a little later on.

First, the FBI was created as a solution to the pesky problem of gangsters and jurisdiction.  During the 1920's and 1930's many bank robbers, bootleggers, and other mafioso types could keep away from the law by crossing state lines.  Crossing into another state would effectively halt any chase and apprehension by the authorities in the state the crime was committed in.  The FBI was created as a Federal Police like force that could continue the investigation and chase despite criminals crossing state lines.  Needless to say the FBI has grown to be the go to investigative law enforcement agency, dealing with high profile crimes and other federal level crimes.

CIA: The CIA grew out of the WWII intelligence agency the OSS(think early Medal of Honor games).  The CIA main goal was operational  intelligence and foreign intelligence aka spy stuff.  This is still what they do.  The CIA main goal is to find out what we don't know, usually from the source, such as agents inside the host countries and any contacts they have fostered.  During the last fifty years or so the CIA has grown to not just include covert monitoring but covert action as well.  The CIA Special Activities Division is very active in war zones and other countries forcing changes, such as overthrows.  In fact the first US forces into Afghanistan where CIA operatives from SAD  Of course any and all of this is subject to speculation.  

NSA: This is actually a very simple agency from an overall perspective.  The NSA provides intelligence, both domestic and foreign, by electronic means aka SIGINT.  The NSA is a component of the DoD.

Secret Service:  The Secret Service started as the law enforcement and criminal investigation arm of the Treasury Department.  The Secret Service is one of the oldest forms of federal law dating back to the Civil War.  Back then they're role was slightly larger but for the purpose of being brief I'll skip that part.  The Secret Service fell into the protection of the President and other VIPs after the assassination of William Henry.  

ATF: Will talk about during Homeland Security

Homeland Security:  Now here is where everything ties together, kinda.  The Department of Homeland Security is just that, a cabinet level Department that over sees many agencies, including the Secret Service and FEMA.  The main mission of Homeland Security is the internal protection of the United States by threats, both domestic and foreign.  Although not completely compromised of Law Enforcement Agencies, Homeland Security does maintain a certain level of LE capabilities when these agencies have missions that correlate to actual security.  For example the Coast Guard is now an agency of Homeland Security, there main mission is domestic maritime policing, or Customs and Border patrol whose main mission is security of the borders and entry points.  Homeland Security agencies do not focus of the prosecution of criminals other then the ones stated above.  The falls to the Department of Justice, where the FBI and ATF reside.  In essence the ATF is like the FBI but with a strong focus on, you guessed it, Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco.  They do more then policing work as they also regulate the sales and transfer of such items.

thedrew,"Respect.

It is considered respectful in English to not use someone's name in front of them until invited to do so.  This stems from an ancient belief that reciting a name gives you power over that person.  

This is why in formal settings we say ""Madam Mayor"" and ""Mr. President"" instead of calling them by their names.  Sometimes we mean to show respect, but we need to use names in order to be understood - this is basically how surnames came to be.  So we say ""Mr. Smith"" until we're invited to call him ""John.""

Parent is a position of high authority and respect within the family.  So we don't use our parents names, we instead refer to them by their title, though because we learn ""Mother"" and ""Father"" at such early ages, we find ""Mom(my)"" and ""Dad(dy)"" constructions by most children.

Interestingly there are positions so high that we can't even use the name of the title in their presence.  This is mostly royalty where we say, ""Your/His/Her Majesty.""

Highest of all is the deity, Yahweh.  However the use of His name is completely taboo in religious settings, so He is referred to euphemistically by titles such as ""the Lord"" or ""Holy Father.""",null,0,cdodf3v,1rl643,explainlikeimfive,hot,8

Grandma and Granddad get special terms because out parents still call them mom and dad not by their names and pass that on though often it Grandad Smith if Mom talking about dads parents or a distant grandparent when another set is closer referred to without names.   Everyone else gets a name and maybe a title if important. Titles show respect to adults and lone names are for other kids the parents look down at. Even close friends of the family get titles.

Female prostitutes reported the condition when interviewed by Kinsey, as well as other sex researchers. 

It's real, and it can happen to anyone. While the solution is an orgasm, and simple masturbation to orgasm can cure it, it wouldn't be wrong to say that sex with someone else would also alleviate it, and probably do a better job, unless the person it happened to was particularly skilled at masturbation, and who am I kidding this is the internet I'm talking to.

I also jelq and stretch, so the amount of work I put into my sex life and the quality of that work probably skews my answer a bit.

Koooooj,"1 PM is one hour past noon.  Similarly, 1 AM is one hour past midnight.  This is a justification for why we don't call noon 1 o'clock (which would make it go 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm (noon)).  That would solve one problem but introduce a new one.

That sets us up with a system that should go 10 am, 11 am 12 ?m (noon), 1 pm, and so on.  11 am is clearly before noon and 1 pm is clearly after noon, so what do we do with noon itself?

If you just look at the even hour times then it would seem that noon ought to still be AM--12 is more similar to 10 and 11 than it is to 1 and 2, so it should get the same suffix, right?  However, ask yourself:  is 12:30 before or after noon (talking about the 12:30 that occurs near mid day)?  12:30 is clearly after noon and thus ought to be labeled as pm.  The same is true of 12:15 or 12:01.  Thus, if 12:00 is to be AM then we would have 12:00 AM, 12:01 PM, 12:02 PM, and so on.  Now that seems out of place.

In fact, if you continue that argument then we can look at seconds as well--12:00:00 AM, 12:00:01 PM, 12:00:02 PM, and so on.  Since noon is only a single instant in time we find that for essentially the whole 12th hour the time is already pm.  Therefore, making noon be 12 AM is inconsistent more so than making it be 12 PM is inconsistent.

Now, there is a completely consistent solution.  We can still make 1 hour past noon be 1 o'clock and we can make it so we don't have that weird discontinuity from 11 AM to 12 PM.  We simply call noon and midnight 0 o'clock pm and am, respectively.  This is actually the most consistent--0 is more like 1 and 2 than it is like 10 and 11, so labeling noon as 0 o'clock PM is consistent there, and 0:30 PM conveys the idea that it is 30 minutes past noon (while 12:30 PM would suggest that it's 12.5 hours after noon).  This is the most internally consistent 12 hour clock, but the existing 12 hour clock going from 1 to 12 instead of 0 to 11 already has too much hold for this idea to gain much traction--using the existing clock works just fine.

The other consistent solution is to do away with a 12 hour clock in the first place and just call midnight 0 o'clock and count up from there.  We have 10 am, 11 am, 12 pm, 13 pm, 14 pm, and so on--the break from am to pm happens at noon (if it's reported at all--we never have to specify which 18 o'clock we're talking about) but we don't reset the numbering an hour later so there's no problem!  This clock system is arguably better than my proposed 12 hour clock since it removes the ambiguity of a 12 hour clock being used for a 24 hour day and it sees widespread use around the world.

backwheniwasfive,"Before the Marian reforms, the Roman military forces were exclusively made up of citizens-- people of property (3500 sesterces, say about 1750 loaves of bread) and capable of supplying their own arms.

Naturally this imposed a ceiling both on the number of potential soldiers, and their training-- units would be more reliable later with standardized equipment and training.

After Marius changed things, a legion was composed of:

* Roughly 6000 men: 4800 fighters, 1200 noncombatants

* 10 *cohorts* in a legion, so 480 fighting men in each, give or take and 120 noncombatants.

* * 6 *centuries* in each cohort, or around 80 fighters and 20 noncombatants, hence the term century.

* * According to Wiki the first cohort was overstrength, TIL.  Makes sense though-- HQ guards and extras for runners etc.
* * * Each century divided into 10 squads (*contubernium*, led by a *decanus* -- you can probably see ""decade"" in that), again 8 soldiers and 2 noncombatants, who ate together.

These soldiers would fight for 16 years initially, later 20.  TIL Augustus made these retired soldiers *evocati*, or reservists, to form an experienced officer corps at need.

That's about it for the legions.  However, the military also included wide ranges of Auxilia (Greek for slaves, but in this case just irregulars) -- engineers, spearman, horsemen, anyone who didn't fight in the legionary style.   

The *Equites* (social class) who had provided Roman cavalry up to this point were pretty much left to become leaders or stay home.

Koooooj,"Anyone can invent a currency, and in fact dozens of people have followed in Bitcoin's footsteps and created similar systems, most with a few cosmetic changes.  This may seem weird, but you've seen private currencies for a long time and probably never even noticed them.  For example, take ISK, the currency in EVE online.  It is entirely issued by the game's developers and only has value to buy things within the game, but there are also exchanges where you can trade USD to ISK just as you can trade USD for EUR.  In a very real sense the developers of that game invented a currency.

The real trick is to get a currency to become valuable, and to do that you have to get people to start using it.  Now, if you start printing up your own monopoly money then people aren't going to value it--there's no scarcity model (i.e. you could go and start printing 100 trillion dollar bills and crash the market), there's no legal backing (i.e. if you pay your bills in monopoly money then you will get sued for *not* paying your bills and you will lose the lawsuit), and there's no other property that makes your monopoly money superior to your national currency.

Bitcoin, however, addresses these points.  There's a very strong scarcity model--25 Bitcoins are released every 10 minutes or so and there's very little anyone can do to mess with that rate in any substantial way; there's a maximum of 21 million that will ever be produced.  Also there are lots of properties that people want--you can transact nearly instantly online with very low (or no) fees, largely anonymously, without asking a bank for permission.  These properties made the initial users want to use Bitcoin which sparked the initial value, which has grown as more people realize that cutting out banks feels pretty awesome (although we're far from that point).

So if your employee makes $5,000 a month, $60,000 a year (lets just say no taxes for the sake of simplicity), you will cover up to a maximum of $3,000 in matching funds.

So the employee will put up to $3,000 from his/her own paychecks into the 401K, and you will match it up to $3,000 (5% of total/gross pay). The 100% means you match 100% of what the employee contributes. So if Dan the Man contributes $250 a month to his 401K, you match 100% of that, up to the $3,000 limit (5%). If Dan the Man contributes $300 a month, you match 100% of that, but when he hits the $3,000 limit, you no longer have to contribute. If Dan the Man contributes $200 a month, you match 100% of that, but when he falls short of $3,000, thats not your problem. The contribution limit resets yearly - e.g. after 1 year, you have to allow for $3,000 (5%) again. I do not know if this means new year or 1 year since the employee began getting paychecks.

James becomes an astro scientist and builds spaceships with lasers, forcefields and warp drives on them before anyone else does. Also, he cures cancer. Go figure.

One day, some sleazy two bit journalist makes an amazing discovery; James was genetically modified at birth.  All undesirable traits and genetics were removed so he could become the perfect human being. 

Suddenly, James's achievements are meaningless to the general population. He still produces amazing works and breakthroughs, but he is no longer one of us. He's something else. 

Religious people will try to kill him. He is not a product of God. He is Satan incarnate brought forth by evil scientists to disrespect God. 

Athiests will be jealous. Why weren't they lucky enough to be genetically modified at birth? Why couldn't they be born for greatness? Just living and dying. It's bullshit! Why should he get to be so great?

Your average person won't entirely understand the issue, but get that genetically modifying anything is bad (Vegans), people aren't experiments (Right's activists), Male Privilege can now be sold in a test-tube (Feminism), We need more people like this to go fight our wars (Military). Whatever the reason, or what kind of person you are, everyone is unified in the same idea: This person should not exist. 

Everyone begins to hate James. He couldn't have done any of this if he wasn't grown in a lab. He's an adbomination. He must be destroyed! KILL HIM!

You, finally find out James is genetically modified to be great. You form your own decisions on the matter. 

One things lead to another, James is killed by extremists. Everyone like James is killed. The people like James try to fight back.

First tell me: who is responsible for the meltdown?

-----

**Is it American consumers** that live beyond their means in most instances and create a culture of debt, particularly manifested in the early 2000's when many, many people bought homes that were hugely beyond their ability to actually afford and were subsequently abandoned outright and allowed to default?

**Was it the developers, the realtors or the local retail bankers** that made the homes, and pushed predatory adjustable mortgages with low teaser rates early on and completely unsustainable rising rates and shortened terms later?

**Was it the pseudo-governmental financial organizations like Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac** that pooled these mortgages into large investment funds that could be purchased something like stocks on the open market **or investment banks like Lehman Brothers, Goldman-Sachs and then Bear Stearns** that at some point realized these assets were completely toxic and attempted to fire-sell them and took out bets against them?  (remember, in the culture of Wall Street investment bankers or traders routinely sell stocks, commodities and other assets, and it is almost always because the asset is believed to no longer have value- if it did have value the trader would keep it.)

**Was it the financial rating agencies like Moody's and S&amp;P** that accepted profit for ratings and had poor enough foresight and due diligence that they repeatedly rated these dangerous and unsustainable mortgage assets as AAA (nearly riskless) assets, allowing the market to believe they were safe and steady sources of income?

**Was in the investor funds** and everyday people that bought into these funds of mortgages in order to turn a buck on other people's house debt?

**Was it the government** that at various times mandated sub-prime lending (Clinton) or lowered interest rates radically to promote house purchases, generally refused to step in (Greenspan) or even repealed important limitations on the market makers on Wall Street (Congress) like the Glass-Steagall act (investment-retail bank separation) and leverage limits (how much debt an investment bank is allowed to take out and re-invest to attempt to make a profit- obviously the more debt that you take out to invest, the less you can sustain even small shocks)?

----

It is easy to point fingers at 'greedy Wall Street' because investment banks were at the center of the crisis, but it is much harder to say 'throw them all in jail!'   Remember, none of the people involved, from home-buyers who walked out on to predatory lenders who put them there to the Wall Street guys that sold out assets they knew had turned sour, to the asleep at the wheel credit raters to hands-off government regulators actually broke any laws...

The case can be made, especially in the case of the investment bankers and realtors, that lines were crossed, and legal debate should continue.  But the idea that you can round up 'those responsible' for an epidemic that had its roots in so many factors across a decade and more is naive.

mrkarlis,"The government is connected to it in the way that they closed state construction oversight department in 2009 transferring those duties to municipalities, but without giving them sufficient power - basically they can only check documentation and issue/deny building permits, but what happens afterwards is barely controlled.  
However it is probably a combination of many reasons, such as  
  
*  people are always complaining that cabinet ministers don't feel responsible for what happens in the country; that they don't accept 'political accountability'. By resigning the Prime Minister has a chance of gaining huge popular support. It might sound weird, but the minds of people are easily influenced, especially  in the wake of such tragedies. I mean, the President has always been seen as an ex-banker with zero representative skills and questionable morality, but when he called the roof collapse 'basically mass murder', he's suddenly seen as some sort of hero who 'tells it like it is'. The Prime Minister on the other hand has always had both lovers and haters, but more from the first group as he's won the last 3 elections, he wouldn't win the 4th though as his party is increasingly unpopular. His party is beyond salvation, but he personally will now have enough support to pretty much go whatever path he chooses. Has already confirmed not to lead the new government though.  
* He is rumored to have good chances of becoming the new Chairman of European Commission. It's no secret that he is liked in Brussels and that he likes working there as well. Maybe this is in preparation of his return to European politics?  
* The last half a year has been very hard for the government - constant conflicts between the coalition parties, resignations of ministers etc. A very serious problem has become the nationalistic party ''NA'' acting up and generally being a nuisance, but without them the government doesn't have majority support and can't make any important decisions. It would only make sense to create a new coalition, but apparently the Prime Minister doesn't want to.  
* Emotions. The PM is known for being very introvert and emotionless. I mean, once he made a joke at a debate and it became local Youtube sensation due to its sheer unexpectedness. However today when announcing stepping down the man was close to tears, no one has ever seen him like that. It is possible the supermarket tragedy did affect him emotionally, i mean, he did get to the location that night and probably saw dead bodies being excavated and the people waiting news about their loved ones behind the police tape. In a way the tragedy did have an effect on nearly everyone in the country, even those who were not harmed in it.  

*Guilt tripping the Mayor of the capital city into resignation or at least seriously damaging his reputation as strictly speaking the Mayor has more 'political responsibility' in this event as construction oversight is now up to municipalities. The mayor is from the currently most popular political party. However, what would the PM gain by this now is not entirely clear. The Mayor is pretty pissed though and was quite uncooperative today with the journalists.  
  
Although the actual reasons will probably be revealed in time, there's no denying the roof collapse has had at least some impact on this decision and he states it as the main one as 'a new leader is necessary who could lead the government in these hard time'. It's a shame really. This PM has set a record by having lead the government for nearly 4 years straight. He took control during the economical crisis and managed to get the country back on its feet while no one else even dared to accept the challenge. The fact that the country is joining Eurozone this January is also mainly thanks to the PM and his Minister of Finance. On the other hand, maybe it's time for a new PM to come, if not for other reason, then just for the sake of change, to see what it brings.",null,0,cdom6qo,1rlji9,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
ANewMachine615,"Do you mean actionable, illegal discrimination, or moral discrimination, or literal discrimination? I'll answer all 3.

**Is it illegal?** No. It's legal to discriminate on a bona fide qualification for a job. You can discriminate against a blind man in hiring for truck drivers. A black person cannot generally portray a white person in film without unreasonable steps to accommodate their physical difference (probably CGI'ing their entire body, or wearing crazy amounts of makeup and prosthesis).

**Is it morally wrong discrimination?** Depends on the character, IMO. If whiteness is a part of the character, it's not a problem. For instance, Cyclops/Scott Summers is white in all incarnations that I know of. He's been white for fifty-odd years, and it's a big part of his character. Refusing to cast a black man in the role isn't morally wrong, because one of the qualities of the character is that he's a rich, WASPy white kid. If it's a new character and they're denied the part solely because they want a white guy... that's a bit different. A great example is Ellen Ripley, who was originally just ""Ripley,"" and written totally androgynous -- that is, the character had no gender in the script. If that'd been the case, and they turned Sigourney Weaver down just for being a woman, then it'd be a moral problem, IMO.

**Is it literal discrimination?** Certainly, but we do that all the time. Buy the name-brand ketchup instead of the generic? Discrimination. Any time you're making a choice between two fairly similar things, that's dictionary discrimination.

There are always artistic differences between how the director wants the finished product to be and what the producers think will make them the most money.

Film editors work with directors, but for the producers. This means the film can be shorter and simpler that what the director envisioned, and without potentially controversial scenes, as producers think that giving people a film that they can switch off to, which won't offend them, will earn them the biggest return.

If these artistic differences are significant, or of the film is successful enough for producers to owe their director a favour, they'll release a ""director's cut"". Usually, this earns the producers even more money.",null,0,cdogi4f,1rlkwj,explainlikeimfive,hot,5
deep_sea2,"Although the director is a key man in making the movie, it's the studio and the producers that are the top dogs.  In the end, they make the decisions of what they want and do not want in the movie.  Where directors may be more focused on the artistic value of the film, the studio and the producers may be more interested in the commercial value.  Unfortunately, artistic value and commercial value don't always mix.

In many cases, the director's cut contains a lot more footage.  It includes stuff like more side-plots and extended scenes.  However, producers tend to like shorter movies.  Producers are afraid that longer movies will bore the audiences, especially the movie watchers that are not film buffs, but are more interested in getting their bang for their buck.  So, producers tend to cut out a lot of scenes they don't think are necessary to keep the film nice and short and keep the audience entertained.  

Also, some producers don't like the darker elements of a film.  Most people like happy stories with happy endings.  Dark and depressing movies can be very good artistically, but it turns off a lot of people.  So, the producer might cut scenes where the film's hero is shown to be an alcoholic that abuses his wife.

Another reason is censorship.  Things like sex and violence might compliment the film artistically, but it reduces the film's target audience.  A film that a has lower rating has more potential viewers than a film rated R because now younger children and teenagers can watch the movie as opposed to just adults.

ltrain430,"Vegas betting is fairly simply the point spread will always apply to the home team so if the game is Pittsburgh v. Baltimore and the spread is -3 that would mean Baltimore, the home team would have to beat Pittsburgh, the visiting team by more than 3 points to win the bet.  Pittsburgh would win the bet if Baltimore won by less than 3 or they win or tie the game.  The game would push if Baltimore wins by exactly 3 points, and both sides would get their bets back as there is no winner.  

The -110 indicates the odds plus the vigorish or vig (the money the casino charges to place a bet with them) of the bet.  In the US we always use odds in terms of $100, In Europe they use odds in terms of a fraction.  If it is a minus like -110 you would need to bet $110 to make $100.  If it is positive like +110 you would win $110 for every $100 bet.  

The over/under of a game refers to the total number of point of both teams being over or under a total.  If for example the Pittsburgh v. Baltimore game had a over/under of 35 and the final score was Pittsburgh 17 Baltimore 20 the total points scored is 37 and all people who bet the over win.  Pushes also apply to over under bets.  The vigorish will also apply to this kind of bet.  

Parlays are when you bet multiple games on the same ticket for enhanced odds.  Basically the odds would stack on top of each other.  If you picked two games both at -110.  If both win your new odds become +260

Finally lets talk about teasers.  You can if you wish to you can change the lines of a game by 6 to 10 points in exchange for getting less odds.  A typical two team teaser of six points is -110.  You must win both bets to win the teaser.  If a bet pushes the results will vary based on how much the bet is teased and where you placed the bet, some sports books count a push as a loss on a three team teaser of 10 points.

And the best team will win this matchup 48 out of every 50 times this kind of game is played.  If everyone could just best straight-up on who will win risking only 10% juice! then everyone will always bet on the best team! everyone will win 48 out of 50 times, lose only 2 out of 50 times while the sports book will lose big 48 out of 50 times and win only 2 out of 50 times.  Obviously, this will quickly bankrupt the sports book and will be too easy and no fun for the bettors.  So, one thing the sports book does to fix this problem is to set a point spread.  

The point spread says, look,at the final score, deduct the point-spread points from the favored teams final score, and calculate who wins after that deduction.  In our example above, let's say the pint spread is -15 for the best team and the final score turns out 35 for the best team and 14 for the worst team. So, the best team won the game, but did they win against the point spread?  Subtract the -15 from the best team's 35 total points and you get 20 points for the best team, which is till more than the worst team's 14 points, and so the best team's bettors win while the worst team's bettors lose.  

But,,assume that the final,score turns out instead to be 35 for the best team and 21 for the worst team. In this case, we subtract the -15 from the best team's score and get 20 again, but now we're comparing that 20 points against the spread with the worst team's 21 points. In this case, the best team and its bettors lost against the spread and the worst team and its bettors won against the spread.  Obviously if the team giving the points (the one favored to win and so has the minus sign) actually loses,the game outright,,then you don't even need to do the math because they already lost even before you subtract the point spread from their final score. M

(You can get the same result by leaving the favored team's final score alone and instead ADDING the point-spread number to the worst team's final score, so that, in the latter case, you would leave the best team's score at 35 and add the 15 to the worst team's 21 points and get the worst team winning with 36 points over the best team's 35.  This is just an alternative way of counting, so don't be confused.  The winner-loser result is the same under either calculation method.). 

The juice will apply here too, and the same,possibilities and consequences of a push are also applicable here.  

But, unlike the over/under, here you don't care at all about total points scored. You only care here about who wins and by how much.  

There are many variations on this, but this is the general framework. There re other ways to equalize the mismatched teams, such as not using a point-spread, but instead using a money line, but maybe we can discuss that another time.  ",null,1,cdoh5mv,1rlky3,explainlikeimfive,hot,1
Infinite_Ambiguity,"In general, the over/under refers to a threshold of something and you're betting that this something will actually end up being over or under the established threshold -- most commonly, the threshold is the total points by both teams scored in the entire game, but it could also be total points by one team in the game, or total points by one or both teams in a half or quarter, or total fumbles/interceptions/turnovers by one or both teams in the game or half or season, or one team's total wins in a season, or one team's total points in a season, or anything at all. 

For simplicity, let's say that we're dealing with the most common -- the over/under for total points in, let's say a late December game between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs. It's going to be cold, the offenses have been performing poorly, and the defenses have been playing well.  So, for these reasons and others, the odds makers set the over/under at a relatively low number -- let's say 31. 

So, with a 31 over/under, the odds makers are inviting you to guess whether the total number of points scored by both teams combined in the game will be over 31 or under 31. You don't care who wins, who loses, or by how much. You only care how many total points are scored.  So, let's say you think it will be a very high scoring game with total points above 31, and so you bet $110 on the over 31 total points. This means that if the total points go above the 31 over/under threshold, then you get your $110 back plus $100 more from the sports book.  But, if you're mistaken, and the total points stay under 31, then you lost by betting on the over, so you just lose your $110 and get nothing back. The converse is true if you bet the other way, obviously.  

Notice that you risked $110 to win $100. This is because these straight wagers typically require you to risk 10% more than you stand to win. You risk $110 to win $100, $220 to win $200, $1,100 to win $1,000, and so on. This 10% extra you pay on losses is usually called the ""juice.""  

Final point here -- What happens if the total points scored in the game are exactly equal to 31?  In that case, it's a tie -- known as a ""push"" -- and so you get only your risked money back minus the juice. In this case, you put $110 at risk to win $100, but the game pushed, so you will get $100 back of your risked $110 and you will lose the $10 juice.  

So, this is a quick summary. There are many possible variations. Feel free to ask any questions. I'll,answer your point-spread question separately.  ",null,1,cdoglu4,1rlky3,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

Using proper breath support, when she sings these powerful high notes, it would feel like her face is buzzing.

PS a lot of people do spend years training this type of singing, and if you get set up with the wrong teacher or try to do it yourself, a lot of people do end up losing their voices.

People with healthy belting: Florence, Idina Menzel (recently), Whitney Houston, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Hudson

Pre-aplha: I've always heard this as just ""prototype"" but prototype implies that it gets scratched and built again once it's done which isn't usually the case in games. This is when the game gets its feel, figures out what it does and how the player ineracts with it. By the end of this phase, a core working model of the game is done but most features are not done.

Alpha: Make features of game. Things like jumping, menus, fighting. Pretty much any interaction you have in the game should work at the end of this phase.

Beta: Bug fixes. By now, everything is ""feature complete"" and just needs to have the bugs ironed out, polish added, and have everything made shiny. By the end of beta, the game is ready to release

Gold: Game is done. If this was a song, it would be put on a gold record now. Release date is set and marketing goes to town. Or if it's a smaller game, it's just released/release-day patched.

In reality, though, Beta starts way way earlier in alpha so it's usually only 70-80% feature complete and a bit more polished than it would normally be since end users tend to beta test.

'Dead' is better defined as the point at which medical science can no longer assist the person in any fashion.   Under that definition, your experiment is not possible.

djonesuk,"The core ideology of Communism can be attributed to two individuals, Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, who got together and wrote a document called *The Communist Manifesto*.

The central tenet of this manifesto was that the small rich group who possessed most of the wealth within society were only rich because they exploited the average working person's hard labour.  

This was largely due to the shift away from an agricultural and artisan society where each man reaped the rewards of his own labour, to an industrialized one where it was the factory owners who reaped the big rewards, not those actually doing the hard work.

Marx and Engels proposed the following as a radical (and somewhat violent) solution to the problem.  Marx later acknowledged that socialism could be achieved through democratic means.

1.    Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
1.    A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
2.   Abolition of all right of inheritance.
3.    Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
4.    Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
5.    Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
6.    Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
7.    Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
8.    Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equitable distribution of the population over the country.
9.    Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form and combination of education with industrial production.

Anyways, there is more that goes into the quality of a CPU than just the speed.

Many operations take more than one step.  So the way you get speed increases is to decrease the number of steps it takes to do some unit of work.

Take long division for example.  Most people learn math by starting with addition, then subtraction, then multiplication and finally division.  The reason for this is that each of those skills build on each other.  So in order to do a simple division problem, you need to know how to do addition, subtraction, multiplication.  So if you were building a computer to do math, you would start with addition, and it would take one step to add two numbers.  Then when you did multiplication, you would need to take more than one step to do that work because multiplication requires more than one unit of addition.  Finally when you write your code to do division you would need to do both multiplication, addition, and subtraction.  So you would get one request to divide two numbers done in say 200 steps where the addition of those two numbers would only take one step.  Now lets say you learn some shortcuts in doing long division and you realize that you don't need to do so many steps.  That's what happens when you go from say an i5 processor to an i7 processor.

Due to something called redshift, we know stars are becoming increasingly further away from us, because the light coming to us from those stars lose their energy, which has the effect of the light becoming more red (hence the name redshift) (and this is measurable). And it's thought that this redshift isn't really because the stars are *moving* away from us, but because the space in which the light is moving towards us is stretching.

This empty space is mostly filled with dark energy, which is thought to work kind of like the opposite of gravity, in that instead of pulling everything together, it stretches empty space even further. It's like if there was a belt between us and every point we could observe in space, and that belt were stretching further and further, and belts were connected to different galaxies across vast space, and stretching further and further.",null,0,cdojxle,1rltg1,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

Koooooj,"Sig figs is a measure of uncertainty.  In science a number without any indication of uncertainty is essentially meaningless.  For example, say I tell you to prepare for a party and that there'll be 100 people there.  If you take that number as exact then you could have exactly 100 servings of ~~beer~~ goldfish crackers.  However, you'll want to be prepared if that number *wasn't* exact--maybe I know that number is accurate to ±10%--there could be between 90 and 110 people, so you should really have 110 servings to be on the safe side.  Perhaps, though, I'm *really* bad at estimating, and I only know the number of people to a factor of 10--there could be between 10 and 1,000 people.  These are three very different views that all would be reported as 100 people ±*N* just with different values of *N*.  This is the importance of stating uncertainty in science.

Now, for dealing with uncertainty properly you have to do what's called uncertainty propagation analysis--you know the uncertainty of each number you use and you use some math (which is ultimately derived from some ""basic"" calculus) to figure out what the limits are on your answer.  This is a lot to deal with, especially in early science classes, so sig figs are used.

Thus, sig figs are all about representing how certain you are with a number you state, and it all comes down to how you write a number.  For example, if you write 8.7 then it's clear that you didn't mean to write 9--you had enough certainty to carry the decimal out to 8.7.  However, it's also clear that you weren't confident enough to give the answer as 8.70 (or perhaps 8.71).  Thus, this is two significant figures--the 8 and the 7.  For some other numbers:

* 8.70 is 3 sig figs--you included the 0

* 870 is only 2 sig figs--you didn't have any choice in including the zero here.

* 870. is 3 sig figs--the explicit decimal after the zero indicates that the 0 is accurate

* There is no way to state 8700 to 3 sig figs without scientific notation

* 8.70 \* 10^3 is 3 sig figs--the 8, 7, and 0.  This is the only way to state the number 8700 with 3 sig figs

* 087 is only 2 sig figs.  The first zero is meaningless (and should be omitted)

* 807 is 3 sig figs--the zero is surrounded by non-zero digits

Once you figure out how many sig figs your inputs have you have to figure out how many your output has.  For example:

     870
    +000.087

Here each number has 2 sig figs.  When you carry out the math treating each number as exact you get 870.087.  How should this number be reported?  Just as 870 (random parenthetical comment to indicate the period is not a decimal point).  For addition operations each number is only precise to a given place value (i.e. ones, tens, hundreds, etc).  Whichever number is the least precise determines what the significance of the answer is.  This makes sense--if your first number is 870±5 then you can't suddenly know the sum of 870±5 + .087±.0005 to any precision more accurate than ±5.

Another example:

     870
    *000.0870

Here 870 has two sig figs while 0.0870 has 3.  If we carry out the math with exact values then you get 75.69.  How should this be reported?  It should be rounded to 2 sig figs regardless of place value.  The most significant number is 7 so that number gets to stay.  The 2nd is 5 so it gets to stay.  The final 6 and 9 aren't significant enough to stay, so they get set to zero.  However, since we're rounding the 6 causes the 5 to be increased (i.e. we've rounded 75.69 to be just 76).  The math here is (870±~1%) \* (.0870±~.1%) = 75.69±~1%.  This becomes more clear in scientific notation:  8.7 \* 10^2 \* 8.70 \*10^-2 .  Here we can see that you can pull all of the ""\* 10^n"" out and deal with them separately then look at the remaining numbers on an even scale.  The rule for multiplying numbers is that you count the sig figs of each number then round your result to that many sig figs.

A final thing to consider is the idea of exact values.  For example, in the formula for the area of a circle you have A = pi \* r^2 .  How many sig figs does pi have?  Infinity.  Not because it's irrational or anything like that.  It has infinite sig figs because you don't *measure* pi at any point--it's just a value you introduce.  Similarly, the number ""2"" in the exponent of that equation is an exact value and has infinite sig figs, even though a ""2"" would normally be only 1 sig fig.  When you add, subtract, multiply, or divide an exact value you get no loss of precision.

Note that when doing a combined operation you keep track of sig figs according to order of operations, but never round until the end.  For example:

    870 + (.87 \* 8700)

Here your first move is to multiply .87 by 8700, which yields 7569 with 2 sig figs (both .87 and 8700 have 2 sig figs and you were multiplying).  You then add 7569 + 870 and get 8439.  Where do you round this?  7569 was actually the number that determines the sig figs of the result, since only the 7 and the 5 are significant in this intermediate result, so you have to round to the nearest hundred.  Your result is 8400.  

Note that It would have been improper to round 7569 to 7600 before carrying out the addition--this would have caused the result of addition to be 8470 which would then be rounded up to 8500.  The rule to remember here is that you never round intermediate values, even if you are keeping track of how many sig figs they have.

Obviously sig figs are a cumbersome system that isn't perfect.  For formal scientific papers it is expected that proper uncertainty analysis is performed.  However, for less formal approaches it is good to use the sig fig rules to remember that numbers are inherently uncertain.  The rules to remember are:

* Rules for determining number of sig figs (All non-zero digits, all zeroes to the right of the decimal, no zeroes to the left of the first non-zero digit, all zeroes in between non-zero digits, all zeroes between the lowest non-zero digit and an explicitly stated decimal)

* When adding or subtracting, the result is only as precise as the number that has the largest *place value* of uncertainty

* When multiplying or dividing, the result has as many significant figures as the number that has the fewest significant figures

* Intermediate values of a multi-step piece of arithmetic should never be rounded",null,0,cdok03z,1rlu8t,explainlikeimfive,hot,4
TimeTravellerSmith,"Sig Figs are how many numbers that you actually want to look at when you write something down.

So pi is something like 3.14159....and on and on.  But we don't want to write all those down so we say we're gonna use 5 sig figs, which means that we'll call it 3.1416.  

Then when you want to start using sig figs in math operations you have to keep track of what has what and how many you can carry over.  So unless you have to track how many are used for operations, for exams it's best to try to keep as much as you can during operations in your calculator and then round at the end for the most accurate number.  You would end up rounding to be as accurate as the numbers you're given.

For example if you're told to calculate how much time it takes a mass to fall to earth, and you're told to use a mass of 1.1kg, then you'd round your answer to 2 sig figs in the end even though you might know that acceleration is 9.81m/s/s and the distance is 123526548 cm.",null,1,cdoiwhp,1rlu8t,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

Spain (26%) has had an unemployment crisis going back decades.  If you look at unemployment rates back in 2007, before the global economic meltdown, their unemployment rate was already around the 7-8% the US has today.  So, although they had been making steady progress towards lowering it for years, the result was that they had only managed to get to where the US is today.  The world banking collapse caused unemployment to spiral out of control.  It doesn't help that 11% of Spain's GDP comes from tourism, a particularly hard hit sector during any recession.

Greece (27%), with the help of Goldman Sachs &amp; JPMorgan Chase among others, lied to the rest of Europe about how much it was borrowing to fund its economy.  As a result, other countries kept lending to it without realizing that it had no way of ever paying the money back.

Well eventually your luck is going to run out and once discovered you are going to be faced with a humongous bill that you can't pay.

sir_sri,"&gt;We were told this in our high school Econ class, but it was never discussed or explained.

So a few things

1.  How countries count unemployment is different.

2.  Europe is actually fairing worse as a whole than it did during the great depression.  (It started out doing better than the US, but because the US is much more  centralized than europe federal spending the US has buffeted places like Florida and Nevada which would have been the greece and spain of a US union).

3.  Europe - even the countries in bad shape, have reasonably strong social safety nets, and particularly Spain, Italy and Greece have different cultures than the US where it's not unheard of to have people live with their parents until they're well into life.  This means the absolutely huge unemployed youth in europe (the age 20-30 crowd) are living off their parents and participating in underground (i.e. uncounted for cash) labour markets.  

4.  The problems europe faces are reasonably well understood, the problem is political paralysis and it's very very difficult to do much about it.  Either they need a much stronger central EU government responsible for much more spending, or the Euro needs to break up.  Absent those the EU needs to be willing to target more inflation (which given that inflation is 0.8% is not saying much).  None of those is particularly easy to accomplish politically, germany is against inflation, political integration failed and dismantling the euro would be admitting defeat on a project that need not fail.

forcefx,"This may not be 100% but this is my understanding of the unemployment rates across the countries/continents.
It depends on your definition of unemployment. Basically there is Frictional Unemployment, Cyclical Unemployment, and Structural Unemployment. At a very basic level unemployment can be broken down into voluntary and involuntary unemployment. The US rate of unemployment expressed to the Public is the involuntary unemployment rate, or those who do not wish to work/ try to work. /u/Zebo91 put it well when he said, 

&gt; ""The 8% is the workforce that does not have a job and is actively applying for work. That does not factor people who have given up looking or hasn't put any applications out in a while."" 

Involuntary unemployment is generally a larger problem. As of September 2013 the European Union Unemployment rate is 11%, not way too far off from the 7.3% in the United States.

 The 25% figure is most likely including all types of unemployment whereas the 11% is the voluntary unemployment rate. While Italy and France have the highest unemployment rates as of June 2013, Germany and the Netherlands are both below US rates.


TLDR; Voluntary vs. Involuntary unemployment. They show us the number that only includes those not looking for work, etc. The unemployment is EU: 11% vs. US: 7.3% as of September 2013

GryphonNumber7,"1. Countries define unemployment differently. Every country fudges the numbers in one way or another. In America, the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes 6 different measures of unemployment, each with an increasingly expansive definition of unemployment. U3 is the most often repeated measure, currently standing at 7.3%. U6, the most expansive definition, encompasses part time under-employed workers, those who've been discouraged from looking, and all other ""marginally attached"" persons. It's at about 13.8%. When talking about unemployment across different countries, you need to be sure you're looking at statistics that are actually measuring the same thing.
2. Many European countries, especially the ones that are having economic troubles today, have a recent history of bad government that exacerbated economic problems, leading to chronic high unemployment and socioeconomic dislocation. For example Spain had a fascist government until the 1970s, and around the same time Greece was ruled by a military junta. Italy has had like 40 different Prime Ministers since it adopted its modern constitution in 1946. By comparison, America has had only 12 presidents over that same time frame. Over time, the populations in these countries got used to having high unemployment, and started to consider that the norm.
3. America has grown accustomed to a certain level of affluence since World War II ended and we became the dominant military and economic power on Earth. So what might be acceptable levels of unemployment in other countries isn't good enough for us.

conomy is operating at maximum capacity, (everyone is working as hard as possible, all businesses are operating at maximum efficiency) there will still be some people unemployed due to various factors. Let's look at those factors.

1. 

Frictional Unemployment: 

Basically this is where people have just been layer off or quit and are unemployed but manage to get a new job fairly quickly. For instance if you work for Dole selling bananas for Reddit to use as a scale in photos, but suddenly a giant plantain comes along and destroys Reddit's ability to use bananas as a scale, thus reddit no longer uses bananas and you get layed off as a result. However luckily in a  month you get hired quickly to sell bananas to truck drivers in Africa who use it to temporarily fix truck Truck differentials (This is a real thing actually). Thus you were unemployed for a small amount of time thus it would temporarily cause an increase in unemployment

TL;DR Unemployment can vary based on how often people change jobs.

2. Structural Unemployment

People who can't a job, but want a job. They often lack the credentials to get a job or there is simply not enough jobs total for the population. This is where government policy tends to come into effect, a country with a very strong unemployment benefits program and other welfare might have higher rates of structural unemployment since they can rely on the programs more rather than taking a very low paying job. 


There is also another area doesn't really fit in to these categories at all, and that is people involved in illegal business or who have undeclared income. A hypothetical scenario is a crack dealer who claims unemployment benefits because he has no income to report other than his illegal money. Thus a country that has a large amount of people who falsely claim that they are unemployed when they are actually Meth dealing ex chemistry teachers.

So I wouldn't generalize too much about the whole continent of Europe, but generally European countries as a whole have stronger welfare programs and thus a higher structural unemployment, that is probably one of the biggest reasons, not sure about the other two. Also some countries in Europe have shittier economies. 

Though this really only makes sense if you're framing this in the context of unemployment that is most commonly used for government policy. The unemployment rate used is really only helpful from a monetary and perhaps fiscal macroeconomic policy viewpoint. It's not really a good measure of quality of life or an individualistic perspective of an economy.

Some of it has to do with the strength of families, particularly extended families. 

Most Americans think of their money as 'theirs'. It's not their brothers or their nephews or anyone else's. It's a very individualistic culture. 

In some southern European countries, the family is both bigger and more communal. There's a family 'pot'.

So 25% unemployment in USA means that many households will have no income, or at least a 50% drop in income, which is a disaster. 

But in parts of (Southern) Europe, a 25% unemployment rate might mean that out of four brothers, three still have jobs, and they cover for each other. The unemployed one might be in charge of looking after the grandmother.

Also, keeping things in the family means that credit is easier. If you are on hard times in America you will probably have to max out credit cards, and that puts you into serious debt quickly. In southern Europe you are more likely to be able to borrow cheaply from an uncle or a cousin - on the proviso that, when it comes to it, you then give their kid a leg up. What goes around comes around. 

Certain immigrant communities in the USA - Italians, Greeks, Jewish etc - understood this well, and were usually able to go from nothing to something in a generation or two. Then they bought cars, moved to the suburbs, plugged themselves into MTV, and wondered where it all went.

The small-scale examples given in the other examples, whereby rise in wages and rise in living expenses are directly correlated, is true inside of a small-scale closed system. However, it fails to account for changes that occur at larger scales.

First off, you are absolutely right. Just raising the minimum wage will do very little on it's own. However, it is an important part of creating a **demand side economy**. You'll also want to ensure business regulation will prevent monopolies from emerging in the new markets created by the new demand, and you want to make sure your tax scheme is progressive enough to prevent the rich from getting so rich they flip it around again, creating the situation you described. So, yes, preventing an executive from making too much more than the workers can help, but you have to be careful not to overdo it; you still need investment capital.

*So, why have a demand-side economy?*

Simply put, the health of an economy is tied to the flow of money. If money is changing hands, it generally means things are getting done, goods and services are trading hands and have good value associated with it, and you have an example of the old saying ""A rising tide lifts all boats."" While the actual value of individual units of currency might change, in an economy that is both growing and health, purchasing power increases. As growth is primarily fueled by technological innovation and doesn't really look to slow down, increasing the value of labour to match is healthy!

The next thing to understand is that poor people and rich people handle their money very differently. Poor people, they spend their money as soon as they get it, on things like rent, food, clothes, medical care, etc. They don't (and can't) hold on to very much. By contrast, rich people traditionally either save their money, or shunt their money off into the financial sector, where it is *invested*. Ideally, that money is invested in ways that enhance the economy by keeping the money flowing; into businesses, especially small businesses, on a competitive stock market, and into limited markets. That dynamic of investiture is what forms the basis of the financial sector of the market.

Now, something interesting happens when the system gets ""top heavy"", when the richer portion of society has a disproportionately large chunk of the money compared to the poorer half. (like, for example, in a society which believes in supply side ""trickle down"" economics) Essentially, this causes the financial sector, especially small portions of it, to become bloated with capital. Money is invested at a faster rate than growth can keep up with, because money is not the only limiting factor on growth.

Investment is rarely straightforward. Oftentimes, an investment is actually an investment into an investment ad nausium which is finally being invested in the actual market. What happens is that large portions of the economy are segregated off, circulating only in an incestuous subset of the financial industry chasing real value to be invested in for growth. Other people, usually middle class people who want to be rich, take out loans in order to invest in these seemingly-valuable markets. Pretty soon, there is more money being invested than the things are actually worth. When people realize this has happened and they won't see a return on their investments, the bubble ""pop"".

This is known as a ""Bust"", and it involves the sudden loss of value in a market as everyone tries to get out as once. This not only releases a bunch of money back ""into the wild"", leading to inflation, but saddles a bunch of people with worthless investments they can't get rid of. Booms and busts are commonplace in an economy; without regulation, they are extremely vicious, creating periods of extreme growth followed by even worse depressions.

So why does this matter for minimum wage?

Because the people making minimum wage don't invest in the financial market. Money comes to them through their jobs and is immediately spent on *stuff*, which pays other people their salaries so they can spend it on *stuff*, and so on and so forth. When you pay minimum wage workers, more, they still do that, but they have more options. They might be able to afford to eat out and eat better, so new markets open up for restaurants and quality food. They can buy electronics and entertainment, so those markets expand. Competition in these markets is no longer strictly a race to the bottom in terms of prices, which creates a more diversified economy as luxury options move in. You still have people who own those companies and make lots of money and are rich, but they are not making quite as much as they were, their profit margins are narrower (further encouraging competition and reducing monopolization) and less money is shunted off into the financial sector, so booms are not so frantic and busts are not so drastic.

A ""demand-side"" economy sees more regular, stable growth in markets that are more in line with the long-term value of a market, because most of the money is coming from consistent spenders (the poor) instead of investment chasers (the rich). The growth of the economy is seen directly by everyone, instead of just to investors. Rich people still exist and still invest, providing the raw capital needed to break new ground into fresh markets and reaping the benefits, but because the system is more bottom-heavy, investments are more metered and safer. Less runaway booms and busts.

Either way, you get growth, usually fairly comparable numbers, when you look at it over long periods of time. But in a supply side economy where minimum wage is low, thus devaluing labour and massively increasing profits for the rich, the economy spikes and drops harshly, wasting capital and hurting the people at the bottom who can't afford to have their labour devalued any further. In a demand-side economy, the growth is a steady line, with little dips and rises. Less money is squandered and prices are more stable, so your money goes further!

So, everyone else here is absolutely right; in a closed system, raising the minimum wage would be meaningless. But it's not a closed system; the economy of labour exists alongside things like financial sector, like government and public spending, and like the global market.

****TL;DR****
Higher minimum wage and redistribution of the economy so poor people have a higher proportion of the money leads to steadier, more stable economic growth with better competition by growing new markets in proportion to the consumer rather than the investor. However, this sort of economy also requires greater regulation and progressive taxation.

You know how they talk about how 10% of Americans control 90% of the wealth (or something like that)?  A higher minimum wage, it's argued, would force employers to pay employees more and would cause less of a rift between upper and lower classes. 

The other side of that coin though, is that ultimately, it devalues the dollar and it's more expensive to hire employees.  The result might end up being inflation (dollar devaluation) and fewer jobs, although they'd pay more.

Both Bush and Obama used a ""stimulus"" (cutting checks for 600 - 1200+ dollars to middle class families) in order combat the recession. Why did they do this? Because economists overwhelmingly agreed that this was the right thing to do and that it had an overall positive effect.

McDoogleSnatch,"First, [consider looking at this graph.](http://www.heritage.org/~/media/Images/Reports/2013/06/SherkChart1.ashx?h=405&amp;w=600)  Purged from the US Department of labor, this chart illustrates that the minimum wage we currently have is $1 *above* the historical average going back to 1947.  Taking into consideration how [tax relief effects those on minimum wage further skews the truth](http://cdn.epionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/minimum-wage-historical-chart.png).  The current notion that minimum wage workers are making so much less, relatively to people in the past making minimum wage, is preposterous.  Especially if you factor in all how technology has made one's standard of living increase for the equivalent cost of living.

This notion that we should have a $15/hour minimum wage, seems to have [originated by a *banned* TED talk given by Nick Hanauer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBx2Y5HhplI)  Refutations of his opinion can be found [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/22/a-15-minimum-wage-is-a-terrible-idea/), [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/09/01/the-absurdity-of-a-15-minimum-wage/) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jk3fRC8kqs)(this one is an interview with the guy).  He gets his number by looking not a historical averages in wages, but *increases in productivity rates*.  The problem with his rationalization is simple.  Suppose you own a Wal-Mart and you pay to install 12 self-checkout counters.  Four of them can be run by one person, reducing your labor force from 12 to 3.  Because productivity in this case quadrupled, Nick would reason that the remaining employees should have their wages quadrupled to compensate, since they are four times more productive.  If you can't understand why that is absurd at first glance, then I can't help you.

Consider for a moment what a $15/hour wage would mean.  A couple, working at McDonalds full time, would be making $60,000/year.  That's [$10,000 more a year than the median income](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Distribution_of_Annual_Household_Income_in_the_United_States.png) of all Americans for a job that requires the absolute bare minimum in skills and experience.  Can you imagine the consequences to our country's productivity and job growth should this be an option?

That begs the question, if $15/hour is unreasonable, what is a lower amount that would have less detrimental effects on the economy and still foster a ""living wage?""  Of course, that necessitates defining what a ""living wage"" is.  It requires calculating the cost of rent, food, transportation, child care and medical costs.  These all vary from city to city, and state to state.  As I live in Austin, [here is a breakdown of the living wage estimates courtesy of some dude at MIT](http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/48015).  For the sake of argument, lets assume all of these numbers are accurate.  Do you notice that in all of the cases in which someone is without a child, the minimum wage *exceeds* the living wage requirements?  You may then ask, how many workers are on minimum wage have children?  There's no one study that illustrates this, but looking at [data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011tbls.htm#2) and the [Census](http://www.census.gov/hhes/families/files/cps2012/Figure10.pdf), a reasonably high estimate would be 20% of minimum wage workers.  That breaks down to just 1% of all employees.  Is it so catastrophic that 1% of the workforce isn't making a ""living wage?""  What other country in the world can make such a claim?  This minimum wage/living wage argument is blown *way* out of proportion.  It's done primarily by union leaders, community organizers, and members of the political left who exacerbate the problem for their own personal ambitions.

And should you say that we should still do *something* for that 1% of the workforce, then why not look to encourage community outreach programs to help.  Local charities are looking for reasons to give their money away and a single mother working a minimum wage job is someone they wouldn't turn down.  What about encouraging people *not* to have out-of-wedlock children? This is more than sufficient, especially because the turnover rate in minimum wage jobs are so high.  Meaning, once a person is there, getting skills and improving their resume, they leave the job to find one with a better wage.",null,4,cdoqmf3,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,hot,8
t_hab,"In most cases, it can't. 

If under a free market, your job is worth $12, then placing a minimum wage at $15 eliminates your job. **You don't get a pay raise, it has become illegal for you to work at the wage that somebody is wiling to pay you and that you want to work at.**

Not only that, but the person down the hall making $20 who depended on your work also gets fired. The person making $22 who can do his job without you, but less efficiently, gets a pay cut.

Of course, now the company can't produce as much as it used to or at the same quality, so it has to charge its customers a lot more and give them a lot less. Basically, you end up with a lot of slack in the economy (it shows up on the supply and demand curves as two triangles that are wasted, otherwise known as deadweight loss). If the company has to raise its price and lower its quality beyond a certain point, then no customer will buy its products and either it will close down (firing everybody in town) or move (firing/relocating everybody in town). 

**Basically minimum wage is an almost entirely useless tool to improve standards of living and equality. That's important to note, since improving standards of living and equality are extremely important things to do.**

**So when can a minimum wage be useful? Well, in the case of a labour monopsony (single employer) a regulated wage can help prevent employee abuse.** Setting it too high will cause the problems described above, but not setting it at all can cause the opposite problem, so setting it as close to the right wage as possible helps to reduce the inefficiency. 

**Minimum wage also serves as a signal.** While perfectly efficient economies wouldn't need a signal for the ideal wage, imperfect markets (the kinds we have) use all kinds of signals. If I am a small entrepreneur and I want to know how much to pay an inexperienced, part-time, unskilled labourer in a non-dangerous job, I might not know how to look up industry statistics. Instead, I take the minimum wage as the indication as to what that person is worth. If they have some skills, I might take minimum wage as the signal and adjust upwards by a certain percentage. While any level of minimum wage will prevent some people from working, low enough minimum wages will cause almost no negative impact on the economy but also serve as a signal that avoids low-skilled workers getting abused out of ignorance. 

In the information age we are finding better signals, but the minimum wage is still a useful one. Hopefully we will be able to completely do away with it in the near future, but today, it still serves a useful purpose. **The problem is that some people think its purpose is to raise general wages, but in reality it can only serve to help prevent extreme cases of abuse.** There are other tools that must be used in order to bridge the income gap and help raise the standard of living for the most poor.",null,4,cdorxzg,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,hot,8

The inflation would effect everyone equally but the worst off would no longer feel it the most harshly as it is today. A more evenly distributed economy is actually a recipe for economic success since it means more aggregate demand. It's all about the marginal propensity to consume.

The point of minimum wage is to ensure that companies can't translate low wages into increased profits for the CEO, shareholders etc. In a perfect capitalist economy where everyone knows exactly how much their labor is worth and there is absolutely no question about how much you should get paid minimum wage is unecissary. You would make whatever is fair and would allow you to provide for yourself as that wage would be tied to the price of goods given the fact that firms would pay their workers based on what they would make based on how much they sell. Unfortunately, in real life I have no idea how much people accross the country with the same job as myself make so I can't tell my employer exactly how much I am worth. A minimum wage allows the goverment to help determine how much a person's labor can be worth at the bare minimum preventing exploitation of workers and ensuring that at the minimum people can survive when they have a job.

The current minimum wage is no longer sufficient to provide enough for basic survival needs. I and many others believe it must be raised to ensure that workers are payed at very least enough to survive given the current CPI (Living Wage).

Or has more military force. More whatever the conflict is about. The solution to such conflicts are treaties where all parties decide they are better off if ALL parties involved reduce equally. The reason why this is not always possible is because they cant always decide what is equal, or who should be more equal than the others. 

When it comes to minimum wage it's a little easier. There's a higher power, a government who can decide who, what and when these ""treaties"" should count for. 

A government could for instance enforce a minimum wage for the food industry only. This would help avoid the outsourcing a lot of labor, but it's not like the fast food industry would stop selling food in the US. Unlike a phone-tech assistant these jobs require working hands on US soil. 

Thing is that probably most work that can be done without being located in the US for less than 15$ probably already is outsourced, so you might as well not make it limited to say the food industry. 

So wouldn't the prices go up on their products? Not necessarily. They don't pay people more if they make more revenue. The price of labor is mostly decided by supply and demand. This means that every time a nation is losing jobs and markets, then there is a high demand for jobs that they can take advantage of. These swings will always happen. Nations change, and then it takes time to adapt to new markets more suitable for their nation. In the US, this would probably mean a higher focus on better education towards tech and greater investment in tech development along with other particularly and less about manual labor but that's a way different discussion. Point is that swings will happen and they always take time to adjust. 

So basically it does two things: 1) it helps reduces between classes in the US. These classes are more or less made up by 3 stands of sociaty: a) people who have ownership in US companies who either succeeds in markets suitable for the US nation, and/or outsources. b) The people who work for these companies in the US because they make up a profession that is desirable to said companies/markets and c) which is the last and lowest stand which are the people who are not desired by any of these markets/companies but does jobs they cannot outsource. 
Minimum wage helps the second class(b) but more importantly it prevents massive abuse against the third stand of society. 

2) It helps spread(read; keep) more money within the US. Money spent towards third(c) class professions are money spent on services they more or less must've spent money on anyways. This again leads to less buyer force directed towards imported goods and pleasures. 

Both these points are economically profitable for the US. Being a first world country they are expected to have a certain amount of welfare, although it is shit compared to the rest of the first world/western world. Having more people be able to afford their daily lives through their own work is good. And who pays for this? The middle and upper class, through the services they purchase. 
Then less money goes overseas. 

Now who want you to think this is a waste of money? Well, the upper class(a) first and foremost, but also to a great extent class b. Togather they make up a big enough voters pool so that they have a great chance, and I'd argue they have already to a great deal too, steer politics in their own advantage through (political) campaigns and advertisement.

Many modern downloads will change the estimate very quickly after the download speed changes, but if you just take a look at a download and it says ""4 hours remaining"", and you leave to do something else, the speed may drop and change the estimate to ""6 hours remaining"" when you aren't there to see it.",null,0,cdojqs0,1rlxct,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

This creates some initial design issues, but it shouldn't really create a load issue if the initial architecture of the software is sane.

The real answer is that Healthcare.gov was a trainwreck of extremely poor project management due to the cronyism exercised by the Obama administration in hiring CGI. It's just a really shoddy, terribly built piece of software because of poor business analysis, poor design and poor project management.

For example, healthcare.gov is powered by a remarkably shitty and remarkably obscure xml-based data tier.  Not only does their chosen data tier not scale because of its bad tech, it also drastically limited to talent pool they could hire from because it wasn't an industry standard technology.

Reddit involves posting cat and banana pictures vs health care information so it doesn't have the same security requirements that healthcare.gov has, so the amazon cloud might not be appropriate to host healthcare.gov.

When you buy bitcoins you are buying units of the fledgling currency.  There is a decentralized network that keeps track of who owns which units, just like a bank keeps track of who has how much money in their account.  This system is set up so that everyone can check everyone else's work and so that there aren't real names inherently associated with each person't account.  It's also set up so that opening an account is as simple as choosing a random number to call yours (yes, if someone else chooses the same random number then there's a problem, but there are a *lot* of numbers to choose from, so you could choose random numbers at a rate of 100 billion billion per second and still watch the sun burn out before you ever choose a number someone else chose, provided they chose truly randomly).

Another important difference between Bitcoin and stock is that it is possible to buy a fraction of a Bitcoin, just as it is possible to buy a fraction of a Euro.  In fact, Bitcoin is probably among the most divisible currencies on the planet, given that it can be divided to a unit of 1/100,000,000 of a Bitcoin, far smaller than anything currently useful.  There's the possibility to divide further, if necessary.

Finally, it's important to realize that unlike a stock, owning a Bitcoin does not give the owner any rights.  Bitcoin does not pay dividends nor does it offer people the right to vote on, well, anything.  All it is is a digital medium of exchange, store of value, and instrument of wild speculation.

japko,"There is an interesting theory about that, actually. Do you know the [Jesus illusion](http://files.myopera.com/Dava/albums/170157/Jesus%20Illusion.png)?

Our mind usually tries to adapt to things. In the said illusion, our mind notices that there is a big black blob in our sight, that carries no information with it. It makes no sense. So it's best to ignore it. Our perception mechanisms start to create a ""counter-reaction"" - something that would even out the nonsensical blob, and make it one with the background. The longer the blob is there, not moving, the stronger this counter reaction be. After a couple of minutes, when you stop looking on the blob, and look on, say, a wall, you will see the counterreaction of your brain - an image that happens to look like the face of Jesus. It could be anything though. Your nose, for example, is removed from your sight in a similar way, only you never get to see the counter-reaction, because you always have a nose in its place, hopefully.

Now, the same applies for all stimuli, but there is an interesting glitch in some of them. There was an interesting study about people who give blood. When you do it for the first time, it's scary, painful, and takes some time to get back to feeling 100% good after the deed, but your organism creates an anti-reaction - and when the pain wears off, you actually feel pretty good physically. The more you give blood, the less scared you are, the more used to the procedure you are, and in effect, the less pain you feel (also thanks to the feel-good counter-reaction).BUT! The major finding in this study is, that with time the counter-reaction does NOT fade, like the initial painful stimulus does. It stays on the same level, making giving blood pleasant, some even described is as addictive.

It is hypothesised that the same mechanism happens with other things, like cold showers, blue cheese, wine, and (finally to the point), beer. It's not tasty at first, but your brain creates a countermeasure to relieve you in your beer-drinking pain, an anti-taste, if you will. With time, you get used to the taste, but the magnitude of the positive antitaste stays the same, so you end up enjoying the whole thing.


**tl;dr: it's thanks to a counter-reaction to negative stimuli that your brain creates.**

And overtime, the burn of the acid probably doesn't even register unless you have a cold or have just consumed spicy food.  But to someone in a third world country who has never had Coke, soda is hard to choke down the first time because of the acid and the cloyingly sweet level of sugar.

Like so, there are pleasant qualities associated with wine, beer, and coffee. And there are unpleasant qualities associated with wine, beer, and coffee.

When you ""acquire a taste"" you are **not** learning to love an unpleasant flavor…that would be nonsensical. The truth is that the unpleasant flavors fade away over time, leaving you free to discover and enjoy the pleasant qualities unfettered.

It's a lot like that for Wine/Whisky/Beer/Coffee.

First few drinks, all you notice is the main taste - which is bitter. Then you start noticing the additional tastes. Essentially, your baseline has shifted. The bitter is still there but you notice it less. Now you notice the differences between different types of wines or different types of beer and you start realizing you prefer one or the other. This relative preference starts getting coded into your mind and you start treating the liking as absolute. This is the stage at which people start saying, ""Oh, I love the Zinfandel. Not so much the Cabernet Sauvignon.""

Also, the brain rewards us for persistence. If you keep trying wine/beer/coffee/whisky the brain starts hiding the unpleasant sensory information as it seeks out the subtleties. As a bonus, you start thinking of yourself as a connoisseur and you get hooked.

Also, I see a lot of people saying how they hate coffee and that it's bitter. To them I'd say that good coffee is barely bitter and that behind what little bitterness there may be there is a wealth of nuance and flavour waiting to be discovered.

Bitcoins and gold may have some speculative value but as a solution to economic problems or as a form of money they are on a par with pyrite

As I understand bitcoins their main feature is that the supply of them is intended to be finite.  This will make them great for speculators but as a form of money they come with the same problem as gold and that is that the amount of money in an economy needs to be flexible.  Through history there have been a number of situations where authorities have tried to limit the money, sometimes by trying to force a gold standard, and the result has been serious depression.  I wonder if bitcoins were invented in part because gold is in limited supply.

circleBitcoinProbably the increasing interest in  bitcoins is a psychological reaction to economic uncertainty and fears of hyperinflation which would wipe out the savings and pensions of a lot of people.  Given that the economic crisis is based on problems in the resource base gold and bitcoins may not be useful.  A better hedge would be a market garden.

Another feature of bitcoins is that they can be used online anonymously .  This makes them great for illegal transactions.   No wonder some regulators are saying bitcoins should come under their jurisdiction.

So far as I can see the main use of bitcoins is for speculation.

Koooooj,"The nominal exchange rate (i.e. $1000 per Bitcoin) is pretty much immaterial.  It could be that $100,000 per Bitcoin is fair or that $0.01 is overvalued.  This is because Bitcoins are effectively infinitely divisible--you can divide a single Bitcoin into 100,000,000 pieces (each worth 1/100,000,000 as much) right now and divisibility could increase with a simple software patch.

There are two things that drive the value of Bitcoin:  utility and speculation.  The second is pretty obvious:  people notice that the value goes up, so they buy.  This makes the value go up even more, so they buy more.  This cycle repeats until people get tired of buying, at which point the bubble pops and the price quickly falls to zero.  We saw that happen perhaps most famously in the Netherlands with tulip mania in the 1600s.

Utility, on the other hand, ought to be much more stable.  It brings price increases as more people realize the utility and join the movement.  This is what gave Bitcoin its original value.  Thus, the question is what is their utility?  The answer varies from person to person, but the common answers include:

* It allows near-instant transactions around the world (seconds until it's received, typically)

* Transactions are irreversible--great for merchants dealing with credit card fraud

* Transactions are low fee--credit cards can take several percent of a merchant's gross income

* There is no danger of sudden hyperinflation from a government deciding to print 100 trillion dollar bills (see: Zimbabwe)

* Transactions can take place nearly anonymously (technically pseudonymously)

* Individuals have the power to protect their wealth from theft more securely than a bank can (note: many Bitcoin supporters are strongly Libertarian and view taxes as theft; Bitcoin is especially popular in that group.  Also note: many people do not take the proper precautions)

restricteddata,"Every so often the US military creates a document called the Nuclear Posture Review, which outlines the current US nuclear weapons policy and sets the policy for the next five years.

It says a lot about preventing nuclear terrorism, modernizing the stockpile (without making new warheads), providing assurance to NATO allies, reducing stockpile sizes, and so on.

It says very little, however, about when the US would use nuclear weapons. This is a deliberate ambiguity. The US does not want to say, ""we will never use them except in reply to nuclear attacks,"" because it fears that might invite an adversary to think that even terrible non-nuclear attacks might be ""safe."" It also does not want to say, ""we will definitely use nuclear weapons in response to an WMD attack"" because the President always wants to keep his options open. US nuclear policy is extremely vague as a result. It is basically ""we won't use them, unless we really think we have to."" It does not rule out, for example, using nuclear ""bunker busters"" to destroy fortified targets. It does not rule out using nukes in reply to chemical or biological attacks. It also does not guarantee they would be used in those instances, either.

TheUnRealTylerDurden,"The key to snakes' agility -- hundreds of vertebrae and ribs -- is closely related to the key to their locomotion: ventral scales. These specialized rectangular scales line the underside of a snake, corresponding directly with the number of ribs. The bottom edges of the ventral scales function like the tread on a tire, gripping the surface and propelling the snake forward.Snakes have four basic methods of movement:

 Serpentine - This S-shape movement, also known as undulatory locomotion, is used by most snakes on land and in water. Starting at the neck, a snake contracts its muscles, thrusting its body from side to side, creating a series of curves. In water, this motion easily propels a snake forward because each contraction pushes against the water. On land, a snake usually finds resistance points in the surface -- such as rocks, branches or dents -- and uses its scales to push on the points all at once, thrusting the snake forward. Speckled rattlesnake using rocks as resistance points

Sidewinding - In environments with few resistance points, snakes may use a variation of serpentine motion to get around. Contracting their muscles and flinging their bodies, sidewinders create an S-shape that only has two points of contact with the ground; when they push off, they move laterally. Much of a sidewinding snake's body is off the ground while it moves.

Caterpillar - A much slower method of movement is caterpillar or rectilinear locomotion. This technique also contracts the body into curves, but these waves are much smaller and curve up and down rather than side to side. When a snake uses caterpillar movement, the tops of each curve are lifted above the ground as the ventral scales on the bottoms push against the ground, creating a rippling effect similar to how a caterpillar looks when it walks.

Concertina - The previous methods work well for horizontal surfaces, but snakes climb using the concertina technique. The snake extends its head and the front of its body along the vertical surface and then finds a place to grip with its ventral scales. To get a good hold, it bunches up the middle of its body into tight curves that grip the surface while it pulls its back end up; it then springs forward again to find a new place to grip with its scales.",null,0,cdommt2,1rm7bf,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

QuickSpore,"Needless to say the facts in the matter are disputed. Prior to WWI the area known as Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Around this time there was a group of Jews living in Palestine, all across the Middle East really. And the European Jews were tired of being treated like second class citizens. Hitler was far from the first European leader to put blame on the Jews, or to round them up and kill them. He was pretty much the best at it though. So these European Jews chose their old ancestral land as the one which would become a Jewish homeland. 

Bit by bit Jews moved to Palestine, buying land and setting up communities. The Turks weren't too happy about that. The last thing they wanted was another strong ethnicity in the empire. But they never cut off immigration completely. And small numbers of Jews continued to move into the area.

When WWI broke out, the British made a lot of promises. They promised the area to the Arabs. They promised the area to the Jews. And they promised to split it up and rule it with the French. Of course the promise they kept was to rule it themselves as a ""protectorate."" Both the Jews and the Arabs (there were no ""Palestinians"" yet) took offense at this. And both Jewish and Arab terrorist coups formed. And a three way low level micro-war broke out. The British clamped down on Jewish migration, incidentally dooming a lot of Jews, but a small amount of illegal immigration continued to take place.

By the end of WWIi it was clear the British weren't going to hold on to the area. And frankly they didn't want it anymore, more trouble than it was worth. Step one was the area east of the Jordan river was spun off as Trans-Jordan. There were very few Jews and so it was clear that would be Arab regardless. But dividing the area west of the Jordan was a mess. And there was even a question of whether it should even be divided at all. After a few years the British tossed the problem to the UN. And in 1948 the UN came up with a plan, the area would be split. About 60% would go to the Arabs in Palestine, 40% would go to the Jews, and Jerusalem would become an ""international"" city. It wasn't clear exactly how that last part would work out. Largely the Jews said absolutely, we accept. And largely the Arabs said, we don't accept. And the British said, screw it we're leaving.

The day the British left, the Jews declared the formation of the state of Israel. And the Arab nations all declared war on Israel. I the end when the fighting was over, Israel had most of Palestine. Egypt had Gaza. And Jordan had the West Bank. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were forced from their homes all across the Middle East. And a lot of Palestinians fled from their homes in what became Israel.

Israel was established as a Jewish democratic nation. But it should be mentioned at this time that there were a lot of Arabs living in the new Israeli state. And they are citizens to this day, with voting rights and everything. It should also be mentioned that Jews and Arabs are not treated exactly the same.

After this Israel and the Arab states fought other additional wars. And Israel conquered Gaza, the West Bank, Sinai, and the Golan Heights. Originally Israel held these territories with a promise of ""land for peace."" They gave the Sinai back to Egypt for a peace treaty. But neither Egypt or Jordan wanted Palestine back. And the Palestinians didn't have anyone willing and capable of negotiating with Israel.

Somewhere about this time the Israelis got the bright idea that settling Israelis in the occupied territories would both make them more secure and induce the Palestinians to the table. That didn't exactly work. And some Israeli extremists view them as a chance to grab more or even all of Palestine and create a Greater Israel.

So right now the two parties are disagreeing on most everything. The extremists on both sides would love to see the others driven ""into the sea."" And even the moderates can't agree on where borders should be, if Arabs should be allowed to return to their old lands in Israel, who gets Jerusalem... and which parts. And both sides regularly kill innocents on the other side, making it harder to compromise. ",null,0,cdopvj3,1rm94a,explainlikeimfive,hot,6

AyCarrumba,"Two reasons:

* The earth has an inclined axis of rotation - the pole around which it spins is leaning over slightly. This means that as the earth orbits around the sun, the north pole leans ""towards"" the sun for 6 months, then ""away for 6 months, and vice versa. This gives rise to the Arctic circle, North of which the sun does not set for 6 months.

* The suns rays can be regarded as being ""parallel"" when they hit earth. What this means is that at the equator, a certain amount of solar energy is concentrated on a small patch of the earth because it hits it at 90 degrees. As you near the poles, the same amount of energy hits the earth at a very shallow angle, meaning that it is spread over a much larger area of earth. Lower energy input = cooler.

The combination of these effects is that each pole beyond the Arctic or Antarctic circle experiences 6 months of very shallow angle daylight, and then 6 months of darkness. They are cooler because they receive much less solar energy. Incidentally, because they are icy and bright white, they actually reflect more of that sunlight back as well - darker ground would absorb more heat.

So, they get much less sunlight, they are dark 6 months out of the year, and they absorb less of that small amount of heat as well. ",null,0,cdoq7we,1rmffr,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

SO much can go wrong during a delivery. Only recently have we found a way to fix most of the problems that can arise. The biggest problems usually have to do with the fact that humans babies have unusually large heads as far as newborns go. Human babies are also pretty much helpless when they're born and have extremely delicate systems that have to immediately switch over from relying on mom for oxygen, food, waste removal, etc. to doing it themselves. PArt of that involves getting rid of the placenta, which is so closely linked with the mother that the circulatory systems fuse. After birth, the baby and the mother have to change from being one big, convoluted system to being on their own, which can have serious complications if everything doesn't go just right.

 For example, if all of the placenta doesn't come undone with the afterbirth, the mother WILL bleed to death because her body is still trying to get blood to a baby it thinks still needs it. The baby could get stuck in the birth canal because of complications or the baby simply being too big; big babies run the risk of getting jammed in the uterus, which places undue stress on both mother and child. The umbilical chord could get caught around the baby's neck. The mother could start having seizures as a result of the beginning processes of child birth. The baby could have deformities or birth defects that could endanger its mother's life as well as it its own.

Also, there would not be as much benefit as you would think from having a processor so fast.  A 10ghz processor is not 10x as fast as a 1ghz processor with an equivalent architecture.  The reason is that while the faster processor may be capable of performing 10x as many actions per second, the processor has to spend a much larger portion of its time waiting for the rest of the computer.  It takes time for data to travel between a computer's memory or hard drive or network connection and the processor, and the processor might have to sit there for anywhere from nanoseconds to milliseconds waiting for information to get to it.

Most modern advances in processor design (at least since ghz stopped increasing after the Pentium 4 era) have to do with the processor being able to handle more tasks simultaneously (more cores, hyperthreading), being smarter about reordering the things it is being asked to do so it can still work while waiting for information to come in, storing more information close to the processor (bigger caches), and things like that.",null,0,cdopqoc,1rmg62,explainlikeimfive,hot,3

CPU's are a great deal more complex than that, and it's not trivial to get perfect utilization out of multiple CPU's but adding repeated units can produce a lot of speedup without increasing clock speeds.

There are specialized processor types (or parts) that can get into the 10GHz range (notably some math stuff), but if you want a 20GHz processor you need a 20GHz clock, you need to be able to read a long string of 1's or 0's extremely precisely or you can get all messed up data etc.

Since the current can only flow in one direction through each pair of diodes, the positive half of the AC cycle will pass through one pair of diodes and be blocked by the other pair of diodes.  The other half of the AC cycle will be blocked by the first pair of diodes, and pass through the second pair.

From the other opposite pair of corners of the rectifier flows an oscillating direct current.  Now, what once looked like a sine wave looks instead like the path described by a bouncing ball.

mobyhead1,There's a .22 caliber shotgun?  Or are you referring to those .22 shotshells that can be chambered in .22 rifles and pistols?,null,0,cdor1z7,1rmlkd,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
djazzbass,"OK, shooting 101:

1. Shotguns are almost always measured in ""gauge"". This is how big the diameter of the barrel is. Like all ""gauge"" measurements, lower number = bigger. Small shotguns will measure barrel size in decimal inches (e.g. a 410 shotgun has a 0.410"" barrel) instead of gauge, but these are typically only considered children's guns. A .22 shotgun might exist, but it'd be so small as to be considered a novelty. You'd never shoot skeet with one, unless they were skeet for ants. Typical gauges for shotguns are 20, 16, and 12. 

2. Guns that fire bullets are measure barrel diameter either in decimal inches (.22, .308, .45) or mm (9mm, 5.56mm, 7.62mm). The US military is metric, so they refer to their ammo that way. US civilians typically get inch version of the similar bullets. So a Marine will load his M4 with 5.56mm ammo, while I load my AR-15 with .223 Remington bullets, which are almost the same. 

3. Just looking at the bullet diameter doesn't tell you how powerful the bullet is. You also have to factor in the size of the bullet and the amount of power it has. A .22LR has the same diameter as a .223 Remington. Look them up on Wikipedia - the .223 Remington will kill you at 1000 yds. The .22LR will not. Almost every bullet will have more than just a number. For example, you can't tell someone to buy you some .22 bullets, because there are three types: .22 short, .22 long, and .22 long rifle. There's not much consistency here and you just have to learn, unfortunately. Often a bullet will be named after the gun it was originally designed for or the company that made it. E.g. a typical handgun bullet is a .45 ACP. ""ACP"" = Automatic Colt Pistol, as this was designed for the Colt model 1911. 

4. Those things you put in your gun to make it go ""bang""? Those are actually ""cartridges"", not ""bullets"". The bullet is the lead part that is actually fired. The cartridge is the whole thing - bullet, brass case, power, primer. Almost everyone calls cartridges ""bullets"" and only the real pedantic will make the distinction. Some will call them ""rounds"". 

5. More semantics: clips and magazines are very different. A magazine is a box that holds bullets and typically attaches to the bottom of the gun. With a loaded magazine you'll typically only see one or two bullets at the top. Magazines can be large - average holds 15-20 and large ones can hold 100+. Magazines are designed to be reused. Almost every gun today that isn't a revolver uses a magazine. A clip is, well, just that - a small piece of metal that holds a small number of rounds together, usually 6 or 8. Clips are inserted into the top of a gun and are designed to be disposable. After the last shot, the gun will eject the clip automatically and the shooter can insert a new one without removing the old one first. Want to see a good example of a clip? Google ""M1 Garand"" - the main infantry rifle of WWII. This was a clip based gun.",null,0,cdorlkl,1rmlkd,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
dmukya,"It's probably not a .22 shotgun but a 20 or 28-*gauge* shotgun.  Shotguns are measured differently from pistols/rifles.  A shotgun's ""gauge"" is a traditional measurement based on the *number* of lead balls the diameter of the barrel needed to equal a *pound*.  The bigger the lead balls are, the fewer balls you need to make a pound, this is why bigger shotguns have lower numbers.

A magazine is technically not the same as a clip.  Clips hold together ammunition for easy loading and are (with a few exceptions) not loaded into the weapon.  Magazines are what you load *with* a clip, and when attached, hold ammunition in a ready state where the gun's mechanism can grab and put it in the barrel to fire.

Tips:

* Wear eye and ear protection
* Treat every weapon as if it was loaded
* Finger off the trigger until it's time to fire
* Only point the weapon at things you want to shoot
* When not shooting, point the muzzle in a safe direction, not at people

Snafu_Coaxer_2013,"There's a huge number of reasons for this, and I'll try touch on a few, but it's very important to first recognize a few assumptions. Firstly, you're coming at this from the perspective of someone who exists post-rise of the West so you're going to look at the world as being on a sort of linear progression of technology. That isn't how anyone viewed technology prior to the point that it changed radically in the span of a single lifetime, so around the late 18th/early 19th century. 

Also, note that to someone in the periods we're talking about, these sort of differences in technology might not appear to exist and ""technology"" the concept only really 'exists' in the popular mind by the early modern age.

Anyway, the main reasons I can think of that Europe ended up with superior technology to much of the rest of the world:

- Geographically, Europe isn't particularly well suited to farming (especially Northern Europe). While there are some very productive regions, there's nothing like the Mekong Delta and the continent is often too cold or the terrain too undulating to grow large quantities of crop. This means that agriculture is often very difficult. This has three effects: firstly, it means that the population is less content with an agrarian-based society, secondly, it facilitates trade within the region. Lastly, it's a huge limit on the growth of urban areas. So Europe is typified by very dense, very small urban settlements.

- Those geographical factors set up the perfect environment for huge economic growth. If I need to buy Egyptian grain, I need something Egyptians cant produce themselves, like wine. Using far more modern economic theory, we know that the most productive trade is done between highly specialized economies with very different advantages, and this leads to increased wealth for all economies involved. This develops rapidly in Europe, however it's not going to develop as well in South East Asia or North America, where food is abundant (and so trade in these places becomes a largely diplomatic exercise, rather than a vital force. Trade is a source of imported luxury goods, not a vital lifeline for the majority of the population). So we know that Europe is going to be more interconnected and wealthier in the long run than many other places with abundant food and smaller trade flows. 

- Greater trade flows means that ideas travel faster through Europe than through other locations. For example, if i'm in Peru and everything I consume is locally produced, there is little need for new ideas, and, more importantly, if i did have an innovative idea, it would likely never reach say, Mexico without generations of people physically migrating. However, an innovative farming idea in Baghdad is likely going to reach Vienna in less than a year. So the ""research base"", the knowledge that you've building off, is much greater in Europe (especially if you view Europe as a monolithic entity).

- Socially, the Black Death creates a need to radically restructure society. This leads to the Renaissance period, which triggers renewed interest in the Classical world and things like philosophy. This causes the Reformation, which, for a bunch of highly contentious reasons, leads to Northern Europe developing at a very fast pace (this is in a large part due to Protestantism removing much of the outer-worldliness of Catholicism, and much of the comfort it provided it's practitioners in terms of the promise of heaven). Coupled with a lack of agricultural land and an abundance of fuel sources, the Industrial Revolution occurs first in the region.",null,0,cdosar9,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,hot,4
whatIsThisBullCrap,"This is my own theory, and as far as I know not commonly supported. But I'll share it anyways, because I think it's at least a contributing factor. 

Basically, trade. Specifically, information trade. Europe was very connected to much of the world, and they were in constant contact with Arabia, India, China, North Africa, etc. This meant that information, most importantly technology could be shared. The result of this is that technology advances faster. 

Consider this basic example: ammunition, arches, and plows (just three random things that popped into my head) are complicated technology. They might each take 100 years to invent and perfect. For a single culture to invent all three would take 300 years. Or, three different cultures could invent one each. That way, the whole old world has them in 100 years, plus a couple for the information to spread. Obviously, technology doesn't work like this. First of all, it can take 1000s of years before someone realizes the need or potential for something, and then in a year it could be complete. There's also no reason you can't work on more than one piece of technology at the same time. However, this does demonstrate that having more peoples to invent technology that can be shared does speed of up the process. 

On the other hand, the Americans and southern Africans were more isolated. In America, the natives had ni contact with other peoples, and even amongst themselves wasn't that common except for with a few select tribes. In southern Africa, it was a similar story. Isolated tribes, and even when Europeans began exploring the rest of the continent, there was little trade, as it was mostly colonozation and resource-hunting. This means Americans and southern Africans didn't get the benefit of other societies' inventions ",null,0,cdos9ks,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

sir_sri,"&gt;Curious as to how they got so famous considering the pirate era wasn't that huge.

As other people said, some of it is people doing things after the fact.

But a big contributor was letters of Marque and prize money.  Countries could issue you a letter of Marque - that meant you were working for them and could capture enemy ships with the approval of your government.  And prize money is what the royal navy paid captains and crews who captured enemy ships.   That meant a lot of people who were 'pirates' went all legitimate and became 'commerce raiders' and then decided that the commerce  raider lifestyle, where you weren't allowed to attack your own coutries ships, wasn't nearly as lucrative as just being a pirate.  

Getting a posting to a Frigate (as compared to a slow ship of the line) was a big deal because you could make a huge amount of money if your ship captured someone elses.

People in all the major european states were well aware of piracy - ships and crews were lost, people killed, fortunes lost etc.   But then there's the romantic 'free from government rules' side of things too.  Where if you overlook all the health problems, the risks of being killed by other people and so on, it's sounds so good.

Keep in mind that this is the exact same car with the exact same engine using the exact same fuel.

With wings comes the trade off of weight. Arms and legs weighs a great deal - so birds are quick to flee and quick to swoop, we instead that did not need that escape strategy.

Way back in the day, in the 1950's or so, phone numbers were usually written with a word + 4 numbers. The first 3 numbers of that word then become the first 3 numbers. This is why phones have letters under the numbers, and did way way way before texting :) 

So 867-5309 would have originally been TORonto-5309 or UMPire-5309, for example. 

Now, the 5 on your phone dial has the letters ""JKL"". You try finding me a word that starts with that.

Thanksgiving is just a day when families put down whatever they are doing, and put aside whatever issues they have with each other and eat a meal together. It is only important because it is is viewed as a sort of social barometer for a family. If someone is alone on thanksgiving it a sign that either they do not care about their family or that their family does not care about them. It is also common that if someone for some reason absolutely cannot travel to eat with their family on thanksgiving a friend invites them to join his or her family.

(For example, I saw someone offering a ride from and to Pittsburgh to as far as Connecticut, their destination.) Thanksgiving is something that many people celebrate, but it's not exactly like you see in the movies. (Few things ever are...)

It's part of the American creation myth. The Pilgrims, struggling with the unexpected harshness of American winters, find unexpected friends among the Indians, who share their plentiful abundance with them. (Of course, the Native Americans celebrate a National Day of Mourning today, so like most history, perspective is important.) But this story is taught in elementary schools, and then kids are given the day off. The idea continues through college, when a lot of kids are going home for the first time of the year.

Most people are given the day off work. Some stores are open, so this is a shitty time of year to work retail. (Especially with 'Black Friday' coming up tomorrow.) It's a time for sometimes distant family members to come together, share a hearty meal, and spend a day thinking about how awesome things are, all things considered.

But it's also not terrible to miss out on a meal. Don't get me wrong, if you're not cooking (or not able to cook) it's very, very common for neighbors to see if you want a plate. ""What are you doing for Thanksgiving?"" is one of the most common questions Americans hear this week.

But movie theaters are open, especially in 'college towns', some people organize drinking parties. There are football games.

Iamtheonewhobawks,"Until the recent advent of Black Friday and its subsequent bleed-over into this thanksgiving's Black Thursday, Thanksgiving was uniquely difficult to commercialize. Its not a gift-giving holiday, there are no costumes, there is no emphasis on any one specific subculture.

There are no specific religious connotations, there is no epic origin story. That means that thanksgiving movies and songs and so on are relatively rare. You can only make so many about eating a large bird.

Thanksgiving is traditionally a holiday from the usual U.S. holiday experience. Every other one is surrounded by massive commercialization. Christmas decorations show up in stores in October, right alongside miles of cheap Halloween candy and disposable costumes. Easter is all about pastel colored everything, and since it is specifically christian anything Easter-themed will sell. Valentines day, a ""lets eat chocolate and fuck"" pseudo-holiday, is filled with obligatory purchases. Buy your SO some valentine's day themed food/clothes/jewelry/trip or its considered deeply insensitive.

New Years is an inescapable media storm. Fewer products to buy directly, a million special things on TV.

But Thanksgiving is just so hard to capitalize on. Its not a party holiday like St. Patrick's day or Cinco De Mayo, no presents are given, no trips are scheduled. The best anyone could think of was some cheap turkey-and-native-american decorations.


Of course, now we have Black Friday, which started being a thing sometime around the new millennium and seems to be attempting to change Thanksgiving into a new President's Day or MLK Day. A holiday where you celebrate specifically by going shopping. I guess we'll see how that goes.

I often tell people that it is my favorite holiday, and this is often surprising to them, given the scale of celebration surrounding other holidays compared to Thanksgiving. 

For me Thanksgiving is significant for its namesake. We live in a nation that is extremely prosperous and wealthy when compared to most nations in the world. Our economy is competitively based, our civil liberties heavily concerned with the rights of the individual. Success is defined by wealth, celebrity, sex-appeal, etc.

In such a society, I like to think that Thanksgiving is an opportunity to recognize how fortunate we are to have what we have. To acknowledge that the things that are truly important to us are friends and family. To pause our usual pace of life and put our rampant aspirations on hold for a brief moment to reflect on what we already have that we are truly grateful for.

InfamousBrad,"Odd that nobody is bringing up the fact that while having ""festivals of thanksgiving"" was a Puritan custom, they weren't held on a regular schedule, or even every year, until 1863: the year that President Lincoln declared that the last Thursday of November would, forever, be a day of thanksgiving for the fact that the war was turning around, that it was beginning to look like America would survive its war with the rebels.

But it was also a good time to make an annual festival a month out from Christmas, because the 1860s overlap the time that Christmas presents (like everything else in the home) were turning into something you bought, that came from factories, instead of being things that you made at home, or that your servants made for you.

So American Thanksgiving became as big, and important, as it is because it overlaps four themes, meets four strong needs that are very, very American:

* It's a foundational religious holiday among people who are still pushing the myth that America was founded as a Christian nation, ...

* It's a celebration of what was, until fairly recently, America's most important and profitable export industry, agriculture, and ...

* It's a celebration of military victory (most often, in modern times, taking the form or reminding people to pray for our troops abroad in foreign wars), ...

* It's a ceremony marking the official beginning of the Christmas season; with the rise of Thanksgiving, America switched its Christmas season calendar from the traditional December 24th through January 6th to our current fourth Thursday of November through December 25th.

Thanksgiving is one of a handful of holidays that is celebrated primarily with family.

And pie, that's important.  It is also a time for appreciating what you have: food and a family to share it with, if nothing else.  And despite what some here are saying, it absolutely is a time to learn about and reflect on our history.  The pilgrim story isn't a completely happy one, but it reminds us of why people came to America to begin with and what they had to go through to survive here.  It is also a time to reflect on the story of the Native Americans, both how they helped the pilgrims initially and how they treated each other later.

xdkyx,"CDO stands for Collateralized Debt Obligation - it's a derivative, meaning a financial instrument that derives it's value from another instrument (called underlying instrument). CDO's are basically financial instruments that derive their value from a large number (called a pool), of mortgages or loans. Companies that have access to mortgages/loans (banks or companies specialised in buying those from banks), pool them together and issue CDO's which are being sold to investors. The person buying the CDO (bearer), recieves interest basing on the probability of the loan backing the CDO not being paid off - that is if the loans used for the CDO pool have a high risk of not being payed off, the CDO has higher interest for the investor and if the loans are safer the interest is lower. What is most common is that the pools of loans, called tranches are graded based on seniority - the probability of default, from senior, mezzazine, junior to residual. Basing on this and knowing the structure of the pool an investor can choose if he wants to bare the risk of default vs interest recieved, because if the loans fail the CDO becomes worthless.
With the CDO the concept of an ""SPV"" comes in place - Special Purpose Vehicle, it's an entity created by the bank in order to issue the CDO. Basically it offloads the risk for the bank in the case of default.

aiydee,"Both are correct (cooked and raw) for Salmon depending on how it's smoked.

Hot smoking does cook it.  But it comes down to carbon monoxide.  When meat is cooked in the presence of high carbon monoxide, it will tend to leave a very strong pink in the flesh.   This is because Carbon Monoxide reacts with the Myoglobin in blood to create this colour.  (Look up Carbon Monoxide Myoglobin for more Not 5 Explaining).
Hot smoking consists of having the fish near the heat source when it is smoked.  Often 'trapped' in the same box as the fuel and smoking material.

However, you can 'cold smoke' meat.  Some fish are cold smoked.  Sometimes salmon is.  In which case it's raw fish like sushi, but it's been given a smokey flavour.  Cold smoking is typically done by having the smoking material and fire in a seperate box to the food you are smoking and having a cooled chimney leading to the food stuff.",null,0,cdov8nv,1rn1ke,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
LondonPilot,"&gt; **Is smoked salmon cooked or raw?**

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_fish):

&gt;  Cold smoking does not cook the flesh, coagulate the proteins, inactivate food spoilage enzymes, or eliminate the food pathogens, and hence refrigerated storage is necessary until consumption.

However, it then goes on to say:

&gt; traditionally, in the US, cold-smoked fish, other than salmon, is considered ""raw"" and thus unsafe to consume without cooking

Personally, I would consider smoked salmon to be uncooked. I think the distinction Wikipedia is making between salmon and other smoked fish is that salmon is the only one which is generally considered safe to eat in the US without cooking.

I'd guess that the reason for this is because salmon is so often prepared this way that the fishing and storage methods involve keeping the fish fresh enough to eat safely without cooking - I'm sure that other fish would be just as safe if it was stored in the same way as salmon.

&gt; **And does putting fish in an acid (i.e tuna in lime) cook the fish, or is it still raw despite the change in appearance?**

Again, using [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceviche#Preparation_and_variants) as a source:

&gt; Ceviche is marinated in a citrus-based mixture, with lemons and limes being the most commonly used. In addition to adding flavor, the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become denatured, appearing to be cooked. (However, acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms, unlike the heat of cooking.)

So this method of preparing fish is not considered to be cooking. However, the confusion perhaps stems from the fact that the word ""ceviche"", which describes preparing fish in this way, might derive from the Spanish-Arabic word assukkabáǧ, which itself derives from the Arabic word sakbāj (سكباج) meaning meat cooked in vinegar. The fact that this is the origin of the word is not definite, though.",null,0,cdov9ii,1rn1ke,explainlikeimfive,hot,2
Fairleee,"It depends on the context of the filming, and the laws in various nations. So, in the UK for example, if you are filming in public for the purpose of news, or reporting, or current events, then you do not need to obtain consent. This is because it is assumed that, by being in public, you have waived your right to privacy - after all, anyone in the street can see you. However, it is usually considered good practice for companies filming to put up signs or notices that filming will be going on in the area, so people are aware. This is partly because it would be impractical to obtain verbal or written consent from everyone in the area. However, if you notice that you are filmed, you do have the right to ask them not to identify you.

In a private residence, you do have to get permission to film someone so that they can be identified, because it is not assumed that they have waived their right to privacy (they are in a private place). 

That tends to cover people who are being filmed in the background - when it comes to people being interviewed, you typically would try and get a consent form in place, so they are aware that they are being interviewed, and the interview might be used. However, it is also generally expected that the person should be told what they are being interviewed about. For example, it would be completely unethical to tell someone that you are filming them about Christmas, and then use them saying, ""I think it's wonderful!"" in a piece about child pornography! Obviously that's an extreme example, but something that is intentionally misleading like that will make you liable to a lawsuit, and if you intentionally misrepresent someone then that is illegal.

When it comes to filming for commercial purposes (i.e., the purpose is to make money), then you would typically need a consent form because entertainment is different to news/current affairs. Again, in a large crowd scene, you can just use a general announcement that filming will be going on, but if you are going to film someone intentionally and directly (as opposed to just a shot of them in the background), you should get consent, simply to cover your own ass.

Mephysteaux,"Gifts are not typically exchanged on Thanksgiving. Strangers do typically wish each other a happy Thanksgiving/holiday. While Thanksgiving is traditionally a family holiday, some people do see/call friends. In particular, if a friend isn't spending Thanksgiving with someone (often due to being separated from their family), it's fairly customary to invite them to spend Thanksgiving with your family. Native Americans rarely get thanked. Religious people often thank God, but the feeling of gratitude generally isn't directed at anything or anyone in particular, unless they're directly involved. It's considered a generally American holiday, so it's celebrated by people regardless of their race, religion, or political affiliations. I wouldn't say there are people who express 'Anti-Thanksgiving' views, but there are some who say the story is watered down, and that the Thanksgiving story everyone knows takes away from the fact that Native Americans were abused by white settlers. Also, the big controversy recently is that a lot of employers, especially in retail, make their employees work on Thanksgiving. This is partly because Black Friday, which is considered one of the busiest shopping days of the year, is tomorrow. Thanksgiving is only one public holiday, but many employers also give employees the following day off so they can have a 4-day weekend, and schools might be closed as early as Tuesday or Wednesday.",null,0,cdowsk9,1rn8ci,explainlikeimfive,hot,4
GreenTea-,"The history, as I understand it, simplified: a ""day of Thanksgiving"" including a feast, to thank God for a fortunate event or blessing, is a tradition that goes way back. In America, there was a famous Thanksgiving in the 17th century when English settlers in Massachusetts joined with Native Americans to celebrate a successful harvest. It really happened, although it has been mythologized over the years.

Flash forward to the 19th century, ""days of Thanksgiving"" have continued but with no set date. The Civil War has torn the country apart and president Abraham Lincoln, inspired by a citizen's letter, decides to declare a national day of Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November. That's how it became the national holiday that it is today. For much more detail, see Wikipedia.

Modern Thanksgiving:

People of all faiths and nonbelievers celebrate the holiday to give thanks to their deity, to just be grateful/appreciative...or just to have a big meal. Many families try to get together, hence the driving large distances for people who have moved away.

Gifts are not a traditional part of the holiday. It's all about food, family, and (for many Americans) football! Also watching parades (mostly on TV).

Yes, it is normal to say ""Happy Thanksgiving!"" (or, ""Happy Holiday"", especially this year with Hanukkah overlapping it).

Friends certainly could be involved, although the focus is on family for most people. However, the night before Thanksgiving, many old high school friends reunite because they have all come back to their parents' homes after being away at college or moving away.

Unfortunately, actual Native Americans are not a big part of most public Thanksgiving events--although I'm sure it happens somewhere.

Amazingly, Thanksgiving seems to be equally enjoyed by liberal and conservative Americans. Food is universal. :) There's not much anti-Thanksgiving sentiment, although you do see some from Native American activists. Also vegans I guess, since turkey is the traditional main dish (although many vegetarians/vegans celebrate happily with non-meat dishes).

The official public holiday is only Thanksgiving Day itself. Some workplaces also close for the following day, making a wonderful 4-day weekend, but others don't (especially retail--the dreaded ""Black Friday"").

havalinaaa,"You have it right about the why - when the first (successful) colonists arrived, they didn't know how to survive here and the Wampanoag tribe helped them out, showing them the wonders of corn and other things. They had a big meal to celebrate. We commemorate that meal with Thanksgiving. It is a secular holiday, though of course there are religious people who like to make it about religion and thanking god for a bountiful harvest, but as an atheist I say it's usually non-religious people's favorite big holiday. It's supposed to be about being thankful for all you have in your life, lots of families go around the table saying what they're thankful for or something similar. 


You typically have a large meal with your extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc) and sometimes with your friends instead if you don't want to deal with that (it's sort of unofficially traditional for political arguments to happen, personality clashes to come up, all the 'joy' of family time basically) or can't afford to travel - or if your friend can't go you bring them to your family's thanksgiving. There are lots of football games that people watch all day while sitting in a turkey-induced food coma stupor. Also, a big parade happens in NYC that most kids love to watch on tv. 


You do say 'happy thanksgiving' to people. As far as I know (I'm white), all races celebrate thanksgiving. There are no gifts. I've never heard of people being anti-thanksgiving, just anti-the sale that happen the next day. 


It happens the fourth Thurs. in November, and that day is an official holiday that most people have off work, schools are closed, etc. Some people also get Friday off but not everyone (all schools are usually closed though), and of course there are people that have to work both days (cops, doctors, gas station clerks, etc - and more recently, some large chain stores are open).

The difference is called the ""deficiency balance"" and is then billed to the customer, ALONG WITH THE COST OF REPOSSESSION (usually over $500) and all late fees. Since the customer is already broke, they usually can't or won't pay the deficiency, so they end getting sued by the finance company, and either work out a plan to pay or file bankruptcy.

psychologythrill,"there's another explanation also. there's this thing called 'object permanence' which is an infants ability to represent an object in its mind. To get an idea of this, think of playing with a baby and his toy, and then hiding the toy under a blanket. until a certain age the baby wouldnt look under the blanket for the toy because it doesnt yet have object permanence, or  a symbol of the toy in its mind. So the theory goes that until a child acquires object permanence it wont be able to represent objects/scenarios in it's mind and so wont have that kind of memory.
Language also uses symbols (the idea that a word represents a concrete thing) and so another idea is that using language throughout the day will aid memory formation and so before children begin speaking, their memories will be weaker. evidence of this was shown in the different social environments that north american vs asian children have. Its more common for NA parents to discuss the events of the day with their children (what happened today, what did you learn, etc) and this is not so common in asian cultures.

SunAvatar,"We don't really know exactly why, but there are several proposed explanations.

* **Neurological immaturity.** The brain structures that form lasting personal memories are just not fully formed yet. This is probably the most popular theory, yet it has the problem of explaining why two-year-olds can frequently remember things that happened when they were one.

* **Emotional immaturity.** Emotion is heavily involved in recollection, and during the first few years the brain structures that regulate emotion are still developing. Supporting this theory is that the occurrence of deeply meaningful and emotional events in a young child's life, such as the birth of a sibling, can lead to earlier memories.

* **Repression.** The first few years of life are so traumatic that they are simply repressed. Supporting this theory is the fact that adults who were abused or traumatized in childhood frequently have their first memories even later, around 5-6.

* **Lack of self-awareness.** Until a certain age, toddlers don't really understand that they are a person with unique characteristics, and separate from all others.

The first is capacity of the energy infrastructure.

At the moment the US as a whole has [~63Gigawatts excess capacity in it's energy sector](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=9671), that is not evenly spread, and some areas already experiencing ""brown outs"" would certainly struggle under significant extra loads. To return to your original question; the knock on for consumers is affected energy delivery.  

Tesla will, eventually, be allowed to sell their cars as they wish. Those who want a Tesla will simply order them across state lines, online... at some point state regulators will realise they're harming their economy more than they're helping it. 

Other car manufacturers are also looking at more direct selling. Fiat is trialling stores in shopping malls (with a range of cars available to test drive in the parking lot).

We have this method in place, and had it before you could shop online directly from a manufacturer.

Well, since a airborne plane isn't grounded, lightening strikes generally don't hit planes for this reason. However, they do sometimes hit home and when they do... nothing happens. As ACrusaderA said, the light might flicker but it's very uncommon for something serious to go wrong. [NASA](http://www.f-106deltadart.com/nasa_lightning_research.htm) actually did a bunch of tests on this back in the 80's by flying a F-106 through violent electrical storms and determined that the most likely outcome of an airborne lightening strike is that the lightening will simply pass harmlessly through the plane and head to the ground (where it was trying to go anyway).

pelicandb,"**Sorry this is not quite ELI5, but some people gave very incorrect explanations.**

Lightning does hit airplanes regularly. Modern airplanes have been designed so that when lightning strikes it is not very noticeable to the passengers.

The fact that planes are not grounded does not prevent lightning from striking the plane. While flying near an electrically charged cloud, the cloud can induce polarity: The total electric charge stays the same, but the cloud pulls positive charge to one side of the plane and negative to the other, and this increases the chances of getting struck. 

However, the planes are designed so lightning passes through the plane and out the other end, and continues to the ground or another cloud. Since lightning must pass through the plane, they are either made with metal skins, or if they are made from graphite composite, a thin copper layer is added to make the composite more conductive.

To protect the passengers, crew, and equipment, they are insulated from the outside skins. The lightning passes through the outside surface of the plane and leaves the contents unharmed. The plane acts like a [Faraday cage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage).

Canada eventually grew more and more independent from the Empire (a long and complicated story in and of itself).

mikelo22,"The US tried to bring Canada into the fold initially in their invasion of Quebec. Wasn't smart though since it was during the winter. Needless to say, the expeditionary force sent to capture Quebec City failed and withdrew. After that, we never really tried again and focused on our own borders as the war soon shifted to the south.

Later, however, there were some diplomatic negotiations with the region later to be known as New Brunswick, though this never panned out. As someone else mentioned, during the Revolutionary War, many of the loyalists to the crown fled north into Canada. Thus, the loyalists had a very strong foothold in Canada politically.

Canada also wasn't anywhere near populated like the colonies were. They were mostly military and trade outposts. So it's not like there could be an appeal to the common folk to instigate a revolution like in the colonies; if a ""revolution"" was to come, it would have to come through diplomatic and political means.

In the War of 1812, the US did invade Canada, though not really to colonize it since Canada didn't really exist at this time... it was simply a British territory. If I recall, the Americans did gain some territory around Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, while the British Canadians made excursions into the Ohio Valley. At the end of the war, lands gained were given back on both sides and returned to the status quo. The War of 1812 is commonly referred to as the 2nd Revolutionary War because it was the US's attempt to legitimize itself as an independent and autonomous country. Before this, the British held very little respect for America's sovereignty, especially on the high seas via trade. While much cost came along with the war, the end finally legitimized the US as a sovereign nation that Britain would be forced to respect.

In the early 1800s, there was another border dispute by expansionist Democrats in the border dispute between Great Britain/Canada over where the official border should be between the Oregon territory and British Columbia. Americans wanted the 54-40' parallel (leading to the slogan ""Fifty-four Forty or Fight!"") while the British demanded the 42nd parallel. Instead of it leading to war, they eventually compromised on the 49th parallel. This officially gave the US the territory later to be incorporated as the state of Washington.

By this point, however, America had turned its sights south into Mexico where it annexed Texas and other southwestern territories later to be known as New Mexico and Arizona.",null,1,cdp4ucd,1rni9t,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

suicidebylifestyle," Lot of the time it's related to the blood vessels in your brain they get smaller or bigger and put pressure on other structures such as the membranes that surround your brain.

Example, if you are really hung over and have a head ache it is because you are dehydrated, how does this happen you may ask? Basically your brain is incredibly amazing and rather stupid at the same time.

Body: shit were really dehydrated we need some water where can we get it.

And your brain being the generous chap that it is steps up to the plate.

Brain: hey I've got plenty of water here have some!

And the membranes that envelope your brain don't shrink along with it as it loses water putting tension on then making your head hurt.

That's just one example.

By and large it has to do with the expansion and constriction of your blood vessels, unless there is some other underlying problem.

EDIT: I've been getting a lot of replies saying how I'm wrong and this or that aren't cause by the pathology I've stated here and I never claimed this to be the sole cause of headaches, read the entire post before you send snarky messages.

flamingmanny,"This is copied from another thread, i saved only this excerpt so unfortunately i don't know who the original writer of this is. Very informative, whoever posted this:

There's actually an [""international classification of headache disorders""](http://cep.sagepub.com/content/33/9/629.long) that classifies the different types of headaches. The brain itself has no pain receptors, because all pain receptors send their signals to the brain. It's the thing that's doing the ""feeling"" of the pain. This is why awake brain surgery works as well as it does: the neurosurgeon can go in an electrically stimulate the awake brain and remove brain tissue without the patient feeling anything.

As can be seen in the ICHD, there are many kinds of headaches. Some are caused by muscle tension in the head and neck. Others by inflammation pressing against nerves. Some even caused what's called ""referred pain"", which is when it feels like the pain is in one place, but that's actually a ""phantom"" pain being caused somewhere else.
The classic examples are heart attacks and ice-cream headaches. In ice-cream headaches, the rapid cooling of blood vessels in the throat and mouth stimulate the trigeminal nerve which brings in pain information from the head, making it feel like your head is in pain when the stimulation is actually happening in the mouth.

For other headaches, it's good to know about the three protective layers, called meninges, that cover the brain: thepia mater (soft mother), which adheres to the brain and is very fine; the arachnoid layer, which sort of provides a barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and the rest of the circulatory system; and the dura mater (hard mother), which feels very leathery, like bat wings, and holds in the cerebrospinal fluid.
These meninges also help form the blood brain barrier and cover a lot of the fine blood vessels that supply the brain with blood.

Both the blood vessels and meninges have pain receptors. The pain receptors in these regions can be stimulated by a lot of things. For example, meningitis is when these become enflamed due to infection. This inflammation is painful due to the stretching and pressure. Similarly, pressure changes brought about by dehydration or changes in blood salinity or what have you (like in a hangover) can also cause pain that we feel as ""headaches"".

So in short: there's not one kind of ""headache"", and sometimes even though a headache feels like it's located in one place, it's not really because of the phantom stimulation from referred pain.",null,13,cdp2rr0,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,hot,65

TheOsteopath,"One frequent cause of headaches involves the muscles at the top of the neck/base of the skull getting irritated by poor posture, like sitting at a computer for too long, and tightening up. The Occipital nerve which runs close to the muscles gets pressed on which causes the headache.

Just like banging your funny bone, the pressure on the nerve causes symptoms to be felt in the area the nerve runs to. The funny bone is the ulnar nerve and you feel it in your fingers, pressure from tight muscles on the Occipital nerve makes you feel it over the top of your skull.

FeatherAlchemist,"There are a variety of migraines that can be triggered by things such as allergies (gluten, sugar, egg/dairy allergies are extremely common and often overlooked as an underlying cause). Other triggers can be caffeine related (sometimes caffeine will help to alleviate a migraine, sometimes it will be a trigger), change in air pressure/weather changes, change in altitude, light sensitivity, and more. Chronic migraine sufferers often report an aura of light/sudden blips of darkness before receiving an intense migraine, as well as dizziness, nausea, senisitivity to sound or movement, a loss of speech, and in severe cases - seizures. For some people, migraines can't be explained away with dehydration. Long time sufferers may very well have a chemical imbalance/hormonal imbalance, a family history of migraines, an intolerance to common stress, etc (the reasons are so varied and wide, that it is important to know your family medical history in cases like this). For anyone who suffers migraines frequently, it is important to seek medical help. MRI's, CAT scans, and blood tests may be necessary to determine that it isn't a build-up of fluids causing pressure on the brain, a tumor/cancer, some sort of damage, an aneurism, a nutritional deficiency, an unknown allergy, etc. For most, a migraine is a very uncommon experience, rare enough that they may only experience one or two in their entire life. For others, learning to manage a life with frequent migraines is quite different, and they may live their entire life without ever finding a cure or a cause. If you have ever experienced an actual migraine, you know, undoubtedly, that it is nothing like a headache or a hangover. That pounding in your head resounds through your entire body to the point that even the sound of your own heartbeat makes you turn with fever and sickness. It can last hours (if you're lucky), or days... For the lucky few, a simple antiseizure medication can often help (as sometimes does an antidepressant). These can help to alleviate the pain or offer the sufferer some control before a migraine strikes. For others, migraines are something that the sufferer will often have to learn to cope with and endure. Migraines might mean that the sufferer make permanent, life changing decisions in their diet and exercise routines as a way to seek some control (in my case, this helped me greatly). Migraine sufferers should also note, that the use of OTC's can cause long-term issues. Paying careful attention to proper doses and following instructions are important in matters like this. If an OTC does not work, do not continue to pop more pills. Your body will eventually build a tolerance, and your migraines might become more difficult to treat, as a result. 

Source: I was diagnosed with chronically transformed migraines and have been seen by specialists, as well as been in and out of hospitals since I was 14.

TL/DR: There are several types of migraines. Not all are caused by dehydration. Many outside factors can influence any individual to suffer a migraine, some of which, have no cause or known cure. ",null,0,cdp0hro,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,hot,13

Oznog99,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache

It's a good question, because the brain itself does not have pain-sensing nerves at all.  

&gt;Rather, the pain is caused by disturbance of the pain-sensitive structures around the brain. Nine areas of the head and neck have these pain-sensitive structures, which are the cranium (the periosteum of the skull), muscles, nerves, arteries and veins, subcutaneous tissues, eyes, ears, sinuses and mucous membranes.

&gt;Headache often results from traction to or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels. The nociceptors may also be stimulated by other factors than head trauma or tumors and cause headaches. Some of these include stress, dilated blood vessels and muscular tension. Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fiber to the nerve cells in the brain, signaling that a part of the body hurts.

That's still rather vague!  And unusual- when stressed, it's not common to have, say, your left foot suddenly ache so much you can't function.  For no reason, and then stop.  Unexplained pain from receptors with no apparent stimulus is [neuralgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia), and the process is not well-understood at all, headaches included, apparently.

I think the best answer to your specific question is ""we don't really know, exactly"".  Sometimes that's just the answer.

doctor_anonymous,"Headaches are basically pain referred outside from any damage or irritation to structures inside your head other than brain mostly.
Because brain itself is insensitive to pain and even if touched directly it can only cause funny sensations in the areas of the body represented by that portion that is touched.

Whereas the layer covering the brain which holds the blood vessels are very sensitive. As someone mentioned earlier hangover headaches are from here.

Too much alcohol -too much byproducts (and even constipation)causes toxic products in the vessels-irritation of vessels-Headache!

In Migraine too much emotion and tension will make the blood vessels go crazy which get tired and become flaccid and blood keeps gushing in causes it to stretch more including the layer covering brain-Headache!!

Emotional headaches are when muscles of scalp and neck spasm(i.e when muscles get too stressed out lactic acid is produced which causes pain) but still it feels like your head hurts from inside because all types of headaches are referred outside and feels the same.

StasisNation,"Well, here's how it works.

1 shot (30ml/1 oz) = 1 spirit (like, 150ml/5oz) = 1 beer (12oz). 

In simple terms, drinking one shot will get you the same amount of drunk as drinking one beer, the same as drinking one glass of wine in terms of alcoholic content. 

1 Shot is USUALLY 35% (depends on the booze). per 100ml. A beer is like...7%/100ml. So, if you drank 500mls of 7% beer, it would be the same as drinking 1 shot. Can you understand that? 

Bars generally have a guideline on their serving sizes so they a) Don't overserve customers, and b) don't lose money. If a glass of wine has like, 20% alcohol, then drinking a glass at 150ml would be the equivalent of drinking one shot still. 

It all really comes down to math. All liquor is generally priced in relation to it's percentage of alcohol (Unless it's imported/fancy/popular/etc),  which is why the bottle of wine in the grocery store is like, $10, while a bottle of fireball is $20.

doc_daneeka,"The underlying structure and vocabulary is still largely Germanic in origin. All the most common words, for example, are of Old English derivation.  English traces back to Anglo-Saxon, which was beyond doubt a West Germanic language, every bit as much as German or Dutch and their ancestral languages are. 

Yes, it has since received a massive infusion of terms borrowed from French and Latin, but that doesn't change the fundamental nature of the language. ",null,1,cdp0lwu,1rnmvx,explainlikeimfive,hot,5
ubabar,"Not a linguist but I'll try my best.

It's Germanic because it is descended from parent languages that are Germanic. Modern English is directly descended from Middle English which is directly descended from Old English. Old English was made up of a few very similar dialects that all directly descend from Proto-Germanic. This right here is the very simple reason linguists classify it as Germanic.

----

Now why isn't English considered a Romance language or Romance-hybrid if Old French changed the language so much? That's because Old French didn't change it as much as most laymen think that it did. The very simple answer here is that Old French contributed vocabulary, and borrowed vocabulary by itself does not change languages.

If all that had happened was that Old English speakers started borrowing words from Old French, then it would still have been Old English, just with more French words.

The actual transition from Old English to Middle English was in the grammar, and these changes had already started *before* the Normans had even arrived. And would still have happened regardless of the Norman invasion, because all the pieces were still in place.

The *most* important change was the reduction of inflectional endings. This might not seem like much, but to understand it better, you have to understand that *with* inflectional endings, a language can have a pretty free word order. That is, it doesn't really matter where all the words are arranged in a sentence, the words themselves are marked for their grammatical meaning... so you could literally rearrange the words almost any way you want. But modern English doesn't do this, if words are out of order we can't understand what's going on. We also have very few inflectional endings as well, so... 

You should probably guess, when the inflectional endings went, our word order had to change to pick up the slack. No more ""I will the you store and to go"", but now it could only be ""You and I will go to the store"".

But this reduction of endings didn't happen overnight, nor did it happen over a few decades after the Norman invasion. This change was actually about a thousand years in the making. You see, the ancestor of English, Proto-Germanic, had done something strange to the way words were spoken: they fixed the stress of a word on the initial or root syllable. Other Indo-European languages could and did switch the way they stressed their words. Latin and Ancient Greek would usually put the stress towards the *end* of the word, usually among the inflectional endings themselves.

What this meant for all Germanic languages that inherited this feature, was the very gradual degradation of all inflectional endings, which now all occurred *after* the stressed syllable. So for instance, Proto-Germanic \*wulfaz, ""the wolf"", would have become pre-Old English \*wulfa, which became Old English wulf, which became modern English wolf. Now again, this might not seem like much, but it happened to almost *all* words, and even by Old English these endings had already taken a beating. After what few endings remained had become so similar to each other, it wasn't really long before they lost their purpose and would have been dropped altogether.

* A note here: Old English didn't end in 1066, it was actually spoken for another 100-150 years after the Norman invasion. It just wasn't written down anymore, as all the people who were in a position to write at this time were now speaking Norman French or were writing in Latin.

If French had caused these changes, say, in a creole situation, you would expect this all to have happened very fast, with a near complete collapse of inflectional endings right off the bat, which is what happens with creoles. But you don't see this with English, you see a very gradual reduction of endings, Middle English still had them, more reduced in nouns and adjectives, and only slightly reduced with verbs, before they were eventually dropped altogether in Modern English. (Well, most of them anyway, we kept a few.)

* Another final note: While we borrowed an awful lot of words from Old/Norman French into Middle English, this number was *dwarfed* by the later borrowings of French and Latin words into Early Modern and Modern English during the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods.",null,0,cdpab2f,1rnmvx,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

RjoTTU-bio,"Vaccines do have side effects. For live vaccines (ones with living, but damaged versions of a virus or bacteria) the side effects tend to show a mild form of the disease for which you are being immunized against. For dead vaccines, you can get side effects simply due to an immune response against the antigens present in the vaccine. 

Some people claim the flu shot gives them the flu, which is half true. You can get a mild version of the flu from the vaccine, or just a mild immune response to the antigens in the dead flu vaccine. Therefore, some people associate a vaccine with feeling sick. 

Like u/mrrandomman420 stated, there was a study published that linked the MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccine to autism. This study was poorly designed and thoroughly debunked. However, the damage was done, since there was a rise in measles and preventable diseases following this study (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7872541.stm).

There is also an argument that vaccines drive huge revenue for the medical industry, but most of the vaccines covered under Medicare part B &amp; D, and Medicaid really don't drive much revenue for medical offices or big drug companies compared to medical treatment for these diseases that we are trying to protect against!

**Edit:** Basically, people think vaccines are either or scam, or outright dangerous. This is due to a poor understanding of what a vaccine actually does. I will edit again and explain that better as well.


**So what does a vaccine actually do?**

A vaccine introduces a live virus/bacteria, or dead components of these organisms. Once these organisms enter the body via injection, oral, or nasal route (fluMist vaccine), your body collects these particles to present to your immune system. There are cells that roam the body looking for bad things (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells). These cells (primarily dendritic cells) gather up dead things and bring them to the lymph nodes. Once in the lymph nodes, B and T cells are exposed to these particles and begin to change. B and T cells that recognize the antigen start to clone themselves, and eventually form differentiated B &amp; T cells that hunt down more pathogens (B cells produce antibodies, T cells kill in other ways). They also differentiate into memory cells, which give you long lasting immunity to that antigen. 

Once you have been given a shot, it generally takes 10-14 days for this process to work. You are now immune to some strains of that virus or bacteria that you could be exposed to in the future.   ",null,0,cdp1qev,1rnpbq,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

His data was bogus, and his particular brand of fear mongering did not do well in the UK where he is from, but it caught the American imagination. 

I think Americans were particularly vulnerable because his theory resolved ambiguity about a mysterious disease (Americans hate ambiguity) while squarely setting the blame on opaque organizations that were out to make money, and damn the consequences. (Americans also love conspiracies, particularly with clear moral badguys at the bottom.) Also through previously very successful immunization programs, hardly anyone has seen scarlet fever or whooping cough, while autism is an 'epidemic'. This makes Americans particularly bad at estimating the risk of not vaccinating. Americans also have a broad misunderstanding and mistrust of science, and tend to mistake people using scientific sounding words and repetition for people who actually sense. Also, our preventative care system sucks, so many people will take any reason to not go to the doctor.

Most people vaccinate their kids, and themselves. For one thing a lot of schools require it. But hardly anyone does it because they understand know what they are doing and make a choice, it's mainly habit and doing what your doctor tells you.

NightMaestro,"Friction is made everywhere. The results however can be neglible or very pronounced.

What you have here on a molecular level is a bunch of liquid contacting liquid. And I'll explain this.

The water molecules inside the bottle are already at a liquid state, but when in contact with that ice cube, the surface atoms at the state of energy to keep the ice cube a solid begin to break into a liquid. The molecules of the ice cube are melting off.

There still is some friction made between a liquid vs a liquid state, but it's pretty neglible. Imagine the friction of air moving against air. The molecules hardly ever get close enough to create a lot of friction. And in water, you just have the molecules actually move, not resisting much change. The friction is negated almost entirely when the molecules actually move about instead of resisting the force you are applying.

Now imagine I filled that whole bottle with marbles covered in sand paper. What you got now is two solids running up against eachother. The state of these solids keep them a solid, and when force is applied on a molecular level they will resist change along the whole structure. This is called sliding friction, and is the most resistant.

In this picture you will see on a atomic level, little ridges of the sand paper hit against eachother and the molecules staying in their solid to compensate this. They don't all break off, instead each solid object will move a little bit to compensate, but the electromagnetic repulsion (actual mathmatical friction) creates energy in the form of heat (what we expirience as friction). You have huge sheaths full of millions of atoms (the surface of the objects) enacting this force, so the net gain of friction is a lot bigger than the liquid or gaseous frictional return.

You can almost think of the various components like lego bricks.  You buy a selection of the right color and shape and plug them together.

The software environment is also standardized.  The main board (or 'motherboard') for example has software on board (the BIOS) that can recognize keyboards and video cards, can access the hard drive and read a DVD ROM.  This means you can take your Operating System (e.g. Windows) DVD ROM, pop it in the drive, power-on and your system will install itself.

When Windows is done installing, it will often be able to use all your devices either immediately, or once you pop in the driver disk for your new video card.  If the video card or printer manufacturer have done a good job then this should be trivial.  Device manufacturers write software for Windows based on Microsoft published specifications and then have to pass a set of tests (called 'certification') in order to publish their device software.  Things can still go wrong - if the manufacture hasn't done good quality assurance then bugs can get through that can crash the operating system (omg Windows suxorz.. uh... no).  Usually though, things just work almost like magic.

Consoles aren't like that.  Consoles are not like lego sets put together with well-defined pieces that can be plugged in and out. Typically the insides of a console are rigid - they can't be changed.  They're put together in one configuration and can't be changed.  This does two things: First, it keeps the costs down. Making a mainboard with all the components fixed is cheaper than building individual components and connecting them.  Second, it presents a fixed configuration to the games companies.  They can write their game knowing that it will always work at these graphics levels and at this resolution.  They don't have to build the flexibility to work with 5 years worth of different graphics card performance.  They can tweak and tune their game graphics so it looks as good as possible without risk of some unexpected variable (old busted graphics card) coming in and ruining the experience.

On the software side, the operating system will be hard-coded in the platform, and cryptographically signed (which means it contains a magic number that mathematically proves the software came from the vendor).  This doesn't mean it's not upgradable, just not upgradable by you.  You can't but the OS install on a DVD.

Console vendors often make either miniscule profit or an actual loss on the console itself in order to get it out in the world in mass quantities (i.e. they can't price it too high otherwise people won't buy it).  They actually make their money on games.  Every game you buy, a slice will go to the console vendor, and that's what makes the whole enterprise a viable business.  The console vendors, then, can't have people installing unlicensed software on the machine as that would defeat the business model.  So signed binaries are everywhere.

When I 'build' a computer at home, I'm really doing something a robot or illiterate chinese factory worker could do - I'm just taking parts I've purchased and sticking them together.  The serious business of making the parts is not something you can do at home, and you need billions of dollars in hardware to make the parts. 

Game consoles use custom hardware that deliberately does not talk to certain regular PC hardware, their software deliberately is just a little bit different.  Both the XB3 and PS4 use basically PC architectures, and the hard drives are readable on Windows and FreeBSD computers 
(freeBSD is the base OS in the PS4), and a few things like that, but most of the serious hardware is a variant on consumer parts, notably the CPU/GPU combo.  

PC's rely on a very broad collection of agreements and standards by companies that make sure all of the components talk to each other and that software can talk to the hardware (or at least should, UEFI and the linux guys have had some disagreements).  The console parts won't talk to a regular PC, and the software won't run on a regular PC.  These are things hackers should be able to figure out a way around this, but the PS3 and XB2 held up pretty well for quite a while.  ",null,0,cdpeess,1rnq48,explainlikeimfive,hot,1
OrangeCrack,"People can build Microsoft / Intel computers because they are not protected by any copyrights preventing people doing so. This is because historically IBM owned all the patents on PCs and decided to let other companies build off their patents free of charge. Hence why many years ago people would always say your computer is IBM compatible.

This is an important distinction, because besides Playstation and XBox, you also cannot build a Mac. These components are all controlled by apple. While apple now uses Intel processors you cannot buy the chip that would allow it to run an Apple operating system.

verumdicetur,"The hardware for pc's have been open sourced so anyone can build the parts. The hardware for consoles are not, they are proprietary.

Note: Open source basically means the information on how to make and work the device is open to the public so anyone can make it. This is why most hardware is compatible with most pc's. Certain companies like Dell and Apple are trying to change this back so they can make more money being the only producer of hard and software for their devices. 

Also, you cannot just change out parts for consoles, they want you to buy new ones instead. For instance, I had to change the optical drive on my Xbox and it was not as simple as swapping the parts. I had to use special hardware and software to get a code off the old drive to program it onto the new one so it would play games. Without this all I had was an expensive DVD player. 

It would play games downloaded on the hard drive that were purchased online but it would not read a game disc without the code. Lets say for instance that I had either thrown out the old one or the old one was shot completely then I would be forced to get a new console. 

This used to be the way it was with pc's before Bill Gates convinced IBM to open source their hardware but leave the software closed. This is how Microsoft got so big and IBM stayed the same size.  Now anyone can make the hardware you need to build a pc but the software is proprietary.

It's a profit thing, simple as that. ",null,2,cdp2faf,1rnq48,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

Essentially they want their own parliament and ability to spend their tax how they want (rather than it going through London), to keep the Queen, the £ as currency and stay in the EU.

Still aren't sure if all that can happen (if it separates and becomes its own country it will have to apply to join the EU, but new countries to the EU have to use the €). Even if it does happen no one can predict what effect it will have on the UK and Scottish economies - which is why there is such a debate over it. 

Someone with more knowledge of economics may be able to give you more details on that side of it.

At the moment I think there is some hard feelings on both sides, Scotland brings a lot of money in from oil in the North Sea, so they see it as money going to the UK. But Scotland gets stuff the rest ok the UK doesn't, such as free University places and cheaper/free prescriptions.

sir_sri,"Those questions are hard to answer.  Partly because we don't know exactly what independence would mean.  

Scotland is a relatively poor part of the UK that has benefited quite a lot from payments from the central government over the centuries for things like health care and roads etc.   But it has oil reserves, well some anyway, which have inflated GDP lately.  

So first thing - scotland only has about 5 million people, of the UK's 63 ish.  So if they leave, in the grand scheme of things it won't make much difference.

But how oil revenues are carved up would be non trivial, as would how the territory is split.  There no answer here because it hasn't been decided.  Presumably scotland would get most of the oil as most of it is close to scotland

&gt;standard of living, etc?

In the long run it's bad for scotland.  It won't matter much to the UK.  Unlike Ireland, which was a 3rd world country (caused by deliberate UK policy) attached to europe when it got independence Scotland is overall well off.  That would start to gradually erode as the practical realities of trying to do business in scotland sink in.  Without oil they don't have anything, and while they could try and set themselves up as an Ireland like english speaking tax haven, how many more tax havens does europe need (or want), and if they can't be a tax haven what are they?  There isn't a critical mass of people for any meaningful industry anymore, and trying to use the Euro or the pound would turn them into a greece or spain.   For a little while it would all seem rosy, as the ship building and the IT sector seemed great, and then the problems of goods and people across borders, the currency imbalances etc. would all sink in.

&gt;etc?

The etc is really the main question.  Unlike just about everyone else who has asked for and gotten independence scotland is not particularly culturally distinct from the UK on a day to day basis.  At least not anymore.  They all speak the same language, albeit with an accent, they go to similar jobs, they live in similar houses they already have representation in government, they go home and watch TV and play games and go to bars and pubs etc in much the same way as their english counter parts.  The scottish are not particularly committed to one religion that is being oppressed by another or any of that.  So what do they get?  

Somewhat like Canada and australia and new zealand they get to waste a pile of money having independent foreign policies which almost no one in the world cares about because they're too small to matter, and most of the serious important issues it will get to spend a pile of money to feel good about itself for agreeing to do what everyone else sane is doing anyway.  Made worse is that scotland is never going to get much bigger.  While Canada and Australia could conceivably pass England in population by the end of the century or so, scotland is going to be, well, small.  

The UK has military bases in Scotland and Scotts serve in the  British military, that would change, and less money in one pot will make it a bit harder to have major military assets like aircraft carriers and airplane R&amp;D and that sort of thing.   That weakens the UK a little bit, but makes scotland basically irrelevant in the world.  

If the EU got its act together into a single megastate it basically wouldn't matter at all.  It would be like splitting New York state in half.  You can... or you cannot, in the end it doesn't make much difference to anyone.  Arbitrary lines on a map are arbitrary.  

N.B. I'm in Canada, we have our own separatists in Quebec, who do seem to be culturally different from the rest of us in Canada.  But on the whole, Canadian independence hasn't actually gotten us much.  It makes us feel good about ourselves, but that's about it. ",null,1,cdp3qp0,1rnq5q,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

Less blood in circulation means less oxygen getting to the brain.  When the brain senses a dangerous drop in oxygen, you pass out.  An intuitive way of conceptualizing it: blood flow isn't fighting gravity when everything is on the same level.  By passing out, your brain gets itself, the legs, and the heart all on the same plane so no more relying on leg muscles to overcome gravity.

Veins have a bunch of valves all over your body to create pressure to push blood through your body, but when you lock your knees you basically compress these veins shut. And eventually that leads to you losing blood supply to the rest of your body. They also tell soldiers and guardsmen to wiggle their toes, as the muscles contracting and relaxing helps push blood back up to your heart/head and so on. 

From wikipedia:
""The return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the skeletal-muscle pump, and by the thoracic pump action of breathing during respiration. Standing or sitting for a prolonged period of time can cause low venous return from venous pooling (vascular) shock. Fainting can occur but usually baroreceptors within the aortic sinuses initiate a baroreflex such angiotensin II and norepinephrine stimulate vasoconstriction and heart rate increases to return blood flow. Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting. In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness. Jet pilots wear pressurized suits to help maintain their venous return and blood pressure.""

I.E. for multimedia software, this range would be something from 1 to 543 if you have 543 songs in your playlist. The songs are placed in some sort of [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) in which every song can be accessed by its relevant index (1-543). This computation would run every time a new song needed to be chosen, with previous songs marked as ""played."" Generally all of these types of programs have something in place to stop a song from being repeated on shuffle, or an option that can turn this off or on. Once all songs have been marked as ""played"", the shuffle unmarks all the songs and stops. Usually at this point if you hit play again, the process will begin anew, where any of the 543 songs can be chosen.

Borders tend to follow 'natural borders - mountain ranges, rivers, gorges etc.  Or they are drawn along racial/ethnic boundaries. 

European borders - particularly in what was the holy roman empire (germany, italy and neighbouring areas basically).  Territory was owned by the Crown - but the crown and the King were the same thing, so if the King or future king bought or inherited some random blob of realestate for some reason 500 years ago it remained the property of his family.  And then his family got a country of all of his personal territory, and you end up with a blob of territory that belonged to a someone that was in no way connected to the rest of the country.  

Drawing new lines on a map, as has happened a few times over the years is difficult, particularly if the territory in question is worthless or particularly valuable.  Territory in the middle of a desert for example isn't worth shuffling lines around on because no one is there to enforce the new lines and spending millions on boundary commissions is a pain.

~~Mandatory carbon credits allows a government to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted within their jurisdiction. The government doesn't care who is emitting gases, so they distribute a limited amount of carbon credits, and allow the free market to sort out who gets to emit. This incentives reducing emissions to save money.~~

~~There other kind of carbon credit is one that a company can buy from another company. The carbon credit dealer pledges to offset whatever amount of greenhouse emissions the credit is worth. Basically, a company can buy carbon credits from a company that specializes in emissions clean-up to reduce their carbon footprint, instead of personally reducing emissions or doing cleanup themselves.~~

Laser printers are a bit more complicated.  Fist, there ink, called toner, is a ferrous powder (as in, it can be attracted by an electromagnet).  Part of the printer, called a xerographic module, is given a static charge along a blade that picks up the toner and assembles it into a portion of what will be printed.  This happens very  fast and as paper is pulled across the xerographic module, the toner is laid out on the paper in the way it will look when it comes out of the printer.

Camelope,"If I had to take a simple, college-educated guess:

Sneezes are caused by irritation in the nostril(s)/sometimes throat and your body's natural reaction is to expel the foreign objects. I believe this causes your diaphragm to contract (or expand?) and shove all the air from your lungs and stomach out so that the air pressure forces the object out. During this process, your trachea contracts (to 2/3 its normal diameter if I'm not mistaken) in order to further increase air pressure. As the air is rapidly forced through this narrow passage, sneezes can be different in different people based on any of the following:
    
* trachea diameter
* muscular strength (the force with which the diaphragm expels air)
* spasms (i.e. sometimes I sneeze twice in the space of one sneeze and it sounds different)
* how much air is flowing

Halloween: Is a European Holiday that came into existence when the Catholic Church moved ""All Hallows Day"" (A day honoring dead Saints) to November 1st in an attempt to sap power from the pagan Samhain festival. Once in America numerous traditions merged, and we created some of our own. The practice of dressing up came from pagan activities of wearing cloaks and disguises to hide from the spirits on the holiday. Trick-or-Treating came about as a response to an earlier tradition of kids pulling pranks. People started giving home made goodies and candies to bribe the kids to not prank them, or giving ""treats to not be tricked"" if you prefer. And all of it has been heavily commercialized as most of our holidays are. 

Thanksgiving: Is a day that is set aside to be thankful for all the blessing that you have. You gather with family and friends and have a feast, share stories, watch a football game and the like. There is a connection to our first settlers and the Native Americans celebrating their first harvest with a feast (as was traditional in Europe) but that is mostly window dressing and is really only stories for children and decoration themes.

At the end of the year the students were tested for real and the bloomers in fact excelled while the strugglers were worse off. The teacher had expectations of these students and those expectations shaped her behaviour towards the kids which resulted in the expectations being met.

Another example could be if society has a stereotype that a certain subgroup of people are mean.

Drofmum,"Well, young moflugger, as I am here avoiding real work I will try to explain. 

Most smart people tend to agree that dinosaurs died because of a big disaster called the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Probably because a big rock from space hit the earth and sent a lot of dust into the sky. This dust blocked out the sun and made the world very cold. Like the north poll where Santa lives. As we all know, only Santa and his helpers and reindeer live in the north poll. That is because when it is cold and dark, plants can't grow, so the big animals that eat the plants die because they are hungry and cold :(

Smaller animals can live with a lot less food, and mammals have fur and warm blood to keep them alive in the cold. This is why they survived the cold winter that lasted many years. 

Eventually all the dinosaurs died except for some birds (did you know birds used to be dinosaurs?) because they are small, and some could dive under the water or make warm little burrows. Mammals then took the place of dinosaurs when the world warmed up again. They got bigger and bigger, like elephants and whales! (The largest animal to ever live still exists, it is the blue whale! We call such animals ""megafauna"". For a long time these giant animals lived happily, grazing on lush green pastures and making friends. Then there came man. 

Unlike other animals, man is very sneaky. He can work together to catch and eat really big animals, even an animal as big as the blue whale I just told you about! He can use weapons like spears and knives and even make traps. That is why many of the big, slow and delicious animals we used to have were all eaten up.

SirEbonwolf,"I'm not 100% sure but as I've always understood, it has to do with the concertration of oxygen in the atmosphere. That in the prehistoric period there was more oxygen that let animals grow to extreme sizes and still be able to easily get enough oxygen out of breathing as the larger an animal is the more oxygen it needs to fuel it's cells. As far as I know whales can get around this by not having the same type of extremities, like arms and legs. They do not need these as they are suspended in the water. getting air to these extremities is harder than getting it to central parts of the body so as the oxygen concertration has decreased,animals with extremeties like arms and legs have become smaller over the generations.",null,2,cdp8kyp,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,hot,16
why_rob_y,"As animals get proportionately larger (i.e. picture a sixty foot tall human, with the same relative dimensions as a normal six foot tall person), their bodily functions become less efficient and need more oxygen and other things (I'll get to why in a second). There used to be more oxygen in the air than there currently is, so that's one major factor for why extremely large animals have a hard time sustaining themselves.

The reason proportionately larger animals are less efficient is because mass is a function of the cube of height, but the strength of bones and muscle are a function of the square of height (because [their strength is related to the size of the 2D cross section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_strength#Overview), not due to the mass of the bone or muscle - picture trying to make a house out of paper).

A 60 foot man has 10x the height of a 6 foot man. So, he has 100x the bone and muscle strength. But, he has 1,000x the mass. So, he wouldn't be able to support himself unless his body had much stronger (and less energy efficient) bones and muscle.",null,0,cdpbfg9,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,hot,3

Keep in mind that I am by no means an expert.

There is a fundamental property true for all quantum objects, in that you cannot determine one partner of a pair of complimentary properties with 100% precision. The more precisely you try to determine one, the less precisely you can determine the other one in a single measurement. This is called the uncertainty principle. Thus I am a little bit sceptical about their method of attempting to measure multiple parameters at the same time.

What they are doing here as it seems, is measure the location of a photon at the left side, where they have a 100% chance to travel to, but are able to detect just the polarization at the right side in a separate measurement, where the chance of them to travel to is 0%. Taking measurements here though causes a disturbance in the system, changing the path the photons take, and changing its location (it's no longer 100% on the left side), thus explaining why they could measure just the polarization at the right side now. 

Then, they try to measure both properties at the same time, with lower precision and with lower influence on the system as they say, but get the same outcome, the location being 100% on the left side, and the polarization being on the right side, which seems a bit paradox.

Since there can be no such thing as negative pressure (as pressure is an expression of force and area, both of which cannot be negative either), we have effectively reached a point where it would be no longer logical to continue, or simply something we cannot describe with our laws of nature. 

Keep in mind that a pressure of 0 also implies that there is no movement of molecules and atoms anymore, as to apply pressure, a particle needs to collide with a surface.

Obviously the slowest the particles could move is not moving at all. Thus, no movement means no energy, which means no temperature. This is why the coldest something can be is 0 (no movement).

edit: if you want to know why we can calculate this without actually being able to achieve it, it's just by using formulas that we have.

   Organic food industry. Monsanto is one of many companies that produce GM seeds. For some people GM crops are either ""against gods plan"" or ""tampering with nature"" or ""not pure food"". The scientific consensus is the GM crops are as safe as non-GM crops... but of course people just claim a giant scientific conspiracy (see creationist, anti-vax, 911 truther...)

*  Anticorporatism. Some people just don't like the idea of corporations. In the case of Monsanto, this is usually centers around having patents for plants. Ironically, these same people have no problems with patents in other areas. A second area is on many of the claims that Monsanto uses heavy handed tactics to enforce patents, however when these claims are looked at, they typically are completely false or very exaggerated. You have to be purposely breaking contract agreements or violating patents to get their attention.

Mistuhbull,"Long long ago the Greeks came and conquered the land of Judea.  The king of the Greeks, Antiochus didn't like that the Jews had their own customs and gods.  King Antiochus decreed that the Jews needed to act like Greeks and worship the Greek Gods, not doing so would be a crime!  One day the King was riding through town and saw an old man who refused to worship the Greek Gods, the King came down and demanded to know who the man was.  

The man answered that he  was Mattathais and he would not worship the Greek Gods.  This angered the King, and sparked the people into revolution. 

The Jews revolted against the Greeks, led by Judah Maccabee (Judah the Hammer) and eventually won a long and arduous war against the Greeks, pushing them out of Jerusalem and reclaiming The Temple.  But, when they got to the temple they saw that the Greeks had defiled it, they had smashed all the furniture and candles, they had let pigs run amok in The Temple and they had let the Eternal Light go out.

The Maccabees got to cleaning up the temple and restoring it, and when they went to relight the Eternal Light they found that they had only enough oil to last 1 night, and it would take eight nights to make new oil.  The Maccabees lit the light and sat through the night to watch it burn, to their surprise the light burned strong throughout the night, and continued to burn for the eight nights needed to make new oil for the lamp.  The holiday is eight days long because G-d intervened and made a miracle happen when the light kept burning.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, that's what is told.  If you look at the books where the Maccabee story comes from, you won't find any mention of the oil.  That part seems to have been added in by later rabbis, possibly as a way to add a bit of G-d into the story.

TL;DR: Greeks tried to outlaw being a Jew, Jews revolted, Jews win.  Big Party!

sir_sri,"&gt;Someone young like me doesn't have $1000 to spend on a single share of Google.

If you don't have several thousands of dollars to lose you shouldn't be investing in individual stocks.  Any single company could have all sorts of things go wrong with it and you would lose everything, that you cannot afford to lose.  

&gt;and their stock would go up as a result, right?

Not really no.

A few thousand people buying one share is irrelevant to the share price.   The way you should be buying into google (or anyone) is by buying into a mutual fund that has several tech stocks.  You get a tiny piece of the larger pie, but you're not stuck to a single company. 

&gt;Or do they not want that for some reason?

They want to drive away hordes of small investors who have no meaningful portion of the company.  1 million investors with 1 share each are only worth a billion dollars, which is less than 1% of the value of the company.  That's a lot of paperwork for basically nothing.  Particularly if they're  highly volatile and trading small numbers of shares around.  


&gt;please explain if this is not the case

Different companies have different strategies, particularly when it comes to stock splitting. If you feel there are enough shares available, or if you feel that you stock is so expensive as to even be pricing mutual funds out of the market you may need to consider a split, unless you only want long term investors.  Cheap stocks can see a lot of trading volume from people trying to get a few dollars a share here or there. 

Berkshire hathaway (warren buffets company) is the example of strongly resisting - to a point of excess.  Their share price as of when I type this is 174 000 USD per share.  Yes, 174k.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/17/technology/google-stock-split/

A lot of companies split around $1000 for the reason you are saying - people are hesitant to spend that much money for just one ""thing"", and if they can buy four stocks for $250 each (or just one for $250) then they feel the barrier of entry is lower, the risk is lower (?), etc.  It's purely psychological.  However, typically when a strong company whose stock has been rising splits it stock there is a quick upsurge in the effective stock price as people want to ""get in"" on the new price, they feel they can finally afford it, or whatever.  I would be interested in some statistics on this actually, maybe that is just my bias talking.

The opposite is true in my very limited experience too - I worked at a company who did a reverse stock split to try and get their price above $1 a share, as if that would magically put them into the big leagues and suddenly the company would turn around.  So we traded in two $0.55 per share stocks for one $1.10 and within a week the new price was down around $0.80 and just kept falling after that.  I can't imagine that a reverse stock split has ever worked, it sounds like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic to me.

Quetzalcoatls,"&gt; My question is, why is there no consensus over who owns them?

The Islands have changed hands many times over the course of history. If you take the land from someone and then someone takes that land from you, do you have any more of a legitimate claim than someone else? What if you never settled or developed the island but another country later did? All these questions make a question of ownership complicated. 

&gt; What does that mean for territory claims in general, what would happen if country A were to say ""We own this province in neighbouring country B!""? Is that something the international community decides about, and if so, why aren't they deciding anything about the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands?

Country A would be ignored unless they physically controlled the territory or were intending to take it. The international community gets somewhat involved in land disputes but its something that most nations are not quick to get involved with without cause because it is such a touchy subject.

sir_sri,"Taiwan and mainland China both claim the islands because the Republic of China was the government of China until it fled to Taiwan during the civil war, they roughly claim ownership of all of the same territory, and both claim to be the legitimate government of the other. 

&gt;What does that mean for territory claims in general, what would happen if country A were to say ""We own this province in neighbouring country B!""? Is that something the international community decides about, and if so, why aren't they deciding anything about the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands?

There are procedures in place for the international community to try and settle these  things, some more successful than others, and both parties would need to agree to arbitration, which neither party is likely to consider neutral.  

Usually when you sign a peace treaty you agree to boundary changes, but not always.  In the case of Japan and China, China (taiwan) signed as part of the Allies but basically left a number of islands unresolved as the US was going to occupy them, and they figured the islands would be handed 'back' to them. 

The US took the view that these Islands belong to Japan, and so... didn't give them to China (either china).  

Unfortunately, there are a lot of blobs of territory around the world like this.  Someone discovered it, someone else claimed it, someone else claimed it again, someone else settled it, a war was fought where one side presumed it was settled, but wasn't and then 100 years later we're still squabbling over it, but it's low level and no one cares.  Until someone finds something worth having.  Then it's a problem.  

These islands in particular are problematic because Japan may have acknowledged that they were part of China in prior to the 1870's, but claimed annexation in 1879 before a series of wars between Japan and China and it's not clear whether or not they should be returned with 'all chinese territory' or other vague phrases. 

The world used to have little dots of fishing islands that were sort of but no legally abandoned and basically tiny little enclaves of one country in another and no one is ever happy.  As the world changes lots of these things went from important and with recognized (if disputed) claims, to unimportant with no one doing much of anything, and back to important and squabbling again.

The English common law developed in the Middle Ages, and forms the basis of law in England and its former colonies, including the U.S. (Except for Louisiana, whose common law derives from France).

For instance, under English common law, a couple is married when they live together for a certain period of time and hold themselves out to the community as man and wife.

carlfish,"As far back as the middle ages, legal disputes between individuals in Britain were decided by taking them to courts adjudicated by judges appointed by the crown. Judges appointed by the King or Queen would literally travel from town to town hearing cases and passing down judgements. In the absence of a comprehensive statutory code, judges would base their decisions on their understanding of how the law should work, and how judges before them had decided similar cases.

On their return to London, courts would record their judgements and the reasoning behind them and share them with their fellow judges. That way, when a judge encountered a similar case on their circuit, they would be able to decide it consistently with the last judge who had decided that case. Alternatively, a senior judge might overrule their junior and create a new precedent.

The Common Law is the result of these thousand years of legal decisions. Judges in Common Law jurisdictions are expected to decide cases consistently with their predecessors, and in turn pass on how they interpret the law in newly arising circumstances to their successors.

How ""legitimate"" the Common Law is depends on your jurisdiction. The degree to which the Common Law is adopted in your local legal system is determined by your local laws. Especially, different countries tend to clearly mark where their local system of precedent diverges from the British system they inherited it from - decisions before that date being binding legal precedent, and decisions after that date only being suggestions on how the law might be interpreted.

Imagine pedaling a bike - each gear is a compromise between power produced per pedal stroke and difficulty of pedaling at a given speed.

In contrast, a CVT (continuously variable transmission) has no fixed gear ratios. Instead, it uses a computer algorithm to continuously determine the most efficient gear ratio for the given road speed and throttle input. Mechanically, it uses a system of pulleys and belts.

1. They have a pharmacological effect opposite that of the toxin (using a stimulant to counteract a depressant for example)
2. They block the receptor the toxin binds to, blunting the effect of the toxin (for example, naloxone, an opioid antagonist, binds to narcotic receptor sites on neurons and prevents opioids from binding competitively) If you drank methanol, you could be given ethanol (grain alcohol) which has a greater affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase which turns methanol into toxic formaldehyde. The goal is to pass the methanol through the urine unchanged so it has no toxic effects.
3. They bind directly to the toxin so it cannot bind to receptors in the body (for example, CroFab binds to snake venom so an inactive conjugate of the crofab and venom is excreted without toxic effects)

But close up, the incredible gravity of a black hole produces interesting effects.  The tidal pull of our Sun and Moon causes the oceans to bulge, because the pull on the side of the Earth nearer to the Sun or Moon is somewhat stronger than the pull on the on the far side.  This effect of the tide--the difference between gravitational pull between two points--is ferocious near a black hole.  If you fell into a black hole, the difference in the force of gravity between your head and toes could be hundreds, perhaps thousands of G's; such a difference would, in the terminology of physicists, ""spaghettify"" you.",null,0,cdpab85,1roigp,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

sir_sri,"It depends on when exactly you mean

Prior to the advent of a reliable mechanical clock which is the ability to determine longitude at sea basically... you guessed what direction you were pointed, hope you don't screw it up, and hope you live through the experience.  And yes, a lot of people didn't live through the experience.

You've been able to reasonably deduce latitude from something like the 3rd century BC (when latitude and longitude were developed), even in open water.  So sometimes people sailed to the correct latitude and then sailed straight east/west (or tried to anyway), that's not trivial when you're powered by sails that lead you not exactly where you intended.

From the mid 1500's on into the 1700's various european monarchs were offering quite a lot of money to try and solve this problem.  Finding longitude is a relatively easy problem on land, not so easy at sea btw.

One of the most basic ways to do this was with very precise measurement of time.  If you know the local time, and the time at some other fixed point (say Greenwich observatory) you could tell where you were.  Unfortunately methods of telling time - hourglasses and pendulums don't work for shit in a ship bobbing around in the open ocean. You can correctly tell *local* time from the sun, but that doesn't do you any good unless you know local time at some fixed point.  

In the mid 1700's (and for quite a while after) the method was based on very complex data tables about the position of of the moon at known points.  Not ideal, but it was good enough until the mid 1850's when high precision mechanical clocks became affordable. (and then in the 1900's they used radio positioning, which along with GPS type systems is still what is used).

GaryDo,"**TL;DR an awful lot of painstaking measurement by hand, the construction of physical reference points and mathematics**

A process known as chain surveying by triangles. Essentially you very carefully measured a large straight line distance by hand using a chain of known length^1. Then using trigonometry you could work out the distance of the other two sides. The whole area to be mapped (for instance the whole of the UK by Ordnance Survey) could be broken down in to triangles and mapped in this way. Whilst in theory you could map the whole country based on one single measurement of length, in reality tolerances (small errors that make your calculations too large or small) would build over time and throw your map way out. As such they had to do those physical measurements by hand all over the country to ensure their numbers were not straying far from reality.

HashTagWaterFelon,"Short answer is that it depends, and serious deformities may or may not ever actually arise.

The thing is that if the initial two had ""perfect"" genomes with no mutations corresponding to serious defects, there is no reason that their breeding (or that of their descendants) would necessarily give rise to a population with those defects. If they aren't there to begin with, they wouldn't be created by inbreeding. The founder effect is the formal name for how low diversity groups starting a population can lead to high incidences of genetic defects. But that is only because the genes for those traits were brought by a founding member of the population. Inbreeding NEVER creates a genetic mutation. It only increases the chance that one already present will be expressed.

And anyways, if the two people happened to carry in some serious problem traits, as in serious to the point that they would kill off the affected person, then natural selection would act to start pushing the gene's prevalence downwards anyway. Simulations with programs mathematically assigning fitness levels to mice show how when a given gene gives a higher probability of successfully breeding, that the inferior gene is purged to a minimal level very quickly (described in Reece and Campbell, ""Biology"", 7th edition)

So in short, assuming that these two individuals were healthy to start with, that pretty much guarantees that there are enough ""healthy"" genes in play to rebuild the population. Situations like the Kentucky families that took on a blue skin tone was because that trait didn't really reduce fitness levels by much (if it did, the blue ones would die and that gene would fade out). You would have a low level of genetic diversity, yes, which would leave humanity vulnerable to being ravaged by a disease or other pressure of that kind. So you could very easily get some strange traits popping up, but if they were ""serious deformities"" to the point that they mess with a person's ability to propagate themselves, then no, that trait wouldn't show up and stay around.",null,6,cdpg3e8,1rootd,explainlikeimfive,hot,25

panzerkampfwagen,"The speed of light is a constant.  That means it's always measured as the same speed (in a vacuum) for all observers.  When you're in a car going 60kph you'll see a car going 70kph as going 10kph.  An observer standing on the ground sees that car going 70kph. Not so with light.  If you're standing on a planet and light zips by you you'll see it going the same speed as you would if you jumped in a spaceship and zoomed off at 200,000kps.    No matter your own speed you'll always see the light going the speed of light (300,000kps) faster than you.  The faster you go the more time slows down for you because time is slowing down (and length contracting) to keep the speed of light a constant.

a20gate,"Here's a way to visualize it without any math.  (I'm going to use some horribly imprecise terminology and I look forward to real physicists explaining all the ways this is cringeworthy.)

You're always travelling at the same ""speed"" through 4-dimensional spacetime.  If you're stationary, you're travelling entirely along the ""time"" axis, and all your speed is spent moving in that direction.  Whenever you're moving through space, that means you're moving at an angle through spacetime, spending part of your speed moving along one or more of the space axes, so you don't make as much progress down the time axis.

A photon moving at c is essentially moving through spacetime at a 90 degree angle to a stationary person:  It spends all of its ""speed"" moving along the space axes, and does not experience time at all.

A hypothetical tachyon moving faster than c would be moving through spacetime at a greater-than-90-degree angle to a stationary person, i.e. it would be moving in the ""wrong"" direction up the time axis.  That's why having a velocity faster than c would imply breaking causality and going backwards in time.

Incidentally, the natural and smallest measurable units of spacetime are called the Planck units, and c is equal to 1 [Planck length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length) per [Planck time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time).",null,0,cdpeckh,1ror80,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

rainman21043,"When a server sends a web page to your browser it is HTML, CSS, and (sometimes) Javascript.  Occasionally there is Flash or whatever plugin.  The HTML and CSS are ""static"", meaning they don't change and are just like a file that is sent to your browser, while the Javascript is like a little program that is sent over that your browser runs to do some of the fancier things on the page (animations, etc).

The server that sent you the web page is often a lot more complex than just a file system though.  If you are visiting a very simple web site then maybe the server just holds a few files that get uploaded to your browser - the *.html, *.css, and *.js files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that make up the web page and they are usually the same for every user who visits the site.

However, if the web site is even remotely complex (having lots of different pages, or logins for different users, customizable stuff, shopping baskets, etc) then the server doesn't store a different HTML file for each page you visit.  The server will usually have a database with all the data that users might be able to see on the page but each individual web page is created on the fly by the server.  This is done with the programming language PHP, or sometimes JSP or plain Java or whatever.  There are lots of different programming languages you can write a web server with.

Take Reddit for example.  The page where I am typing this response has dozens of different clickable areas on it - the header where it says ""FRONT - ALL - RANDOM | PICS - FUNNY - etc..."", then the ""EXPLAINLIKEIMFIVE"" header under that, the login area to the right, the search box, some advertisements, the text of your particular question, etc.  There are thousands of ELI5 questions just on this subreddit and the server doesn't store a different HTML page for each of them (there would be millions of pages to store, and they need to be customized for individual users with their user name, etc...), it just stores the questions and responses in a database.  When I click on the link to your ELI5 question the URL is sent to the server and the PHP program on the server receives my request and generates a brand new HTML file using the latest data in the database, my preferences and user name, etc.  So every time one of the millions of Reddit users clicks on a link, a brand new HTML file is generated and sent to them and promptly forgotten by the server because it will likely never need to send the same exact page ever again.  The CSS and Javascript are usually the same on every page though.

&gt;It's because punching (like running) is a highly-coordinated activity that relies on proprioceptive feedback throughout the motion to work. Since the thalamus clamps down both on the transmission of the motor signals you'd need to effectively complete the motion and the perception of joint-motion data while you're asleep, everything feels bogged down and slow.

&gt;Compare that to 'flying', which is a), something we can't do normally, so we have no basis for comparison to see if it feels right or not, and b) superman-style flying about doesn't require significant body motion anyway.

sir_sri,"So I work with a company with games listed on steam that use keys.  

1.  You send them an excel spreadsheet with valid keys.  It checks against the list.  If they run out of keys they unlist your game or it becomes unbuyable and it's a nuisance to get back, as the key uploading (from a developer) wasn't automated last time we had this problem, so you have to wait for someone at valve to put it in the computer system.  

&gt;How does a key get generated?

Key generation is just cryptography.  Basically you take some message, encrypt it with a public key, print it on a disk.  Your servers or valve have the private key and can decrypt the message, read it, and figure out what it says, the encrypted message can be in a particular format to make them easy to understand once decrypted.  

&gt;is it really that unlikely to correctly guess one?

Depends on the encryption used.  But if the encryption chosen was good there would be 10's of millions of valid CD keys in a key space of 2^256 (which is 1.5x10^77) so.. you'd have a 1/10^70 ish chance per key.  That might take a while.  

That's assuming 256 bit encryption.

Because baldness is considered less sexually attractive (in general) in almost all populations, it may be a way of removing jealousy and the perceived threat of infidelity for elderly leaders, reducing the causes they'd have to fight for.

[Vilayanur Ramachandran does a good TED Talk on them.](http://www.ted.com/talks/vs_ramachandran_the_neurons_that_shaped_civilization.html) A few things I've read have seemed to suggest Oxytocin is thought to maybe activate these neurons. Also, there have been studies on Oxytocin's affects on forms of autism, so you might look for those if you're interested.

As for describing things on a more personal level, perhaps it's easiest first to imagine anxiety since you're familiar with it (and so am I, unfortunately!). There are ""gut"" feelings attached to it, right? Not everyone can name those feelings easily, but for me, when I think about feeling anxious, I think of words like ""jittery"" or ""nervous."" I think about having a nervous or upset stomach, about sweaty palms, about feeling like everything is coming to a head in a way that I won't be able to manage.

If I see someone else running toward a bus or getting ready to give a big presentation with trembling hands, I think about what *I* might feel, were I in their place. In those cases, it's anxiety. *I* would hate to miss a bus I desperately needed to be on. *I* would hate to feel nervous before a big presentation. 

It's not always about being able to name emotions, I think, or necessarily being able to know what to do with another person's emotions. It's about imagining you are another person and thinking about how you might feel in their place. I'm not at all sure if that helps, but that's the best way I can describe it.

How ""far"" someone can imagine things from others' perspectives varies. Some people can imagine how it'd feel to be that person running toward the bus. Others can imagine how it'd feel to be a person half a world away who's just lost their home to a devastating earthquake.

If you're asking more about the romantic side of things, that becomes more complex because what's ""normal"" and expected in relationships is heavily influenced by the culture you are surrounded by. How ""swept up"" people feel varies a lot, too, and ebbs and flows with partners and stages of life. Being a teenager, you're probably around a lot of people who are feeling a *lot* of things in this department—the best and worst of love, hate, jealousy, etc.—and likely feel overwhelmed by most of it.

BassoonHero,"There is a lot of mythology about this, so I'll try to post a complete answer. This brushes on some old holy wars, so please read the whole thing before leaving angry comments.

The first important point is that a virus is a specific type of malware. A virus exploits holes in an operating system to spread itself from system to system. You might get a virus from an infected disc or flash drive, or from another system on your network. If you install it yourself, then it's not a virus, even if you were tricked into installing it. A piece of malware disguised as something innocuous is called a trojan horse, or just a ""trojan"" for short.

There is a variety of trojan horse malware out there for the Mac OS, for Windows, and even for Linux. However, there are few viruses that will infect modern Windows and *none* that affect the modern Mac OS. For Windows, this has not long been the case. A decade ago, Windows viruses abounded, and users had to be very careful to keep up with software updates and to run antimalware programs. At the same time, there were *still* no Mac OS X viruses in the wild.

Common internet wisdom holds that this is because the Mac OS was far less popular at the time, so no one tried to write a virus for it. While intuitively appealing, this explanation is faulty for several reasons.

First, it strains one's credulity to suppose that this could explain a *total* lack of viruses for Mac OS X. Surely someone *somewhere* would have seen that while the Mac market was smaller, it was also ripe for subversion. Mac users of the time were justifiably (if irritatingly) smug about not needing to run antivirus programs. If there had been no additional hurdles to creating a Mac OS X virus, then it should have been *easier* to infect Macs, because their users were not accustomed to taking precautions. Moreover, surely some ambitious hacker must have realized the infamy that writing the first virus for OS X would bring.

Second, the prevalence of other types of malware, such as trojan horse software, has increased as the Mac's market share waxes. It's commonplace to hear that yet another Mac-based trojan has been spotted in the wild, yet still not a single virus. If the Mac's market share is sufficient to attract trojans, then why not viruses?

Third, the true cause is evinced by a decline in Windows viruses over the past several years. True, Windows's market share has declined somewhat, but the number of true viruses has dropped precipitously. The drop is all out of proportion to the fall in market share, and, crucially, the prevalence of viruses for other platforms (such as Mac OS X) has not increased to make up for it.

So if we can eliminate market share as the cause, then what? Well, the answer is simple, if sadly contentious. During the ""dark ages"" of Windows viruses, the Windows OS was far more vulnerable to viruses than either its contemporaries or the modern Windows OS. The ""malware explosion"" that accompanied the rise of internet use among ordinary users hit Windows the hardest because Windows was the easiest OS to write a virus for. The subsequent decline of true viruses came as Microsoft worked to close security holes, retire old APIs, and generally modernize their OS.

In a way, it's only by happenstance that the Mac OS avoided this. The ""classic"" Mac OS (versions 1–9) predated Windows, and by the late '90s, it was showing its age. It was designed for a world where a personal computer had a single, trusted user. Where this assumption was violated, there were security holes. And there were definitely viruses, although in those days, you were more likely to catch one from a friend's floppy disk than from the internet. There were also myriad technical limitations that are well-documented elsewhere. So Apple decided to replace the OS wholesale. This was a long and painful process, and an interesting one if you find this sort of thing interesting, but in the end, they had OS X, a modern, multi-user UNIX-based OS. And no viruses.

Windows's evolution took a more gradual path. Windows NT (""New technologies"") was in some technical respects a dramatic step forward, but Microsoft was very careful not to move too fast, lest compatibility problems alienate their users. Apple, on the other hand, maintained compatibility by requiring their users to emulate the classic OS within OS X, an approach that infuriated users but allowed Apple's engineers to make a much cleaner break with the bad old days.

So during the ""dark ages"", Mac users had a brand new modern OS, whereas Windows users had an aging single-user OS full of holes that Microsoft was working to plug. Today, Windows is a different animal – Microsoft's strategy of replacing the planks as the ship sailed seems to have mostly worked. And a modern Windows PC is very unlikely to get a computer virus.

TheDoctorApollo,"While it is true that there is more awareness for Celiac's Disease and that will lead to increased diagnosis, I am not aware of any evidence that suggests it is more common now compared to 5, 10+ year ago.

Most people who are self-diagnosed Celiacs have absolutely nothing wrong with them, but instead just want to jump on board the band wagon. Perhaps they have an intolerance to gluten, but an intolerance is very different than an allergy which is what defines Celiac's Disease. For someone to truly be allergic to gluten they must have an adaptive immune response to it. As I said, most people are either doing it because they want the health benefits of a gluten-free diet or because it's the cool thing to do. I had a friend that decided she was allergic to gluten this summer. I couldn't help but call her out on it when she decided that pizza and beer didn't count in her new lifestyle.

If your sister was actually diagnosed with Celiac's by an allergist (MD who specializes in allergies) than it is possible that you have it as well. There is some evidence to suggest that there is a genetic link in Celiac's disease. It is worth getting check out by a health professional, prolonged exposure to gluten can cause tissue remodeling in someone with Celiac's, which may lead to cancer or chronic inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome.

liquefaction187,"Awareness does help, but there are many other factors. I believe there's been a steep increase over the last 20-30 years that is only now becoming public knowledge. Children have more sensitive immune systems than adults, and those who have spent their whole lives only eating lots of unfermented gluten from a few strains have a more severe immune system reaction than adults who ate less gluten, grew up on fermented gluten, and ate more diverse gluten. 

For starters, we are overexposed to gluten - we eat more processed foods than we did in the past. Gluten is also added to more foods than ever because it's cheap. It's cheap because it stores well, and it's subsidized. While in the past we ate many different strains of wheat, currently we eat only a few strains. Modern wheat is bred to be extremely high in gluten, because gluten is great for texture. 

The way we process wheat has also changed. Commercial yeast wasn't developed until the 1960s. Before that, wheat had to be fermented to help it rise. A starter was created for this purpose. Starters are usually made from flour and water. The flour and water would be naturally colonized by local bacteria, which would be fed with more flour and water on a regular basis (or less often for sourdough), and these bacteria are what caused dough to rise. That starter was used to make each loaf of bread. The bacteria served another helpful function as well - to break down the harmful substances in grains by digesting them and leaving behind harmless substances humans can digest easily. 

There's a good reason grain is a common allergy. Like animals, plants can have defenses. Not all though - some plants, like fruits, want to be eaten. Their seeds are spread through feces, so it makes sense for them to be delicious and not cause issues in things that eat them. Unsprouted grains, however, die when eaten, so they developed a hull as a defense. That hull contains phytic acid, which blocks absorption of calcium, iron, and other nutrients we need. It's called an anti-nutrient for that reason. Another mildly toxic substance in seeds is lectin. In small amounts, these substances won't cause permanent issues, just some mild stomach upset in those not accustomed. However, when eaten multiple times a day, our bodies sometimes start to react. 

Another thing makes lectins and anti-nutrients in grains more harmful today than in the past. Grains were left in the fields to sprout long ago. Just like fruit now is picked before it's ripe, followers of modern agricultural methods don't allow the grain to sprout, as sprouted grain goes bad more quickly. Sprouted grain also contained fewer of these anti-nutrients as it doesn't need the defenses that a seed does. 

Even in people who aren't intolerant/allergic, gluten causes inflammation due to this toxic substance, as well as lectins. This inflammation causes the intestines to swell. The swelling causes tiny holes to be opened. When this happens, tiny particles of food leak outside of the intestines where they're supposed to be, into the body. At this point our body sees the particles as foreign invaders, and begins to attack them. This is called Leaky Gut Syndrome and is in debate within the medical community, but many people (myself included) have seen relief by avoiding substances that cause inflammation. Had I waited around for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me, I'd still be too sick to leave the house. 

If you think about how your immune system is designed to react to a tiny germ, it's easy to understand how a tiny particle of gluten could cause a reaction as well. Our bodies are reacting to what they see as a constant poisoning by doing what they are supposed to do - trying to make us stop eating something that's bad for us.

defguysezhuh,"When calling 911 in the United States, Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing (D/HH) people have several options (links to additional information are included as I go along):

* **Video Relay Service (VRS) &amp; Video Phones (VP) -** They can use VPs to call 911 immediately via VRS.  Basically, the Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person will dial 911 over the video phone, a certified sign language interpreter will respond first, and then dial 911 is dialed immediately via telephone line in a 3-way conference call (deaf person to interpreter to dispatch).  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located (at home or at a business) registered on that account so that when dialing 911, the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the 911 dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency.  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a time-saver when dealing with emergencies, but is also provides clear and direct communication when a Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person, like anyone in an emergency situation, may be panicking and would likely ""stutter"" with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address.  For more information on how VPs &amp; VRS work, you can check out **[Purple Communications](http://purple.us/)** or **[Sorenson Communication](http://www.sorenson.com/)**, which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida (with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA, I believe).

* **TTY/TDD &amp; Text Relay Services-**  Just to avoid confusion: TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context, but have two different names for the same device.  Some people know it better by one name over the other, so I included both, though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out.  Moving on, it's been pointed out that **[TTYs/TDDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_devices_for_the_deaf)** are an ""outdated technology.""  For the most part, this is true.  A D/HH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other D/HH friends/family members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place.  However, not all D/HH people know sign language.  As such, these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls.  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls, they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the D/HH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that D/HH person.  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the D/HH person as if they were speaking to that person directly.  So, it’s the same idea as calling 911 on a VRS call, but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign.

* **Captioned Telephones-** If you still use a landline telephone, you can use a **[CapTel](http://captel.com/)** phone, which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss (usually a Hard-of-Hearing person and not a Deaf person).  Basically, you’ll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed.  Using speech recognition software, everything being spoken by the person you’re calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone (similar to subtitles on a TV) with the silent operator’s ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software.  Recently, Sprint created a **[CapTel mobile app](http://www.sprintcaptel.com/wireless-captel-sprint)** so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline.  Same principle as using the Text/Video Relay Services, but you won’t have an operator talking for you.  You’ll be talking for yourself, so less delay in 911 calls.

* **Text Messages -** This is still in the works.  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to 911 because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if you’re a victim of attack and trying to hide (e.g., school shootings, muggings, home robberies, rape, etc.), so this is extremely beneficial not only to D/HH, but also to hearing people as well.  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how **[Text-to-911](http://www.fcc.gov/text-to-911)** is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up &amp; running.  However, as /u/MastersInDisasters points out: SMS, as it is defined now, is NOT a reliable protocol. If possible, use voice 911.

I hope this information helps!

**TL;DR -** We have several options: Videophones, TTY/TDDs, Captioned Telephones, and Text Messages (limited locations only for texts but slowly expanding).

I was a VoIP operator so a lot of the calls didn't come with an address &amp;amp; we'd have to get the caller to give us the address &amp;amp; input into a system so we could transfer the call to the appropriate police service. I got this call one day, I never worked another shift. 

Me: 911, do you need police fire or ambulance?

Him: It doesn't matter anymore. 

Me: 911! Do you need police, fire or ambulance?

Him: I just don't want to live anymore, it's not worth it. 

Me: sir, Can i get your address please?

Him: it just doesn't matter anymore. 

Then I heard a loud bang. I stayed on the phone for a couple more seconds trying to get this persons attention to no avail. 

I called his phone provider, got his address &amp;amp; called the police. The police later called back requesting the 911 call tape &amp;amp; let me know that they did find him dead. They asked me how I was &amp;amp; if I wanted to talk to anyone.

I once tried to report some pretty fucked up crimes in progress involving loss of life, etc, while they were ongoing, and I was the only witness, and it said ""No text service is available for 911. Please use voice calls."" I still speak perfectly, but I was in a situation where speaking would get me killed. Same with them seeing my phone.

I'm kind of bitter about the fact that, in the supposedly-best country in the world, 911 can't receive text messages. That's arcane. So I just left it at that. It was actually a blessing in disguise because if I ratted them out, I'd probably be dead now.

So how do we call 911? If we can speak, and we don't have a TTY, we just call in most cases. However, the operators are kind of annoying: I've told them straight up I'm deaf, and I can't hear a thing, that I don't have a TTY and to just get someone here ASAP to help these people. They keep calling me back. Over and over. Trying to keep me on the line, and it's pointless when nobody else is around (in the event someone else is around and able to use the phone, I give it to them).

 During a 911 call, we were required to give much more information about the call to the dispatcher, and there was no need to enforce transparency. I probably handled a few calls to 911 that were legitimate, but most calls to 911 were fraudulent.  We were required to process them anyway.  Things are much different now.

7cardcha,"Okay, so I know a fair bit about hardware but most of this is just compiled from a Google search. Some of this could be outdated or slightly wrong but I think it is fundamentally correct. 


The Xbox and the PS4 have virtually the same CPU(an 8 core AMD Jaguar), except the the Xbox is clocked slightly higher, 1.6GHZ vs 1.75 GHZ for the PS4. 


However the games on the Xbox will only have access to six cores, 90% of the GPU, and 5gb of memory(out of 8). I suspect that the PS4 has  some limitations like these as well, but I can't find any info on that. The PS4 doesn't have stuff like the Kinect though, so the limitations may be less.


Games are rarely CPU bound though. The GPU tends to have a hugely greater impact on performance for. According to RPS, 4 Jaguar cores have less then a quarter of the performance of a i5-3570K. This means that my fairly lowly i5-2320 destroys the CPU of a PS4 or Xbox. WTF? I don't even have a gaming computer.



As for the GPU, the PS4 has 0.52 more teraflops then the xbox. The PS4 also has some other advantages like more ROPs and stream processors. However the Xbox is clocked a little higher. I think it is pretty safe to say based on this alone that the PS4 has a fair bit more horsepower then the xbox. Check this out if you want to here more about those stream processors and ROPs. http://www.ign.com/blogs/finalverdict/2013/10/26/xbox-one-vs-playstation-4-hardware-and-specifications/


COD Ghosts also runs at 720p on the Xbox, as compared to 1080p on the PS4.


The PS4's standard memory is wayyyyyyyyyyyy better then the Xbox's. The catch is that the Xbox also has 32 MB of ESRAM. This is the part I'm not sure about. Sorry. I'd have to assume it makes them pretty much equal, except the ESRAM might be harder to utilize.

The Xbox supposedly has a better audio processor, taking a load off the CPU. Little bit of difference. 


Overall I think the PS4 wins.

OldFatMonica,"For the most part, yes, dogs do like to be rubbed and pet. However, it is a common misconception that every dog wants this kind of affection.

Just like people, some dogs prefer lots of affection and others are more independent or prefer to express themselves in a different manner. So, how can you tell if a dog is interested? You look for body language cues. See the following video for a really good idea on canine consent: 

http://youtu.be/-cGDYI-s-cQ

As a shelter manager, I strive for a no-bite environment. Educating my staff and the volunteer population on body language is the number one way to prevent bites and to begin to understand what's going on in your pup's head.

Given that you and a dog have a good rapport already established, dogs like pets and rubs for the same reason you do. It feels good, it's a reinforcer, it's soothing, and relaxing. Aside from that it's a direct form of communication which can tell you a lot about your relationship. For example: 

(1) Your dog comes to you and you scratch behind his ear for 3 seconds.  

*  Your dog is telling you that he trusts you and appreciates your company

(2) When you stop, your dog stares at your face and gently places his snout under your hand.

*  He's telling you that you're doing a great job, you should probably never stop. 

This seems silly, but it's very significant because this is actual communication which suggests the dog's understanding of human behavior and social cues.

Good job on letting the media get to you, OP. Let's debunk this right away, shall we?

There are 4,156 Walmarts in USA. Let's be conservative and say that only 4,000 of them do black friday.

According to [this](http://blackfridaydeathcount.com), there have only been 4 deaths and 75 injuries since black friday started in 2006, 7 years ago. 2 of those deaths were due to a shooting, not technically black friday's fault.

So we have 2 deaths and 75 injuries over 7 years of black fridays. That's .29 deaths a year and 10.7 injuries a year. Spread out among the 4000 walmarts, that's 0.0000725 deaths per walmart a year and 0.002675 injuries per walmart a year.

doctorrobotica,"Because corporate profit is more important than civilization.   This is an unfortunate game theory problem that motivates these companies:  Their primary goal is to generate the most revenue.  And this is not *new* revenue in the sense of companies that produce new products or services, but revenue from the same fixed pie (WalMart, etc are all fighting for the same consumer for the same product.)   If everyone opened at the same time on Friday, the total amount sold would be equivalent. However by opening one hour before your competitor, you get some of his slice of the pie.  And so on, until suddenly we don't enjoy Thanksgiving at all and minimum wage staff is made to suffer so the WalMart heirs can by another yacht.

Another area this same problem arises is the minimum wage:  Almost all serious economists agree that if companies suddenly increased wages (disproportionally at the bottom) - say, raising the minimum to $12/hr - it would greatly benefit the economy.  But if your competitor doesn't do it and you do, it hurts you in the short term (and possibly you go under) because your employees make more, but don't necessarily spend it at your store.

RadicalKid,"I'm a producer. 

They use a combination of real recordings and synthesized frequencies, all laid out in a sequencer that plays their arrangements of sounds in a timeline. 

Starting out, and electronic artist needs a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). Common DAWs include: ProTools, Ableton, FL Studio, Studio1, Reason, Cubase... Though they mostly do all the same things. Most producers can use multiple DAWs and are accustomed to the varying workflows. These DAWs are computer programs that are able to pipe in/out sounds all throughout the computer. Basically, you can put a sound into the DAW, hit play, and hear it out your speakers. The DAW is also used to sequence the sounds together. The sequencer is laid out like a timeline and tells the computer when to play certain instruments or sounds. In modern day electronic music, there can be many many layers and sounds to organize in the sequencer.

Artists get their sounds and instruments from various sources. Some instruments are recorded live (guitar, keyboard etc) and then processed with effects and such. Other sounds come as ""samples"". These are short bits of sound ripped from other recordings. Samples can be vocal lines (YES, OH MY GOD!), snare drums, kicks drums, laser blipts, just about anything. Producers love to collect and share samples. I'm quite fond of my sample collection. Other sounds are synthesized via synthesizers! Synthesizers can either be analogue (hands on) or digital (it's in the computer... It's so simple). These synthesizers manipulate different wave forms by subtracting and adding to the waveform. Crafty producers can make awesome wobble bass, thick trance leads, and even realistic and hard hitting drum sounds. 

Artists get these sounds to play via MIDI within the sequencer. MIDI is the information that tells the computer what sound to play, when to play it, how long to play it, and how hard to play it. Lets say I have a big Saw wave synth that I want to play a Db note every 2 beats. I would have to go to my sequencer, find the Saw wave synth section, and put in a Db note every two beats. I would do a similar process for every time I wanted the kick drum to hit, snare, blipt synth, etc. 

In short, the artists collect their sounds and organize them in a DAW sequencer which plays out the arrangement in real time.

warriorsatthedisco,"They learn to understand what the word means. I'm no expert(I'm not deaf) but it's similar to how people speed-read. The reason why you can't just a pick up a book and speed read it is because most people are taught to read with phonetics(telling people that the letters ""c-a-t"" mean ""cat""(they would speak the word cat aloud so that the child would understand)). Since you learn to read with phonetics, basically you're teaching the person to read the words, and ""translate"" them into spoken language in your mind. Then your mind deciphers the spoken word. I think this is why kids usually have to read aloud before they can read in their head.

Because we learn to read phonetically, the fastest we can read is about the fastest we can speak. What speed readers do is ""silence"" the voice inside their head. They learn to associate the word itself(not the sound of the word when spoken aloud) with it's meaning.

People who can't read think like this: They see the word ""cat"" on paper. They say the word ""cat"" in their head afterwords. After hearing the word cat, they visualize/understand a cat. Obviously this all happens so quick that you think of it as instantaneous. A speed reader skips the second step where they say the word aloud in their head, thus reducing comprehension time.

t0mbstone,"Basically, due to its shape, it's easier for a boat to move forwards in the water than for it to move sideways.

This means that if you point the boat into the wind, but at an angle, the wind ends up blowing the boat sideways. The boat doesn't want to move sideways, though, so it ends up sliding both sideways and towards the angle it's pointed at.

This enables you to move forwards (and sideways) across the wind. By changing your angle to the opposite direction every so often, you can essentially zig-zag your way towards a destination, even if it's up-wind.

beerMonger11,"No sailboat can sail directly into the wind. But most modern boats can sail at about a 45 degree angle into the wind. 

Essentially sailboats have 2 wings on them. One in the air and one in the water (the centerboard or keel). Both of them are very important to making the boat move upwind. The sail itself uses lift from the wind going around the sail, to pull itself up. Think about blowing over a piece of paper. The paper will move upwards towards the moving air. This is basically how the sail works.

The other wing, the keel or centerboard, does the same thing, only at a 90 degree angle to the force of the sail. You get an apparent motion in line with the length of the boat. 

You mentioned the boats in AC4. Those are mostly the square sailed kind, which basically only went downwind, and used different trade winds to get where they wanted to go.

plasticluthier,"I'll explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about 12;

Three sets of forces are happening while you're sailing a boat. 

* 1. You have the wind pushing on the sail.
* 2. You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind.
* 3. The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shape.

Now, when you're sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry. If you squeeze directly from the sides, the cherry stone wont go anywhere, but if you squeeze from the back, the stone will come out of the front. It's the same with sailing, the wind pushes on the sails, the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards. Now, you can't sail straight into the wind, the forces wouldn't balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise, backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too. So, to balance all the forces, you zig-zag into the wind, turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn. This is called tacking. 

Now, sails are tight in when you're going into the wind, completely out when you're going away from the wind and pulled in until they stop flapping at all other points. generally, the position of the centreboard matches the position of the sails. 

If you need to know any more, I'd suggest going sailing. I have no idea what AC4 is. ",null,3,cdpj6al,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

NerdBell,"I'm surprised no one's given this answer yet, so here goes:

Congratulations! You're using a lot more of your lungs than you used to. While you're running, you're building up an oxygen debt as your muscles start to use more and more oxygen than you've asked them to in the past, and your lungs are struggling to keep up. As a result, you start really expanding your chest muscles -- does this sound familiar? This can be where side stitches come from. 

However, your lungs are really only used to taking in so much oxygen. Chances are when you're just sitting around during the day, or walking places, you only take very shallow breaths. The alveoli at the bottom of your lungs don't see much action and they get lazy, but when you start taking deep, heaving breaths you start to use them -- and they don't like that very much. 

This can happen regardless of whether it's cold or warm outside, and regardless of whether you're breathing in through your mouth and out through your nose or what have you (and for the record, I'm pretty sure you can breath through whichever orifices you choose [er, within reason] and breath out through whichever orifices you choose [again, choose wisely] as long as you're getting enough breath. Some people recommend breathing through both your nose and your mouth!)

In either case, it really just means that you're helping your lungs gain capacity. I would suggest looking up some breathing exercises online, being really conscious of how deeply you breathe during your day, and most importantly, keep running. :)

**I thought you were referring to a burning sensation in your legs before you tire. Oops.**



I'm not an expert, but I think you're referring to the effects of the build up of lactic acid.

As I understand it, when your body can't deliver enough oxygen to your muscles, it temporarily forms ""lactate"" which helps break down glucose and give you energy. 

However, one of the downfalls of this process is that you'll eventually experience increased acidity levels in your muscle cells (hence, lactic acid). Now, the whole process doesn't work very well in acidic environments, so the whole process is hindered and this is where you'll tend to get that muscle fatigue feeling. This is all done as a natural mechanism to prevent muscle damage caused by over-exertion. 

Once your body slows down, oxygen becomes more available and the whole system sort of reverses itself and everything is back to normal.

TL;DR: When oxygen is limited, your body resorts to other means that provide a temporary fix, but this process naturally halts and reverses itself before the quick fix causes any permanent damage.

The reason is because it would be too easy to steal money. Customer comes in, orders food, you put the order through the till and press the total button. Then you charge the customer the correct amount, and, any time the customer pays with exact money, you immediately cancel the order and pocket the money.

For this reason, once the Total button has been pressed, nothing can be removed from that order (although it is possible to add to the order) without manager's approval.

sir_sri,"&gt; Why can't they just SAY ""Check system time""?

Because the line of code that failed doesn't know that the problem is that your system time is wrong.  When you do a search for error codes or when you go look at the MS knowledge base you're looking at common causes for an error.

But when you write code you have something like this

If some condition is true (do whatever is supposed to happen).

If not, throw off an error code that indicated this condition failed.  

The solution to the problem is to figure out what caused the condition to be wrong in the first place, but then, maybe it's *supposed* to be wrong some of the time.  


Software is a series of complex interlocking systems, particularly operating systems where you have thousands of programmers who have worked for years.  The guy doing a software update is checking to see if time time is valid, the guy who wrote the clock software 5 years ago did so with whatever his assumptions were (that time servers would be accessible for example).  

Enter you trying to update.  The programmer who wrote the update only knows how to check that the time is valid or not, he has no way to peak into the time keeping code to know that the problem was some time sync failed, and that caused his time to be wrong.  He just knows the time is wrong, and there are a lot of potential reasons for that.

The simplest strategy is just to output that the time is wrong, then exit gracefully instead of just crashing.

In addition, from a software development perspective, writing a detailed explanation for the cause of the error takes lots of time. Normally, a placemarker is left in the code where the error message will go, so that they can put an error message in just before the software is released. If the code is changed before the release, then the text of the error message has to be changed too. Giving the messages an error number ends up saving time and reduces the possibility that someone will forget to change the error description.

The ASVAB is a test that measures how good you are in various areas, i.e., verbal skills, mechanical systems, math, etc.  Each area gets a score and each job has minimum scores in one or two of these areas.  There's also an ""overall"" score that determines if you're even able to join the military, amongst other things.  Each branch has its own minimum for this overall score, so even if you don't score high enough to join the airforce, you may be able to join the army or marines.

Assuming the recruit qualifies to join the branch of service, the recruiter then gives them a list of jobs they qualify for, based on their ""line scores"", the scores from each area tested.  The recruit then picks one of these jobs and starts training for basic.  After basic, they go to the school for whatever job they chose.

This is one of the first places where the enlisted side diverges from the officer side.  Enlisted soldiers pick their specific job.  Officers pick three branches (such as transportation, medical, communications, etc.) and ""the needs of the Army/Navy/Marines..."" determines which branch they get assigned to (that is, if an officer's first choice is full, the military will look at their second and third choices).  Officers are expected to adapt wherever they go, even if they didn't get the job they really wanted, whereas enlisteds get the specific job they signed up for.

computervirologist,"Computer viruses fall under the category of malware, or malicious software. Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware, a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs. 

A computer virus is usually an executable file that, when executed, will usually perform the following tasks: 

* search for other files on the computer
* if the file is a program, copy the virus's code to that program
* execute a payload (which may or may not be destructive)

Once a program gets a virus's code injected into it, it becomes an infected program. An infected program, when executed, will run the virus code first before running the original code of the program.

Since viruses only infect files when they're executed, they rely on user interaction in order to spread. Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus, any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now. Keep in mind though, that unless the virus has elevated privileges, it can only infect programs that the current user has write-access to. 

An anti-virus virus is a program that spreads like a virus, but when it's code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it. Think of it like a chain: virus, anti-virus virus, original program. First the virus code will run, then the anti-virus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it, then the original program will run. Anti-virus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used. 

Besides viruses, there are also computer trojans, spyware, ransomware, backdoors, worms, and fork bombs.

Trojans are rogue programs, they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else. For example, many trojan programs ironically claim to be anti-virus software, but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malware.

Spyware is any program that collects users' personal data without their knowledge and consent. Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user. In fact, many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature. 

ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom. Cryptolocker, for example, will encrypt the user's files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files. The password for decryption is stored on the hacker's computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up. 

backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker. Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet. A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person, usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down. 

A worm is an autonomous computer virus. Unlike computer viruses, worms do not require human interaction in order to spread. Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading. When a worm is running on a computer, it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as it's host. It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers. Once it finds a host with vulnerable software, the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer. 

Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship. Multiple viruses may infect a worm, allowing the viruses to be transported across networks. Once the worm reaches a destination, the viruses copy themselves to that machine too. You can think of the viruses as piggy-back riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate. Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated worm.

Finally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb. Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources. The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive, requiring a hard reboot. If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads, the computer will crash every time it is turned on. The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up, is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system.

Just this week it comes out that Bell Mobility (Canadian telecom company) is marking up the price of competing online content by 800% ([explanation](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/11/26/bell-mobility-net-neutrality_n_4338654.html)).

Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T and others have been throttling connections to media hubs like Youtube and Netflix for years. Verizon wants to make people and the companies running these sites pay more to access these media sites as well.

diMario,"Quantum mechanics, or more broadly quantum physics, studies matter on the level of elementary particles. It turns out that strange things happen when you dig down to a smaller and smaller scale of things.

For instance, electric things. In everyday life you can have a light bulb rating 60 Watt, 40 Watt, 25 Watt and so on. If Philips were so inclined, they could easily make a light bulb rating 41.5 watt or 7.89 Watt. In every day life, things happen on a sliding scale. A certain property can have a value of 1, or a value of 2, or any other value in between 1 and 2.

Not so in quantum physics. When you look at things in a smaller and smaller scale, the properties that you measure take on distinct values. For electric current for instance, you can measure a flow of 1 unit of charge per second, or you can measure a flow of 2 units of charge per second, *but you cannot measure a unit of 1.5 charge per second*.

This is explained by theorizing that electric charge in everyday life is made up by the sum of a bunch of very small but distinct elementary electric charges of which you can have either 1, or 2, but not one and a half.

In order to describe this phenomenon, physicists say that electric charge is *quantized* (from which comes the ""quantum"" part of the name).

Now, as it turns out, not only electric charge but practically all properties of matter that you care to study exhibit this behaviour.

One of the (theoretical) consequences is that when speaking about properties on the quantum scale of things, you cannot deal in certainties but only in probabilities. When I perform a thousand measurements in a certain quantum physical experiment, I'll find that roughly 300 times the outcome is 5, and 700 times the outcome is 9. But when I perform a single measurement, I cannot predict whether the outcome is 5 or 9. Weird, isn't it?

Quantum physics solves this weirdness by assuming that before the measurement, the property I am about to measure is *5 and 9, both at the same time*. Only after I have measured it, the quantum system ""has decided"" whether it was 5 or 9.

This means that only *after* I observe a system, the system ""decides"" what value it will show me. Thus it is said that reality (the value of the property) is influenced by observation (the fact that I measure it).

QuigleyQ,"I suppose it would be best to start with a brief history.

What is light? Some people, such as Newton, believed that light was made of tiny particles (corpuscles) that were fired off by the light source. This explains why light goes in a straight line, and how it is reflected off surfaces at the same angle. But this does not explain how light is refracted (through a prism, for example). Why would some particles bend more than others? This could be corrected for by assuming that these corpuscles speed up when passing through glass. Still, there are other phenomena that the particle theory does not describe, such as diffraction.

---

Eventually, physicists came to support a different theory of light. Instead of discrete particles, light was a wave. Not like a water wave though, this wave only moved tranversely, like [so](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Electromagneticwave3D.gif). This explained light much better than the particle theory. 

The most striking example is in diffraction. Imagine you have a solid sheet of metal with two slits cut in it, a sensor screen some ways behind it, and you shine a light onto this [contraption](http://www.empiricalzeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/double-slit-box1.jpg). If light were a particle, you should see two bars on the sensor, like [this](http://stephenwhitt.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/double-slit-bullets.jpg?w=490), because the particles go through and continue going straight. However, if light were a wave, the sensor would have [a more complicated pattern](http://grad.physics.sunysb.edu/~amarch/int.gif), because the waves [interfere with each other](http://www.atom.uni-frankfurt.de/research/synchrotron/photonmolecule/H2_double/3_double_slit/double-slit-plane-wave.gif). It turns out, when you do this experiment, that you get the interference pattern. Coupled with the fact that you can explain pretty much all properties of light, this theory is pretty convincing. So it's settled, light is a wave, right?

---

The challenge to this theory came from an unexpected direction. When you heat up an object, it emits light. And physicists had equations to predict how much light of a particular frequency. While these worked well for low frequencies, they predicted that objects emitted infinite energy in the higher ones. Clearly this is wrong. Planck showed that this problem does not occur if light comes in discrete quantities. Other properties, such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are also well described if light comes in lumps. So are we back to the particle theory again? If we are, how do we explain the double-slit experiment?

---

Let's go back to it again. If it is really a particle, then why does the interference pattern form? Say we place detectors at the slits. If light is a wave, then it'll trigger both. If it's a particle, it'll just trigger one. When we do this, we see that only one is triggered. So light is a particle! But when you check the screen, the interference pattern has disappeared, and two stripes show up instead! So we take away the detectors and try again. Now it reappears. If words don't cut it for you, watch [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Wave-particle_duality.ogv).

When we watch the slits, light behaves like particles. When we don't, it behaves like waves. How can we reconcile these two behaviors? The answer is: light behaves like some very unintuitive *thing*.

---

Quantum physics is the study of how on earth this works. This wave-particle duality only seems to show up for small objects (think on the scale of atoms). Some of the consequences of this include:

* Objects exist in a [superposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) of all possible states, weighted towards the more ""likely"" ones. Measuring the object collapses this superposition to a more defined state.
* The more [precisely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle) you measure the position of an object, the less you know about its momentum.
* Occasionally, objects can [tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling) across gaps or barriers that they otherwise could not cross.
* You can [entangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) two particles so that measuring one disturbs the other, regardless of how far apart they are.",null,0,cdpuf79,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

The parasympathetic nervous system activates ""rest and digest"" stimuli such as decreased heart rate and increased digestion.

It wasn't an explosion like you and I relate to. It's more like the rapid and massive expansion of pure energy, but there was no matter, no gas at all. It had to expand and cool a fair bit until the universe had cooled enough to allow for matter to come into existence from the converted energy. The first particles came about a few minutes after the initiation. Neutral stable atoms around 300,000 thousand of years later. 

No one really knows what came before and it is an area of intense research with a number of theories. Nothing in the existing universe can precede the Big Bang so the conditions that set it off are outside our experience, outside time and space. 

Some think that the universe began as a quantum fluctuation that was able to last long enough for the process of inflation start. Once that process began there was no way for the fluctuation to annihilate itself and you end up with this runaway inflation of the universe. This comes from the understanding that spacetime is in constant state of fluctuation. There are virtual particle appearing and disappearing all around us. Although it is specuated that the [Higgs Field](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_field) prevents this from reoccuring within our universe again. 

Another is where a pair of 5 dimensional [branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane) collide with each other and produce a massive amount of energy which creates the trigger of the Big Bang.

The Bang Bang is when,among other things, time began. Asking what was ""before"" literally makes no sense in the context of the theory. It is like asking what is north of the North Pole.

It is also when matter came into being. So there was no ball of gas... there was no nothing. Even in the early universe there was no gas. Everything had so much energy even atoms couldn't form. The subatomic particles were whizzing about too fast to form larger particles.

And asking about a ""cause"" for the Big Bang is hard as well. As far as we know the universe is it. Maybe there is something more, but we can't sense or interact with it... because it would exist outside of the universe. We can make guesses about what it might be.

In the 19th century, the reverse of the current situation became fashionable in Europe -- pink as a colour for boys, and blue for girls. Rumour was that this originated in using blue for blue-eyed babies or blond(e) babies and pink for brown-eyed or brown-haired, with girls being more likely to be blonde or blue-eyed -- but there's no way of knowing if that is the origin, or just what some magazines happened to advise.

This fashion spread up until around the mid-20th century. In 1948, Prince Charles was born. His nursery was decorated in pale blue, and he was seen wearing pale blue clothes. Magazines did colour-photograph features on the royal baby, and it was something of a sensation, like the royal wedding was recently (Charles being the future king, and all). It's often said that this was the event that made blue a fashionable colour for boys, as mothers around the UK started dressing and decorating like their Queen did, then catching on in other English-speaking countries.

There's no way to know if that's definitely true, because this isn't some iron law that was signed into effect on a given day, but it's *probably* true, or at least a major influence, because that is the time that pink and blue reversed their positions and became actual gender signifiers (prior to this, blue was generally associated with girls and pink with boys, but it wasn't taboo to wear the alternate colour and those colours weren't used to *represent* girls and boys).",null,15,cdpi8a6,1rpazv,explainlikeimfive,hot,71

Quick rundown:

1) If major arteries or connecting arterioles (Cerebral medial, posterior, anterior, basal or carotid) are hit, there is a high probability of death. If not, things get interesting:

2)If not, then its down to what brain matter is destroyed (And this is how researchers attributed function to area: 

Frontal lobe: Non life essential (See Patient Phineas Gage), destruction results in change of personality, executive function (higher moral, thought, rationalising and inhibition processes.

Temporal lobe ( lower side): Non life essential (See Patient: HM), destruction may result in loss of memory functions (hippocampus), loss or intensification of primal emotion (fear anger etc) (amygdala). 

If you drew a line from ear to ear along the top most point of your head, this is roughly (slightly more anteriorely) where the motoric and sensory cortex would be. Damage here results in loss of the ability to feel, or move.

Parietal lobe (top side): Non life essential, damage may lead to cognitive  changes, however its very possible that no obvious changes may be seen.

Occipital lobe (back of head): Non life essential, vision loss.

Deep brain (Di-encephalon, Mes encephalon etc.) and brainstem.
Traumatic damage here is almost certainly deadly. 

Most important life functions are breathing, arousal, and decending motoric tracts. 

3)
Lastly, infection is a major concern. High dose Antibiotic (probably broad spectrum) is necessary.

TLDR: 1) If you dont pop a major artery, 2) You can hit non life-essential brain matter and 3) Survive infection, you can survive a shot to the brain and not die.",null,9,cdpjjq5,1rpdhm,explainlikeimfive,hot,83
seriously_trolling,"Only certain parts of your brain control essential body functions, like respiration and heart rate.  The whole brain is not the same, and is composed of many different regions which do different functions.",null,2,cdpin8x,1rpdhm,explainlikeimfive,hot,6
YourDoubt,"Actually, the very 'front' is the most 'losable' part of brain tissue to keep you 'alive,' to say nothing of the Circle of Willis (which is more at the base of the 'front'). The Brainstem is typically where the respiratory and other vital maintenance areas are, if you take this out, you will definitely die. An interesting example of losing a large chunk of the Frontal lobe is [Phineas Gage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage). 

What is important to note is that the brain is incredibly vasculated, if you knock out a vessel (which is likely), you not only have to deal with the blood loss to vital regions of the brain, but the blood itself is incredibly neurotoxic, and before that, you have to deal with inter cranial pressure(of course if you have a bullet wound, you likely have a shunt already formed for the blood to come out.) Also, you have to understand that some bullets can create a shockwave of force that can travel through the body itself and cause damage in areas not local to wound itself. There is also the issue of the brain having a completely different immune system, so you may have to deal with an incredible infection.


So, to recap, if you survive the trauma of bloodloss, toxic damage from blood and intracrainial, avoid widespread tissue damage from the bullet traveling through the brain and bouncing around(this can happen with .22 caliber bullets, its a not uncommon method of execution in the underworld of our society), have ALL the bullet fragments miss your medulla you could survive.

The bones themselves contains no nerves. (Aside from the spine, but that's different, as the spinal column isn't a single bone, but many discs stacked on one another, hollow on the inside so that the spinal nerve can be protected and flexibility is still possible.)

As far as anecdotal experience is concerned, you know for certain if you have a broken bone just by the pain alone. It starts as a very intense stabbing feeling at the point of the fracture. Inflammation occurs rapidly, resulting in swelling, and a throbbing ache as the surrounding tissue attempts to stabilize the bones. My hand injury had to be treated with an Open Reduction, Internal Fixation (ORIF) technique, where an orthopedic surgeon had to make an incision into the back of my hand, reduce the fracture so that the two bone fragments were aligned properly, then insert a steel pin inside the bone to keep the two pieces together while they healed.

j_guazu,"&gt;But couldn't you just pretend to be Christian or Atheist?

The religious beliefs of the Jews weren't what the Nazis despised - it was their ethnic identity. A non-practicing Jew was still a Jew, a convert to Christianity was still a Jew. It was your ethnicity that you'd have to hide, and that would be altogether more difficult.
 
People in Nazi-controlled areas were rigorously documented, and several of the states that Germany invaded already had very thorough civil records which were used by the Germans to quickly identify the Jewish population. There was a history of Jewish segregation in Europe anyway, so your Jewish identity would be very likely to appear on your paperwork.

Add to that the fact that anti-Semitism was not a uniquely German thing, there were plenty of gentiles across occupied Europe who would have little problem pointing out which families were Jewish in their community. Even for those who had no problem with the Jews, if a group of SS soldiers turned up in your village and demanded to know who was Jewish, you could either lie and risk you and your family's safety, or identify them and make things easier for yourself.

&gt; did they just decide to kill everyone in France or Poland.

France no, Poland sort of. Poland was going to be part of the Third Reich's *Lebensraum* (living space), so it was planned to reduce and relocate the native population to make way for German settlement.

yakusokuN8,"First of all, before answering any of the questions, let me emphasize that the things that non-Americans see are highly atypical and not representative of what happens everywhere.  There's 300 million or so of us, and if you see 300 people acting crazed, that's one person in a million.  You aren't seeing the vast majority of the other calmer, bored, tired shoppers who wait patiently in long lines in stores where nothing happens.  These things don't make the news.  

&gt;In such videos, people always seem to be grabbing items at random. Is this true? Or do they have specific items in mind?

In the videos you see, they probably aren't grabbing things randomly, but there's so many people, that it's hard to calmly make your way through the crowd and tapping someone on the shoulder and saying, ""pardon me, can you pass me one of those?""  They most likely have items in mind, but the craziest people seeking out the best deals are usually after expensive, large items, like television sets and it's difficult to just grab one of the shelf, tuck it under your arm and get out of the way.

&gt;If they're grabbing items at random (just because they're 'cheap'), what is the rationale behind that? Do people grab and buy lots of things they don't even actually want?

This sometimes happens, but it's far from the norm.

&gt;If people aren't grabbing items at random, do they decide before-hand? Do places like Walmart advertise, let's say, iPads as 20% off, and then the riots happen because everyone had a pre-meditated goal to grab that one particular item?

Oh God, does Walmart advertise.  I was over at my parent's place on Thanksgiving night and within one hour of watching a football game, I must have seen 6 Walmart ads, no exaggeration.  We get ads in the mail, ads in the newspaper, and ads on radio and television nonstop for days.  It's really impossible not to know that there are stores having deals on Friday.  As you've noted, yes, often stores like Walmart will feature one big item that's normally $400, marked down to $200 and a few people every year get zealous about being the person to get it, because quantities are usually limited - just enough to get people excited and in the store, but not always enough for everyone to buy it who wants it.

&gt; Why are sales such a big deal to begin with? Sure, I like to save money as much as the next guy. But mostly I can't be bothered going out of my way for the sake of a sale. I don't mind paying a bit more money for the sake of convenience - even though I only work part-time and have a low income.

I'm not justifying the kind of crazy behavior that makes the news in other parts of the world about us, but it's not just a little more, at least percentage.  Some items are marked down 50%, so if you don't get it now, you will be paying literally double if you go a week later.  In the case of the really expensive things, this can mean a few hundred dollars and for many who don't earn much, this may mean a lot of hours.  If you earn $10/hr, $200 off a tv is half a week's pay.

&gt;what makes Black Friday in the US so different to the equivalents in other countries? What inspires all the excitement?

Honestly, companies advertise for weeks, the media hypes it up to *create* a story, then *reports* a story, where it happens and makes it seem like it's a huge thing, and so what's normally less hectic than shopping on Christmas Eve has now become a major deal with huge crowds and chaos.

Don't think the U.S. is unique, though.  When H&amp;M stores were opening in Europe and other parts of the world, there were crowds lined up to the stores.

It was particularly frigid outside, so mall security allowed to hoards into the mall early, but they had to wait at their chosen store for the gate to open. When I went out onto the floor, the crowd was howling and shaking the gate. It was like something out of a gladiator movie!

EDIT: Also, yes people do have plans ahead of time. A coworker of mine has been pouring iver sales ads since they started ""leaking"". He made a spreadsheet of all the items he's interested in, then went late on wednesday to map out the store so he would know exactly where the items would be. Then he developed a plan of attack and cane out with everything he intended to.",null,5,cdpjn88,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,hot,11

iamphiip,"I have never gone to stores on Black Friday and I have no plans to ever do so in the future. That said, I talked with a friend of mine who goes every year and she told me she goes for the rush and usually doesn't even buy anything. Apparently, it is exciting to camp out in front of a store overnight and be one of the first people in when the store opens. She goes straight for one of the big sale items and grabs one, takes it to a random part of the store where there aren't very many people and leaves it on a shelf, then goes back to watch ""the feeding frenzy"" going on where the big sale items are displayed. I think she likes the feeling of being in on the secret that there is one of those items a few aisles over and no one knows it. I personally don't understand the appeal of her ""urban camping and hunting"" trips as she calls them, but her family has been doing this for years.

Cedosg,"Honestly, Black Friday has always been a joy for me...

We have one of the biggest walmart in the area and it is always well stocked if you come early that is.

Anyway, much of this has to do with timing and expectation. You are out with your family in the cold and just want a nice Christmas present for your loved ones, but when you get to the location, you see piles of people. This often results in a highly competitive instinct to get what you have came for.

What shows are people's expectation that they come away with something to show for it.

Last night, i did most of my shopping at boscov and jc Penney (had to get some dress clothes for myself and brother in law) and it was pretty hectic.

We then decided to head down to the walmart next to the mall, and we weren't able to get anything worth our trip. Thankfully we didn't have to travel a long way, but for families that want that special something, it is not unusual that they go crazy.

For your point about other countries, you haven't really been to Singapore during one of those computer expos or that great Singapore sale, have you? I have seen grandmas fighting over a silk blouse.. It is not an usual occurrence as you make it sound to be.

Get the price of popular items extremely low, have very limited quantities and advertise the heck out of it so that everyone knows about that Ipad that comes with a $100 dollars gift card or that $98 tv... and have a sufficiently large population in a small area. You have the exact recipe for the same outcome.

Mdcastle,"Part of it is Friday is a holiday for most people that don't work in the service industries. All the people in suits that normally make news are at home, so it's a slow news day anyway, and since it's a holiday people start to go shopping for Christmas. The media and the retailers have hyped it up in recent years, with say $1000 flat screen TVs marked down to $499.99, as ""doorbusters"" They lose money, but not a lot as they only have 10 of them per store, so people line up the night before and camp out, and maybe 1,000 people mob the store when it opens hoping to get one, and when they don't they still buy other things. There's also a trend among stores to one-up each other by opening earlier than the competition, (you can probably only get to the doorbuster at the first store of the day), so stores are opening earlier and ealier, first early morning Friday, then midnight Friday, and now even Thanksgiving evening, which is creating more news stories about how service workers are getting shortchanged as far as spending time with their families, (Thanksgiving in the US is when everyone comes home to grandma's house to eat dinner).

Nobody wants to admit that they don't see the value in crowding into a circle of retail hell at some ungodly hour to maybe get their hands on something they could have purchased online for the same great ""sale"" price they're getting in stores. Since Black Friday is the closest thing to a religious retail holiday, stores push the issue with over the top ads about each year being insane and better than ever. It's all to contribute to ths mythology of the day.

As for the riots you see on TV, those are exaggerated, uncommon cases. Shoppers, while stupid and insensitive, aren't always as violent and beligerent as the media would suggest. Mostly, people come in with maybe one or two ad items in mind, but are really there just to browse the rumored fantastic deals.

seerae,"For me, Black Friday is a family tradition with my dad. As the food is cooking on thanksgiving, we pull out the ads and browse the deals... mapping out the stores we want to go to at the specific times, and what we will be getting at each store. We wake up at 3 am, grab hot chocolate and wait in the freezing weather outside the store. As soon as the doors are open, we bolt inside, rushing for the deals that we planned for and many other random bargains. By 7 am, we've hit all our stores and we grab breakfast at the pancake corral. Then, we come home for a nap, and later we consolidate everything we bought and sort out what we're going to return the next day. It's a fun tradition, but it's been ruined since stores started opening on thanksgiving day

From my experience,  people are rarely violent... I've never seen anything bad. That being said, there is a definite rush for the good deals. I remember one morning they opened up one door and people were filling in, but we were so far back that we wouldn't be able to snag one of the thirty $50 bluray players (back when they were never cheaper than $100). But then! A miracle! The other door opens and my sister and I rush through, sprint across the store, hurdling over decorations and into the pile of electronics on sale. That day, we ended up with three bluray players. My dad was proud. 
Other deals inspire other people to come out. I mean, I normally wouldn't buy an Xbox because I can't justify the expense. But two years ago, Wal-Mart had an Xbox with Kinect and two games for $100! It would be my only chance to get an Xbox. I didn't get the deal though because that year Wal-Mart opened on thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving is one of the BIG holidays here in the US. And it is the last one before Christmas. So traditionally the Christmas season and Christmas shopping starts after Thanksgiving.

Over the years stores have pushed big sales to capture the early shoppers. And they started to offer a handful of incredibly discounted product. Like a $1,000 TV, for $250. But they would only have like 5 of them in a store. The idea being that people would come to try and get the TV, but they would buy another TV instead... or enough other stuff to cover for the loss on the TV.

Over time the sales have gotten bigger and crazier. Now it is almost a holiday in of itself. But most of them are not like the near riots you see. Most are just crowded stores.

NightMaestro,"All of the ideologies aside, from whatever fucking philosophical judgements are made about American consumerism,

Imagine this big huge gift you could buy someone is normally like 1000$. It's an awesome flat screen. Your family finally has hit the income bracket to afford these kinds of luxuries. You guys love your tv. You want to splurge. You are not necessarily materialistic people, but the finer things in life are always good. Infact, one of the best things in your life are sitting down with your wife of 20 years, putting the kids to sleep, and smoking some weed /drinking beers and watching doccumentaries like frozen planet from the discovery channel. It's an amazing fucking show in HD. You finally get the chance to get a theatre in your room. Who wouldn't want that shit?! You worked for it! Sit with your sexy wife and enjoy your awesome hd expirience, you've earned it.

So at first this tv is 1000$.

The store markets this tv for 250 now on this day because they want people to buy shit, and of course once that shit is out, you buy the 700$ tv because you still wanted a tv in the first place. It's a marketing scheme. But this is not usual in the world of consumerism we have today. No company releases this shit  at such a low price besides this day. I remember when one of my coworkers got all 3 lord of the rings movies from a different store for 5 bucks! In blu ray! I would say that's awesome considering normally you would have to spend a lot more.

Now, would you push a few random people out of the way to grab an awesome TV and save 250$? Yes it is consumerism, but think about it this way. Money is money. You worked your ass off for this, for going through school, going through the hardest of times, to finally get this amount of income. Like I said, it's your money. You use it to pay bills. If you had to pay 1000$ as apposed to 250, guess which one anyone would choose.

I'm sorry but I am sure as shit going to push motherfuckers out of the way if I get to keep 250$ in my pocket, and 750$ saved I will rush in like a mad man. Why? Because its fucking money saved!!!

There isn't some damn horrid dystopian ideologies americans are bred with, it's fucking capitalism. We live in a world where money is money., and as pink Floyd put it, it's the root of all evil today. 

Make what you will with it, but when shit has the possibility to cost a lot less, people will go for it. It's just how the consumer system is set up.

This means it affects certain receptors in your brain that modulate ""inhibition"". You brain needs to get excited in order to do things - but it also needs a way to calm down to avoid freaking out in a state of hyperactivity. In general, GABA accomplishes this. 

We find that certain mental states, like anxiety, are correlated to different levels of GABA activity. More GABA, more inhibition, less anxiety (and also less physical coordination, etc). Other compounds that act on GABA receptors include the benzodiazepines, like Xanax, which are used to treat anxiety. The effects of alcohol on anxiety tend to come into perceivable effect at lower doses than those that affect physical coordination.

GreenTea-,"Basically, to make you perceive the sound as ""wider"" and more realistic.

Stereo sound attempts to recreate the experience of hearing a real band (or whatever) playing in the room with you--you hear with two ears, of course, and each of your ears picks up slightly different sounds because they are different distances from the source. So your left ear might hear a little more guitar while your right ear hears more keyboard.

Sound mixers try to reproduce that effect by making certain tracks louder in one stereo channel than the other, tricking your ears/brain into thinking you're hearing sounds coming from different directions, which makes the sound ""wider.""

Eventually people also began using stereo as an effect in itself, for example having certain sounds ""pan"" quickly from one side to another, which isn't particularly realistic, but sounds cool.

True, it would be easier to mix everything in mono, but when your equipment is working properly, stereo sounds better (to most people). :)",null,1,cdpk3nz,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,hot,7
Xelopheris,Not necessarily. If there are two similar sounds (like two guitars for instance) it might be better for one to be on the left and one to be on the right so that the sounds stay independent until your brain mashes them together.,null,2,cdpjze4,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,hot,7
systoll,"Essentially, Stereo sound [different sound for each ear] exists because we *can* distinguish which ear a sound is being played in -- and we use this information to determine where sounds are coming from. Putting everything through both earphones at the same level makes it sound like everything's in the same place, right in front of us. It's not *terrible*, but not ideal. By making different elements louder for one ear and softer in the other, producers can create the illusion of different instruments existing in different places around you. This sounds more realistic, and also makes it easier for you to distinguish and follow particular instruments. 

But others have explained this stuff. I'm here to demonstrate it. 

Most iPods have an accessibility setting to make both earphones play the same thing. On iOS, you can find it in Settings &gt;General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Mono Audio. Enable it with functional headphones, and you'll notice a substantial difference. It also serves as a 'fix' when one of your earphones breaks. Or, if you want to use it as intended, when you go deaf in one ear.

EDIT: Buuut... quick question. When you say you can only hear select layers of a song, does that include having the main vocals getting (mostly) stripped out of (most) songs?

danpaquette,"&gt; What happens after a company forgets to renew their domain name? 

Once the domain expires, it enters a renewal grace period of about 30 days where the original owner can reclaim it. Once that 30 days is up, it enters a ""redemption period"" where the domain is frozen for 30 more days and drops from the zone file. The original owner can reclaim or make changes to the domain, but the registrar fees at this point are often well into the hundreds of dollars (which is easily still worth it if the alternative is losing your business).

For about 5 to 10 days, it goes through deletion processing where it is dropped from the registry and is available to be registered by the general public.

Some registrars will retain their deleted domains to auction them off; whether they do it themselves or have an agreement with a third party auction house depends on the registrar.

More often than not, a domain that had an established website never makes it through deletion processing and is sold off for auction. Old domains that had measurable bodies of content, users, or search volume can be extremely valuable and can sell for many thousands of dollars.

When it's bought at auction, the new owner can use the domain as they see fit. The vast majority of auctioned domains end up in a portfolio of domains owned by a reseller; we call them a squatter. They often prompt the original domain owners, their competitors, and other interested parties to buy the domain well above cost. 

&gt; Can the person who bought it afterwards negotiate a huge price for the company to get it back?

This is legal as long as the domain isn't a registered trademark and they aren't trying to actively impersonate the original owners of the domain. If there are trademark or legal issues, there are avenues people can take to reclaim their domains; otherwise, they're out of luck and either have to pay the squatter's exorbitant fees or find another domain. I've had companies that drop their domains because no one was monitoring their registrar billing information that were squatted and reoffered to them for tens of thousands of dollars. 

The moral of the story is to always make sure your billing information is up-to-date, and set your domains to auto-renew.",null,15,cdpl9aq,1rpk3n,explainlikeimfive,hot,107

This makes it painful for the patient to breath. Therefore, there must be pain receptors in the lungs that tell the patient it is painful.

lumpy_potato,"So think of a restaurant:

The front of the restaurant is where you eat - it looks nice, it has all the fixings, and the food is brought out too you.

The back of the restaurant is where the food is made - all your supplies are there, the food is cooked, etc.

You, in the *front* of the restaurant, don't see the *back*. You just input your order, and get your food - you don't see how the food is made, and you have only as much input in what the *back* does as the *front* allows.

Websites work the same way - the *frontend* is the actual website, like www.reddit.com. Much of the functionality - comments, logins, etc., are like ordering food on a menu. You put all the data you want in and hit send, and the *frontend* delivers that data to the *backend*.

The backend consists of servers and software that, based on how they are programmed, know what to do with the data the frontend sends it. Once its done doing whatever its programmed to do, it sends the data back to the frontend. Some items, like minimizing comments, don't require anything beyond changes to the frontend - its usually only when the frontend needs to access data or send new data that the backend gets involved.

The frontend should know how to respond when the data comes in, and displays it to the user (or does something to it first).

For instance, login:

Frontend: Enter username and password  
-&gt; send username and password from frontend to backend  
Backend: check username and password against internal database  
-&gt; Send confirmation of correct login, or error message of incorrect login  
Frontend: Either log the user in, or display error message  

Or for going through pages:

Frontend: I'm on page one, and the user just hit next - what are the next 20 entries?  
-&gt; Send request for next 20 entries from frontend to backend  
Backend: Next 20 entries? Based on my list of topics, the next 20 should be these  
-&gt; Send data from backend to frontend

Verdandeify,"There's a really great book about this called Guns, Germs, and Steel that explains why some societies have gotten so much more progress than others.

A couple of things.

The ""northern half"" includes North America, which is one of the least advanced, historically. So saying that ""the northern half"" contains the most developed countries in the world is only partially true. If you take the United States, well, that's essentially a really large European colony, and can take advantage of Eurasia's natural advantage.

So that leads to the question: Why did Eurasia have that kind of advantage, anyways? Why did Europe colonize the world instead of Africa or South America? It's a couple of things, actually: The east-west axis of Eurasia, the availability of domesticable animals, and the availability of good quality metal ores.

The Americas are primarily north-south in their orientation, and it's obvious that there are larger differences in latitude than longitude. You can bring that awesome wheat variety you've just domesticated eastward or westward, like what happened in Europe, but it's hard to move that wheat north or south, where it's colder or warmer, and where the weather is probably different.

Secondly, Europe and the Middle East have by far the most large animals available for domestication, and that's a huge deal. When you have a large animal working your fields, you are a lot more productive, and the more productive you are, the more people your land can sustain. Agricultural societies are always a lot more dense than non-agricultural societies, and more dense societies can sustain more non-productive citizens like philosophers, artists, kings, and soldiers. 

Domestic animals also increase your ability to travel, and the amount of luggage you can tow around. When you're limited to smallish loads carryable in a hand cart, you're not going to be able to realistically trade as much as you could if you had a horse-drawn cart, and you're not going to want to go as far. You're not going to be able to really use the massive power of the wheel, because you can't scale up as far as you can if you had an ox-sized being hauling stuff.

Lastly, the advantage of iron and bronze over stone and wood is self-evident. If you have bronze, you're going to beat your stone-equipped enemies and can access iron. If you can access iron, you're going to defeat your bronze-equipped enemies and can access steel, and so on.

Rodorador,"When you mean northern hemisphere I think you truly mean the US and the majority of European nations. Many vast regions that are officially part of the northern hemisphere like Central America, Northern Africa and regions of Asia are actually considered ""third world,"" meaning really that they are underdeveloped by European/""first world"" standards. 

I am not sure why you would pose the question from a European standard, but I am going to hypothesize that it is because you were raised in a region of the world where folks are educated with European standards. 

Now, while the book guns germs and steel is definitely a fascinating account of why certain societies are more powerful than others or have the ability to conquer other societies does not answer the question of why such societies are justified in doing so. I will not get into this, since OPs question was not a moral question. The question was about why the ""north is more developed than the ""south.""

The main reason is the fact of colonialism. European powers like Holland, Spain and Portugal, upon coming into contact with the cultures that had been existing in what we call the ""Americas"" for thousands of years, decided that they would like to conquest the people and the land they used to to create a sustainable living environment for their civilizations. I am not sure how European powers decided to do this, but what resulted was a history of large scale exploitation, theft and enslavement and forced serfdom of entire civilizations. 

If you recall, during the renaissance era, when colonization was in its beginning stages, (Columbus had accidentally landed in America in 1492), gold and silver were measures of a countries wealth and used to trade goods. You can read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations for more info.  

Present day Bolivia and Peru as well as Mexico were excavated by Spain until every ounce that could be found by contemporary technology (enslaved Indigenous miners) of gold, silver and precious metals was shipped to Europe. So much gold was found that European gold reserves quadrupled. 

Once Europe had effectively colonized and extracted the wealth of American civilizations, we move to a period of time called imperialism. This is a term meant to signify a process by which European nations set up government in other regions of the world to dominate and hold power over other people for the empire's benefit. In modern day, although former colonies like the majority of the African continent and all of the Americas were allowed to become independent sovereign states, we still see the legacy of colonization and imperialism continue to keep what we call ""third world"" countries from developing. Structures like the world bank's structural readjustment programs and the US agricultural subsidy prevent these countries from developing. 

The agriculture subsidy has put out so many country's agriculture sector out of business, even though they would have a comparative advantage (ie make crops for cheaper than the us).

Structural readjustment loans from the world bank and IMF give loans to ""third world"" countries, but force them to run their fiscal policy in such a way to force the countries to overdevelop their raw goods sector. This is bad because these nations don't have the funds to develop processed goods like computers or other non-raw resources or technological processes, or their human capital.  What ends up happening and is happening, is that southern countries are still in debt, and the loan programs are not enabling the countries to get out of debt, but keeping them in the cycle of debt. Thus is the legacy of societies who felt justified in conquering other societies.

Doubtless, there are a million things that were different between englanders and the rest of the world. Empirically, we can't tell what factor(s) accounted for the change. That's because empirical work deals with correlation, not causation - but that topic is for another day.

So sticking to theory, what could cause a culture to pursue a better living standard? I can think of only two things: the desire by millions of individuals to make a better material life for themselves and the expectation that they will be able to keep their improvements. For the progress to affect everyone, they all need to be working in mutually beneficial ways. 

Essentially, England had a society that can best be described as capitalist. Its culture embraced the belief that it is morally good to want a better material world, as well as the belief that it is morally appropriate to pursue that better world on a personal level - as long as no one else is hurt by the pursuit. 

And this is just me guessing, but I would say that the other Western European countries had near enough cultures that they could incorporate the progress England started. Unfortunately for parts of the world, personal property isn't respected (certain types of property are stolen or legally prohibited), or there doesn't exist a belief that it is okay to pursue a better material living standard.

SecureThruObscure,"Depends. 

Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation. 

The reason is pretty straightforward. Your blood (and veins) act like a radiator system. They're brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area, and then sent off to a different part of the body. 

Is it's cold out, your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities.  It then radiates (transmits) that heat to the fingers, toes, etc. 

Typically, they lose heat (especially in cold weather).  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without. 


It's worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia (less blood gets to the skin/fingers, less heat gets lost), and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals.

Shmalpin,"Your extremities are naturally the coldest parts of your body (this is why gout crystals most commonly form in the big toe).  They are the farthest away from the heated core of the body, so it follows that they are more susceptible to the cold than your head, abdomen, chest, etc.  In the cold, the body attempts to generate heat in the extremities - this manifests as shivering.  If cold in the extremities persists, the body shunts blood away from the arms and legs to preserve a warm, functional core temperature.  
  
If someone genuinely has ""bad circulation"" or a pathological reason that their extremities are very cold-sensitive (and not an offhand, self-made diagnosis) then it would be due to a lack of blood reaching the extremities.  Individuals with autoimmune disorders (like Lupus), Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Vasculitis generally suffer from some sort of peripheral blood vessel damage.  This damage leads to less core-warmed blood reaching the extremities.  When less blood is getting to your arms and legs, they naturally become closer to the temperature of their environment.  Diabetes and Hypertension are becoming increasingly prevalent, but autoimmune disorders and vasculitis are extremely rare.  
  
""Bad circulation"" is something that a lot of folks are eager to diagnose themselves with, whether or not a true medical cause exists.

An older person who jumps into the same cold water has stiff vessels and they will take much longer to constrict.

May comes from Maia - The Italic Goddess of Spring

June comes from Juno - Roman Goddess of Marriage and Women's well-being

July comes from Julius Caesar - He renamed the month after himself

August comes from Augustus Caesar - He assisted in the Calendar reform with Julius and also named a month after himself

This mostly makes sense, since the 5-10 months are numerically named.  The years were 304 days long, and started on what we now know as March 1st. The old Roman calendar didn't assign months to what we now know as January and February. They considered winter to be a dead time without specific months. 

Two more months were eventually tacked on the account for this (Ianuarius and Februarius) along with an interstitial period (Intercalaris) to help address issue with the calendar and the actual seasons being out of alignment. 

The Julius Caesar came in and reformed the calendar, setting January as the first month (instead of the 11th) and throwing off the naming alignment of September, October, November and December (Quintilis and Sextilis were renamed July and August). ",null,0,cdptl11,1rpxaa,explainlikeimfive,hot,2

When in a crunch it can be injected intramuscular (i.e. epipen for people with severe allergies) which gives good enough absorption to have the desired effect. Epinephrine jump starts the heart by activating receptors that 1. increase heart rate (chronotrophy) and 2. increase the strength of contraction of the heart (ionotrophy). If you have taken a drug that slows down the heart, this can counteract the effect. If your heart has stopped beating; aside from CPR we give epinephrine every few minutes until your heart starts pumping on its own or you die. Pulp fiction is inaccurate because a heroin (or any other opioid) overdose does not kill by slowing the heart but but causing respiratory depression which we counteract with naloxone. The rock is slightly more accurate since chemical weapons often act by mimicking the signal to slow down the heart. Goodspeed appropriately takes atropine which blocks this signal.

That all sort of changed with your 4th grade teacher, didn't it? Nobody messed with him or tried to test him. They respected him a lot more.

The 39th president of the U.S.A was Jimmy Carter, although not a terrible president, people even today look at him as soft. He did some good things, but the country was just coming out of a terrible period of war; the cold war was still chilling around and Stagflation was casting freeze trap everwhere-- where, how should I say it, the cost of everything was going up, but at the same time, the economy was slowing down.

There was a feeling like the U.S.A was losing control and Reagan came in and even though all he had to do was smile, he gave people the feeling that things would change.

I'm not sure if you ever heard the term 'Reaganomics' but Reagan cut taxes, removed barriers in production, and provided benefits and tax breaks to upper level income people in the country.

Did it work? Well, it doesn't really matter. Some people will say yes, others will say he indebted the country further to make some citizens richer.

He was looked at like a hero by lots of people in the country. Now, with all that said, let's get at your question.

Reagan was a 'tough' guy. The cold war was going on between the U.S.A and Russia and where Jimmy Carter took a more peaceful course, Reagan went Super Saiyan 3. He stockpiled more weapons and in the end, he won.

""Take down this wall."" More importantly he won peacefully. He ended the cold war. Did he really? Hard to say. But that's how people saw it.

So, in short, Reagan was a famous movie star, an old guy who comes in and 'saves' the country from our economic problems, ends the cold war, put us back on a traditional path, like when grandpa comes over smoking his pipe and saying how he fought in ww2, complaining that mommy doesn't use enough butter in her mashed potatoes.

Everyone boosted him up so high, a small thing like the Iran-Contra couldn't change how people saw him. He'd have to lvl Charizard to 100 and then just let it go, or, I don't know, buy an X-BOX one and PS4 and then give them to the girl down the block, something really terrible for anything to change.

It also helps that conservatives and republicans have referenced how 'good' was, non stop for the last 24-25 years.

All of us, even the Democrats, agree that our parents have a kind of blind admiration for Reagan as they can't really give us a reason for viewing him as a great president, but here's what we think. The combination of new technology being integrated into the stock market, massive outsourcing, looser economic restrictions, and crack downs on unions gave the middle class much stronger buying power (for the time, at least) but actually ended up levying almost irreparable damage on America's social mobility. He also had little care for political correctness and used terms like ""welfare queens"" and engrained in people the incorrect fact the welfare was being abused by those on it, basically perpetuating a kind of de facto racism that persists to this day, and it should be obvious how this was appealing to Whites from all social classes. Also his ""Trickle-down"" economics, which in theory sounds really appealing but fails to account for the natural greed and self servitude that permeates among all humans, but because of economic success due to other factors it appeared to work (due to failures in modern day Canada, Bush 1, and Bush 2, it's clear Trickle-down doesn't work as well as thought). Anyway he empowered the middle class and there was even a mild recession towards the end of his second term which people didn't attribute to him but instead blamed on ""new technology"", because of his cult of personality. So basically he was loved because he built an aura of invincibility and growth which was powered by short term fixes to our problems (which are even today causing us problems i.e. outsourcing) and the fact that he had a massive cult of personality populated by young middle class kids coming out of college who were allowed massive spending power due to the cheapening of goods and the influx of jobs because of the growth technology (which had little if anything to do with Reagan) and military spending.

Drew2248,"You say that Reagan is ""held to be one of the best US presidents,"" but who believes this?  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagan's accomplishments.  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans.  In any case, even if he were ""held"" to be an amazing president, the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had. 

JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president.  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the 1950s while being, himself, young and vigorous, having an attractive wife and young children (the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelt's and that had been nearly 60 years before JFK), and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights, the Peace Corps, nuclear disarmament, and so forth.  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful, attractive, witty, and energetic.  But, Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president. No civil rights laws and so forth.  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in people's memories.  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish.  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process, in a way. 

Reagan's reputation developed somewhat similarly, though not quite in the same way as Kennedy's.  After all, Reagan did not die in office, but he was very good on TV, witty, pleasant, easygoing like JFK, and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him. So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had.  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits, and Reagan's children from his two marriages (he had been divorced and remarried) were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets.  But he was a nice guy, had a good sense of humor, and his appeal on TV always benefitted him.  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal, no matter what their abilities really are. And Reagan was not a bright man.  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm, that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with, and that America could do no harm.  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man, and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do.  

As for his actual policies as president, he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union. He had come, late in his presidency, to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing. But this was very much different from the rest of Reagan's foreign policy.   

Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive (as Kennedy's had been, as well, with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in 1962).  Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly.  He is often credited with ""defeating"" the Soviet Union, but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents' efforts as from Reagans, and it resulted at least as much from the USSR's own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures, arguably more from internal problems than from what the U.S. did.  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble.  But, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually ""fell"" during the presidency of Reagan's successor, G.H.W. Bush.  Maybe he should get all the credit?  Of course that would be silly, too, but crediting Reagan is just as illogical.  

What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy (like JFK) who made them feel good, that he stood up to the Soviets (but so had Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, and other presidents, often much more dramatically), and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the 1970s.  So, Americans felt better in the 1980s.  Was this Reagan's doing?  

Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending, and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy, and other factors.  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today -- he began the 30-year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others.  This legacy was one of Reagan's worst and we are still suffering because of it.  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the 1980s, and most Americans don't understand very well the economic changes of the last 30 years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the 1920s. This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations, shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top.  

Reagan was also very anti-union (his firing of air traffic controllers), accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor (whatever you might think of unions) in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time.  Reagan was also a strongly anti-environmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws.  On popular issues like these, Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy.  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president.  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS (those who got the disease were most often ""leftie"" homosexuals which Republicans did not care about) or to improve the medical system in any way.  In fact, Reagan's social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president.  

In short (?) our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians.  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre.  But neither is ranked among the top presidents. 

The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and, instead, they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people, was reviving the economy, was a patriot on foreign policy.  These claims are inaccurate, but the average American does not read much, I'm afraid, or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they ""feel"" about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing. And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan (he was reelected in 1984, of course) or buy most of the claims made in his favor, and in the last years of his presidency Reagan's popularity was dropping.  

This was partly due to his involvement in the Iran-Contra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagan's impeachment, but didn't. He somehow survived to the end of his term, and he got Alzheimer's fairly soon after leaving the White House, he was already very old, and people generally liked him, so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him.  The public simply choose not to care.  But the facts are there, nevertheless.  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past, had been divorced, and lied a little about his accomplishments, but was very charming and told good stories, so people liked him anyway. 

Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them.  Abraham Lincoln, often ranked as the best president today, was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good.  Popular views are shaped by emotion, sentiment, misunderstandings, a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues, and faulty memories.  Truman was widely disparaged as president, then there was a Truman Revival in the 1970s after we'd had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better, and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more.  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher, I think, due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were.  In any case, I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president.  It's the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy.  Heck, I liked him, but I hated his policies and still do. ",null,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,hot,4

I'm old enough to remember him, and what I remember is that he was kind of a doofus. A nice guy, well-meaning, but hardly the great hero he's made out to be. The depiction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU9lv_WqK6k) is, believe it or not, pretty much how a lot of us regarded him at the time. It probably seems very unlikely, since you've likely heard the more recent 'awesome' depictions of him. He was just a guy, and hardly a spectacular one. There were a *lot* of depictions about as flattering as this (and some much less so). There were also plenty of much more positive ones. He was not one-dimensional, after all, and he fairly won two terms, with good margins. He was controversial in many ways, but hardly despised. Even those of us who rejected many of his ideas and policies respected him, for the most part. If nothing else, he was likeable and personable, down to earth, and a terrific speaker. (Though many of us recognised that as the product of his earlier acting career and his years of corporate speakership; he was trained and highly practiced, but we did not confuse that with competence, high intelligence, or vision. We knew good acting when we saw it.)

I don't want to condemn him, but it bothers me a lot how modern conesrvatives regard him, because he was not very much like the way they paint him now. Reagan himself would be pretty disturbed at it, I think. He was conservative, but he was one of the last of the *paleo*conservatives, men of an earlier time who clearly remembered the prewar period and a different system of ways and values than we have now. By the standards of his time, he was more or less moderate, and was well liked by many liberals and conservatives alike. But by modern standards, he was more liberal than conservative, despite the very distorited image presented of him now. People can lie, but facts don't. Reagan favoured reasonable gun control, argued for union rights, holds the all-time presidential record for signing environmental regulation (much of which he personally championed), and was the first president to put up a gay couple at the White House, over the objections of many more conservative people.

I want to make it clear that he was not a cartoon. He was a real guy. But he was *just* a guy, neither villain or hero. It's weird and unsettling to me how people talk about him now.

VoreGidal,"The myth of Reagan as a great economic, free market messiah is conservative propaganda: http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/02/05/142288/reagan-centennial/

Some stand-out quotes:

2. Reagan nearly tripled the federal budget deficit. During the Reagan years, the debt increased to nearly $3 trillion, “roughly three times as much as the first 80 years of the century had done altogether.” Reagan enacted a major tax cut his first year in office and government revenue dropped off precipitously. Despite the conservative myth that tax cuts somehow increase revenue, the government went deeper into debt and Reagan had to raise taxes just a year after he enacted his tax cut. Despite ten more tax hikes on everything from gasoline to corporate income, Reagan was never able to get the deficit under control.

3. Unemployment soared after Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts. Unemployment jumped to 10.8 percent after Reagan enacted his much-touted tax cut, and it took years for the rate to get back down to its previous level. Meanwhile, income inequality exploded. Despite the myth that Reagan presided over an era of unmatched economic boom for all Americans, Reagan disproportionately taxed the poor and middle class, but the economic growth of the 1980′s did little help them. “Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled,” the New York Times’ David Leonhardt noted.

4. Reagan grew the size of the federal government tremendously. Reagan promised “to move boldly, decisively, and quickly to control the runaway growth of federal spending,” but federal spending “ballooned” under Reagan. He bailed out Social Security in 1983 after attempting to privatize it, and set up a progressive taxation system to keep it funded into the future. He promised to cut government agencies like the Department of Energy and Education but ended up adding one of the largest — the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which today has a budget of nearly $90 billion and close to 300,000 employees. He also hiked defense spending by over $100 billion a year to a level not seen since the height of the Vietnam war.",null,3,cdpzabn,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,hot,6
joelawendt,"This is written by someone who lived through these years (I was born in 1940).

Its called ""myth making"".  Reagan's reputation is a cultivated myth, and does not stand up to serious examination.  Google ""the clothes have no emperor"" for the definitive book, written just have his terms ended.  This book consists only of quotes, where he over and over again shoots himself in the foot.

He started having alzheimer's symptoms early on, and slowly deteriorated.  He is credited with writing all these beautiful letters, but there was a ""Freudian Slip"" by Nancy Reagan when the letters book was published, where she used the word ""we"" when talking about their letter writing activity in the evenings.  She recovered quickly and changed that, but the slip is out there.

I'm pretty sure the letter writing was part of exercises where she tried valiantly to hold back his looming dementia.

It is actually Rock 'n Roll that brought down the Berlin Wall, ... read what the people in Russia have to say about how emboldened they were with the ideas of freedom conveyed in that music (especially the Beatles).

The night of first election, I saw live TV of him walking through back halls toward the ballroom to make his acceptance speech.  He was not flashing his famous smile, but had the wrinkled careworn look of an old man, on whom it was finally sinking in that he was going to spend the next years of his life pretending (remember he was an actor) to be something he wasn't.

The really weird thing is that most of his actual economic policies (outside of the famous - ""read my lips, no more taxes"" - which he violated once elected) were right in line with modern democratic economic thinking.  He had great staff and advice (look up his ""kitchen cabinet""),  all of which has been attributed to his own thinking.

SlothingOut,"So a unitary government is a government system where there is one central government with all residual power. There may be state/municipal governments, but in a unilateral state these have no constitutionally protected rights or powers. An example would be the former Soviet Union, don't be confused though, this system is not always communist, most monarchies would also fall into this category. Many small countries also tend to be unilateral as well.

 Federalist systems have at least two levels of government with constitutionally protected autonomy and have formally divided powers. An example would be Canada, or the USA.

Alternative systems are hard to find, most systems are usually one of the two, I can't think of any examples of other systems off the top of my head.

Dr_Merkwurdigliebe,"(Thanks for asking a great ELI5 question. We need more of these around here.)

The difference lies in where power is (at least in theory) concentrated. 

In a unitary system, all power and legislative authority rest with the national government. This means that the national government is the only one allowed to make new laws, and that it makes laws for the entire country. The UK operates under a unitary system. A unitary system allows for broad application of national policies and standardizes government services across regions.

A federal system splits up power between the national government and regional governments. The US is an example of a federal system; the national government has the power to do certain things (like raise an army and regulate inter-state trade) and the states have the power to do other things (like run schools and build roads). This allows different states to pass different laws based on what works best for them. It also limits the power of the national government.

There is actually a third government type that goes along with federal and unitary systems: confederations. Confederations are on the opposite end of the spectrum from unitary governments. In a confederation, the nation is divided into regions or states like in a federation, however, rather than the regional and national governments being in a balance, the regional governments hold the vast majority of the power (the opposite of a unitary system). This means that most laws are tailored to local interests, which is good, however problems can arise when a confederacy needs to act together as a single nation, like in wartime, since the national government is too weak to act effectively.",null,0,cdpq1px,1rpza1,explainlikeimfive,hot,1

At it's current rate though, it will eventually do this on it's own, as it appears to be moving about an inch away from Earth per year. Give it enough time, and it will happen on it's own, baring any sort of mass collision, that could impact it's orbit (which is still highly unlikely).

But anyways, assuming that we could change it's orbit, so that it escape's Earth's sphere of influence... it would probably have a slightly longer orbit around the sun that we would have, mostly due to the speed at which it would have to travel to escape our influence. It would probably be just fine, and it it ended up far enough away from Earth, would then be considered a planet. If it shared our orbit, without ever returning to our orbit (which is highly unlikely), then it would potentially demote Earth from it's planet status, as a planet must not share it's orbit with any other celestial body.

But anyways, back to Earth. Without a Moon, our orbit would stay exactly the same. it's possible that the length of the day would change, as there is evidence that the Moon did have some part to play in causing the Earth to achieve on full rotation every ~24 hours.

yankee333,"The radiation ""ionizes"", meaning it transfers charge to biological molecules. Essentially these molecules ""absorb"" the energy in the electromagnetic wave, and change shape.

The charges are deposited on large molecules, especially DNA. This charge negatively impacts the ability of proteins to bind to the DNA, leading to errors in cell replication and the production of proteins necessary for cells to live. 

This destruction (of DNA/cellular protein machinery) causes the radiation poisoning symptoms. Low levels of radiation poisoning: GI effects (nausea, emesis). Larger levels: neurological effects, organ failures (death).",null,1,cdpqpr5,1rq7w4,explainlikeimfive,hot,3
marpiddycity,"When radioactive material decays it throws off different particles of varying size and amounts of energy. When those particles collide with your particles their energy is transferred to yours. Think of hitting a pool ball with the  cue ball.  

The radioactive particles are of such a high amount of energy that after they ""ping"" into one of your particles they'll keep bouncing around. And each particle it interacts with is going to bounce around transferring kinetic energy to more and more particles.
The more energy a particle has the higher degree of temperature.  So if you are exposed to too much radiation you will cook yourself.  Sun burn is a result of too much ultraviolet radiation, for example, while the microwave radiation that cooks your hot pockets is a different type.

The average person is exposed to about 300 mRem of radiation per year. More so if you smoke, eat a lot of bananas, drink a lot of milk or dwell in a basement.

Alpha particles are, comparatively, very big and therefore very slow moving. They are stopped by your layer of dead skin. However, if you were to ingest them they can do terrible damage... y'know, because your intestines are inside you. Beta particles are stopped by your clothing, they have a little more energy than alphas but, again, being exposed internally is a bigger worry.
Neutron and gamma radiation involve much faster, smaller particles.

With getting cooked eventually happening if you are exposed to very high amounts of radiation, you also have the possibility of slower damage from radiation resulting. A cell will form more copies of itself. So if a cell is ""pinged"" too many times the cell produces faulty copies of itself, and then those cells go on to form faulty copies of itself, etc. Or perhaps the cell is too damaged to produce daughter cells and the cell simply dies off.  Over time this results in damage (this is what happens to people who tan too much and look wrinkly and withered). 

However, getting dosed with a small amount over time means that while you might sustain cell damage it won't be to the extent that your cells reproduce damaged daughter cells; which is why after a few days or weeks your sunburn goes away because your damaged cells went on to produce new healthy cells. Which is why that 300 mRem/ year isn't a bad thing.

In summary: radioactive particles are high in energy, which equates to higher temperature. Therefore the more particles you are bombarded with the more your own cells/ organic matter are going to either die, become damaged, or cook.

ixian_probe,"There are two types of radiation explosure, acute (all happens at once) or chronic (slowly over a long time). In the case of Elysium, Max (Matt Daymond) is exposed to a lethal medium level dose of radiation. It is important to understand that people do not  become more radioactive when exposed to radiation. Instead, their bodies are damaged by the radiation in ways that are bad for their health. 
There is also another confusing expression you need to understand. Often acute radiation exposure is called radiation poisoning, even though it is actually not a poisoning at all! 

The reason it is called radiation poisoning is because the damage that happens to the body resembles very much what happens when people are poisoned. If they are exposed to a very high dose of radiation they start vomit and bleed from their lungs, stomach and such within a few hours. This happens because the radiation kills so many cells inside their bodies that the body start to leak so badly that the body can't ""patch the holes"" fast enough to keep itself alive. 

For a medium (but still lethal) radiation dose the damage is still very serious but people will live for a few days before the effects occur. Inside the body you have particular areas such as the bone marrow where new red blood cells and the white immune cells are made. As long as your bone marrow can produce new cells, the red blood cells will transport oxygen inside your body and the white immune cells will attack bacterias and other harmful invaders of the body. Unfortunately, the bone marrow is very sensitive to radioactive radiation and can be seriously damaged by radiation long before the rest of the body becomes badly damages. After a few days the body will run out of white and red blood cells and people start to die from either an infection or because they can't get enough oxygen to keep the body alive.

Lastly, cancer becomes the main cause of death only after someone survives a medium level radiation exposure or if they were exposed to a low level acute/ chronic(long term) radiation.

When it is ""activated"" by being treated with oxygen the surface of the carbon many of the neutral sites and some of the sites of positive charge are changed so they now have negative charges. This leaves the surface of the charcoal with regions of neutral, positive, and negative charge. In practice this means that just about any material suspended or dissolved in a fluid can find a location of attraction on the carbon which it sticks to, removing it from the liquid.

It can then simply be allowed to settle out of or float to the top of the liquid (depending on the density of the carbon used) as it will have a different density than the water.

AtomicSans,"The main difference is processing power.

An animated movie, a Pixar movie for example, is pre-rendered on massive arrays of computers called render farms. The calculations needed take large amounts of time to finish, and if I remember correctly, a ten-second scene of an animated movie takes somewhere close to half an hour to fully render. This explains why special effects look so good. However, after the movie is rendered, it is turned into a video file, which is simply a series of still pictures played rapidly so that it appears to move (Oversimplified. If you want to know how video compression works, there's lots of explanations out there for you to look at.) Playing this video isn't hard to do, which is why a DVD or Blu-Ray player, which isn't very computationally powerful, is able to play such good-looking movies.

Games are quite different. Instead of being rendered already for you, your console/PC has to perform all the texture, lighting, polygon, shader, etc. calculations and rendering on its own. Also, unlike movie render farms, these calculations have to be done near-instantaneously to keep up with your controller/mouse and keyboard inputs. To account for this, game developers are forced to make game elements easy and fast to calculate.

E-X-I,"There are so many factors that come into play when talking about longevity.

For one, counter-intuitively, our cells are built *to die*.

Only a small portion of our DNA is actually active.  A truly great amount has 'old' inactive DNA, which is how some people can [be born with lizard hearts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014134/).  There is also a tail end of DNA strands made up of telemerase.

This telemerase acts as a kind of buffer against excessive replications (it helps to prevent cancer to some degree).  Each time a cell is duplicated, part of this telemerase falls off.  Once all the telemerase breaks away, the cell is no longer able to replicate.  Once this happens across enough cells in the body, the animal is more susceptible to death.

Now, this use of telemerase is an evolutionary advantage - it helps keep animals alive long enough to reproduce and care for young.  That means that, among many other factors, these tails can show up in different lengths or not at all in different animals.

If a trait (such as a dog dying after 15 years) doesn't interfere with its ability to reproduce and spread its genes, then it will not affect its prevalence in the population.  Similarly, if another animal doesn't have programmed cell death but it doesn't cause say, cancer, to the point of preventing it to reproduce, then it will continue to live longer lives.

On another note, dogs are pack animals while turtles are solitary.  On top of that, they're warm blooded and require massive amounts more energy to stay alive than a cold-blooded turtle.  If dogs aren't programmed to die after so long, then their populations continue to increase at potentially unsustainable rates (at least unsustainable for their immediate environment, considering that dogs aren't able to import food from every corner of the globe, if need be).

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_and_celebrities),...

&gt; Recruiting Scientologist celebrities and getting them to endorse Scientology to the public at large has always been very important to the Church of Scientology. Scientology has had a written program governing celebrity recruitment since at least 1955, when L. Ron Hubbard created ""Project Celebrity"", offering rewards to Scientologists who recruited targeted celebrities.

&gt; The Church of Scientology operates special Celebrity Centres. Scientology policy governs the Celebrity Centres (the main one in Los Angeles and others in Paris, Nashville, and elsewhere), stating that ""one of the major purposes of the Celebrity Centre and its staff is to expand the number of celebrities in Scientology."" (Scientology Flag Order 2310) Another order describes Celebrity Centre's Public Clearing Division and its goal, ""broad public into Scientology from celebrity dissemination""; this division has departments for planning celebrity events and routing the general public onto Scientology services as a result of celebrity involvement.

&gt; As founder L. Ron Hubbard put it: ""Celebrities are very Special people and have a very distinct line of dissemination. They have comm[unication] lines that others do not have and many medias [sic] to get their dissemination through."" (Flag Order 3323, 9 May 1973)",null,4,cdpsrxg,1rqf3h,explainlikeimfive,hot,17

misanthrope82,"Guns are classified according to their action and their caliber.  The types of action for long guns (carbines, rifles and shotguns) are Pump, Lever, Semi-automatic, break barrel, Bolt action, Revolver, and automatic.  Pump guns require the operator to pull the fore end grip back then push it forward to chamber the next round.  Lever is where the operator has to pull a lever down then back up to chamber the next round.  Revolver (very few long guns use this) is a cylinder that holds generally 5 rounds that rotates every time the trigger is pulled, and can be fired either single or double action (cocked or un-cocked).  Break barrel is usually a single or double shot gun (rarely triple) that requires the user to open a hinge that exposes the spent shells to be replaced with new rounds.  Semi-automatic is a gun that has either a magazine or an internal magazine that fires every time the trigger is pulled until it is out of ammunition, fully automatic is the same except it fires in either burst or full auto as long as the trigger is depressed.  Bolt action has a magazine (detachable or internal) that every time it is fired the user has to unlock the bolt, pull it back to eject a shell then push forward to chamber a new round.

For Pistols, the same rules apply, they just have no stock to shoulder, and they have shorter barrels.  All of the same actions apply (I can't think of any pump, lever or bolt action ones but that does not mean they do not exist).

There are also black powder/muzzleloaders.  These are single shot guns that do not use a cartridge, are loaded from the firing end and require an external ignition source, like a percussion cap or a flint striker.  

Now to the numbers.  These indicate the caliber of the firearms.  Caliber is the diameter of the projectile in inches.  .22 is 0.22 inch diameter bullet.  .223 is a 0.223 inch bullet (5.56 mm).  The confusing part comes with the types of ammunition.  There are a bunch of different .45s.  There is .45 ACP, which is used in semi-automatic .45s and a very few .45 revolvers.  There is .45 long colt, used in revolvers.  There is .45 Heavy, or Buffalo, used in revolvers.  There is 45-70Government, used in big rifles and gatling guns.  then there is the big guy, the .454 Casul.  It is basically the magnum .45, only to be used in revolvers specifically marked for its use.  a lot of calibers are like this, so if you are buying ammunition for a gun for the first time, do not assume just because it says .357 that it will shoot in a .357 revolver.

The caliber (.22, etc) is the measurement, in inches, of how wide the bullet is. Some bullets are measured the same way, but in millimeters instead of inches.

monkeiboi,"A handgun is a firearm that typically wielded and fired by ""one hand"", although this is not technically accurate, the general concept is that the weapon is designed to be gripped by one hand. A revolver, as mentioned below, is a handgun in which the cartridges or shot is carried in a cylindrical ""wheel"" that rotates either by manual manipulation( single action) or by action of pulling the trigger (double action) and moves the next round into position to be fired. The other type of handgun is referred to as an ""automatic"" or ""semi-automatic"" handgun. (With semi-automatic being the more accurate term). In this design the weapon functions by automatically cycling the next cartridge into the chamber by using the force of expelled gases to eject a spent casing and load a fresh one, typically from a spring loaded magazine. Most of these fire one round per pull of the trigger (hence SEMI-automatic). Handguns that fire multiple rounds with each pull of the trigger are generally referred to as machine pistols. Handguns fire ""pistol"" rounds, which are generally shorter and sometimes fatter than rifle rounds. Bullets have a lower velocity and shorter range, consistent with their intended function.

A rifle, is a firearm that is designed to be wielded and fired with two hands, has rifling in the barrel, and fires a full size or intermediate sized cartridge.  

A shotgun is also a two handed firearm,but distinct from a rifle in that it usually has a smooth bore barrel (although rifled shotguns are common) and designed to fire ""shot"" (many small pellets, birdshot may have hundreds of bb sized pellets, where 00 buckshot is nine .30 cal lead pellets. any variation like that you can think of) or slug rounds, which are thick heavy bullets. The distiction is that shotgun rounds generally do not fit snugly in barrel when traveling out, like a rifle. (A rifled shotgun allows the shooter to fire a smooth slug sized bullet, with performance similiar to a rifle because it is a tighter fit) Shotguns are beneficial in that one shotgun can fire shot, slugs, or basically anything that will fit in the barrel, but always have a shorter range and velocity than a rifle.

Healthcare costs, in general, but especially in the US are greatly inflated. The insurance companies refuse x number of claims, which then go unpaid in one way or another; either the company doesn't pay, or the patient can not afford it after the claim is denied. 
Because of this, X number of procedures/medications/etc that have already been administered are not going to be paid for. So to compensate they raise prices on everything else. Those that do pay are offsetting the cost of those that cannot. 
Mainly this applies to hospitals, if you show up in the ER they WILL treat you regardless of your ability to pay. Treatment first, ask questions later.

The manufacturer and insurers in the US.  The pharmacist, the delivery guy.  

But also the 10 dollars you're paying in South Africa may in part be a tax writeoff for the company (they're selling it below cost) or they're manufacturing it locally with local quality control - which is good enough for africa but if you want to do quality control in the US or Europe you have to pay US or EU labour rates and that sort of thing drives up costs.

Poor countries (including South Africa) have basically told the drug companies that they cannot afford patents.  If you make a drug that saves lives you'll sell it for next to nothing or they'll ignore the patent, make it themselves and then the manufacturer will get nothing at all.

Drug production itself isn't very expensive, for most drugs, the big costs are in R&amp;D.  Companies make their money back by having patents and charging basically whatever they want.  But patents are up to a country, and South Africa has no obligation to grant drug patents at all.  

As a practical reality this system wouldn't be sustainable, the people doing R&amp;D all need to get paid and for every successful new drug there are a lot of dead ends in research that need to be paid for.

The nasal septum is what separates the sinuses into your left and right nostril. A deviated septum can cause trouble breathing because it will physically block either the left or right airway. I'm not a doctor, but my guess is that your deviated septum is not very severe, otherwise you would have trouble breathing all the time.

If it only happens at night, it probably is just the result of the fact you are lying down. In this position, without the help of gravity, it is much harder for mucus to drain down into your stomach, so it is possible for it to build up in your nasal passages causing congestion. This effect could be amplified by a deviated septum.

Second the memory Apple uses is much more robust. Solid state memory has a certain number of reads and writes before it gives out. Apple uses the best memory they reasonably can. If an SD card goes bad, you shrug and moan the loss of a few files. But losing all the files on an iPhone is potentially much worse. At the very least it bricks the phone until it can be replaced.

so_I_says_to_mabel,"Ok, so I did a lot of H NMR work during my undergrad, but it has been a while. The nuclei of all atoms have specific properties given their specific make up, this includes isotopes of individual atoms. When you put atomic nuclei in a magnetic field, they can absorb and re-emit radiation of specific wavelengths (frequency). 

The wavelength of the radiation they can absorb is determined by the strength of the magnetic field they are in and the magnetic properties of the nuclei themselves.

So NMR spectroscopy works by putting nuclei in a magnetic field of known strength and hit it with radiation of a known wavelength. You then measure the emission of any radiation from the nuclei. When it is detected you have the magnetic field strength and the wavelength of radiation absorbed (and emitted) so you are able to determine the magnetic properties of the nuclei. Which tells us which nuclei or nuclei group for the case of complex molecules is present.

Edit: Sometimes I find formula helpful, this isn't actually a mathematical formula, just a relationship between the information, basically: N= Nuclei specific magnetic properties, W= wavelength of the radiation absorbed/emitted, and M= strength of the magnetic field.

What reddit does is tally all of the up and down votes. For every upvote 1 point is awarded to a post. For every downvote 1 point is taken away. Then reddit organizes everything in nice little tabs, labeled: top, new, hot, controversial, old.

Top sorts all the comments by number from top to bottom. So the very best comment will be at the top of the list, and the very worst comment will be at the votom of the list.

New sorts all of the comments based on when they were added to reddit. This post was 12 minutes ago and was near the top of the new list.

Hot sorts comments in order of the highest points for the past hour. Reddit does some fancy math and shows you stuff you might like. For instance if you have anfettish for clicking on kitten photos, it will you you kitten photos more often.

Controversial orders comments based off of thier likeability. If my meme gets 100 upvotes and 100 downvotes, its controversial because people like it and dislike it equally.

tibbytime,"This is... debatably not an ELI5 topic, but I'll humor it.

Rap has pretty hard to figure origins. Black culture has never been as well preserved or documented as white culture, so a lot of old stuff is lost. There are some roots going all the way back to Africa, with rhythmic and rhyming storytelling over drum beats. It's hard to say if this REALLY filtered into the modern genre or not, but it probably influenced slaves who influenced the first free blacks who influenced ragtime and then jazz. 

When you get to the jazz generation, you get a lot of Harlem Renaissance poets who started performing poetry over jazz. This didn't directly turn into hip-hop either, but it created a kind of precedent that may have directly or indirectly influenced people who would later make hip-hop. The same can be said of funk in the 1960s- a lot of people would even argue that a few select funk albums might be the earliest rap albums (particularly, ""Here Comes the Judge"").

Most of what we now call rap was born in the 1970s. DJs spinning dance albums- particularly funk, and some dub- would rap over these records, usually improvisationally, to toast someone in celebration, or for comedy. Particularly in New York, DJs became sort of competitive about this, making more complex and stylized rhymes and trying to elevate the game. Eventually you started getting people writing original lyrics to match with older beats, and even further down the road, you got people who started recording their stuff.

After that, the rest is pretty easy to figure out.",null,0,cdpv1ia,1rqjy6,explainlikeimfive,hot,3
