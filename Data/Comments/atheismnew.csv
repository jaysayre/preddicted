Borealismeme,"&gt; We can only deny a god that we know the specific traits of.

**A** specific trait.  One impossible trait is sufficient, we need not complicate matters with additional traits once we find one (or two mutually exclusive) that cannot be.  That said, we are not prevented from making a probability assessment based on any trait, impossible or otherwise.  Worth noting that ""denying"" isn't part of the definition that most of us use to describe our atheism.

&gt; So ask this question (to define the characteristics of the entity we are discussing) before admitting there is a small chance that a god exists. 

While this is certainly practical advice, it's not really required.  It just means that if what we're talking about is vaguely defined we likely won't be able to come to any meaningful conclusion about it.  Could some freaky thing exist?  Well sure, but ""freaky"" is vague.  Do you mean one of the known existing freaky things (like Ru Paul, or Michael Flatley's feet) or some vague as yet unmentioned freaky thing.

God through members of the clan found it, killed Achan, his wife, his kids, his relatives, and his livestock.

So, how is that limited?  Well, of most importance to the folks here, it does not include the option for no gods.  The focus is on the path to god.  There isn't even a philosophical angle -- like many deists and pantheists hold -- that allows the concept of a god to be used while the individual does not claim anything beyond the concept.

We thought we knew how GRBs work, and the types of patterns that we would see. This one is showing different patterns and intensities at times where we would not expect to see them, which means that the ideas about how GRBs actually do work needs to be revised.

BuccaneerRex,"I grew up in a secular household, but in the US you can't really avoid Christianity. I think one of the reasons I've remained unconvinced by any religion is due to a set of Children's Encyclopedias my uncle bought from a door-to-door salesman when I was around 5 or so.

I don't remember the publisher, or anything about the actual encyclopedia set. What I remember is that along with the reference volumes were some additional books: A book of Greco-Roman mythology, with beautiful classic artwork, and a book of Bible Stories that were illustrated the same way. Because they were published by the same company, they were written in much the same way. Instead of being traditional chapter/verse, the Bible stories went through the whole book, and basically wrote out the stories in prose form, without pulling punches or glossing over the details. 

So I had an early 'comparative religion' course right there. I read both sets of mythologies, and didn't find much difference between them. I grasped very quickly that the idea of a deity is just a way to explain the unknown that happens around us, and that the more we learn about how reality actually works, the less need there is for a deity to explain it.

So I asked my mom one day, when I was around 6 or 7 what God was. Her answer was ""It's what some people think explains why the world is here. But there are other explanations that work better.""",null,1,cdkjqa4,1r7t2m,atheism,new,4

Then, when I moved out of the house and started reading atheist literature, I read Why I am not a Christian... it was like every argument I had ever heard for the existence of God had been taken apart in a much more eloquent manner than I was able to utilize.

When I was 11, my best friend died from an asthma attack, and my grandmother took me twice to see wakes of her friends who had died. As a teen, I volunteered in a nursing home and everday people were dying. 

I think death is one of the main things that determines someone's religiousity. Every person I have known who is really religious, as in they pray, go to church and are hard core spiritual has a story of how they were confronted it seems spontaneously with the realization of their own mortality. A beloved relative or friend died, or they were drug addicts or alcoholics...they all have some story like this. I think that until they had such an experience, they never gave a single thought to how short and precious life, they never gave a thought to the fact that one day they would be dead. Luckily, I was eased into this realization from a young age, and had family members who told me the truth rather than saying that the people who had died ""went to heaven"" or some other thing.

proraver,"By satanist do you mean a member of the Church of Satan, or someone that actually worships Satan? Atheism is the lack of belief in a diety, not a lack of belief in Magik, or the supernatural.  

In LaVeyan Satanism there are two main types of Magic, Greater Magic and Lesser Magic. Greater Magic involves ritual and ceremony to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. Lesser Magic consists of non-ritual or manipulative magic, through use of natural abilities to manipulate other humans, and therefore circumstances, by wile and guile. At the forefront of this effort, according to Anton LaVey, is knowledge of how to employ appearances to one's advantage.",null,1,cdkhzd1,1r807b,atheism,new,4

It's metaphors  like psychic vampires are manipulates that  use psychology to  get what they want from you.

LaVey seems to have believed in his life that people required a dose of  these sort of  imaginative  thoughts placed upon the natural world.

These facts would only be possible with the great expansion.

What this of course does not match up to is any  preexisting religion on the planet.   So we know that all religions that try to make a claim on how existence came to be are incorrect.

If I don't provide you with the demonstration, you would be right to tell me I can't teleport and I would be wrong to tell you to prove that I can't teleport.

beer_demon,"&gt; as an atheist, do you ever struggle with believing what you believe?  

Sure.  Atheism is just the absence of a god, it is not the contrary of any other belief, it doesn't mean certainty or even skepticism.  If you think life entails a spirit, a force, an energy or some soul that remains after death or even continues in a sort of resurrection, as long as you don't see this as an effect of a creator or controlled by a deity you are still technically an atheist.  Several atheists are ex-christians that have a rebellious, arrogant, skeptic or even resentful towards religion and anything that resembles it.  Some even think atheism is a kind of informal science or philosophy degree.  It is not.  

The best you can do is read about the phenomena that caught your curiosity (death? afterlife?  ghost apparitions? UFOs?) and spend some time reflecting on it and reading opposing beliefs with as open a mind as you can.  If at the end you still have doubts that means you have been successful.

Zamboniman,"&gt;as an atheist, do you ever struggle with believing what you believe?

Not really, no.

But, I suspect you are using the word 'believe' to mean something slightly different than I am using it.

I 'believe' things are true because of empirical evidence, understanding, and direct experience. For example, I believe the world is round because of the evidence provided by massive amounts of data and my own experiences of seeing photos and pictures from the moon and in orbit as well as my own eyes seeing the curving horizon when I was at a *very* high altitude.

But, I don't struggle with this. There are aspects to my internal model of reality that don't jibe with actual reality. I guarantee it. This is because of the fact I have faults, am imperfect, and my mental model is my best attempt to make everything fit, not absolute knowledge.

Once I see evidence that shows me aspects of this model are wrong, I change the model.

That's it. No struggle. Just awareness that I may be wrong at times. I hold my understanding of reality based on the best empirical evidence I have, and must always be prepared to change the model as new evidence rolls in.

Santa_on_a_stick,"&gt; as an atheist, do you ever struggle with believing what you believe?

Short answer? No. The things I ""believe"" in are based entirely on empirical, objective evidence. 

When I was a Christian, there was a time I had no issues at all with my belief. Then as I got older I started going through the all to common ""I'm struggling with my faith"", and everyone in the church said ""This is normal, it's god testing you, etc etc"". I thought it was perfectly reasonable to have these sort of crisis-in-faith moments. It wasn't until I shed religion that I realized that this was the *only* area in my life where it was ""normal"", and that this kind of struggle is unnecessary in real life. In fact, the struggle is pretty indicative of a flawed belief system in the first place. 

&gt; how do you or other atheists handle the ideas that there may be things that are inexpiable, or unobservable?

I don't really believe things in the sense you're talking about.

None of that has anything to do with ""belief"". Belief is an irrational, emotional response. Facts - things proved through scientific evidence - do not require belief.

Sure, there are things that we can't yet explain or observe. Absolutely! There are!

How I personally handle that is with an immense sense of wonder and, importantly, curiosity to discover those explanations, to observe what we haven't yet seen.

That's the really cool part about being an atheist and a scientist. I am perfectly free to say, ""I don't know; let's figure it out!"" rather than being chained to, ""My hubris *requires* me to know, therefore God,"" and being happy to leave it at that.",null,0,cdkngd5,1r8ejz,atheism,new,1

orange4boy,"The biggest struggles with belief I had growing up all had to do with the catholic church. I'm now an atheist but I never fully believed in any of the stuff I was taught. The more I thought about it all the less logical and credible it all seemed. 

There are so many contradictions in Christian dogma that I slowly realized that if there was a god It was a very confused, abusive, changeable, illogical, hateful and callous god. 

If you hurt a child you would be considered at least a sinner if not a criminal but by Christian definition a child in pain is part of 
""god's plan"". According to dogma, He directed it and intended his plan to happen. How can god be perfect if he intentionally hurts people? If he can act to stop suffering but will not in order to teach us a lesson he is neglectful and abusive. If humans live to a higher standard to their god then is not a god at all. 

When an atheist does something barbaric there is no excuse and they have to take responsibility for their actions and live with the guilt and consequences. People are a lot less forgiving and trustful that god and for good reason. A Christian can simply ask for forgiveness from his imaginary god and he is absolved. Of anything. That's not justice, that's a type of group psychopathy.

I honestly think that the old testament god was simply an invention to justify abuse and control of a population of stone age farmers and to justify the military conquest of the neighboring tribes. It gave the rulers dominion over the people and a way to motivate reluctant and good people to kill and rape.

Anyone who has to try to pretzel their mind to try to reason with these ideas is truly handicapped by them.

Dudesan,"The suffix ""-phobia"" typically indicates an irrational or unjustified fear or hatred, but the term ""Islamophobia"" is used overwhelmingly to describe *justified* criticism. Something like 90% of the time the accusation is made, it is as a juvenile invective, comparable to calling someone a ""Big stupid doo-doo head!"". It's the remaining ~10% of cases that give the term any credibility at all, but which also provide the sharpest contrast to demonstrate when its use is inappropriate.

Unfortunately, there actually *are* some rednecks, chavs, and assorted white supremicists who don't understand the difference between ""Muslims"" and ""Brown People"", and who really *are* motivated by base xenophobia and ingroup/outgroup effects rather than by any actual objections to Islam itself. Indeed, most of these xenophobes *agree* with hardline Islam on subjects such as the rights of women, the separation of Church and State, the validity of the Scientific Method, whether it's okay to go to war because your Holy Man claims that the voices in his head command you to, and all the things that most ""Islamophobes"" actually take issue with. You need look no farther than the Republican Party to find a wide assortment of such people.

The word is mostly thrown around because certain people would like to silence any and all criticism of Islam, no matter how grounded in fact that criticism may be. They seek to accomplish this by pretending that the above-mentioned rednecks are the **only** people who could possibly dislike anything about Islam for any reason, lumping it all into the category of ""Islamophobia"". By this logic, anyone who objects to child marriages, or to *being raped* being punished more harshly than *actually committing rape*, or to demanding the death penalty for victimless ""crimes"" like blasphemy, or to enthusiastic and near-constant endorsements of violent ""martyrdom"", **must therefore be a racist**. The fact that none of these topics have *anything to do* with race is ignored, and frequently dismissed with some bafflegab about ""culture"". These people either cannot understand the difference between ""phobia"" and ""legitimate criticism"", or choose to ignore it when it is inconvenient to them. It's especially worrying that some of the people engaging in this dishonesty are not even Muslims themselves, but that's a topic for a separate rant.

This is a classic example of the false dilemma, ""You're either with us or you're with our enemies!"". It's roughly equivalent to suggesting that, since Adolf Hitler hated Joseph Stalin, it is impossible to disagree with Stalin on any issue without being a Nazi– even if that issue is something upon which Hitler and Stalin agreed, such as [whether it is appropriate to solve your problems with genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor).

taterbizkit,"This is a great first step, but that's all it is.  The judge's order stays enforcement until after the entire appeals process is completed.  That could take years.

Also, oddly, the FFRF's summary in the linked article seems to have misread the opinion.  The judge only ruled on 107(2), and did not rule on 107(1).  The article treats this as a victory over both exemptions.  There are good reasons to believe that 107(1) is constitutional, despite this opinion. (**Edit**: I misread FFRF's summary.  They make the distinction properly.)

107(1) allows exemption of the rental value of a home provided *to* a clergyperson.  Home is owned by the church, minister pays no rent.

107(2) allows deduction of a rental stipend paid by the church to the minister, who then pays rent on a home not owned by the church.

107(1) parallels an existing IRS policy allowing exemption of the value of a company-provided home, if having the employee live in company-owned housing is for the convenience of the company.  Applying this rule to clergy is *less* discriminatory than applying it only to business employees.

Anyhow, as frequently occurs with these cases, whether or not this ruling is valid may turn on the **standing** issue.  To have standing to sue the government requires that you have suffered an actual, factual, injury.  You have to have incurred a harm, or been denied a benefit.  Even if a law is blatantly, absurdly, comically unconstitutional, you have to have been injured by it to sue over it.  Silly, but that's how it works.

Being denied a tax exemption provided to others *is* a harm as a matter of law, so as long as the FFRF plaintiffs have been denied the exemption, they have standing.

What's not clear, unfortunately, is *whether or not* they have been denied.  The Government claims that they haven't been denied in-fact because they never claimed it on their tax returns.  The Plaintiffs argue that the tax code on its face makes it illegal to claim the benefit, thus operates as a denial of that benefit.  This is exactly the kind of semantic nuance that judges use to reach the outcome they like the best.

If an appellate judge (or SCOTUS justice) wants to, they can fatuously claim that as a purely technical matter, the benefit hasn't been denied because they never claimed it.  This would defeat standing, and the case would be dismissed *regardless of the merits of the plaintiff's arguments*.  Even though it could constitute a felony (perjury, tax evasion, etc) to claim the exemption, the court could rule that not claiming it defeats standing.

The judge addresses this point in the opinion, that this would have the effect of allowing an unconstitutional law to be un-challengeable, because it would be impossible to gain standing to challenge it.  Unfortunately, this kind of thing does happen.

One obvious problem with 107(2) is that it applies the deduction to ""ministers of the gospel"" -- which is pretty obviously an endorsement of religion.  Long before this case reached a final conclusion, it's possible that Congress would simply change the language of 107(2) to something more neutral, that would preserve the exemption in a way that is superficially constitutional but still manages to exclude non-clergy.

tl;dr:  **Don't hold your breath, folks.**  I doubt very much that this order is going to result in any clergymember or church paying more in taxes than they do now.  There are too many ways to get around this.

**""But it's unfair, other leaders and individuals who help just as much aren't given the same break!""**

Actually, yes they are. Pastor housing is subsidized under the e.451 clause of the non-profit partnership act, specifying that any non-profit founder or direct privilege employee is eligible for this subsidized housing. The act used to specify Christian church leaders only, but expanded to cover other religions, and eventually all non-profits which fall under certain community-based criteria. 

But if r/atheism has their way, the government will just tell them: ""Oh, well you could have had subsidized housing...until we discovered your organization is Christian.

Lovecraft, Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Charles G. D. Roberts, but I also have an interest in shamanism, spirit possession/mediumship, reiki, yoga, and so on.. my favourite philosopher is Rudolf Otto who theorized that the gothic horror story elicits a sensation of daemonic-dread, the sensation of shivers or the creeps, hair standing on end and so on, that was sui generis in a class by itself , a unique human empathy felt in apprehension of the idea of the spectral. and that it was in a way psychic bootcamp and could be used as a form of temporal distortion to commune with spirits. 

I'm an English major and my passion is for weird supernatural horror fiction, and daemonic-dread is what Otto called the weird supernatural horror fiction 'buzz', the ""given sensation"" elicited by the best weird fiction so heralded by H. P. Lovecraft, one of the most famous atheists and roman pagans.

and yeah, I'm really against secularism myself because I enjoy fantasy fiction and mystical occult writing . I'm a medium myself.

best description of my cosmological understanding of the universe would be atheist panentheist

A panentheism which posits that there is a divine spark within 'creation' . Pantheism is the idea that the divine is the universe. Panentheism differs in a gnostic sense that the universe is profane, but that behind a veil was a numinous energy, from an Other-World, in a way, that can irrupt into our 'fallen' world of matter. 

this is present in Lovecraft's fiction, the idea that the world is normal, until the ineffable irrupts into our world and displaces common human knowledge with a divine insight which was debilitating in its intensity

Our own conversion came at last. We began to stir against slavery. Hearts grew soft, here, there, and yonder. There was no place in the land where the seeker could not find some small budding sign of pity for the slave. No place in all the land but one - the pulpit. It yielded at last; it always does. It fought a strong and stubborn fight, and then did what it always does, joined the procession - at the tail end. Slavery fell. The slavery text remained; the practice changed, that was all.

However, Weinberg was speaking of religion in general, not specifically of Christianity.

This is the paragraph with the pertinent quote:

&gt; Where religion did make a difference, it was more in support of slavery than in opposition to it. Arguments from scripture were used in Parliament to defend the slave trade. Frederick Douglass told in his Narrative how his condition as a slave became worse when his master underwent a religious conversion that allowed him to justify slavery as the punishment of the children of Ham. Mark Twain described his mother as a genuinely good person, whose soft heart pitied even Satan, but who had no doubt about the legitimacy of slavery, because in years of living in antebellum Missouri she had never heard any sermon opposing slavery, but only countless sermons preaching that slavery was God's will. With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil, that takes religion. ",null,0,cdks0f7,1r8vla,atheism,new,1

Dudesan,"&gt;but i cant seem to find any proof that god dosent exist,

I think you might benefit from familiarizing yourself with the concept of [the burden of proof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KayBys8gaJY).

Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. 

If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. 

If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.

&gt;Sexual harassment is a subjective analysis. If a woman feels put in a position of apprehension for her safety and if she feels like that she is being sexually harassed ... it is sexual harassment for a women in an area where she has a right to privacy and where men should stay out; just because somebody calls themselves a female, objectively he is a male! He will always be a male, just because you go through some kind of sex change mutilation surgery and cosmetic surgery and change your outward appearance.

First a quick tip: a whole lot of the beginning of your post seems off-topic. You could have cut out the Lego bits, for instance, and still have gotten your point across. Why discuss your kindergarten, your move to the city, the accusations of drugs? Your post is long enough that I worry many people who would otherwise help won't bother reading it.

&gt; How did you, fellow atheists, approach these questions of existence?

It's okay that there is no cosmic purpose to existence. I get to choose my own purpose. My life is mine to live, however I want. Personally, I try to learn as much as I can, have as much fun as I can, and make the world as good a place as I can. Why? Because these things make me happy, nothing more. Do whatever you want (though keep in mind the consequences; spending the future penniless, friendless, and in jail would probably suck). This life is yours to live however you see fit. That's pretty awesome, isn't it?

&gt; How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all you've believed was... false?

I admit, it's hard (and it sounds like you have it much harder than I did). It gets easier over time. You'll become more comfortable with your new outlook on life, and as the old one recedes into the past, it seems less and less important.

&gt; How did you deal with this sense of insignificance?

This is a very common question, and one which I think a lot of people get backwards. The universe is amazing and interesting and complicated and wonderful, and I feel privileged to be a part of it. This life is the only shot at existence that I get; I need to make it count. To [quote Richard Dawkins](http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/91-to-live-at-all-is-miracle-enough):

&gt; We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.

You might be interested in listening to [Letting Go of God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri3-DpSn7AA) by Julia Sweeney.

She discusses tensions with her religious parents, and raising children and mourning death without religion. It's funny, it's poignant, it's thoughtful.",null,2,cdktuoi,1r92wd,atheism,new,9
frontseatdog,"There's this thing called tl;dr..  Seriously, I'm not unsympathetic but a summary with a clear statement of whatever questions you're posing would be greatly helpful.

I think it boils down to this:

&gt; How did you, fellow atheists, approach these questions of existence? How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all you've believed was, if you were not born to atheist parents, false? How did you deal with this sense of insignificance? the idea that everything needs a ""beginning"" and an ""end""?

Frankly, I've never been bothered by the reality of my, nor the human race's, existence.  Although I was born to a Christian family, I never believed in anything supernatural (I thought they were joking.)  This leaves me at a real disadvantage in assisting someone with your question - it is a common question, after all.  I have to hope that those who were once religious can fill this particular gap in my skill set.

For what it's worth, I find [NDT's comments on this topic fairly aligned with my own.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D05ej8u-gU)  My apologies if it seems cliche.  Almost all religions want you to believe that we are big fish (in a little pond) and not little fish (in a big pond), but I'm just happy to be a fish at all - as compared to an amoeba or a rock.  We're the most amazing development of nature that's ever been discovered - shouldn't that be enough?",null,3,cdktp18,1r92wd,atheism,new,4
ca3799,"I just attended a book discussion at my local UU church that touched on some of your questions. The book under discussion was ""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Frankel.

I think what I took away from that discussion  was 'the meaning (not the purpose of life- that's a different question. One group member said the purpose was strictly biological, as in reproduction) of life is making meaning of life.'

Or, the meaning of your life is to make something meaningful of your life.

Frankel, a psychiatrist (and neurologist!) who survived the German concentration camps, thought that the meaning of his life was in helping others find meaning in theirs and he developed a psychoteraputic tool he called Logotherapy. He noted that those who lost hope or a vision of the future were more likely to succumb to the rigors of concentration camp life.

My feeling is that I won't live happily-ever-after in some gilded heaven or unhappily-ever-after in a torturous hell, so I only have this brief time to enjoy this amazing live I have and to help others enjoy theirs. True, my impacts won't last generations (actually my kids and my work may last a while), be recorded in history books, or change the world in major ways, but that doesn't bother me at all or make my tasks feel less important. It just makes me want to make more efforts so my impacts can be felt here and now.

I get my primary fulfillment from my very small family. Many are not so fortunate to have that. I try to focus on relationship and community. 

I also found fulfilling work that makes a real difference in other people's lives (nursing) and a fulfilling hobby that does this as well (running a community garden, teaching others to do so, and then and donating to the food bank). I think if you can't heal or feed one hundred, just try to heal or feed one. Even when healing won't happen, I can help ease the loss in a kind and professional way. I use the garden to allow others to contribute, too. 

So, best wishes to you! I recommend finding something that fills you up and that you can share with others. Relationship and community.

If you're telling me that it is better that the entire ""purpose"" of this life is simply to audition for the next life, then that to me is the true lack of purpose. This life is nothing, except for a test to get into the next one. I like the purpose of raising my 3 year old to be the best man he can be much better than the purpose of using this life as a try-out for the next one. What kind of purpose is that?

Sekret_One,"* How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all you've believed was, if you were not born to atheist parents, false?

You feel betrayed, and I do not think that is an inappropriate feeling. But there two ways you can approach learning: in fear an embarrassment, believing that each lesson just highlights your ignorance, or as a celebration, a thrill that there is something that you never even conceived of.

The old world is shattered. True It was familiar, with clear edges, simple rules ... that didn't work, and hatreds that didn't make sense. The world turns out to be a lot bigger, with a lot more properties than the little one. And the rules all seem to be a bit more... nerdy ... less ""gays are all evil"" and more ""matter cannot be created or destroyed"". Seems a bit fairer, though, don't it?

*  How did you deal with this sense of insignificance?

I am a small man. I will never eat all the food in the world. Does that make eating inconsequential? Do I not taste if I don't taste everything?

It is less scary when you get over the shock of not being in the center of the universe, and instead be part of the universe.

Personally, I can't see anything making me feel more insignificant than being created solely to acknowledge something else. Particularly when that something is insists on testing me when it already knows the answer, and baulks if I test it, when I don't know.

* the idea that everything needs a ""beginning"" and an ""end""? 

I wonder how baffled earlier mankind still applied 'beginning and end' to the surface of the Earth and found out it was a sphere. That Earth didn't really have 'edges'. The answer may be in the scope of a question we haven't even asked. But we can find answers, and that's exciting. But you can only find answers if you ask questions, and don't assume you're right.

The most harmful thing Christianity does is it instills this notion that everything you *need* to know is between the pages. It pretends that all that is unknown is unknowable. Yet we keep figuring stuff out.

It's startling to have the familiar fall away and see what appears to be an huge, unbound expanse. But trust me, that confusing but cozy place is nothing, nothing compared to what's actually out there. It's not a void. It's filled with people, strange plants, weird food, music reverberating on strings, vocal cords, drums and GUI displays, an internet that can freaking connect you to people on the other side of the world in a fraction of a second, moons in a perpetual state of falling, bacteria living without oxygen butted up against volcanic vents, blue whales, a genetic marker named after Sonic the HedgeHog, cartoons, robotic limbs, and corgis.",null,0,cdkvt7o,1r92wd,atheism,new,1

Seekin,"&gt;How did you deal with this sense of insignificance?

I got the fuck over myself.  I let go of my ego and faced reality honestly and forthrightly.  Frankly, the entire history of science can be thought of as deflating the ego of a species which calls itself *Homo sapiens*.  The earth doesn't stand still with the rest of the universe centered on it.  Our planet isn't the center of the universe.  It's not even the center of our solar system.  The earth wasn't made to suit us, we were shaped by evolution to fit it.  We are not separate from the rest of the living world, we are an inextricably linked part of it.  We are not the center, we are a fortunate by-product.

So my experiences aren't of cosmic or eternal significance.  Waah.  I still get to experience them.  I get to eat donuts.  I get to have sex.  I get to hug my young daughters as I tuck them into bed.  For a (very short) while I got to be so poor that I couldn't afford sufficient food for myself.  I get to wonder whether I made the best choices in life and regret the people I know I've hurt.  I get to experience all the really cool stuff and all the really shitty stuff.  The fact that it's ephemeral makes it all the more precious and poignant to me.

This life isn't just a warm up or a prelude or a proving ground.  This is it.  This is all we get so we'd better make it as good as we can figure out how to.  For me that's family, friends, food, regret, strife, perseverance, loss, learning and love.  How lucky are we to get to experience all of that?",null,0,cdkyr09,1r92wd,atheism,new,1
DIEZEL59,"Sometimes I stare up at the stars on clear nights and I try to imagine [how fast I am moving through space at that moment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3p3K06dth4)  Along the earth's surface as it rotates around it's axis, the earth revolving around the sun, the sun moving through the galaxy, the galaxy rotating about itself.  It always gives me a bit of perspective and makes me feel connected to our world as a whole.  I like to imagine all the other planets out there in the universe flying around different directions at massive speeds just like us  and I wonder how many of them have someone/something else looking up thinking about the same things.

For me, living life without a god is about experiencing everything in the present.  I make up my own mind about things and do what I want because it's what I feel is right.  You'd be surprised how many people have blind faith in the church/state/news. This is obviously a very personal set of ideals and if you're inherently a good/bad person you're going to do good/bad things. 

I can imagine it being scary losing a sense of a god guiding and watching you.  I see it as a freedom to make your own existence. Yeah bad things happen sometimes, but it's ultimately up to us to make the best of our lives.  Each of us could have an impact on this world every day if we choose to.  Even something as simple as helping a friend, stranger, or animal.

 I hope you find some people to talk with that can relate with you and let you get things off your chest, It will help.  Our time here is limited and valuable, and I think it's better to spend each day with that realization rather than just waiting to move on to someplace else while thinking someone is pulling all the strings.

What this means is that if the decision is not reversed on appeal, the IRS is barred from granting a tax exemption on extra income provided to a minister specifically apportioned for the paying of a minister's rent or mortgage. 107(1) which was untouched still allows a church to purchase a home and allow the minister to live rent free without reporting the market value of such  rental as part of his taxable income. 

This won't greatly effect most smaller, older, or more rural churches as historically these churches save money on minister salary by paying less and providing a living arrangement by way of a parsonage (often gifted to the church or bought by the church long ago rendering it a free addition for he church to make). Instead what the removal of 107(2) does is to prevent a minister from being able to hide any amount of income that they are able to show was spent on living arrangement, which is far more common among the larger churches which get proportionately more wasteful with increased size and grant ministers unreasonably high sums for their homes essentially allowing the Revruns and T.D. Jakes of the world to live lavish lifestyles while reported relatively little.

***""Readers will find that over the past twenty years, the case for the historical trustworthiness of the Gospels has grown vastly stronger.""***

It is generally considered, among scholars poor form to write your own blurb.

This quote from the blurb of [**The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man by Robert M Price**](http://www.amazon.com/Incredible-Shrinking-Son-Man-Tradition/dp/1591021219/ref=la_B001JPBXS8_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385179873&amp;sr=1-2) provides an interesting contrast;

***""For more than a century scholars have been examining the Gospels and other traditions about the life of Jesus to determine their historical accuracy. Although the results of these scholarly efforts are sometimes controversial, the consensus among researchers today is that the four Evangelists’ accounts cannot be taken at face value. In fact, a team of more than 100 scholars called the Jesus Seminar has come to the conclusion that on average only about 18 percent of the four Gospels is historically accurate.""***

There are two points worthy of note; 

 * Firstly, if you check the link to Amazon you'll note that Price, being a serious scholar uses quotes from published reviews of his books to provide the text for his blurbs. This one is from Freethinker magazine.

 * And secondly, that there is another very scholarly and respected perspective on these issues that is somewhat at odds with the views expressed by apologists such as William Laine Craig, Dinesh De Souza, and of course the very calm and balanced, Craig L. Blomberg.

Now, its not my place to tell you what you should think, or what conclusions you should draw on this issue. Likewise, I don't think you can be fully informed on a given subject until you've got an accurate and sound understanding of both sides of the issue.

Blomberg is as good an author as any to give you a grounding in the subject as it is presented by the modern school of evangelical apologists. Note, though that many scholars who are also Christian disagree.

The above link is as good a place as any to get all you need to know of the other perspective.

Anyone who read both of those books would be in a sufficiently informed position to consider the matter, and draw their own conclusions.

I've included a link below to a Robert M Price youtube video, because he should always be read as he speaks. I've also linked to a few Amazon pages for authors who have written well on the subject.

&gt;Why hello there my Christian friends,   it has come to my attention that you have been placing papers about explaining how you feel that Christ should remain in Christmas.   While myself , fellow atheists, and all heathen kind do not agree  I however do feel that diplomacy is in order.  You Christians are known to be reasonable folk with your crusades,  the holocaust,  genocides of indigenous peoples, and who can forget my personal favorite the inquisition.   But enough admiring your works  let's  cease the flattery and get down to business shall we?

&gt;We shall see to your terms that Christ remains in Christmas and once again becomes the main focus on that holiday.   In return we simply ask that  you return Easter to our pagan allies.    We must after all keep Ishtar in Easter.    Just as we shall focus on Christ during Christmas  you and your Christian ilk shall properly dedicate Easter to Ishtar and  acknowledge the Goddess of fertility.  

&gt;If these terms or acceptable or if you wish to engage in further negotiations I and my heathen brethren greatly look forward to your reply.   Hopefully we can  use this to build a lasting friendship and end the hostilities between our peoples.   Thank you for your time and may god be less.

It's a common trap theists try to use  however is not only easily countered by  our understand of morality  through science on how and why it came to be but  since many theists do not believe in evolution I like to counter it another way.

What people perceive as good and evil changes person to person.   Which shows it is largely a culture  and somewhat of a personal opinion.
Think of a few religions and then look at how drastically they can view certain issues differently.    A modern Christian for example would likely see Mesoamerican  mass human sacrifices to be  immoral,  yet obviously the other side of the fence would see it as a good and moral act.     

But it gets worse for theists as even people of the same faith will often disagree on at-least minor issues  and at times even major issues.    The topic of homosexual rights for example,  you can find that Christians can have a polar opposite opinion on this subject.   Some still think homosexuals should be killed  and they believe this to be the moral thing.  Others will can be completely for homosexual rights and be supportive of the LGBT community and have nothing but love for such people.

Daniellassander,"i will try to be as concise as i can but give me some slack english is not my native language.

There are many reasons why i dont believe in any religion god or gods first and foremost would be that even if we knew one religion was 100% true, how could we possibly know which one if we have to take it on faith? there is no clear way to differentiate between them. and we dont know if one religion is true at all.

Secondly would be that all religions (that i have studied) never has anything in their texts that reveals  something that we still did not know about the universe or the world we live in at the time it was written.

Third would be that most religions holy texts contradicts itself in certain places, so we know for certain that parts are not true/correct there is no way to discern which is the most accurate, and by this we also know that god indeed did not write it.

Fourth if there was a god and he cared about a relationship with us humans he would let us know, with evidence. and if that god had written any holy text we can be quiet sure that it would be unmatched in the literary world, it would be the most perfect thing ever written.

Fifth people of all religions often say that their god talks to them and tells them what to do, if that god was a real god those people would never find themselves at odds with others of their religion as the god would actually tell them the same things.

i can go on almost endlessly about this but there is one thing that stands out more then anything else. science gives us a clear and unbiased way of understanding the natural world we inhabit. it has uncovered that lightning comes from a charge building up in clouds by natural processes (no god there) earthquakes is tensions in the earths crust being released (no god there) volcanoes are magma under pressure bursting through fissures in the ground untill it reaches the surface (no god there) science gives us a way of understanding the world we live in that no religion can give us. and through all the progress of science we have not yet found something that requires a god.

I see it this way:  The odds of us existing on this 'perfect' little planet are pretty lousy.  It has to be worse that trillions to one against.  But, here we are.  Somehow, enough cards fell in the right way that the primordial soup coughed up life and, TaDa!

I'd say that the odds in favor of a god existing are approximately the same: bad.

Also, as an atheist, I don't have a problem with creationism being potentially accurate.  The bible claims that it took her 6 days.  No problem.  Since I have absolutely no idea how to calculate a god day, I have to assume that it involves millions and millions of what we would think of as years.  The bible gets the order fairly accurate.  Nothingness, light, planet, plants and animals, man.  Seems spot-on to me.

I lost my faith when I was around 18 or 19.  Raised Baptist, I had a really hard time resolving some of the contradictions that I was being taught.  Eventually talked to a Jehovah's Witness who told me that many of those contradictions are actually translation errors introduced when King James was in charge.  Rather than offend the king, whenever there was anything ambiguous or controversial, the interpreters would ask the king what to put.  So, the JWs went back to the original text and translated it directly into fairly modern terms.  This is why they don't believe in hell: it was never mentioned in the original texts.  The grave, the burning pit, and the absence of a forever-after somehow translated to eternal damnation in the King James version.  They don't believe in blood transfusions because the original texts very clearly state that one does not consume human blood.

About 8 or 9 months of that and I realized that my problem wasn't getting solved because there was just too many inconsistencies.  I decided that I could accept the possibility of a god but, in no way was I about to believe that this book containing the word of man was accurate and that it was likely that if there *were* a god, for us to try to comprehend it would be like asking a goldfish to speculate a human's motivation.",null,1,cdlbjk0,1raker,atheism,new,2

&gt;5 These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.

Jesus specifically told his disciples not to go to non-Jews.

&gt;13 If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. 14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. 15 Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.

He specifically said that any who are reticent of conversion will be destroyed worse that the fate that happened in Sodom and Gomorrah.

If you are looking for faith your quest is completely different, you will need to find something to reassure you to feel the spiritual connection. In this case I personally suggest something along the lines of being spiritual, that is to say just believe that there is a higher power and don't buy into any specific religion, search for the good parts of religions. If you're looking for the truth on the other hand you need to ask yourself, are you ready to find that there is in fact no higher power and the gods people believe in are just manifestations of psychology?

As for damning people to hell for not believing, it's one of the glaring problems with christianity. Think of if this way, if there were a loving god, he/she/it/they/them would not condemn people for silly stuff, surely. But from a critical perspective, consider that the jewish faith and the old testament has no concept of heaven or hell. And if you read the bible carefully you'll find that nothing jesus said mentions heaven specifically. Jesus spoke of the kingdom of god on earth and the resurrection of corporeal bodies when the time comes. And people are still waiting. Also consider that there is no single interpretation of pretty much anything in the bible. Or it can be seen that way, consider the christians that kill in the name of god despite thou shalt not kill is a commandment from god. Also consider that there are countless churches and denominations, so being right is out of the question, or at least practically out of the question. Since if a truth could be found and presented, it would not make sense to fracture churches.

You don't need a church or a doctrine to be spiritual. And you don't need to have faith in a higher power or spirituality to be good or happy. And if you're looking for the truth you might get surprised, be ready.

Over time evolution just started making more and more sense to me.  Eventually evolution went from being a crazy theory to something I could see everywhere.

While accepting evolution does have to mean you don't believe in god, for me once I fully grasped evolution and could see how our world formed and life came to be the idea of god no longer made sense to me.  

As I moved further away I saw more and more how the bible was not divinely inspired but was clearly written by men, and many of them not very wise.

Daniellassander,"First you need to know something about me, that is that when i was young i asked questions about Everything (yes the capitol E is in correct use) i asked everything i could imagine, why grass was green why it grew why in the summer, why did they not all look the same, why were some shorter then others, why did some grass die etc etc etc you can go on here for as long as you like every question you can imagine just about grass. and i asked these questions about everything in the world, trees houses people asphalt glass and you can just insert every topic you want here.

so my mother thought that when she was young and ""got to knew god"" she had answers to everything and she is more a deist then anything else now but she thought that i would ask less questions and she wanted me to be a spiritual person growing up.

so i went to sunday school as it was called and at first we were allowed to ask questions as the priests or a nun told us stories about god and boy did i have questions, it was so bad they couldnt even complete their stories in the 2 hours we were there. so after a while they told my parents that we couldnt ask questions during the stories but after we could ask questions. and boy did i have questions! why this, why that, why so, why him, why there, why not etc etc.

and what really murdered religion for me in its infancy was the answers to my questions wasnt answers that told me anything, it was answers that required even more questions to sort through. ""god works in mysterious ways"", ""no one knows the mind of god"" these answers to my questions didnt feel right they just opened the door to even more questions.

and at home it grew worse as well, now my parents had to answers questions about god. and boy did i have questions!

so after a while my parents told me that i wouldnt go to sunday school anymore, but my sister still went. and they told me that no one really knew if god existed or if we lived in a world without a god. and that no one really knew the meaning of life. the only answer they had to that question was to grow up, get children, raise your children to be good persons and to try to be kind to other people, and try to find your own meaning of life.

StanFitch,"Here's my EXTREMELY VALUABLE input, I know you've all been waiting with bated breath:

I'm not religious, I don't have anything against religion itself or the people that follow their religion of choice (Assuming they're open minded and don't judge every living creature they encounter, ha ha, right?). I've had my fair share of experiences with several different religions as I was growing up, my parents were very open minded and allowed me to experience all sorts of different religions on my own. I learned very quickly that it just wasn't for me. I would probably consider myself Agnostic or simply Spiritual more than anything else.
As far as our government goes; Buildings, Currency, Monuments, etc. My opinion is there needs to be an absolute separation of Church and State on all fronts, plain and simple. We, as a society (And especially as Redditors) have already seen how chaotic and crazy a religious influence can make even the SIMPLEST OF DECISIONS in our government. For fuck's sake, they can't even wipe their asses without referencing some portion of the Bible that states exactly how many wipes is too many, not enough, and whether you can do it yourself or with someone of the same sex in the same room.
Our politicians can barely act on what is best for the people of this country without involving some flawed concept of Christianity or Catholicism. They can't vote on a simple idea without bringing in the Bible, the Jesus dude, or the big guy God himself. We can't even vote on a simple law to allow marriage to people who love one another, what the fuck is that all about, kids?
Anyway, my point in all this rant is simply that the longer we allow ANY religious references in any of our government activities, the longer we're going to be fighting this religious battle in a government that should not have any religious affiliations whatsoever. If you, as an individual, would like to think that God has his eye on us and is giving us the strength and the power to be a great nation... that's fine by me, do your thing. But DO NOT INTERFERE with what is best for the nation, best for the people, best for the majority, just because the Bible says it's naughty or ill-advised. 90% of what's IN YOUR BIBLE is terrible, evil, insane, outdated nonsense that offends even the religious followers who've failed to do their homework (i.e. Reading the fucking book that came with your choice of religion). The quicker we abolish these references, the quicker we can start to become a nation that focuses on the good of the people. All of the people. Bam, there it is. Chicks n' Midgets!!!

He interweaves this rather skillfully (befitting to his profession) with some some glaring non-sequiturs and errors of fact; for example, personalities and appearance aren't ""random"" - they're caused by an easily understood sequence of events occurring in childhood and gene expression, respectively. Lewis then blindly asserts that it is ""irrational"" for music to be pleasurable, without having any knowledge himself on what scientific reasons there might be for music existing within cultures in the first place, so once again we see argumentum ad ignorantium. Furthermore, he commits a non-sequitur by implying that because it is irrational, you therefore cannot explain it by chance alone - what a load of nonsense! Even if my love for ska music and kittens is inexplicable to me, that doesn't mean I can't appreciate them or that my feelings for them aren't real. He makes an assertion there that really amounts to little more than ignorant opinion.

Moral absolutism: The idea that some actions are immoral no matter the consequences or motive.

postoergopostum,"I've been thinking about a new approach to arguments about morality. Any thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciated.

One of the foundations of just about all religious doctrine is a moral code. Further, most of these doctrines are structured such that these rules are generally raised to a higher status than mere human rules and are regarded by the flock as being far more important and carrying more weight than civil laws.

This is then used as leverage to try and force all of society to conform with their individual ideology. Think of Sharia in the UK, or gay marriage in The US.

Apologists also use our own internal sense of right and wrong as an evidence for God. By claiming that the ideas we hold on the subject of how we should behave are not things that we have been taught or even conclusions we've reached on our own, the assertion is made that this moral law is a feature of The Universe, and it was put there by God.

To make matters worse there is the popular troll that those of us without faith are in some way morally compromised.

To date, we heathen have tried to construct scientific or philosophical justifications for a moral code or sense that is independent, as it must be of a non existent deity.

But what exactly is meant by the term morality?

Like 'spiritual' and so many other popular terms of faith (including faith), the word,morality is a slave to equivocation. Part of the way religious belief is kept unfalsifiable is by using a wide variety key terms ambiguously. If the things you say about your beliefs are confusing and difficult to pin down, let alone understand, then it's much more difficult for that belief to be shown as false.

Words like 'morality' are too loaded. We don't need them, and by using them we are giving too much ground.

As Hitch used to point out, those who are psychopathic, or sociopathic seem to exist without any genuine idea of morality and right or wrong. So morality, as such is not available to everyone.

Instead, let's talk about behaviour.

How human beings behave towards each other is something we can test and measure. There is already a wealth of data, and it feeds in directly to ideas like Harris' thoughts on well being and human flourishing.

We already call the subject, Ethics. It is the scientific study of human social behaviour. We even know where it comes from. Surprisingly, most social conditioning (formerly moral instruction) is carried out by our siblings and peers right from the very beginning of childhood. Fairness is understood the day after we first manage to crawl to the toy box under our own steam.

**TL:DR**
So my position is, to put it succinctly;

There is no such thing as morality. It's a term of ecquivocation, and only serves to cloud the real issue; How should we humans behave towards each other so that we maximise human well being and flourishing.",null,0,cdlepxw,1rava8,atheism,new,1

Your example would not be an example of moral relativism, it's just a confusion of category. Few people would make the broad, categorical assertion that ""it is always immoral to kill"" (this view does exist, but it's rare), usually it's more akin to a view that gratuitous/non-defensive/unjustified killing is immoral.

I mean seriously look at all the people who come here that think that they are making the world better by bashings others beliefs. And all the atheists that think in order to take the next step of our social evolution we have to get rid of a belief in god... Honestly it's these stupid assholes that slow down the progression of our species by putting off greater community work and cooperation so they can feel superior to others by demeaning them and their beliefs. It's a lot easier to feel better about your self by looking down on others and judging them to be at fault then it is to actually try and help/respect those regardless of differences of beliefs. In short many atheists/Christians would rather sit in a position of judgement over others then to get down off their high horse and actually lend a helping hand.

Steven Pinker wrote a great, dense book called ""Religion Explained,"" which you could look at for better answers. He argues that our brains work by making categories for everything so as to better remember it later. We are attracted to supernatural ideas because they fit in some categories they should and shouldn't. A ghost may look like a person, so your brain says ""person category,"" which confuses you when you learn this person walked through a wall without breaking it. 

One would remember this story more easily than, say, an ordinary hunting story. But the hunting story can teach one a lot about hunting. So, ordinary stories and family histories are mixed with supernatural ideas to make them easier to remember and pass to the next generation. He talks about a study in which people were given words to read, and a week later were called back to tell the researchers which ones they remembered. It was always funny-sounding words that were spelled weirdly.

Basically, religion, Pinker argues, is a sort of culturally-specific memory system that eventually became what formed societies and made each group its own. The problem is, God and the supernatural can still exist in this scenario, Pinker only explains how our brains remember things.

Both athiests and religious people, as Tacsol5 aptly pointed out, at the moment depend on faith.

If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. 

If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.

postoergopostum,"The problem you've got is that religious belief is deliberately unfalsifiable for obvious reasons. The respect afforded faith, an assertion held to be true despite all evidence to the contrary means that your friend lives in a universe where the concept of proof as we understand it, does not exist. Further, apologists have sown the field with a host of escape clauses and equivocations.

His faith, like that of all believers is not rational. It's emotional.

Your rationalising and arguing won't deconvert him, and it certainly won't do it quickly.

People do abandon their faiths every day, but it's a long and slow process, and they have to think their way through it themselves. Though you can help. What you need to do is plant ideas in your friend's mind that he will return to and contemplate carefully over time. Being a delusion, the way to shatter it is to generate cognitive dissonance. I like to call them doubt engines, because once they're well planted, they just keep generating doubt. More effective than statements or arguments are questions, asked in earnest, with the full expectation carried on over time that a reasonable answer should be forthcoming.

Look I've got a question about Christianity that I'm having a hard time with. Correct me if I'm wrong, but salvation is guaranteed to The Flock because of the sacrifice of Jesus.

***Yes.***

Well what was actually sacrificed? Isn't he now seated at the right hand of The Father.

Ask him why prayer doesn't work. He'll say that there are ambiguous results, and we are still awaiting a definitive study. Then you can explain that the definitive study has in fact been done, and that the results are conclusive beyond all doubt and have been in since 1872. He'll say nonsense, nonsense. At this point in time you will need to be up to speed on statistics, institutionalised bias, and The Galton 1872 Prayer Study.

**TL:DR**

What I'm getting at, is that there are no shortcuts. If you are going to engage with the flock on the subject of God, and his ongoing struggle to exist consistently and convincingly then you need two things;

I went to church with her when I slept over at her house even though it really wasn't my thing. We grew apart a little at the end of high school when she grew more religious and preferred to hang out with her super Christian friend.  We weren't in contact too much during college and after, until we both joined Facebook and reconnected with each other.  She ended up marrying a super Christian guy who went to Liberty University.  She posts about religion all the freaking time now. She had been a math teacher, but her and her husband decided to dedicate all their time to their ministry, being missionaries and running Jesus camps.  This means an invitation to all their friends to become ""ministry partners"" and donate money to support their family and to fund their training to be missionaries.  I turn a blind eye to all of it, even though it makes me incredibly uncomfortable.  I love her, but I cannot in any way support their life's work of brainwashing kids.

Snabelpaprika,"This is basically a scam, a pyramid scheme hidden behind a lot of Jesus so people lower their guard and not suspect anything.

* The extremely sketchy employment contract that isnt any kind of employment, just a commitment from her to give them a lot of money. It is not an employment if you provide your own salary... That is recruiting to a pyramid scheme, nothing else.

* The use of ""partnership"" is also very pyramid schemy. Just as the ""employment"", it is nothing but ""how about you give us money?"", but just renamed so it sounds like something it isnt. Why not just call it ""giver""? It is to instill some kind of duty and loyalty so they can complain and demand stuff, which you cant do to people who are just ""givers"". 

* Pyramid schemes forces people to use up all their social contacts, milk as much money out of them as possible, and then when they and all their friends are dry, they just leave them or force them to stop doing it since they cant support themselves any longer. This is not a sustainable way to collect money, thats why they need to be able to get rid of all these used up people, and that is why the ""employment"" is completely self funded so they dont need to provide anything or have any kind of responsibility.

She is being used, and probably instructed in how to convince all her friends and relatives to give her money. The use of Jesus and calling itself nonprofit is just a way to try to get around the fact that pyramid schemes are illegal. I would research what they actually do with the money. I assume just a fraction goes to anything at all except the pockets of the leader, and this is just enough to keep up the illusion of it helping anyone.

We pass through this veil of tears but once. What's more, in short order.

One of the surprises that strikes you in middle age is how insanely you have been undervaluing friends and friendship. Once they die, they are dead for a fucking long time.

There's a couple of points I might make. Firstly, you don't have to agree with your friends on every point of ideology.

That said, sooner or later we all have to grow up and take up an adult role in our community. In a democratic society it is your duty as a citizen to act as a representative for principles and ideals you feel are important, for if not you, then who. There is no shortage of the religious right representing God's interests in the gay marriage debate. Which is only as it should be. Everybody is always eager to claim their rights as a citizen, and far too reticent when it comes to their duties.

It is possible to stand your ground on a matter of principle, question and contradict the statements of those who disagree, yet maintain the respect of your peers. It's not easy, it's one of the great challenges of life, and few make the grade.

It is in our dialogues with friends that we can acquire and practice these skills. Our friends will give us a little latitude if our diplomacy is clumsy, and it is often possible after a faux pas to rehabilitate goodwill. These are life skills that will stand you in good stead for the rest of your life.

So decide what you want to achieve, make a plan, do it.

Jews like the first movie, but ignored the sequels, Christians think you need to watch the first two, but the third one doesn’t count, Muslims think the third one was the best, and Mormons liked the second one so much they wrote fanfiction that doesn’t fit with ANY of the series canon.

The tactic of sending out young, naive, polite and well-dressed missionaries seems to work for them.  They are trained to be non-confrontational in debate and not to raise their more crazy beliefs on first encounters.  They bend over backwards to be classified as 'Christians' but are not recognized as such by most christian and non-christian observers.  As a European I found it somewhat ironic that in the last US presidential election there were anti-Obama car stickers saying 'Vote for the Christian, not the Muslim.'  I'm not a huge fan of Obama but if Romney had been elected he would have been the first openly non-Christian President of the USA, though he would have declared himself as such.

CesarV,"I am always polite to them when I see them, but ask them a few questions that no Mormon has ever been able to adequately answer.

Why is steel mentioned in the BOM but not only has no steel been found that was made by natives in North/Central/South America, but no evidence that they had the technology to produce steel?  Why are horses and barley mentioned but both were not present or used by natives?  Why is it that modern linguistics has demonstrated no connection at all with native languages and the middle east?  If you believe in the ""small population theory"" why is it that in the BOM there are battles with hundreds of thousands of people killed, yet no evidence of these battles?   

Nine times out of ten, they smile, nod, listen... and then ask me to check their website or come to the temple for a chat with an elder.  I then tell them that I have already done this, and no solid answers.

I have to say though during my time with them a nicer bunch of people you would be hard pressed to meet. No one in the church gets paid for any work they do and 100% of money given as charity is used for charity.

Like all places there are a few people that were what I call Sunday Christians but I would say in my area they where in the minority.

As for the missionaries it is crazy what those kids go through mentally, I became friends with missioners as we where around the same age and when one went home she was institutionalized. She could not leave her room for weeks without another person. They live 24/7 with another person of the same sex for 18 to 24 months, so it must be hard being a missionary.  

So nowadays when I come across them I offer them a lift if they need it, I speak to them nicely although I may at times really push them with theological questions, they never react with anger or scorn and they have never said I would go to hell for not believing like my own brother who is a Evangelical church member said  to me one day.

1. ""Messiah would be born of a woman"". Big deal. How many men are not?

2. ""Messiah would be born in Bethlehem."" This is *not* what the prophecy says: it says that he would be born to the clan of Bethlehem. 

3. ""Messiah would be born of a virgin."" If you read the prophecy in context it is clear that this prophecy has nothing at all to do with Jesus, but is referring to the Assyrian invasion, centuries earlier. And in any case the original Hebrew says ""young woman"",  not ""virgin"".

4. ""Messiah would come from the line of Abraham."" In other words he would be a Jew. Big deal.

5. and 6: Matthew and Luke give wildly different lines of descent, inspiring no confidence at all in their reliability. Furthermore they are *male* lines of descent. And Jesus' father was supposed to be God - on which basis he was *not* a male-line descendant of Isaac etc. The whole thing is a complete muddle.

7. ""Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah."" This contradicts the Micah prophecy that he would come from the tribe of Bethlehem.

8. ""Messiah would be heir to King David's throne."" Jesus was never the king of anything. All we get is a repeated prophecy that he will be one day.

9. ""Messiah's throne will be anointed and eternal."" We're still waiting.

10. ""Messiah would be called Immanuel."" He was called Jesus. See also point 3.

11. ""Messiah would spend a season in Egypt."" If you read this in context, it isn't even a prophecy. And according to Luke he didn't go to Egypt.

That pretend to be more open minded  and more intelligent when they really aren't.    

Their stance is based on the idea since we cannot disprove we do not know and therefor we don't claim that they can be wrong.    Which is absolute bullshit,  there are tons of things agnostic atheists  will deem as false in their lives and they will not be open to it many of these things won't even be of religious nature and much more plausible than  the claim of a deity.

Go and ahead and test this yourself watch how many without pause will outright claim Scientology to be false as if it were a known fact.

I just treat them the same as agnostic theists now. Because if you don't believe in something but are open to the idea no matter how absurd it is, it's really just a step away into belief.   Being closed minded is not a bad thing when it is placed upon absurdities.  If I were to over a tonic  that provided super powers  how many of them would believe me?

im-a-noob,"&gt; The only reason we even consider the possibility of a god is because some guys wrote stories about nonsense because they did not know science.

No. There are deities in all human cultures. We are natural worshippers and followers. We worship and follow leaders, things, desires... That's what lead some guys to write stories, not the other way around.

Of course, that does not mean those guys were right about anything. It just tells us something about ourselves.

&gt; I am completely sure there is in fact no god. I can not prove that one doesn't exist, but I can't prove the non-existence of something.

How can you be completely sure of something you can't even begin to understand?

I'm even making an assumption when I rule out some of them, that assumption being that I am here typing a comment and this is reality (which is supported by lots of evidence, but you never *know*, I could be dreaming this, or I could be someone else's dream). 

Anyway, long story short, I don't think it's *taboo*, I just think gnostic atheists have a hard time being self-consistent with the way we actually know or don't know things about the world.

BuccaneerRex,"The nature of epistemology does not allow certainty on some types of claims. But the lack of certainty is not a vote for belief in the claim. An agnostic atheist simply acknowledges the lack of certainty. 

Some people like to denigrate that as 'fence sitting' or 'holding out', but it's really not. It is just admitting that the concept of a deity is not one that can ever really be proven or not, because of the nature of the claim, not because of a failure of knowledge or science.

Theist hypotheses are, to paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli, ""Not even wrong."" 

They can't be scientifically proven or disproven because they're not science. The ""supernatural"" is an oxymoron. If something has an effect in the universe, it can be studied scientifically. If something does not have an effect within the universe, it can't be said to exist.

What this leads to is the conception of a deity being goalpost-shifted until $deity is simply defined as the universe itself, at which point you've just made the $deity irrelevant as an entity within your hypothesis. 

I can't say with perfect certainty that no deity exists anywhere. But not because I expect one to be hiding somewhere in the universe; it's because I don't make any claims regarding a deity. I can say that any theist claims I've ever heard of are ruled out by the nature of reality as exposed through scientific investigation, and that I do not accept any theist hypothesis as an explanation for the observed phenomena around me. 

By holding this stance, I am not making any claims, and therefore leave no rhetorical ""cracks"" to get an argument into. The burden of proof remains completely on the side of the theist, and thanks to Hitchens' Razor, I can reject claims without evidence without needing any more justification.

The 'strong' or 'gnostic' atheist position strikes me as a 'doth protest too much' assertion. It is like including ""And we have ruled out Leprechauns explicitly as the mechanism for this phenomenon"" in a scientific paper.

Iceborg9,"Well, if you look at the wiki for Gnosticism, you see the main themes (Gnosticism is basically an ancient set of religious ideals or philosophies) 

- The notion of a remote, supreme monadic divinity
- The introduction of a distinct creator god or demiurge
- The estimation of the world, owing to the above, as flawed or a production of ""error"" but possibly good as its constituent material might allow.
- The explanation of this state through the use of a complex mythological-cosmological drama in which a divine element ""falls"" into the material realm and lodges itself within certain human beings


I would suggest that anyone who understands the description of having gnostic ideals when referring to their beliefs means that you potentially submit to some abstracted form of Theism/Deism, and are therefore not an Atheist.

Yes, because God fucked up and didn't reveal his Gospel to everyone around 33 AD!

&gt;Is it necessary now that our planet is fully colonized and there are multiple competing religions?

I don't think religion was ever necessary, and perhaps even moreso now.  What good can be accomplished with religion that cannot be accomplished through secular means?

&gt;Is economic power a similar and competing concept?

NuclearShadow,"&gt; Is it a control structure?

I can't think of any religion that doesn't have at-least some basic rules. So yes.

&gt; Did it help turn tribes into societies and eventually nations.

This is a tricky question in which I have to answer yes and no.   First of all tribes are a form of society. Also nations would have formed  despite the existence of religion.     However  without religion  history would have played out very differently so the current world you see today likely wouldn't have the same nations and borderlines.

&gt;Did it speed up the process of colonizing the planet?

I think this is a really bad thing to suggest,  as if the indigenous people do not count as people that once colonized the lands?    As for European colonizing sure,  it was often used as a reason and was funded by kingdoms  and churches alike,  and look how that turned out for the  indigenous peoples.    This was a terrible thing and shame on you for suggesting it may be ""useful""

&gt;Is it necessary now that our planet is fully colonized and there are multiple competing religions?

Colonization was  a eventual thing and preexisted any religion practiced today.  Why would it be necessary for religions to both exist and compete?  How is this useful when this caused massive wars?

&gt;Is economic power a similar and competing concept?

I have a old friend that was beaten with a baseball bat almost to death and was left for dead as the Christian shouted hateful things at him.   Simply because he was a atheist.

BuccaneerRex,"I prefer ""meme complex"" to ""control structure"". Belief in a religion induces the holder of the belief to exhibit behaviors that benefit the meme. Religions, at least in their earliest form, strike me more as evolved behaviors with a layer of abstract thought on top to give them a 'narrative'. The control aspect is merely the exploiting of the behavioral inducement inherent in holding a meme. Someone who knows how to push the buttons appropriately can guide/direct those behaviors.

It's simply part of being human: our brains are susceptible to infection by ideologies. Religion, Patriotism, Justice, Mercy, Humanism, all of these things are just ideas that cause us to act in certain ways. And they are therefore subject to evolutionary pressures like any other evolved behaviors. The ones that benefit (or at least don't harm) the holders, and have reasons for being passed to others will continue. The memes that lead the holder to act in ways that make it less likely they will pass the meme to someone else, don't get passed on.

2 For a long time it just sat there in the nothingness, getting hotter and hotter.
3 Then it exploded.
4 The explosion created the stars, which were burning bubbles of the first big ball of gases.
5 The stars threw out chunks of debris that cooled and became planets.
6 The planets spun round and became round.

&gt;CHAPTER 2

&gt;1 In a remote and insignificant sector of the universe, one planet fell into an orbit around its star that by accident made its surface conducive to the molecular formations known as amino acids.
2 Neither so close to their planet's star as to be incinerated, nor so far from it as to be frozen, the acids survived,
3 And proceeded to combine into new molecules of a complexity advanced enough to permit change and growth,
4 And meiosis, and the development of certain other transient characteristics of a generic nature classifiable as life.

arthurpaliden,"Genesis For The Modern Age

1. In the beginning there was only God and he alone created the void that was the Universe. Then into the void that was the Universe God placed a infinitesimal part of his being. Then he sat back and watched.

2. And the void being with out substance was unable to contain this essence of God and so it expanded at a terrible speed releasing unimaginable energies.

3. Where upon there was created the four fundamental forces to contain these energies. The Strong Nuclear Force, the Weak Nuclear Force, the Gravitational Force and the Electromagnetic Force.

4. And with the establishment of these controlling forces expansion of the Universe slowed and the great energies cooled  the first elementary particles were formed. 

5. And from these partials the first atoms were formed. The initial one having a single proton and electron and God looked down and said let this be called Hydrogen.

6. Then when all the Universe was Hydrogen  the Fundamental Force of Gravity caused groups of these atoms to come together in ever larger masses.

7. Where upon when the masses became so large and the Force of Gravity so strong that they started to smash the atoms of Hydrogen together creating new atoms and releasing new energies that  illuminated the Universe.

8. And thus Stars were born and there was now light upon the void.

9. Then as the forces within the stars created heavier and heavier atoms the energies generated within became great. Greater in fact than the Force of Gravity. Where upon the very Stars themselves exploded spewing the atoms out in great clouds into the void.

10. Again the fundamental forces came into play creating new stars from the lighter atoms and Planets from the heavier ones. Starting the  cycle of Star birth and death.

11. Now it came to pass that the Planets once formed were much cooler than the Stars allowing the atoms of various types to join together according to the Fundamental forces into molecules.

12. Some were simple such as the water that filled the seas some were complex such as the precursor proteins of life itself.

13. And with in the waters those combined to produce the first self replicating proteins which then became  the symbiotic proteins and they first living organisms appeared.

14. And as population pressure grew life began to change to venture into new habitats to eat new foods and thus evolution began.

15. And God marveled at the result of what he had put in motion,  which was Man.

16. Then God spoke to man thus,

17. “Do unto others as you would have then do unto yourself”

18. “Use your intelligence to discover the wonders of this Universe and solve your own problems as it will help you to grow as a species and become better people.”

19.  “And, oh ya, Don't be jerks.”.

20. Then all was quiet and Man looked about and thought, “Now where do we start?”

A_mellifera,"As someone who left the fundamentalist religion I grew up in, I think I recognize where you are. You have largely made the rational decision about what you believe. You can't un-see the world as you now see it. But there is all of the emotional part to deal with. In some ways, this is the bigger obstacle. No, you definitely aren't a terrible person for losing the ability to relate to the way your family and friends speak about and think about the world. Leaving a religion can feel like a huge loss. There is fear of the unknown, but also this suddenly looking at the known differently. It takes a while to adjust.

I'd recommend that you don't tell your parents anything until you feel pretty comfortable with where you are. It's clear you are already mentally comfortable. I'm talking about the emotional part of it. Maybe you never confront them with it. I have tried a couple of times, over the years since I left, to tell my dad my opinions. It's clear this will be so hurtful to him that I have decided to let him construct his own opinions about why I never go to church, why I change the subject when he starts in on the Hope for Israel. My mom has a better idea of what I think. They both know I believe in evolution, but my mom will actually talk to me about it. They both believe I still believe in a higher power. I have never said anything to reinforce this idea; I have actually said things to make them believe I am an atheist. But it's clear this is something they need, so I don't press it. My mom knows I don't believe in their specific religion (Christadelphianism). My Dad believes I have issues with the power structure. I don't know why he constructed this story, but I've decided to stop challenging it.

I'm addressing your first question last, because everyone approaches this differently. For me, it helped to sit in a space where I asked myself: OK A_mellifera, let's just say God does exist. Do I want any part of what he's done? Do I really want to support a supreme being, who created people who are rational and capable of understanding his message, but then decided that a girl who grew up in China at the time of Christ was never to have a chance to be saved? Do I really want to believe that he sent his son only to the Middle East, and a boy growing up as a native of America or Australia would only hear his message (of love, supposedly) from people who enslaved him and took his land and used God as an excuse for it? And these kids - real kids who actually existed - are sentenced to a life without God or eternal torment for things they couldn't control. If that's what God is, then I don't want any part of it. Giving myself this was a huge relief. It can be completely internal, but once you make the emotional break, you'll feel it. Then you can start constructing what you really think and feel about the world without all of the baggage. Seriously, I can't explain it to you until you are there, but it is a HUUGE relief to let yourself believe what you already believe. Some of that is recognizing the ridiculousness of people who think God answered their prayers about a promotion, even though He let your aunt die of cancer. Because it IS ridiculous.

Science which is the atheist foundation and backbone for intellectual support when used to counter religion, is only an observation through our perception of our natural and biological surroundings. It is in a constant state of evolution through observation and realization of the outside world. 

Religion or theism is internal self assessment and processes to better yourself and grow your consciousness and guide you through life situations. to help create a higher potential for a sensible, moral, &amp; rational ideology.

Atheism is an uneducated assessment of an off the mark attempt to interpret holy texts in a literal sense.

A big part of my growing up was realizing (and ultimately understanding and forgiving) my parents' flawed psychology and its impacts on my younger self. I encourage you to consider your current thinking in the context of becoming an adult. No matter where you end up theologically, you will need to come to an understanding of why your parents raised you the way they did. I applaud you for starting on this essential process. Too many people blame their parents without understanding, and/or parrot their families without critiquing. You are probably a better person without the Bible than you were with it, if (through the process of leaving it behind) you put the hard mental work into discovering what you believe and why, including a system of ethics that makes sense to you. 

Personally I did not ""come out"" as atheist to my parents until several years after graduating college. Especially when you don't live at home, there is really no rush whatsoever. It's okay to bow your head, attend siblings' Confirmations, or whatever as just a part of family tradition until you're financially/emotionally able and willing to change your religious beliefs on Facebook.

It's a great thing to think about and I've spent much time doing it, but there is nothing you can really do about it.

2. It doesn't make you a terrible person, but remember that you also once believed that kind of stuff. Some people retreat into religion because it is a way to cope with a scary world that they do not understand. Do not laugh at these people. If you feel comfortable, you can insert some of your questioning beliefs, but nothing more. All you can hope to do is get them asking the same questions you are asking yourself, the rest is up to them.

3. If you still live at home and depend on them for money, then do not tell them. It is unfortunate that that is the way of things, but if there is any question of being disowned then it is what you have to do. If you are independent then you just have to weigh lying to them for all your life against possibly having them never talk to you again, but being honest. It is a personal question, and no one can really answer that one for you. ",null,0,cdmhkys,1rdclj,atheism,new,1
geeuurge,"* This is an argument for religiosity called Pascal's Wager. The idea is that if there is no God, there is no benefit to being an atheist, but if there is a God, it pays to be religious. The reason this is an unreasonable argument is that the consequences of god's existence literally have nothing to do with whether he actually exists or not. There's no real way to let this go, you just have to believe what you think is right, not what will net you the most afterlife. 

* No. But you probably shouldn't laugh about it to their faces. Imagine how you'd feel if someone did that to you when you were a devout Christian. We all tell little lies as social niceties, This is one of them. If you don't find that a compelling reason, bear in mind that ridiculing someone is probably the least successful way to get them to see your point of view. 

* Don't tell them, at least not yet. Deconversion is not an easy ring to go through, and you don't have to deal with being disowned at the same time. Even if you're resolute in wanting to tell them, wait until you are sure about your lack of belief and are comfortable with it before telling your parents. ",null,0,cdmhqqa,1rdclj,atheism,new,1

2)  Humor is a way of coping with pain &amp; loss.  At the root of all humor you will usually find that someone has been hurt at least a little.  Sometimes this pain is nothing more than making a silly mistake that wastes time or resources or mildly hurts your reputation with no lasting damage.  But almost always there is some loss.  So you mind instead of getting stuck in depression, it just laughs and goes on.  So I would say the fact you find humor in the situation means you are normal &amp; healthy.  If you did not find at least a little humor I would worry you are suffering from depression.

How I would urge you to not make the mistake that ""ninterd"" does.  Do not believe that just because you recognize the damage it makes you superior.  Pride is very likely what keeps your family from recognizing their mistakes and escaping Christianity also.  And someday your pride will make you make a keep repeating a mistake also.  In the case of ""ninterd"", he comes off as an elitist and may actual alienate those he would like to help.  

3)  I don't think you have to take on the burden of deconverting your parents.  As far as I can see there are only two reasons you need to tell them.  One, is that you are trying to serve as an example of moral atheism in an attempt to deconvert them.  Two, is that their religious harassment is so burdensome on you that you need to tell them in order get them to let up on you.  If one is your only reason to tell them, then don't.  If two is your reason to tell them, then tell them as soon as you are no longer financial dependent on them.

What kind of god would you believe in, should you be wrong and it exists? Is it this loving, forgiving version of the Christian god? If so, doesn't he forgive? If you died, and this is how it really is, do you honestly think he'd turn you away at his doorstep just because you got this one wrong? Isn't that contradictory of a loving, forgiving god?

If you think it's a cruel god of classic fire and brimstone, that you *ever* questioned your faith has cast you to hell forever anyway, so there's nothing you can do about it. You're already fucked.

Not remotely. I can't comment further, as I have no idea how you would have come to this conclusion.

&gt; I realize that I've been brainwashed my entire life, but how do I tell my parents that I don't believe? They are so extreme about their religion, that it's quite possible they'll disown me.

Don't. Ever. It's none of their god damn business. No one has the right to question you. Fuck them for judging you. And if live with lying by omission, then you can all get along just fine. There's nothing to gain except polish on your personal pride, and maybe some support to your siblings, but don't bother until they're all out of college and in their careers, so that your parents can't destroy them by disowning them if they become frantically paranoid. I'm suggesting that coming out now can have a cascade effect of hurting others in your family unit by association.

The common advice, though, is if/when you do have that conversation, do so after college, when you have a career, and your own home. You need to sever all financal ties with them and be completely independent. You need to make sure there's nothing that they can take away from you, because they might, or they will, if they can.

I also suggest you need the right attitude. It should be matter-of-factly; your atheism is not an open disucssion or debate. There is no right or wrong, no opportunity to be converted, which often they will try to do. Don't defend your atheism, as it doesn't need defending; it stands on its own.

**5. Virbius and the Horse**

WE are now in a position to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of the tradition that Virbius, the first of the divine Kings of the Wood at Aricia, had been killed in the character of Hippolytus by horses. Having found, first, that spirits of the corn are not infrequently represented in the form of horses; and, second, that the animal which in later legends is said to have injured the god was sometimes originally the god himself, we may conjecture that the horses by which Virbius or Hippolytus was said to have been slain were really embodiments of him as a deity of vegetation. The myth that he had been killed by horses was probably invented to explain certain features in his worship, amongst others the custom of excluding horses from his sacred grove. For myth changes while custom remains constant; men continue to do what their fathers did before them, though the reasons on which their fathers acted have been long forgotten. ***The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason, to find a sound theory for an absurd practice.*** In the case before us we may be sure that the myth is more modern than the custom and by no means represents the original reason for excluding horses from the grove. From their exclusion it might be inferred that horses could not be the sacred animals or embodiments of the god of the grove. But the inference would be rash. The goat was at one time a sacred animal or embodiment of Athena, as may be inferred from the practice of representing the goddess clad in a goat-skin (aegis). Yet the goat was neither sacrificed to her as a rule, nor allowed to enter her great sanctuary, the Acropolis at Athens. The reason alleged for this was that the goat injured the olive, the sacred tree of Athena. So far, therefore, the relation of the goat to Athena is parallel to the relation of the horse to Virbius, both animals being excluded from the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god. But from Varro we learn that there was an exception to the rule which excluded the goat from the Acropolis. Once a year, he says, the goat was driven on to the Acropolis for a necessary sacrifice. Now, as has been remarked before, when an animal is sacrificed once and once only in the year, it is probably slain, not as a victim offered to the god, but as a representative of the god himself. Therefore we may infer that if a goat was sacrificed on the Acropolis once a year, it was sacrificed in the character of Athena herself; and it may be conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed animal was placed on the statue of the goddess and formed the aegis, which would thus be renewed annually. Similarly at Thebes in Egypt rams were sacred and were not sacrificed. But on one day in the year a ram was killed, and its skin was placed on the statue of the god Ammon. Now, if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove better, we might find that the rule of excluding horses from it, like the rule of excluding goats from the Acropolis at Athens, was subject to an annual exception, a horse being once a year taken into the grove and sacrificed as an embodiment of the god Virbius. By the usual misunderstanding the horse thus killed would come in time to be regarded as an enemy offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he had injured, like the pig which was sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris or the goat which was sacrificed to Dionysus, and possibly to Athena. It is so easy for a writer to record a rule without noticing an exception that we need not wonder at finding the rule of the Arician grove recorded without any mention of an exception such as I suppose. If we had had only the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny, we should have known only the rule which forbade the sacrifice of goats to Athena and excluded them from the Acropolis, without being aware of the important exception which the fortunate preservation of Varro’s work has revealed to us.

The conjecture that once a year a horse may have been sacrificed in the Arician grove as a representative of the deity of the grove derives some support from the similar sacrifice of a horse which took place once a year at Rome. On the fifteenth of October in each year a chariot-race was run on the Field of Mars. Stabbed with a spear, the right-hand horse of the victorious team was then sacrificed to Mars for the purpose of ensuring good crops, and its head was cut off and adorned with a string of loaves. Thereupon the inhabitants of two wards—the Sacred Way and the Subura—contended with each other who should get the head. If the people of the Sacred Way got it, they fastened it to a wall of the king’s house; if the people of the Subura got it, they fastened it to the Mamilian tower. The horse’s tail was cut off and carried to the king’s house with such speed that the blood dripped on the hearth of the house. Further, it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and preserved till the twenty-first of April, when the Vestal Virgins mixed it with the blood of the unborn calves which had been sacrificed six days before. The mixture was then distributed to shepherds, and used by them for fumigating their flocks.",null,0,cdm87op,1rdksf,atheism,new,2

&gt;Is the universe ordered or random?

You would have to define ordered and random a bit more to get a detailed answer.  There are certainly some fundamentals about the way things interact - especially on the small scale and very large scale.  But there is no need for the hypothesis that there is a deity behind the scenes pulling the strings.  After all, if the planet (or universe) was better suited for a different kind of life, then is is that different kind of life that would be here.  So I suppose my answer would be that it is random, *possibly* [brought about by a quantum fluctuation.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-EilZ4VY5Vs#t=1330)

Again, this depends on how you define evil.  It's a socially agreed upon empathetic construct that changes over time as people gain more/better access to knowledge and freedom to express themselves.  

For example, slavery is generally considered evil in modern America (even though it still takes place at greater numbers then ever worldwide, including in America) - but that was not always the case.

&gt;Is the universe ordered or random?  

Yes.  It is ordered in that the laws of physics apply universally (good try but no, anything beyond an event hroizon can't properly be said to be in our universe).  And the entropy is increasing, btw. It is random in that events at the quantum level can not be predicted, not as far as we know anyway.  There are also random processes at the macro level.  Hence the mathematical field of statistics.

Humans define evil into existence just like they do good.  Events occur.  Events that cause harm are defined as evil if there is an intelligence guiding it.

A theist should see it as evil given that their god has the ability to mitigate or eliminate the pain, destruction and death, yet does not.

 I was raised in a Confucianist culture, that years of communism and modern zealotry couldn't completely erased. The family is a sacred thing and the basic unit of society. It is the filial duty of all members of family to care for each other and extend the family and accumulate wealth for the family through work and marriage. Furthermore our complex communist culture also contributed to our modern understanding of a family, retired grandparents often watch over children while both parents work (in my parents time there was no way for one man to feed more than 2 children and a wife). Family is so important to us we consider it highly improbable a person can be a good person without a harmonious family life.

Good one! Families are obviously most important for raising children, and providing for their physical, emotional and developmental needs. In today's society where there's a lot of value placed on individual achievement, I think successful families will instill values of thinking and acting independently, while providing a physical and emotional safety net to fall back on when difficulties arise. Outside of childhood, I think the obligations of family only extend as far as the strength of the relationships that make them up. If a family member repeatedly or severely mistreats you, there is no obligation to continue a relationship with that person just because they are family.

&gt;Is the universe ordered or random?

There are obvious examples of both order and randomness at work in the universe

&gt;What is the meaning of life?

Life does not have a meaning in the way a sentence has a meaning, since it arose through natural forces acting on random events (see, there is order and randomness again). Our lives have meaning because we, as thinking agents, assign them meaning. However this meaning cannot be a monolith since each of us has our own perspective. I find meaning by concentrating on developing my strengths and creating good feeling in the people around me.

&gt;Is truth subjective or objective?

Pretty obviously, it is objective, since truth is determined by comparing a statement's meaning to reality. Of course, if one makes statements about subjective things, such as favorite colors, then the truth of those statements is in some sense subjective. Furthermore, since truth depends upon meaning, if the meaning of the statement depends on subjective evaluations, then the truth can be subjective as well.

&gt;Where does evil come from?

To the extent that evil is a thing, say ""a disregard for the well-being of others to the point of taking intentional harmful action,"" there are evolutionary reasons why these impulses still exist despite our best efforts to eliminate them. Individuals can act evilly because greed and self-interest have been successful strategies for propagating genes, and groups can act evilly towards other groups because defending ones tribe against outsiders allowed the tribe's gene pool to succeed collectively.

It plays a huge role by omission. Theistic views tend to have a pretty oppressive effect on the formation of worldviews. It's pretty hard to ignore something like a sky dictator when determining how you feel about things. My atheism allows me to consider each issue according to its observable properties, and find the answers best supported by evidence and reasoning.

Family: Family is an emotional safe place. It's the people you care about and (hopefully) can count on for emotional and other support.

Root of Evil: Evil comes from people. When we forget that other people are, well, people then we are capable of anything. It can also happen when people lose sight of reality.

At any given moment, this planet could be ripped apart by a nova blast wave without even seeing it. To us it would be ""the end of the world"". To the universe, it would be another blip.

There is no inherent meaning to life - or to anything - other than *what you bring to it*. Instead of asking ""what is the meaning of life"" , you should ask ""HOW SHOULD I LIVE MY LIFE?""

Notice - that *actually has purpose* and *can be answered*.

""Is truth subjective or objective?""

Whose ""truth""? What ""truth""? In general, I'm not interested in the ""truth"", I'm interested in *facts* and *opinions*.

thorne36,"As an Atheist as well, I know exactly how confounded people are by the fact that I participate in Christmas. This answer may be kind of long but I want to go into why I participate in Christmas even though I fundamentally disagree with the idea of it. Btw, I want to use the phrase 'participate in xmas' rather than 'celebrate xmas', because although I celebrate the gifts, friends, and moments of Christmas; I don't celebrate Christ.

First of all, I want to criticize the Christian idea of Xmas. I'm sure, long ago, xmas started out as truly a Christian celebration of their messiah (and to some, or maybe even most, it still is). However, it has since turned into an industry and an embedded AMERICAN tradition (I can only speak for the US). One example, and I understand this example may be hard to make since almost all the US is Christian, Hanukkah. As xmas grew in to the huge commercial enterprise it has over the years, a relatively insignificant Jewish holiday seems to have had undue importance placed on it to compete with the commercial enterprise of xmas. Seemingly indicating that there is an underlying value to the holiday outside of its religious value. That other value, in my opinion, is economic enterprise. It ultimately is an enormous American economic enterprise, that can't be ignored by other religious preferences within the population. It's a time when large segments of the population don't have to work, when bonuses are paid and an almost nationally-agreed-upon time of year for 'a day off', for lack of a better term. The American economy nearly comes to a halt, which makes Christmas too big to be ignored. But if it’s too big to be ignored, what should we do as Atheists? Come up with an ‘Atheistmas’ and try to apply some type of values to it, when the rest of the country is doing something else, that way more fun?  You could try that and write your own xmas-type holiday that takes place at the same time but assign your own traditions to it (festivus?). I think most of us aren’t as bold as Frank Costanza though and we’re stuck celebrating an enterprise that has a religious origin, but now is simply an American enterprise

After all that, I want to say I agree with you, I like all the festivities, the music, the gifts and everything that xmas brings. I think it’s fun to celebrate the enterprise that is Christmas, but I just exclude the religious elements of it.

The last thing I want to say is a warning to Atheists who participate in xmas. Like I said, I feel xmas is an American industry that we choose to participate in, but there is a danger in us participating. We belittle the cause of Atheism by participating; if we allow the Christian part of xmas appear to be the part of xmas that we participate in. If we allow it to be seen by others in that light, we seem to admit defeat to go along with the status quo rather than adhering to our beliefs. The danger is that we appear to others to not be serious about our cause and lose the little bit of traction that we have in juxtaposition to Christianity in America. So, I don't feel it's bad to participate, just that we have to let others know why it is that we do participate.

tl;dr: Christmas is an American Industry, not necessarily a religious holiday

Then the only controversy will be 'these are people who believe something for no reason which has no support'. It's great that they're getting to be better people and letting go a little more of the negative parts of religion but I'd really like to see some work done on the core of it. If we can get that down, I think the other nonsensical beliefs should follow suit. I have no interest in encouraging good behavior without accomplishing a justification for supporting it. It's delicate and only does good on the surface without actually correcting the problem. The problem isn't that they're doing good or terrible things: the problem is that they don't justify their actions logically. The magical fairy telling you to be good bears JUST AS MUCH justification as the magical fairy telling you to be wicked. Telling them to pretend one way or another so they can be good people doesn't solve the real problem of listening to a magical fairy in the first place and finding justification for your good or poor decisions in that.

Circles_for_Infinity,"I came out to my parents and in-laws in a letter format. My wife to be and myself ran into a roadblock with the priest that was to marry us when I started asking questions about leaving the mention of God out of my portion of the vows. It was important to me that I not vow something that I didn't intend to hold up and live by, and I didn't want to lie to the church by vowing certain things before God. More importantly, this priest was my god father and was full aware where my journey of faith had taken me over the years and that I had become an atheist as a result. Instead it was his way or the highway, so we elected to take the highway. As such, we needed to break the news to our families about what had transpired so I printed out the email exchanges that we had had with him and presented them to the parents. Of course they were able to connect the dots and soon became aware of my doubts and rejection of faith and belief in the supernatural. It was a tough pill to swallow for my parents, and my in-laws absolutely freaked out and wanted to stop the marriage proceedings. After my parents talked sense into them the wedding went off without a hitch. My in-laws still take issue with my lack of faith, but that is an entire different story and long post. My parents, on the other hand, started asking me questions. Long story short, both of my parents have quite a bit of doubt and continue to be interested in where I am and what my thoughts are regarding certain issues. They both read many thoughts and links that I post and expand and challenge their own comfort zone with faith. In fact, they both recently admitted to me that the only thing that keeps them involved in the church is the sense of community and family that it offers. They pretty much admit that nothing in the text makes sense, and that science is a far better explanation for things than magic.

xubax,"I was depressed for about 2 weeks in high school.  I'd been sitting with a friend of mine at a food court in a mall and I just asked the question, ""Where did all the stuff come from?""

I was already an atheist (and this was before the public had access to the Internet) but tried to wrap my 17 year old head around a basic question about the universe.  

After about two weeks I just accepted it.  If there wasn't stuff, we wouldn't be here to question.  So, the universe exists, stuff is in it, and humans have gained enough knowledge and awareness to question it.

To reconcile that with whether or not gods exist, let's turn to Intelligent Design.  ID claims that people and other animals, the universe, etc., are too complex to have come about by random chance.

Presumably, anything complex enough to intelligently design an entire universe would itself have to be amazingly complex.  Where did it come from?  ID tells us that the creator always existed.

What's more likely?  That an omnipotent and complex creator has always existed outside of space and time and by ID would have had to have been designed by a *more* complex creator, which in turn would have had to have been designed by yet a *more* complex creator, ad infinitum, or that there is at least one universe, filled with junk, and some of that junk managed to put together some molecules to create cells, which in turn created more cells, then the cells grouped together, etc?  Not one random chance, but a virtually infinite number of random chances.  

It's likely that everyone who will ever have existed will have to go to their graves disappointed if they hope to know how or why the universe came about.  And if someone does figure it out scientifically, it'll probably be long after we're gone.

I once thought I was dead, and that I was experiencing the afterlife. It was fascinating.

I was skiing in the Symphony Bowl (I think? It was a decade ago.) at Whistler, solo, and there were some cliff zones under the chair. One of them looked promising. I couldn't tell you just how tall it was now - taller than the trees anyway but it could've been anywhere from 20 to 40'. Anyway I wanted to jump it. 

When I came down (and passed under two ropes and past lines of signs signaling a cliff area and a ski area boundary) I wound up at the top of the cliff, and learned that there wasn't a good launch. No space to start with speed and no lip to hop from because the slope just curved to vertical and the rocks below protruded. I elected to do a quick turn and go out the side, but I was on the steeps, and knocked loose the crust under me. I went over the side with a (very) small avalanche of my own making, missed the rocks and trees on the way down, landed mostly upright (with one ski missing - it was stuck at the top of the cliff somehow) but promptly lost it, yardsaled, and tumbled to a stop some hundred feet later.

I was buried, shallowly, with a decent air pocket in front of me, and I was hyped on adrenaline and endorphin. No injuries - nothing hurt, and I felt amazing. Also, I was comfortably warm. After I wiggled my hands and feet, I leapt to the conclusion that, having just gone through an avalanche and off a cliff apparently unscathed, I was very clearly dead.  This posed lots of interesting questions for me, as I had assumed there was no afterlife. It was comfortable, but dark and boring, so I first wondered if there was any merit to the idea of purgatory, which is where I imagine honestly that I would probably go if the myths were substantially accurate (having never really done anything bad, nor particularly good for that matter).

My next thought was that I was actually dying, not dead, and experiencing time-dilation from some kind of neurochemical bonanza in my damaged brain.

My next thought was that if I were dead, or even if I were just euphoric and trapped in a dying brain, that I might be able to either experience or imagine something better than cozy, warm darkness. I thought I would start by trying to fly. So I jumped.

I jumped out of the snow.  I was under the chairlift at the bottom of a bigass cliff.  People started applauding noisily.

I got so drunk that night that I almost died again. ",null,1,cdmhey4,1relo7,atheism,new,7

One (or more) of these choices will therefore deliver the greatest benefit/least detriment to everyone.  This choice is the most moral one possible, therefore it represents the objective morality.

People may disagree with the level of benefit/detriment an action causes, however this is due to each person having incomplete knowledge of the situation, and weighting the knowledge they do have differently.  However simply because we are unaware of all the data, or how to weigh it, does not alter the actuality of the situation.  Simply because we differ on what the best choice should be, does not mean that there isn't an actual optimal decision.

natural logic does not equal good; mantis females eat the males sometimes during sex; that does not mean it is good

not if they don't find out, so would it not be immoral if you are a master thief?

Sebas2001,"( I don't speak good English , I apologize )

Objective morality means that moral don't change with the context.
For example , ""your will not lie"" , but, what if you must lie to save your life or someone else ? 
(see in the Bible , Joshua 2 Rahab and the spies )

If lying is not an objective value , then never , no matter the context , you will lie .

There's more, objective values ​​implies that moral values ​​are universal , which means moral values apply to everyone, without exceptions.
Objective values also implies that moral values ​​are immutable , they do not change over time .

The Bible has no objective moral values ​​, you 'll see :
Numbers 15:32-36 According this story, we should kill anyone who violates the Sabbath .

Why Christians don't kill someone who works on the Sabbath ?
Christian Excuses :

- There is a new and old covenant ( see Hebrews 8:13), we are in the new covenant.
Or: Jesus changed those laws.
So moral values ​​change over time , then, they are not immutable values ( goodbye moral objectivity )

- The covenant with those laws was only for the Jews.
Then moral values ​​are not universal (again, bye moral objectivity )

And finally , the most anti-objectivity excuse :
- It was another historical context.
Can not be more clear that this argument removes any objectivity.

In summary, Christians believes that morality is objective ""in theory"", but in practice , they need moral relativism to justify or explain the Bible.",null,0,cdmls8p,1rete0,atheism,new,1

"" It is objectively bad to steal, because you will not gain anything (well, except for the object), but you will not gain anything else as a reward. ""

No, it's objectively bad to steal becuase a society which does not punish stealing is less profitable for all than a soceity that makes theft illegal.

American evangelicals tend to support the death penalty, while Catholic doctrine strictly opposes it.

taterbizkit,"You lead a small band of hunter-gatherers.  Your tribe knows of an apple grove, and keeps it secret.  Life is a struggle -- food is adequate now, but there have been severe famines recently.

One day, you see someone you don't recognize in the apple grove.  What do you do?

You must consider killing him.  His knowledge of where the apple grove is represents a threat to your people.  In future times of scarcity, your people can't abide competition.

What's more, you have to make a determination of how likely it was that he has been to the grove more than once -- and his people know where it is.  If you think they do, you must consider chopping down all the apple trees.  It may be better to deny your enemy a food source than to allow something to exist that keeps them close by.

The upshot is that even your claim that killing is *bad* is a product of our modern civilized culture.

That means that ""killing is bad"" is not objective.  Objective means ""a quality inherent to the object"" -- ""object"" being the other person, ""subject"" being you.  

Your argument ""you will not gain anything"", ""lose respect for you"", etc. are arguments aimed at the subject -- the killer/thief.  You're trying to convince us that we suffer consequences if we act anti-socially.  Those are subjective arguments.  Objective arguments would sound like ""The person's life is too precious to lose"" or ""denying the right of personal property to someone else denies it to all human beings"".

I am subjectively free to be a hedonist -- to say ""I don't care about other peoples' happiness, only my own"".  So even the argument that it's good for the species is lost on such a person.  He does not care about other people, and you can't force him to.",null,0,cdmnpit,1rete0,atheism,new,1

Perhaps the biggest problem, however, is that religious morality puts the interests of the religion ahead of the well being of actual people.

NukeThePope,"I've kept a link to this [expense breakdown for a Catholic church](http://www.christianitytoday.com/special/ycresources/pdf/exec-report_churchbudgetpriorities.pdf) - at least that's what I think it is.

The breakdown clearly shows that only a small percentage of the incoming money goes to charitable works and services.

In fairness, churches vary wildly in how effective they are at pushing money out to where it's needed. The best charities, according to charity rating sites, are 80% effective. Churches tend to be a lot less effective, simply because charity is not their primary product - proselytization is. Perhaps the report I showed you, with its roughly 20% effectiveness, is typical.

That said, the Salvation Army had high marks - around the 80% bracket IIRC from when I last looked. I recently read that Catholic Charities had an 89% rate, but I suspect that number is artificially inflated thanks to cross-subsidy from the Catholic Church proper.

This brings me to a general problem you may encounter with finding financial stats for church income: Many churches fiercely resist making their finances transparent. In the US, they are routinely exempt from IRS audits and are not required to publish financial reports as other nonprofits do.

&gt; ###1 Kings 18:16-40

&gt; ^16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

&gt; ^17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

&gt; ^18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.

&gt; ^19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.

&gt; ^20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.

&gt; ^21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.

&gt; ^22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.

&gt; ^23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

&gt; ^24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.

&gt; ^25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.

&gt; ^26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.

&gt; ^27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.

&gt; ^28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

&gt; ^29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

&gt; ^30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.

&gt; ^31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

&gt; ^32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.

&gt; ^33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

&gt; ^34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.

&gt; ^35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.

&gt; ^36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.

&gt; ^37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.

&gt; ^38 Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.

&gt; ^39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.

&gt; ^40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

jmsr7,"Here now: while my first reaction is like everyone else, ""just move out;"" it's possible that OP lives in a culture in which the children stay at home until they marry.  Now as someone who was raised in north america, i know how weird that sounds but i've met multiple people (classmates, coworkers, etc.) who are the children of first generation immigrants and currently live at home (even though they're freaking 30 goddamn years old and what the hell, right?).

In my culture (i'm canadian), we expect children to move out at 18 and make their own way in the world because living on your own teaches independence and maturity; and we view people who stay at home as being either weird or immature or suffering significant misfortune like being long-term unemployed. However, one of my coworkers once explained to me that her culture has the opposite view and basically views parents that kick their children out as abandoning them.  What's more, this is the standard model of child rearing throughout the majority of the world.  

In other words, posters have to remember that the north american tradition of moving out at 18 is unusual, and simply moving out may not be an option for the OP.

Therefore it is incumbent on us to try to think of suggestions for the OP to deal with this situation without belittling him/her, or saying 'just move out' because that may not be an option for many reasons.

IN THAT SPIRIT, i would suggest to OP that she(?) tell her mom that she is 19 years old and that because she is an adult now, taking her belongings is technically theft, a criminal offense.  Further,  adults are guaranteed freedom of association, and can choose to associate with anyone they want and avoid anyone they choose.  As a fellow adult, her mom no longer has power over her; only influence like freedom of speech (though you don't have to listen).  THAT SAID, perhaps OP can contribute to the household as an adult would, say by paying rent?  What would mum think of that?

In any case, good luck and feel free to vent here anytime :)

If you want to try and know some stuff about it, or maybe even try and understand how some of it might work, then it's going to involve a bit of work and discipline. It is just silly to think for a moment that anything really complicated could be understood or explained in a couple of sentences.

If you try to take shortcuts, you just end up dead wrong and looking stupid. Let me give you an example of how you can write a simple sentence about a supposedly simple concept, that is often expressed, and still be completely wrong;

&gt;From a logical perspective since (as of right now) we cannot definitively prove or disprove any higher power?

In Australia apart from the standard domestic 240 volt supply, three phase power is offered for industrial and commercial applications. Three phase can carry much higher loads etc etc.

Admitedly that is deliberately obtuse, but you try and explain what you mean by 'higher' in this context. I can give you an instantaneous understanding of it's meaning in the context of politics or mountain climbing. Without clear and precise definitions of these terms you are just talking gibberish.

Think on this, referring back to the quote above. We now have solid proof and evidence that dark matter and dark energy must exist, indeed they constitute most of the universe. However, although we have managed to discern a few details about what these things must be like, we are yet to even detect the actual things themselves. All we have managed is to notice what must be the effect they are having on other things we can detect.

Let's compare dark energy and gravity, which one is higher. Well, gravity is obviously much stronger, I can detect that just by tripping over. That said, dark energy exerts a much more significant influence on The Universe as a Whole. So even making an attempt to work out which is higher is misleading.

Considered in this light, your question;

&gt;Do any atheists acknowledge the possibility that a ""god"" or higher power does exist? 

can't really be answered.

My regular sexual romps with Zoe De Chanel certainly exist. This type of existence is of course fairly cerebral for me, and fortunately for Zoe allows her to remain ignorant. You could even do some testing for ejaculate, or increased heart rate and have real concrete evidence that these sex romps are definitely taking place.

Without clear and concise definitions for all the terms, we don't even know what we are talking about. So, frankly I can't even acknowledge your question, let alone answer it, because I don't know what you are talking about.

What happens if we fix that problem, what if you had asked something like;

Do any atheists acknowledge the possibility that a specific god, with certain specified attributes does exist in a manner such that it could be detected or exert influence on the contents of this universe?

As you can see, I've not even specified what those attributes or influences might be, so this god is pretty much the bare minimum of definition required to even know what we are talking about.

What's more, this question can be answered. Any entity with these, or more detailed specifications has been proven not to exist, the final nail in the coffin being the discovery of The Higgs Boson at The LHC, just this year.

I did warn you that complicated things require complicated explanations. We've both had to wade through this long post, and I still haven't shown you that proof and I'm not going to, I've done enough, and I know how this all ties up already, you however don't.

It is a representation of the fact that you and I are dinosaur dust, stardust, air, light, and water. It is a representation of the fact that we are alive and conscious in a seemingly unconscious world. The universe is greater than that, without a doubt. Science is an empirical tool through which we explore this cosmos, but what is science? It is conquering nature through measurement and numbers. This maxim was brought to a young Rene Descartes by ""an angel in a dream"". I do not believe in Christian Jehovah, Islamic Allah, or the Hebrew El. In fact, after much consideration, my atheism and agnosticism is more akin to Japanese spiritualism: the idea that every object, every body, every tangible item in this universe is imbued with spirit. I just don't believe that spirit is anthropomorphological (as in, I don't believe the energy is human or what we would term alive or conscious). But, after reviewing scientific literature, the universe seems to have no seams the further a closer we examine it. We must treat this life as sacred and holy if we hope to prosper in it, but that does not mean we should blindly subscribe to fairytales. It means we should have a fervid imagination, lust for knowledge, and a wondering and loving attitude. Religion is always about dogma and culture and order, but I believe spirituality is akin to one's greatest attitude. If you have a shitty attitude, you will have a shitty time, usually. That seems to be the logical extent of the universal secret. These are just a few of my thoughts.

edit: by the way, I believe because we all exist in this universe that we are all inherently interconnected. Thus, we are all, we are God. It sounds esoteric but it means that everything that exists is God. I think of God as an energy trying to know itself by manifesting infinitely.

evolution theory says nothing about the origin of life

&gt;gaps in macro evolution

there is no such thing; there is only 'micro'-evolution; no species has ever changed in a different species; the only thing that happens is that one species splits into 2 species.

&gt;Until you can show that something came from nothing, I can't believe there is no creator.

because that catalyst has the same problem; what created it? If it can be uncreated; so can the universe

ReyTheRed,"[The foundational falsehoods of creationism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnJX68ELbAY&amp;list=PL126AFB53A6F002CC) series by AronRa is a good resource. 

The other thing to do is separate out the issues. Evolution does not contradict the existence of a god, evolution explains the diversity of life on this planet. It happened, we know it happened. You can believe in a metaphorical creation if you want, you can believe that a god set the universe in motion, or that a god guided the course of evolution, doing the natural selection to lead ultimately to humanity.

You could even believe that God set up the universe to look like it is old and that we evolved but it is actually young with these things being set up in progress, but that would be pretty silly.

Finally, even if evolution were not true, that wouldn't give any support whatsoever to creationism. If we found out tomorrow that evolution by random mutation and natural selection were not the correct explanation, (depending on the nature of the new evidence of course), we would be left not knowing how the world came to be the way it is.",null,0,cdmq2z8,1rfg8u,atheism,new,2
shaved_neck,"&gt; Hey! Science rocks!

Yes, yes it does.

&gt; But the worship of evolution theory as a source of our origin

Why did you use the word ""worship"" there? We're not *happy* that we're evolved. Evolution doesn't have our best interests in mind. It doesn't have any mind at all. It's a blind idiot. We'd much rather have been designed by an engineer who cared about us.

...but we weren't. And it shows. If your god did this, he's a blind idiot.

&gt; is no more ""science"" than creationism.

Aside from of course that evolution meets every scientific criteria, while creationism meets none.

&gt; There has actually been more written about the Bible than ANY other topic in history. And LOTS of books to read on the topic of creationism. (Second to that is the topic of beekeeping, I think.)

I don't care how many fiction stories you write in the same setting, it doesn't make the setting real. All those works you're mentioning would fall under the ""wild mass guessing"" section in the comments of any other fan-fiction forum.

&gt; I'd say that people who are not scared of the possibility of a God

What, ""a God"", using an indefinite article with a proper noun? It's not that I'm scared of the possibility of the god of the Bible being real. It's that it's already proven not to be the case. I'm glad there isn't too, because the god of the Bible is evil and would have to be destroyed if it existed.

&gt; find the Bible just as deep and interesting as those who fear God

If by deep and interesting, you mean shallow, primitive, and self-contradictory.

&gt; think of any science textbook which supports the theory of evolution.

I'm specifically going to think of the works cited and references pages, which lists experiments and empirical evidence that evolution is real, happens, and is described by the theory of the same name, so that anyone who doubts it can perform the experiments and check for themselves.

&gt; We believe there are just as many or more gaps in macro evolution theory as in creationism.

I know you believe it. Belief comes in two forms though. The first form of belief is the belief based on evidence. This form of belief is called knowledge.

Knowledge allows you to demonstrate that you are right.

The other form of belief is based on ignorance and denial. That form of belief is called faith. You have *faith* ""there are just as many or more gaps in macro evolution theory as in creationism."" It's faith because you don't have any knowledge, or evidence, or even know what the terms you're using mean. But you say you do anyways.

Faith is being wrong on purpose.

&gt; Hope you will get your head into some of those textbooks for a while before drawing any final conclusions.

I do too! Nobody should believe anything without evidence!

And furthermore no conclusion should ever be final. Evidence accumulates continuously, and beliefs are never certain. Things you know can be demonstrated, but trying to demonstrate things you only think you know can fail! When reality disagrees with you, you are wrong.

&gt; You guys are way too smart to make silly comparisons between the Bible, and science textbooks as if everything therein is antithetical opposites.

We don't. The theory of evolution and the biblical conjecture are similar, in that both can be falsified. The difference is the the biblical conjecture *has been* falsified, while the evidence in favor of evolution continues to accumulate.

&gt; Stop perpetuating anti-creationist propaganda if you have no better idea about the origin of our species than anyone else.

But since we *do* have a better understanding, we will continue.

&gt; Not every creationist is a literal creationist, or a young earth creationist.

But every creationist is however, *wrong*.

&gt; Many of us are HAPPY to integrate scientific findings into our understanding of how our Creator made us.

Up until you get to the understanding that he can't have made you. Then you stop and call evolution a lie. Ex: See you, above.

&gt; Until you can show that something came from nothing, I can't believe there is no creator.

Until you can show there is a creator, you shouldn't believe there is a creator.

Until you can prove that there was ever a nothing (which is a contradiction in terms), you shouldn't be asking anyone to prove something came from nothing.

And since the theory of evolution isn't even remotely about the origin of the universe, it has nothing to do with if something can come from nothing.

And since your god supposedly made something from nothing, you might not want to argue against the point that something can come from nothing.

&gt; you are always posting some pretty cool stuff about physics, atronomy, etc, but I've never seen anything that rules out a creator. Have you?

Well, there's the first law of thermodynamics. That's sort of a big one.

&gt; The easiest empirical experiment one can do is to see that nothing as we know it comes about from nothingness.

That's not an experiment, nor is it empirical, nor do we have any nothings to check. There can't ""be"" a ""nothing"". ""Nothing"" and ""be"" are *opposites*.

&gt; Nothing spontaneously exists. There must be a catalyst.

Nothing never exists.

&gt; We believe a creator is the catalyst.

You have faith, based on a complete ignorance, in the face of evidence to the contrary, that there could be a nothing (nothings can't be), that there was a nothing (despite that), that in this nothing there could be a god (nothings can't have things), that in this nothing there was a god (rather than there being nothing), that god used the nothing he didn't have to make something from nothing (which you claimed can't happen), that since god can make something from nothing there can't be anything else that could (special pleading from ignorance), that this god is your god (and not Azathoth), and then having used up all the nothing creating the universe it had to use dirt instead to make a man (because even illiterate cavemen knew we weren't created).

Faith is being wrong on purpose. And the more faith you have, the more wrong you are.

Also loaded question isn't a fallacy either, its just bad debating.   A question is not a logical appeal, and therefor cannot be fallacious.

It is too often the case that people end up arguing over who is ""making the claim"", when the fact is that both sides are making some sorts of claims.  In these cases, no one is supposed to get an automatic pass and avoid supporting your argument.

Science knows this quite well, and everyone in the scientific community strives to support their hypothesis with as much hard data and provable facts as they can.  For instance, evolution has quite a lot of evidence behind it. 

In a fair argument or debate, you shouldn't be sidestepping your obligation to present the evidence.  You should be presenting it in all its glory.

However, the fact of the matter is that its easier just to put the obligation on someone else.  This also puts the other side on the defensive and makes the argument easier to win.  Its a good tactic, but its often labelled (correctly) as a disingenuous argument by the other side.  If the person asserts X is true, they have to support it... and if you are asserting Y, or even if you are just asserting NOT X, you have to support your argument to.

BrianJ25,"/u/HastyUsernameChoice -- I have a question. 

Why is the fallacy ""appeal to authority"" a fallacy? 

The Principle of Testimonial Arguments maintains that you should accept a testimonial argument that satisfies the following premises: 

1 - It is true that the proposition is *reasonable* to believe 

2 - It is true that the proposer is *sincere* in saying that the proposition is true 

3 - It is true that the proposer is *knowledgeable* in the topic at hand 

I understand that you shouldn't accept someone's argument based *solely* on the fact that they are an expert without first weighing the reasonability of the claim made and the sincerity of the proposer. But this is what this poster states about the ""authority"" fallacy: 

&gt;The authority that such a person or institution holds does not have any intrinsic bearing upon whether their claims are true or not.

But their authority *does* have an intrinsic bearing on how close to the Truth their claims might be. Unless someone makes an unreasonable claim, or seemingly has a reason to spread falsities, shouldn't we accept testimony on the basis that someone is an expert? 

Consider this: 

Biology Professor (A) and your crazy uncle on Facebook (B), who cut a frog open in high school one time, have two contradicting arguments. 'A' makes a sincere, reasonable proposition regarding Biology; 'B,' though crazy, is sincere in refuting it, and does so with an equally reasonable statement. For the sake of my enlightenment, let's pretend that you have absolutely zero knowledge of the topic at hand and therefore are not in a place to weigh the truth of the premises against each other. 

All you know is that both 'A' and 'B' have presented identically reasonable arguments, and neither have anything to lose or gain out from establishing their proposition as True. 

Would it therefore be logically fallacious to accept 'A's' proposition as deductively or inductively stronger than 'B's' on the basis that 'A' is a certified expert whereas 'B' is not? 

Because it seems, to me, that the fallacy of ""appealing to authority"" is not a fallacy at all. In fact, it seems like quite the opposite. It seems like it would be logically fallacious to presume that someone who is a non-expert on the given topic is as capable of proposing a True proposition about the topic as an expert (of course, with all other premises constant).

Here's my take on this issue:

The question itself contains an unproven assumption. To ask, ""What is the purpose of life?"" implies that there is one in the first place, we just have to figure out what it is, and that perhaps this purpose is imposed outside of ourselves.

Why could we or should we make this assumption? First, we need to determine if there is, or must be, a purpose before we can even get to your question.

All our current evidence shows that the ""purpose"" of life (in quotes because I suspect this use of the word may be slightly or radically different than the one in the title) is to reproduce.

The purpose of *our* lives, or, at least, of *my* life, as a sentient human being, is that which I ascribe to it.

So, for some, it may be to be the best football player on the planet and make lots of money and entertain people. Or, it may be to heal the sick and save as many people as possible. Or, it may be to be a good parent and spouse. Or perhaps leave a written legacy on some topic for future generations.

If you assume that there's an 'objective' 'meaning to life', that also assumes that there's an entity doing the assigning of value for the entirety of reality.

I think that's an assumption that we can't really make.

Instead, we do know entities with agency - ourselves. So, *if* we are the ones assigning agency, then our lives 'mean' what we decide or want them to. Some people assign that value as family. Some people assign it to amassing wealth or power. Some to philanthropy, others to building a 'lasting legacy' of whatever type that may be. Some simply assign to 'survival'. Some simple to existential or experiential pursuit, or curiosity.

taterbizkit,"There are two primary ways to look at ""purpose"" in this context.  The subjective (do YOU have a sense of purpose that is personal to you and fulfills your expectations of what your life should be like), and the objective (is there a purpose to existence itself).

The second question is usually easy for religious people to answer: God has a purpose for each of us, even if we don't know what that is.  For atheists, it's not so generally straightforward.  Lots of atheists still believe that there is (or should be) some larger purpose that transcends the individual.  

Even atheists who will discount a larger purpose when the question comes up directly, a lot of us will still make appeals to purpose or direction when the idea comes up obliquely.  You'll hear ""As atheists we should be about making the human race better"", or questions like ""what is the next stage for human evolution?"".

Those are both appeals to *teleology* (that is, a direction that moves/shapes us and our futures).

I reject teleology in any form.  There is no such thing as ""should"" as an expression of objective truth.  I can say ""I should..."", of course, because it's clear that my own standards are involved.  To say ""we should"" or ""you should"" or ""they should"" or ""People should"", though, implies that there is a necessity that is larger than the individuals being discussed.

You see this *a lot* coming from atheists who think atheism means skepticism, or that atheism implies secular humanism, or that it at least implies utilitarianism.  I even do it sometimes out of habit, or because there are some things it's difficult to say in English in teleology-neutral terms.

So for me, of the two types of purpose, the only one that does now or has ever had *any* meaning whatsoever is the purely personal kind.  I enter the world with exactly zero obligations to anyone, any thing, any idea or any doctrine.   If I am a utilitarian, it's because *I* made that my direction in life.  If I want to be an astronaut, that's because I chose it.  If I want to be a world dictator and don't care how many bodies I leave in my wake, that's because I made that my purpose.

The term I use is:  I am *existentially free* to be a nice person, a caring person, a hateful person, a serial killer.  My purpose is entirely and only my own.  And (by extension) so is yours and everyone else's.

The universe does not, has never and will never care that I or you or any human being, ever, existed.  We've been civilized for a few thousand years -- maybe as much as 100,000 years.  The universe will be many many trillions of years old before it starts winding down.  The idea that any human being, ever, could have a significant role that transcends humanity is preposterous.  Even if you found a way to destroy the milky way galaxy, there are still (at least) 400 *billion* other galaxies.  You don't matter, and you never will.

So all you *can* do is live your life for yourself.  For most people (me included) that means some kind of utilitarian moral sense, which is why we get along so well in million-plus sized cites.

As to the cosmic purpose:  I can't even say *life* is a purpose.  Continuing the species?  Procreation?  Nah.  Universe doesn't care, and I'll be dead (relatively) soon so I won't either.

The closes thing we've got to a purpose, beyond the subjective, is that we're little entropy machines helping to smooth out the universe.  We're not even *good* at it, but it's the only purpose we have in common with the universe itself.",null,0,cdmw3yu,1rfzvj,atheism,new,1

lordslag,"Young Sir,

I find your ability to genuinely question what you're being told to indicate your curiosity and intelligence, that said, please let me tell you some things about atheism, and atheists.

Firstly, your teacher is lying to you, about everything he's said about atheists.  Whether that's intentional or not I can't say, because I don't know the contents of his mind or whether or not he knows better.  Keep in mind that almost all atheists were indoctrinated with religion as toddlers and children before we knew to question or seek answers for ourselves, just like you were.  And most of us were threatened with eternal torture for disagreeing with it, most likely just like you were.  We simply set out to find out what the truth was, no matter where the evidence led us, or what the consequences of that search would be.

Regarding morality and ethics, we get those things from the same place that everyone does, that is, from the social instincts we're all born with.  The necessity to work together in a group to provide for our needs and defense against privation, the elements, and predators whether that be from animals, or other groups of humans.  It is very important to realize that religious people DO NOT get their morals from the bible or other holy books.  No one stones people to death for working on the sabbath, or not being a virgin on their wedding night, or being a disobedient child, or breaking certain commandments or worshiping other gods, all of which is in the bible.  Instead, evolution equipped us with an inherent sense of right, wrong, and justice which we codify and adhere to in order to build civilizations, we call this sense a conscience, and even babies, toddlers and animals exhibit it.  The reason I bring up those three groups is that they can't possibly know about religion, yet have a sense of right and wrong anyway, proving my point.  Most atheists that I know, myself included, subscribe to ""Secular Humanism"" as a moral framework, and I won't belabor that subject here since google will provide you with plenty of resources on that subject.

So far as a soul is concerned, no one has ever located one, or presented any evidence that one exists.  Add a little critical thinking on top of that lack of evidence and one must eschew belief in that concept unless and until better evidence is forthcoming.

Regarding his accusation that atheists just ""don't care"" about anything, I think it's obvious to you that's just bigoted drivel.  We love our family and friends just as much as any other person, we strive to be good people, do good works for their own sake instead of in pursuit of divine reward, feel the pain of sympathy when we see other's suffering, and enjoy candy, music and sex just like any of our fellow humans.

In closing, please keep questioning everything around you and never accept anything that anyone tells you at face value.  Demand they cite evidence in reality to prove what they claim.  Search out more evidence for yourself to make sure you're not being lied to.  Seek out the educated and wise outside your friends and family who are willing to speak with you, because they will have nothing to gain by lying in order to manipulate you.

Strive, seek, find...and never EVER yield, young sir.  Good luck on your journey, and I can only promise two things about it: It will NOT be easy, and it will be TOTALLY worth it.

Sincerely,

Slag

Atheism has no specific moral code. That's because its only a lack of belief in gods. There are no tenets or dogma or anything associated with it. That being said, atheists do have moral codes.

What they fail to realize is that morality comes from society, religion are part of society and ultimately conform to it.

guaboy05,"I want to share something with you, as an Atheist person. You are obviously very young, and therefore interested in what is going on here. These are my simple thoughts, might help you or maybe not, but I am going to share.

Entering the churches (and thy were Catholic ones, since it is a culture in my country where I originate from) as a very young guy I had noticed what it is all about. It is about death, and fear from it. What is the most important part in the story of Jesus? His death. Yes, we are a mortal beings, and death is a big mystery that any church uses upon us. The story of the sins is number 2. Combined, those two stories, in a form of the church dogma tells us: we are guilty of something, therefore we must die.

Church is about our fears. That is why it is so successful. Being an atheist, and denying the sins and fear of dying does not mean rejecting the moral of the humanity. On the contrary; it is more awareness by accepting of what we are. And there is a moral; Jesus Christ wanted to formulate some thoughts here (like, don't do to the others what you do not want to be done to yourself). Existent or not, he said what every Atheist already knows: there is a morale. But, some guys tell you that you should be paying for this.

Are you afraid to die? I am not: I face my mortality, equally like any characteristics that as a human being I have, every day. I know that my fellow humans have the same characteristics. I do not need God to explain me that, via some funny dressed guys. That ask for money. This is how it goes, how it went for centuries. What is good enough for my ancestors, it is good for me. And yes; if you ask yourself for a higher sense of all of this, I will tell you: it is a joke. There is no higher sense, sense is in us dying.

HermesTheMessenger,"First off, I would be glad to talk with your teacher privately.  

As I have talked with thelogians, seminary students, evangelicals, and more than a few Catholic priests over the span of decades, I think his objections to me can't be based on something as arbitrary as how old I am nor how informed and patient I may be.

So, please, if it would not cause you any harm, ask your teacher to make an account on Reddit and then click this;

* http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=HermesTheMessenger

I await a cordial and even tempered discussion -- not an argument -- from them.

&gt; ""Atheists aren't like us Catholics. They don't know about the difference between right and wrong."" This struck a lot of us odd, as we had just thought of Atheism as another religion people believed in. Once he saw our blank looks, he added on; ""For example, and Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head. Why?"" -silence- ""Because Atheists don't care."" A few kids questioned him, only to be silenced and we moved on.

Two basic points;

* If the Roman Catholic Church has a clear vision of morality, a deep understanding, then why is it infamous for protecting and shielding those who rape children?  Didn't the Pope and the cardinals realize what even the most hardened criminals know -- that abusing children is one of the worst crimes of humanity?

* As for any atheist doing what the teacher accuses us of, the teacher only needs to demonstrate that what they say is true.  If they can't, or won't, then they have to retract the claim.  Failure to do so is an indication that they are either lying and/or a bigot.

&gt; What bothered me is that this class and his teachings have put me off of religion completely.

Take a look at cultural anthropology.  Religion is fascinating and as a cultural practice does indeed exist in tens of thousands of variations.  I do not think it is a source of greater morality, nor do I think that theism describes reality.

DerberAuner,"my 2 cents on this:

im gonna go through the assertions made by your teacher, that you published through your post step by step, i hope i get them all:

1) ""Atheists aren't like us Catholics. They don't know about the difference between right and wrong.""

i would say this is just plain wrong. my guess is, it is based on the assumption, that only religious people can know what right and wrong is, because atheists dont have a frame of reference to go from. personally, i would adress this argument as follows:

a deity is not neccessary for us to have a sense of ""right and wrong"". we can use our own minds and think for ourselves about whether or not we think something is good for us or our society, or bad. a good starting point here is the golden rule ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". i personally use a variation of it, namely ""treat others, as you think they want to be treated (i am somewhat conflict averting), unless they have shown themselves to be douchebags. if they have, treat them, as they treated you""

2) ""Atheists are people who have turned away from God.""

just plain wrong. not everybody believes in god, or ever believed in god. personally, i was raised as a protestant, but i never truely believed. so, did i turn away from god? you might see it that way, but i wouldnt. i would say i looked at the idea of god and thought ""meh, seems to be without evidence"", once i was old enough. but i never really believed in the first place. others might never have been raised religiously from the start.

3) ""Atheists dont care"" [paraphrased]

plain wrong. not much more to say about this. atheists care about as much as religious people in general. we care about the world, people and life in general, because we are life, we are part of the world, and how we act towards life will influence how our fellow humans act towards us.

what we dont care about is ""souls"", since we dont believe in the concept. (i hope im not stepping out of line here, fellow atheists)

I am an avid runner, I spent all of this year doing obstacle course races with my friends in the hopes of getting them a little more active.  They're fun and all, but way below my running level so I was simply doing it for their health.  I spend zero time talking about religion to people in the real world, it's just not a topic that I ever feel the need to talk about.  I never really think about whether there is a god or not, with the evidence I've seen as of today, I do not believe that any religion is right, I am certain each was designed for the same reason, to control the masses to make the life of the ruling class more pleasant.

&gt; between right and wrong."" This struck a lot of us odd, as we had just thought
&gt; of Atheism as another religion people believed in.

First, atheism isn't a religion. In fact, it's almost an antonym, given that religion is typically defined [in terms of belief in a deity](http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/religion) and atheism *means* lack of belief in a deity.

Second, our sense of right and wrong comes from the same place *yours* does (hint: not the Bible).

**Q.** What's worse:  
1. Raping and torturing your sister her entire life.  
2. Telling your mother dinner was delicious when it wasn't?   

The Ten Commandments forbids lying (#2), but says *nothing* about kidnapping, slavery, torture or rape (#2). So how is that we *both* know which is worse? How is it that the answer is so self-evident that it sounds absurd to even ask it? Because we have *empathy*. We're aware of the suffering of other human beings. We know that rape and torture inflicts vast pain and suffering on another person and is therefore *wrong*.

You don't get your morals from the Bible any more than we do. Your sense of right and wrong is *how you evaluate* the Bible. It's why you think things like ""love thy neighbor"" are good and try to pretend the parts about murdering disobedient children don't count.

The Bible says that all sins are equal. You *know* this is bullshit. You know that killing babies is worse than working on the wrong day of the week. If you're not careful, you'll end up like your teacher, mindless parroting stuff that in your heart of hearts you know is not true. You're on your first step toward being a free thinker.

&gt; They don't care about themselves or others or life in general. 

Think about this: if people are actually immortal, and this thing we call life is just a dress rehearsal for *eternity*, how important is life? After all, you never *really* die. You go on to a life in paradise that's better than anything here.

But what if you *don't* go on? What if this life is *all there is*. No after life. No eternity. Now precious is life now? That's how atheists feel about life.

RamboGoesMeow,"Dude... I am so sorry that your teacher has such a narrow and ignorant view of atheism. His arguments against atheism are ill-conceived, and uneducated at best. I am atheist, but my significant other is a Catholic that has undergone her first communion, and conformation. I have never tried to sway her from her beliefs, despite my contrary thoughts regarding organized religion. 

As someone previously noted, everyone is born atheist and raised with whatever religion their parents believe in. This is especially true in my case; my parents did NOT raise me as an atheist, but they also did not raise me to believe in any gods. It was through my own critical and analytical observation of the ways that my friends were raised that I came to know that which I believe makes more sense than anything else. Still, please know that simply because you refuse to blindly accept that which is taught to you, it is NOT proof that there is no God, it just means your are not an ignorant follower. Also, your teacher does not, in any way, exemplify the true teachings of the Catholic Church, despite the similarities in willful ignorance and disdain for a loving life.

Back to my actual beliefs: ask your teacher how is it that atheists can care about nothing, yet still manage to positively influence our world through scientific progress and the desire to allow access to education for all people? Or more importantly, how do we exist as a species if, by his reasoning, life before Catholicism and Jesus meant nothing to the people of the time, especially if man wantonly killed each other for no reason whatsoever. Don't take silence for an answer, keep pressing him on the issue and watch as his anger and the volume of his voice raise.

MxM111,"OK, I am an atheist, and for me it is strange that what people think what is morally right and wrong is simply because it is written in the book which is older than thousand years, and parts of it are really old (3.5 thousands), instead of trying to understand for yourself what is right and what is wrong. 

It is also strange for me to think that something is moral and right because somebody told me so (priest, for example), because priests are people, and they can make mistakes.

No, for me, right and wrong is result of my thinking about common interests, about humanity. You can read up on humanism, which specifically deals with morals without reference to particular religion. To me religion reflects moral values, not dictates it. Can I make mistake in understanding what is right and what is wrong? Sure. But I will make everything possible to avoid this, by carefully thinking about it, not just referring to the book and removing my responsibility from my decision.

Also, those books (bible if you are a christian) contains lots of stuff of questionable morality. (slavery is OK, inequity between people, men and women, etc), which many people, even if they call themselves Catholics reject. WHAT DO THEY USE TO REJECT THOSE AS IMMORAL? Critical thinking. 

So we, atheists, use critical thinking and feelings to understand what is right and what is wrong. Not an ancient text.

Also, a bit off topic, but may be useful for you to understand where we, atheists, coming from, atheism, strictly speaking, is not belief into absence of God, but it is absence of believe into God. For many of us, there is just not enough evidence to support God's existence in the way it is described in religious text. 

For example, personally for me, while I can easily answer the question ""do you believe into God"" as no, I can not answer the question ""do you think God exists"". Because it is meaningless question for me. I do not know what God is. Ask different people/religions you get different explanation of what god(s) is/are. 

Does god exist as it is described in the bible, with creation of the world in 6 days including humans? Very likely not, since we know from our scientific achievements how the universe was developed, and how humans evolve. 

Can this universe be created by something? Could be. But even in this case, how I distinguish just an alien civilization with power to create universes from God? What makes God to be God, and not advanced civilization?

You see, I honestly can not answer the question ""Does God exist"" since the word God is just not defined. It is meaningless for me. I do not reject God. I do not know what possibly God can be, and I do not have blind faith that something that is called God exists - I just do not see need for that, and I see lots of damage that can be done if people use blind faith.

In shot, we, atheist, do not reject God per say. We reject blind faith and welcome rational thinking about everything, including morals.",null,2,cdmz7do,1rgb8p,atheism,new,4

LIQUIPOOPS,"One of the things about right and wrong is that overall, most religions agree. There are some things like whether to eat meat or which kinds are okay, festivals, rites, and so on that differ, but overall morality is universal. 

Don't kill people. Don't steal. Don't be an ass. Do things that will improve the lives of others. Bathe regularly. Examine yourself and grow as a person. THINK about actions before doing them. 

Thing is, there are some foul atheists throughout history, and we're statistically just going to get the good with the bad among our numbers. Overall most sane people agree on a common standard of morality without being explicitly told by religion and the things that we disagree on are almost always dictated by religion.

I was raised in the Bible Belt in an atheist (Catholic family historically) but open household. I've read the bible, have tried to read the Koran but it's tough work when it reads like an internet comment with the caps lock on, have read neo-pagan stuff, Buddhist literature, and some Hindu stories. I think in a lot of ways the parables of Jesus are indicative of the Bible as a whole- parables and stories that made it easy for a non-literate population to share a code of laws. 

Overall Jesus (if he were real) seemed like a decent guy. A guy who had some Kanye West-like tendencies like the oil for anointing himself and speech at the last supper, but someone who brought moderation to the highly closed and tribal Jewish society he lived in. He was a reformer who stole a donkey and called himself the son of god. 

That being said, the book of Revelations is just NUTS. I think it's a sign that as an atheist that I *do* care because heck, I can't believe that stuff one bit and I would really rather not have that happen to the world. Also, because I care, I'd rather not believe that someone who was born before Christianity or in a different section of the world would automatically go to hell just for not knowing about it.

&gt;""For example, an Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head. Why?""

Because some people are sick in the head.  You get this with religious people as well.  Sometimes, the crime can be tied directly to their religious instruction, coupled with a sociopathic lack of empathy for others.  Those parents that have been killing their kids because of some religious book on child-rearing, that have come up recently.  They didn't care.  At least, they didn't care about the person.  Any moron could see the damage being done, but they *believed* that it had to be right.  And whether or not they could justify it to themselves only indicates the level of mental problems they had.  They did the damage, of their own will.  They killed children, through negligence, outright denial of necessary care, or even violence.

People are capable of these things.  Motivators like greed and doctrine seem to be the largest perpetrators.  Greed can blind you to all others, making you unfeeling.  Doctrine can blind you, but even those with eyes to see the damage are constantly being told, and telling themselves, that it is worth it.  Because this life doesn't matter.  They are striving for the next life, so all things can be sacrificed on the altar of What We Think God Wants Based On This Book.  And it IS a sacrifice, of blood, of knowledge, of pain.  ""This is my book.  There are many like it, but this one is MINE.""

Confirmation provided me with no answers.  I understood scripture better, but no real answers to the real questions or mysteries.  Occasionally, they'd touch on the buzzwords of the day, but those are the surface symptoms of deeper issues.

The best thing you can do as a believer is avoid religion.  If the truth is manifest in the Bible, then you don't need an establishment to interpret and spoon-feed it to you.  

Read that book from cover to cover.  It will drastically change your outlook on what YOU believe, and why.  You will come across a great many things that you don't agree with.  In times like that, find out why you don't agree with it.  It does help to talk to someone to get a different perspective on the story.  Sometimes, I genuinely didn't understand the moral of a parable.  When I discussed it, I understood the meaning more and then either agreed or disagreed with the moral being expounded.  Either way, it was me judging the book, not the book shaping me.  It is just a book, and can be taken or left at your whim.  But you owe it to yourself to understand why you take it or leave it.  It tells you more about yourself than any religion ever could.  

If someone does not answer your question to your satisfaction, then delve deeper.  Find the source of your dissatisfaction and ask further questions.  If they respond with anger or they try to brush it off, then they don't know why they believe what they believe and are threatened by your questions.  These people are not suitable leaders of any group.  Do not look to them for guidance, because they have no grounds to provide it.

Find your own answers, and don't be afraid to question others.  You will be more at peace about some things and more conflicted about others.  This is good.  Conflict exists in the presence of opposing forces.  These forces are both within you.  They are not external.  They are not God or the Devil fighting over your soul.  They are you, trying to figure yourself out.

There are external forces that will try to drive you into conflict with yourself, and they are most manifest in religion.  The pressure of doctrine, and the sheep-like nature it fosters and requires, is no way for a person to live.  You are not yourself.  You are what someone else is trying to make you.  You will feel it inside.  It will be a sense of unease or discomfort.  Listen to that.  Find out who is wrong and why.

gbuuun,"Well, the most interesting point to me has been how religious people hate atheists more than other people of other religions. 

If atheists have *no* morals, then surely Muslims and Hindus have *false* morals. If I were to believe that my god was the one true god and that everyone else had it wrong, I'd be more suspicious of people who fell for easy-to-spot lies about a doctrine than people who didn't believe one way or another. 

I was also raised Catholic, except my church was fairly liberal and didn't really talk about hating anybody. However, I did ask a lot of questions that, in hindsight, were indicative of my growing skepticism, and my questions were often suppressed or mocked as being incredibly stupid. I feel my intellectual growth was heavily stunted during my most formative years due to constant rejection by others of what I thought to be common sense. 

I'm surprised and happy that some people were put off by this unfair attack. From personal experience, Catholicism in developed nations is like Christianity Lite. Evolution is accepted, nobody really follows the doctrines of birth control, and nobody really believes in the Bible literally. Because Catholic doctrines so rarely matter in real life, Catholics end up falling into two general categories of indifference; one believes its doctrines are true and accepts that while it can't be proved, it cannot be disproved (a lot of apologists are Catholic), and the other cares so little that he/she can be dissuaded of the doctrines of the church much more easily than the standard Baptist, for example. Most people fall into the former, and once you don't care to really apply yourself, it's easier to be nasty to a group of people that you were told are evil than to think for yourself. 

I realized that Catholicism had absolutely nothing to do with morality when my mom said to me in high school that I had to confess my sin of not going to church one Sunday. I was actually helping out by giving food to the homeless that day, and it made me confused that doing some good in the world was still a form of sin. Every confession, I'd have to come up with ""sins"" or make what I did seem even worse so I would have something to say. Once you realize you don't have to feel guilty for just being alive, or that telling your wrongdoings to a priest doesn't absolve you of your responsibilities to other people, you begin to see a glimpse of what it truly means to be moral.

Religion has little to nothing to do with morality. In fact, religion - just like any other ideology - can be a vector for immorality.

Torquemada, the head Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition, was definitely a devout Catholic. Yet, he was one of history's most horrible people.

It seems like you've been learning a lot here, but I think a face to face conversation would allow you to pick up on things that don't come across very well in text, such as the ""don't care"" example you gave. I don't know your situation, but there may be some atheist groups around (check local colleges and universities) that hold meetings you could attend. There are good and bad people in all groups, so hopefully, you'll get a good cross section. Heck, you might already know an atheist or two.

Only do this if it safe for you, in that your life won't be negatively affected. If talking to atheists would make your life difficult in any way (parents, friends, etc.) it might be better to wait.

Cyraneth,"Atheism doesn't say anything about whether atheists ""care"". It doesn't enforce a premade set of morals, traditions, or worldview. But that doesn't mean atheists don't *have* morals, traditions, or a worldview; only that we're free to choose the ones we agree with.

That might be what scares the ill-informed or lazy-minded religious (not saying they all are, mind): If they can't simply assume you have the same morals, traditions, and worldview as them, they have to actually put some effort into getting to know you. That's when the prosetylising demagogues step in, whip these lazy minds into a frenzy and fleece them of their money. Hey, it's only 10% and you're giving it to ""God"".. Guess who really pockets that money.

If you're questioning this much now my guess is you will soon discover the information you are looking for and will soon understand why Atheists think religion is silly and harmful to people with certain lines of thinking. If only [.2% of atheists](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/07/16/what-percentage-of-prisoners-are-atheists-its-a-lot-smaller-than-we-ever-imagined/) are in prison that means that a large majority are religious. Now this may be problematic in your instructors teachings as if Atheists just don't care about the laws why are they incarcerated on such a smaller % that doesn't line up with the national averages of religion. In fact the census shows that around [23% of Americans](http://religions.pewforum.org/reports) are Catholic meaning that there is a higher statistical average of Catholics in prison than the population. This means if you are Atheist you are more likely to care and follow religion and be a ""good"" person than being a Catholic if you want to go by incarceration numbers with regards to percent based on population. 

This is either that Catholics ""Don't care"" and will commit crimes in abundance, or that they have a belief that no matter what they do they can be forgiven and therefor allowing them to do terrible things with no thought or cause of punishment in their afterlife due to their actions. 

So if Atheists ""don't care"" and Catholics ""care"" then why are Atheists better people on average when it comes to following the laws of the land when in the Bible it specifically says to essentially [obey your rulers for they have been chosen by god](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/romans/13.html).

""I thought you didn't believe in God.  Doesn't that make you an atheist?""  ""Sure.  I'm a Jewish person who just doesn't believe that the guy exists.""  ""Ah, well, first night of Chanukah is Wednesday.""  At this point, I kinda flipped out, because I thought it was Thursday.  The whole Thanksgivukkah thing, right?  I *really* thought it was Thursday.  Nope, Wednesday.  Thursday's the first *day*, not the first night.  She was explaining how holidays start the night before.  Honestly, I'm a little worried, because I obviously know all this, and I don't understand how she wouldn't know that I know.  Maybe *she* didn't know.  Still.  She knows I go to synagogue.  So it was a little strange.

Anyway, the point of that was that people don't understand what atheists are.  It's all really simple, actually: atheists don't believe in gods.  That's it.  They haven't turned away from God, necessarily.  Some have.  I used to believe in God when I was little.  Then I realized that the guy doesn't actually exist.  Did I ""turn away from God""?  I suppose -- but the guy doesn't exist.

Do atheists have souls?  No, we do not.  Neither do Catholics, for what it's worth.

Actually, there was recently on /r/atheism a story of a Chasidic teaching (it was an image of text, presumably so that the OP could get karma for it, so don't bother searching) where the rebbe teaches that everything was created for a purpose, and the talmid (student) asks why atheists were created.  The rebbe answers that atheists are examples of goodness and action.  When an atheist helps someone or gives charity, he does it out of the goodness of his heart and not because God requires it of him, since he doesn't believe that God exists to require it of him.  Therefore, the rebbe continues, you must be an atheist when someone needs help.  Don't say ""I'll pray to God that help comes""; say ""I will help"".  I don't know the origin of the story.  If it's actually Chasidic, then it can't be that old; Chasidim have only been around a few hundred years.

Patently false. I would call this an outright lie. He knows better. The idea that he could say this with a straight face is just astounding to me. He's saying it because he's tribal, us vs. them mentality. In group vs. out group. He's trying to protect his cultural identity, and he identifies as Catholic, as he's an older man and heavily invested. And back in the day, he was invested with a bit of force, which has some strange side effects.

Anyway, *INFANTS* know the difference between right and wrong. Too young to know language, or even be capable of speaking, physically, and psychological tests show they know when they've been cheated, and they know when they see others cheated. Behavior analysis shows they will treat the cheater differently, indicating their awareness.

No one has to be taught murder or theft is wrong. I didn't have to go to school for that. ""Oh boy, thanks, Teach, now that I know murder is Illegal, I'll be sure to avoid it next time!!!"" Just fucking absurd.

You're absolutely correct.

Once again demonstrating his argument is indefensible, and he doesn't want to sitck around and lose his ground for sure. In making this kind of retreat from debate, he has guaranteed he has lost all credibility. And that's why you're here. Hi! Welcome.

&gt; They don't care about themselves or others or life in general.

To the contrary, I recognize this is the only life we're all going to get, which makes the life we have the most precious thing we have. It is the religious who believe in an afterlife who diminish the value of this life, because living is just an inconvenient and temporary delay in their journey to eternal bliss. Man, if only such theists could only get to the afterlife faster... And I know theists who feel this way, and are utterly incapable of defending why they need to be alive, or why they fear death. Wouldn't death be the greatest and most celebrated thing? You're finally going to heaven!!! Horay! Finally! Eternal *bliss*!

So why the hell do you care? About anything?

&gt; There. I had said it. I don't agree with what the Church teaches.

You can be a theist and not Catholic. You can be spiritual without theism or religion **at all.** As Neal deGrasse Tyson said in a lecture of his, when he looks through his telescope and contemplates the universe, he's having the same feelings of Bigness as the theists do when they go to church and contemplate their gods. He wants someone to scan his brain and that of a theist, when feeling this way, to see if the same parts of their heads light up, because that's saying something...

And you can, as we all do, fill that need, get that fix for the grandure of existence, wherever you want to find it. I've sat in an autum forest, in the mud, and stared at a dried up creek bed and marveled at the majesty of reality and my perception of it. I think about the transistors of my computer and the rising complexity of the machines and the code I write, and marvel at these mini universes that I create. I find the reality of the bleeding edge of discovery in physics, that the universe has bends and pockets, the relationship of space and time, and it's far better than any fantasy anyone has ever concocted (except for Doctor Who, I'd totally love a TARDIS).

Background:  I am Catholic.  I  have co-taught a confirmation class and taught CCD at various grade levels.  I also earned my BA from [Franciscan University](http://www.franciscan.edu/).  

You're confirmation teacher does not know what the (H E double hockey stick ;D) he/she is talking about.  The sad reality is that the Church often simply waits for any Catholic to volunteer their time to do these things regardless of their background and knowledge.  They do not perform background checks and staff have to go through safe environment training which amounts to mostly watching a video.

This is why the Church has been talking heavily of the New Evanglization.  This term is to attempt to get people to see that reaching out to adults on an adult level.  What we have now are adults who don't understand the faith teaching out of textbooks usually organized by organizations that want to downplay and dilute certain aspects.  And the teachers who recognition that its being diluted tend to take that as an opportunity to preach their misguided opinions.

MartinTheRound,"I'm an atheist, by the definitions in the responses I would be a gnostic atheist.

First of all, I have morals, they come from social instinct as was said in other responses but I also have a simple logical self-interested explanation (rationalization really) for my morals. I live in this world, I would like to live in a nicer world, so I'm trying to make the world a better place. People have helped me without expecting anything and it made be feel good so I decided to return the favour and help people without any expectation. Not to the same people usually. I want to live in a world where people treat each other nicely so I treat people nicely. My observation is that when you treat people with respect they tend to treat you the same way. Simple self interest to rationalize my social instincts. We could get into the biological underpinnings of the social instincts and I understand those as well, I'm sure you can do your googling or start a thread here and you'll learn some. If you start a thread I'm sure you'll get many responses.

Second, consider, you came here to a hangout place of these ""evil despicable atheists"", you declared yourself as different from us, our ""natural enemy"". How were you treated? Would we be treated in an equally welcoming manner in churches? I kind of doubt it.

We atheists are people too, we have friends, families, and you don't hear about us making war on religious people. We might make war on intolerance and stupidity, but we don't take up arms and kill the ones we don't agree with we debate and try to convince people. Christians do burn abortion clinics, we don't burn churches (or catholic soup kitchens). Christians kill doctors we don't kill cardinals or pastors. Muslims kill just about any kind of intellectual, we don't kill mullahs. I don't see how one can make such grandiose claims with no evidence to support it and tremendous amounts of evidence to the contrary. Oh, sorry, I forgot, it's all based on faith. My problem with that is that it promotes ignorance to a virtue. It's not.

We are people, we see the majesty of the world around us the same way as believers do. One of my favourite classical composition is religiously inspired, I like some gospel songs but I don't like them BECAUSE they have a relationship to some deity, I like them because of how they make me feel. We sympathize and empathize. We help our fellow man or woman, and when we do we don't ask them for their church affiliations. We don't pretend to have an authority about other people's lives, I mean we don't tell people whom they can or can't marry, we don't tell people what god they should or shouldn't worship. We do however take an exception to people using their faith to make other people's lives worse. We do take an exception to religious bigotry and intolerance. But we don't try to dictate what you should or shouldn't believe. As you might have noticed.

And most importantly, atheists don't turn away from God (singular, specific), we turn away from unsubstantiated (and very often nonsensical) claims about ALL gods (equally yahew, thor and shiva). To be an atheist all you need to do is look around, consider that there are many religions, consider that they are mutually exclusive, consider that not a single one of them as a better proof than any of the others and conclude logically that ONE you've just witnessed the evidence for human invention of beliefs in the supernatural, TWO there is no indication that any one of them is less invented than any other, THREE they are probably ALL invented and rid yourself of any obligation to live by outdated and unsupported standards.

Oh, and your pastor might remember the ""judge not lest ye be judged"". And yes, I've read your book, and some other books too. In fact, I've faced christians, muslims and buddhists that knew less about their own belief system than I did.

On a personal note, I think (i.e. IMHO) atheism takes more intellectual maturity, but whatever makes you a happy person is worthwhile, and as long as your relations with your fellow mortals are friendly I couldn't care less how you arrange your life. But as a fellow human, despite being a face shooting despicable atheist, I sincerely wish you a happy life.

So, it's a reference to the sky, where interesting things happen like wind, rain, lightning, daylight etc.

All Roads Lead to DOPAMINE

Once it was true, all roads lead to Rome. This simple truth is not too dissimilar from the reward circuitry of the brains of Homo sapiens. Numerous experiments have established that the brain’s major reward neurotransmitter pathway, the road to Rome, is indeed dopamine.
Reward circuitry, the cascade of neurotransmission in the brain that leads to the release of dopamine, is kicked off by any pleasurable experience. Everything from eating, to having sex and even skydiving can get it going. The point of the reward circuitry is to positively reinforce actions that promote the survival of the species. During what the brain perceives to be as beneficial actions, dopamine’s release makes our brains “happy,” thus encouraging us to do it again. Though “extreme actions” inherently don’t promote survival, and in fact endanger it, the rush to preserve life causes the release of dopamine and consequently pleasure.
Drugs play on this system and can destroy it with enough use, creating a permanent craving that results in addiction. Pleasure produced from drug abuse occurs because most of these drugs target the brain’s reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine. When some drugs like cocaine are taken, they can release 2-10 times the amount of dopamine as natural responses. The resultant effects on the brain’s pleasure circuit dwarfs those produced by natural rewards such as food and even sex. Just this fact alone strongly motivates people to take drugs again and again, but for about 30% of the population, genetics is also a factor when it comes to the desire to take drugs.
Scientists now know that there are at least two variant forms of the human dopamine D2 receptor gene, (DRD2) which regulates the number of D2 receptors and how much dopamine is naturally fed to our brains. Consequently, DRD2 is the most widely studied gene in psychiatric genetics and what accounts for major aspects of modern human behavior. The DRD2 A2 form, which in today’s world is considered the “normal” variation, is carried by 2/3 of the U.S. population. People carrying this form have properly functioning reward circuitry, thus they won’t inherently crave artificial or alternate ways to induce dopamine release, such as drugs or thrills. Carriers of the DRD2 A1 form represent about one third of today’s U.S. population and have 30-40% lower D2 receptors. These men and women are prone to addiction, a subset of approximately 100 million people.
Given that about 30% of us are born with genetically induced low dopamine brain function how can we overcome this survival variant of human nature and prevent excessive craving behavior? Certainly, the human brain is the most complex organ in the body— a communications center consisting of billions of neurons, or nerve cells. Unfortunately drugs can alter brain areas such as the brain stem that is necessary for sustaining life through motor and sensory control, the limbic system that regulates our ability to feel pleasure, and the cerebral cortex that powers our ability to think. Independent of one’s genetic makeup, if an individual keeps taking drugs, the brain adjusts to the overwhelming surge in dopamine and other neurotransmitters causing a breakdown in the natural process of the brain reward by producing less dopamine or reducing the number of dopamine (D2) receptors. This causes abnormally low dopamine function, high cravings, and reduced ability to perceive pleasure, all contributing to a vicious cycle of addiction.

The Theory of Evolution has been proven to the same standard as the fact that the Earth isn't flat. You can do experiments in your own house that demonstrate it. Someone who denies it is arguing from the same epistemological ground as someone arguing that the Earth is flat or that fire doesn't burn or that ice isn't made of frozen water.

It's possible to ""not believe in Evolution"" if your understanding of the ToE is the hilarious ""dogs giving birth to cats"" strawman perpetuated by creationists. That's an absurd ""theory"" that runs totally contrary to what the ToE actually claims, and you would be totally right in rejecting it. However, it is *not* possible to look at the mountains upon mountains of evidence in favor of evolution, and the absolute lack of any evidence against it, and claim with any intellectual honesty that you still don't believe in it.

When you figure out *why* they claim to believe that, you're well on your way to figuring our if rational discourse with them is even *possible*.


""I don't believe in evolution"" can mean only two things: ""I am woefully misinformed about what 'evolution' means"", or ""I don't give a crap about evidence, and therefore about whether what I believe is *actually true*"". (These two are, naturally, not exclusive).

ktreanor,"The best analogy I ever heard to help explain evolution are how languages change.

French, Spanish, Italian are all romance languages, meaning they all use Latin as their base.  It's easy to imagine how Latin eventual became these different languages.  When the Roman Empire fell different areas, separated by distance or geological barriers, first started having distinct accents, much like how Boston and New York City have very different accents.  These accents continued to change to the point they became dialects (using their own words, grammar and pronunciation).  Finally after enough time has passed these dialects become their own languages.  This is how Latin morphed into Italian over a long period.  What never happened was a Latin speaking mother gave birth to an Italian speaking child.

That's the key...much like Latin changing into Italian by small shifts over a long period, so has life changed by small small amounts over a long period to form all the species we see today.",null,0,cdn3cjl,1rgjae,atheism,new,3

MartinTheRound,"Well, perhaps first you should ask her how she understands evolution, which is quite probably a flawed understanding. Then you can work to correct her misunderstanding.

One common misunderstanding is that evolution works on individuals, another is that evolution works on entire species. In reality it works on groups of individuals. You take one species, put them in two different environments they'll start diverging separately.

Another common misunderstanding is about mutation rates, many people assume mutations are either good or bad. There are mutations that are inert, and sometimes several inert mutations in combination will produce an effect. So some mutations produce slow changes and others faster changes.

But simply, evolution is inevitable. The logic is this, mutations happen (this is an observed fact, confirmed both in laboratory experiments and in nature), they produce change, whether the changes are good or bad depends on the environment (hot climate, less fur, cold climate more fur), thus changes will produce effects over time. Thus we'll see divergence of populations of organisms. The longer the time the larger the effects.

This is of course a very simplified ""explanation"". Whole books can be and had been written on the topic.

Maybe you can start by watching some of the youtube videos recommended, then watch some of them with her and asking her what she thinks about what was said and engaging in a debate and finding more information when required.

But you should probably start by finding out what her notion of evolution is and go from there. Good luck and keep posting on your progress.",null,0,cdn9qg7,1rgjae,atheism,new,2
SpHornet,"The theory of evolution:

-1- If traits are inherited by the next generation

-2- If there is variation in those traits

-3- If there is a selection pressure on (one of) those traits

Then;

-4- Those traits selected for will be more abundant in the genepool each generation as long the selection continues.

you can show 1 by pointing out that kids look like their parents, you can show 2 by pointing out that people look different except for identical twins, you can explain 3 by explaining that genes are not passed on if they don't have kids, and 4 follows pretty clear out of 1-3

So in words; if a 5 legged lizard has a higher chance of survival, it will on average get more children. you give your genes to your children, so they will be 5 legged to (all children, 50% or none, depending on the genetics, but it does not matter that much if you look in detail). Because those children have also 5 legs they to will have better survival and thus more children etc, until all lizards of that species have 5 legs or 5 legs no longer give an advantage.

&gt; looked into different religions and evolution"" before she became JW, and that ""it didn't make any sense"" to her.  

While the basics of evolution may be simple, there are a lot of questions that come up, that require more than just ""looking into it"". Some people dedicate their lifes on studying evolution. And these people are atheists as well as christians, Hindus, muslims or whatever. And they all, (also) after YEARS of study, come to the conclusion that evolution is true. However, only followers of abrahemic religions think that Yahwe created the world less than 10k years ago in 6 days and all species at once.  
There are many many scientific subjects where the knowledge was accumulated by serveral _generations_ of people who spend a horrible amount of time to add bit by bit of it, so today we can build stuff like computers.

MartinTheRound,"You say she looked at evolution and it didn't make sense to her. I'm not sure what exactly she missed, but....

Ask her to compare the anatomy of mammals. A comparison of skeletal structures of, for example a mouse, camel, human, bear, tiger and a dolphin might show that either the creator has a severe lack of creativity or that there is a relationship between all of these animals.

Ask her to have a look at the similarity of brain structures in mammals. She will see the same (or similar) degree of similarity (in general) as with the skeletal structures.

Ask her to consider that we've mapped the DNA of many animals, including humans and we see that there is a similarity that matches the previous conclusions about evolution. If humans were created separately from other animals, you would expect no similarity. Indeed if you assume separate creation of every animal you would expect no similarity between any animals.

Ask her to consider that the HIV virus was originally infecting monkeys (SIV) but their bodies were close enough to ours that the virus could jump and evolve into a new virus.

Ask her to consider that actual evolution was observed in laboratory environment (in bacteria) and those experiments can be repeated, but creation wasn't observed in laboratory conditions nor can in explain the diversity of life on this planet. At least not according to the old jewish bible's story (old testament). Consider that according to this story the earth was depopulated by god and the only land animals and only humans to survive were on the same ship, consider how big a ship would have to be just to house every species of spiders. Consider that not many birds can sustain flight for 40 days, so there would have to be a lot of space for birds. And there are numerous snakes that wouldn't survive a flood. It's neither credible nor verifiable. And the evidence for evolution is both credible (if you understand it) and verifiable. You might also tell her to look up the documentary hypothesis. It's not about evolution at all, it's about the literary and historical analysis of the jewish bible (a.k.a. old testament), and it shows that the bible has been edited, many christian religious scholars accept it in one form or another and to be sure there is disagreement about the details, but not about the fact that what's known as the jewish bible/old testament is a composite work edited with an agenda. Ask her to consider how after the great flood all the kangaroos ended up in one place and all the pandas somewhere else. And most importantly, if only Noah and his bunch survived who owed their existence to this god, how come the Incas never heard about him. And how from the same bunch of people we ended up with all black people in africa and india, all white people in europe, asian people in asia etc, etc. And the only people who ever heard about Noah were the people in the same neighborhood. Ask her to consider what's more likely, that people invented different gods in different places or that some forgot remembered their god and many others simultaneously forgot and invented new ones.

I don't know what mental process lead you to stop believing, but you might ask her to consider that there are many religions, some of which must be invented and wrong because they don't agree with each other. So we have a proof that humans create religions (or does god want to have a laugh at our expense?). So when choosing a religion, ask her what standards would she apply if she didn't have her mind made up already. Then ask her if those standards are fair and if her chosen religion passes them and every other religion fails. Then ask her why you should not be allowed to make a choice based on such a comparison and conclude that since many must be invented and you can't see why any would be more true then all are probably invented and decide that living a life without the burden of pleasing a god that isn't willing to show himself in a clear an unambiguous fashion.

This is not an explanation of evolution just some points that might undermine her certainty in the things she beliefs in and have been shown incorrect and maybe make her able to listen to an actual explanation.

eritas_si_siht,"I think the best way to really cut to the heart of it is to point out the difference between the evidence for small changes (micro-evolution &lt;yes I know there is no real difference between micro/macro, just time&gt;) and bigger differences like humans being related to apes.

The kind of evidence for this is different.  Not fruit flies.  While the fruit fly stuff is real, it just isn't very impressive to most people.

Stuff like pseudo-genes, endogenous retroviruses, the fusion of human chromosome #2.

These may sound too in-depth, but they are the best ways of proving that even vastly different animals (including us) are related.

I have an analogy that helps explain one of the things I mentioned. (pseudo-genes)

A judge is hearing a case where the defendant is being accused of copying information for their atlas from the plaintiff's copyrighted atlas.

If there was only *similar* information in the defendants atlas there wouldn't be much of a case. (this is analogous to the defense creationists use to explain similarities between different species.  Such as ""Well, a Creator would use similar genes for similar needs of the animal"")

But what if there were typos in the plaintiffs atlas?  If the defendant really did copy directly from the plaintiff and not just research the same information, then the same typos would appear in the same places as the plaintiff's.

The same scenario is written in our genes.  One example is the loss of the ability to produce vitamin C.

&gt;Vestigial characters should also be found at the molecular level. Humans do not have the capability to synthesize ascorbic acid (otherwise known as Vitamin C), and the unfortunate consequence can be the nutritional deficiency called scurvy. However, the predicted ancestors of humans had this function (as do most other animals except primates and guinea pigs). Therefore, we predict that humans, other primates, and guinea pigs should carry evidence of this lost function as a molecular vestigial character (nota bene: this very prediction was explicitly made by Nishikimi and others and was the impetus for the research detailed below) (Nishikimi et al. 1992; Nishikimi et al. 1994).

&gt;Confirmation:

&gt;Recently, the L-gulano-γ-lactone oxidase gene, the gene required for Vitamin C synthesis, was found in humans and guinea pigs (Nishikimi et al. 1992; Nishikimi et al. 1994). It exists as a pseudogene, present but incapable of functioning (see prediction 4.4 for more about pseudogenes). In fact, since this was originally written the vitamin C pseudogene has been found in other primates, exactly as predicted by evolutionary theory. We now have the DNA sequences for this broken gene in chimpanzees, orangutans, and macaques (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999). And, as predicted, the malfunctioning human and chimpanzee pseudogenes are the most similar, followed by the human and orangutan genes, followed by the human and macaque genes, precisely as predicted by evolutionary theory. Furthermore, all of these genes have accumulated mutations at the exact rate predicted (the background rate of mutation for neutral DNA regions like pseudogenes) (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999).

http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section2.html#mol_vestiges

These sorts of evidences are hard to ignore or dismiss.  Unless they want to claim that ~~God~~ Jehovah designed our and other animals DNA like this *on purpose*.  That would be a pretty deceptive God to worship though.

MartinTheRound,"A few more things to consider.

The question of our existence can be separated into four different areas of study. The emergence of the universe (the big bang theory), the formation of galaxies (cosmology), the emergence of life from non living matter (abiogenesis), the emergence of more complex life from simple life (evolution).

The religious answer to all of these questions is ""god did it"", which doesn't actually explain anything. ""god did it"" doesn't give us any information, where as investigating the chemical properties of life allows us to gain further knowledge.

We have good theories for each of these. A theory in the scientific sense isn't the same as saying we have a definite answer. But IMHO having a good answer is better than having an unsubstantiated claim (no matter how definite it is), especially if that claim doesn't help us in any way.

For example, we know about Newton's laws for a long time, and today we know they are inaccurate, but they are accurate enough to build many of today's structures. Some of our technology requires more accurate theories, like quantum mechanics (micro-electornics), or the theory of relativity (GPS). But others work with less precise theories that have since been falsified (civil engineering, hydraulics).

A scientific theory is a hypothesis that explains the observations and makes testable predictions which can be verified. A theory that makes more accurate predictions is better, a theory that makes predictions that are contradicted by observations is said to be falsified. But as I said a theory that has been falsified may still be useful if the error (difference between its prediction and a superior theory's prediction) is not significant in the specific circumstances and the inferior theory is easier to apply. For example newton's laws of motion break down at speeds comparable to the speed of light and or distances great enough. But for calculating automobiles we don't need the precision that we'd get from using the theory of relativity. Since the distances and speeds are way too small and the errors would be smaller than an atom.

In terms of evolution, the theory of evolution made predictions that were confirmed. For example at the time of Darwin we didn't know about DNA and didn't have the capability to directly compare the DNA of various animals. The theory of evolution predicted that animals that were considered related (for example based on their skeletal anatomy) would have more similar than animals that were considered less related. Also the prediction was that all animals would share some DNA. All of these have been confirmed. The theory of evolution also predicted that if we perform an experiment we'll get a specific result, which was confirmed. The experiment was this, we take the same bacterium, we put it into sealed containers and we regularly add two kinds of ""food"", one of which would be ""edible"" by the bacterium the other wouldn't. We would expect one or more of the jars to have at some later point a strand of bacterium that can digest the other kind of food. And this was confirmed. I may be oversimplifying the experiment, but I'm sure you can look it up.

However the so called theory of creation doesn't make any predictions that were confirmed. The creationists don't make predictions I've heard of. But my interpretation of the ""theory"" would be that there wouldn't be any correspondence between us and any other animal, since we were separately created. But we see anatomical and genetic similarities between us and other animals. So we can't be said to be separately created as some sort of crowning achievement, which is what we're supposed to be. And if the creation ""theory"" is stated as ""intelligent design"" I would ask why an intelligent designer would give some creatures blind eyes. And if we're supposed to be the crowning achievement, I would expect us to have UV and heat vision. And what is the intelligent purpose of nipples on males of the species? So by the standards of scientific inquiry, creation and intelligent design are both uninformative (useless) and falsified.

IMHO science is better because it accepts and welcomes revisions. As I said somewhere before, when you successfully argue with religion you get a new denomination, if you successfully argue with science, you get better science. :-) .... science is not the sum total of our knowledge, it's the method by which we've acquired the existing knowledge and by which we expand the knowledge further.

Snabelpaprika,"One function in our brain is to think of predictable things and events as dead, and also to imagine a purpose or agenda behind everything that acts irrational or unpredictable. When something moves our brain screams ""its alive!"" no matter what it is. We see rocks and they are dead. We can throw them, fling them or let them fall. It always acts the way we expect them to. Our brain is comfortable with this and think it is safe because everything is under control.

But as soon as something is unpredictable we assume a mind behind it. This is a consequence of being a social animal. We need to all the time consider and interact with other beings, often with hidden motives and goals. Our biggest fear is someone who is dead, and then he suddenly open his eyes! Our brain freaks out and is clearly not comfortable with being surprised with predicable things suddenly being alive and unpredictable. This would indicate that the brain did a mistake, and need to remember this so it is not repeated. And everyone remember things that freak them out. We often cant sleep for days after being seriously frightened.

But there are a lot of things in nature that is unpredictable. And until we find a pattern or a way to predict it, our brains need to be careful and watch those unpredictable things so they dont surprise us. Weather, earthquakes, accidents, luck, fights. Everything is extremely unpredictable and dangerous. So of course our brains think ""well, something must be behind these weird things."" and then it takes the step to ""well, someONE might be behind it!"". But we cant find that someone. But we know that he is incredibly powerful, he can control earthquakes! He must be magical, just like our shaman that made all those colors appear when we tasted his weird mushrooms last year. Maybe its someone who controls the weather and lightning. And then someone else controls earthquakes, and someone wars, disease, destruction, luck, the ocean, plants, the abundance of animals in the forest. They are all very powerful and magical, so they probably know each other.

Then a few thousand years later someone comes up with ""maybe it is a single one who controls all those uncontrollable things. Bet he is the most powerful thing it is. Probably powerful enough to create everything. I asked him for a favor before hunting yesterday, and i immediately found a deer! Im going to keep asking him for stuff! But i must be friendly to him so he likes me, just like i behave to all my friends. Maybe he wants some of the meat from the deer yesterday? How do i give it to him? The only time i hear him is with thunder, and the only time i see him is in the beautiful clouds that change all the time. Bet he lives there.

If observation A is evidence for proposition B, then an observation of not-A must be equal and opposite evidence for the proposition not-B.

If you think ""The old lady floats when we throw her in the lake"" is evidence that she's a witch, you must think that ""the old lady sinks"" would be evidence that she's *not* a witch. If you would interpret *either* result as ""she's a witch"", you've already made up your mind, and the test is just meaningless showmanship.

If you think a horribly inefficient and needlessly cruel jury-rigged biosphere that looks exactly like the result of a blind optimization process is evidence of design by an all-knowing and all-loving god, then you must simultaneously argue that a well-designed biosphere without all the needless waste and suffering would be evidence *against* intelligent design.

If you think that both A and not-A would be evidence for B, then you've already decided exactly what you want to end up believing, and the observation is irrelevant.

The problem however, is if you aren't trying to gather evidence of something as hard to miss as migrating birds, it gets iffy. Are your tools up to snuff? Are you looking in the right place? Are you looking in ENOUGH places? 

Anyways, if you have sufficient confidence in your tools and techniques, absence of evidence *IS* evidence of absence. Without the confidence in your tools, you're just scratching your head and giving the best guess you can. 

All that being said, other than 'god', I can't think of anything we look for that we have no evidence for to begin with. After all, if it interacts with the world, it's going to leave some evidence.

Here's some common sense. 

The universe existed before the big bang. What we can OBSERVE of the universe, including us, was created in an explosion. This refers to stars, planets, galaxies etc... but not the space they occupy. We have no idea what was there first. Empty space? Something else? We have no idea how vast the entire universe is. What if this is just one big bang of many that happened and continue to happen?

The question that the religious can't seem to get past, is that how could there be a beginning of the universe without something existing that has no beginning or end creating it? 

We don't know the answer to that either. But we also don't know that the universe isn't eternal either. And neither do you. If you can accept the idea that a deity is eternal, then why not the universe?

Just because we don't know if there is a beginning of time and space doesn't mean there is reason to believe there is a god. It especially gives no reason to believe that your particular god out of so, so many is the right god.

They often push a ""you can't understand until you LIVE in Christ and accept his holy tabernacle of wonder"" style of argument. Which is to say that they claim that it's something you have to feel, and until you've accepted their worldview completely, without question, and practice *their particular version* of Christianity that everything you do, say or think is pointless.

And their ""feelings"" are stronger than yours because they have ""surrendered to their Christ-self,"" or whatever.

Without knowing the particulars of her version of Christianity, what she said, and how you responded, it's hard to know. In general, with Christians, I not only try to know the Bibles (plural, because there is no need for us as atheists to pretend it is one book) better than they do, but also to know the history of their sect better than they do. Which is hard to do. You will *almost always* discover that they know *absolutely nothing* about the history of their branch of a branch of a branch of Christianity that goes back beyond the time the former pastor molested all those kids in the eighties. And with a little probing you will discover that their version of Christianity believes something weird that other branches of Christianity believe is utter nonsense. Their argument is with *other Christians* not with you. Once they head down the path of figuring out who the **real** Christians are, they are done...

taterbizkit,"The existence of Africa is something that's reasonable to accept, for two reasons:

1) There's lots of evidence.  It might not be firsthand evidence, but there's a lot of it, from a wide variety of sources -- including realtime streaming video from space.  The descriptions of it are consistent as well, from a wide variety of sources.

2) (and this is the big thing about knowledge that people just don't get) The nonexistence of Africa (that is, falsification of the evidence of its existence) wouldn't alter the nature of reality all that much.  This means that it's reasonable to ""provisionally accept the proposition as valid for all intents and purposes"".  There's no real opportunity cost in accepting Africa as real.

It's the same argument that it's reasonable to believe in wind, your own brain, or any of the other stupid ""you can't see it!"" arguments Christians make.

They're trying to create a false equivalence between brains, air, continents and ""you can't see god either"".  They're trying to rationalize their own faith.

But, go back to the two reasons why it's reasonable to believe in Africa:

1) There is no evidence for god, except for a) the writings of ancient books b)  *a priori* arguments like teleological, cosmological, ontological arguments -- which don't really count as evidence, since they're not y'know, ""evident"" and c) subjective personal stories and claims of inner knowledge.  There is no widespread consistency in how god is described, and while you can *go to* Africa anytime you feel doubtful, many people spend years trying to find god and never succeed.

2) The truth or falsity of the proposition has world-altering implications.   In fact, its hard to think of any proposition that has a greater impact on the nature of reality.  Science becomes meaningless when an inscrutable agency can alter reality at a whim.  It is in no way reasonable to accept this as ""provisionally valid"", for any purpose.  That's not to say it's untrue, but the need for verification of a proposition like this completely overwhelms any value in accepting it without evidence.

BeakOfTheFinch,"P. Z Meyers handles this question well (explaining to 9 year old girl that asked 'were you there' to a NASA tour guide showing moon rocks):

Dear Emma;

I read your account of seeing a 3.75 billion year old moon rock, and how you asked the person displaying it “Were you there?”, the question that Ken Ham taught you to ask scientists. I’m glad you were asking questions — that’s what scientists are supposed to do — but I have to explain to you that that wasn’t a very good question, and that Ken Ham is a poor teacher. There are better questions you could have asked.

One serious problem with the “Were you there?” question is that it is not very sincere. You knew the answer already! You knew that woman had not been to the moon, and you definitely knew that she had not been around to see the rock forming 3.75 billion years ago. You knew the only answer she could give was “no,” which is not very informative.

Another problem is that if we can only trust what we have seen with our own two eyes in our short lives, then there’s very little we can know at all. You probably know that there are penguins in Antarctica, and that the Civil War was fought in the 1860s, and that there are fish swimming deep in the ocean, and you also believe that Jesus was crucified two thousand years ago, but if I asked you “Were you there?” about each of those facts, you’d also have to answer “no” to each one. Does that mean they are all false?

Of course not. You know those things because you have other kinds of evidence. There are photographs and movies of penguins and fish, there are documents from the time of the Civil War, as well as the fact that in many places you can still find old bullets and cannon balls buried in the ground from the time of the war, and you have a book, the Bible, that tells stories about Jesus. You have evidence other than that you personally witnessed something.

This is important because we live in a big ol’ beautiful world, far older than your 9 years, and there’s so much to learn about it — far more than you’ll ever be able to see for yourself. There’s a gigantic universe beyond South Carolina, and while you probably won’t ever visit a distant star or go inside a cell, there are instruments we can use to see farther and deeper than your eyes can go, and there are books that describe all kinds of wonders. Don’t close yourself off to them simply because you weren’t there.

I’d like to teach you a different easy question, one that is far, far more useful than Ken Ham’s silly “Were you there?” The question you can always ask is, “How do you know that?”

Right away, you should be able to see the difference. You already knew the answer to the “Were you there?” question, but you don’t know the answer to the “How do you know that?” question. That means the person answering it will tell you something you don’t know, and you will learn something new. And that is the coolest thing ever.

You could have asked the lady at the exhibit, “How do you know that moon rock is 3.75 billion years old?”, and she would have explained it to you. Maybe you would disagree with her; maybe you’d think there’s a better answer; maybe you’d still want to believe Ken Ham, who is not a scientist; but the important thing is that you’d have learned why she thought the rock was that old, and why scientists have said that it is that old, and how they worked out the age, even if they weren’t there. And you’d be a little bit more knowledgeable today.

I’ll assume you’re actually interested in knowing how they figured out the age of the rock, so I’ll try to explain it to you.

The technique scientists use is called radiometric dating. It uses the fact that some radioactive elements slowly fall apart, turning into other elements. For instance, a radioactive isotope of potassium will decay over time into an isotope of another element, argon.

One way to think of it is that it’s like an hourglass. You know how they work: you start with all the sand in the top half of the hourglass, and it slowly trickles into the bottom half. If you see an hourglass with all the sand at the top and none at the bottom, you know it was recently flipped over. If you see one with half the sand in the top, and half in the bottom, you know it’s about halfway through the time it will run. And if you look at how quickly the sand moves through the neck of the hourglass, you could even figure out how long until it all runs out.

In radiometric dating, the scientists are looking at how far along all the radioactive potassium is in the process of turning into argon. The amount of potassium is like the amount of sand in the top half of the hourglass, while the amount of argon is like the amount in the bottom half. By measuring the relative amounts of the two elements, and by measuring how fast radioactive potassium turns into argon, we can figure out how long it’s been since the rock solidified.

It takes a very long time for the decay to occur. It takes 1 and a quarter billion years for half the potassium to turn into argon. When they measured those elements in the moon rocks, they found that the radiometric hourglass had mostly run out, so they knew that it was very, very old.

Scientists double-check everything. They also looked at other elements, like how quickly uranium turns into lead, or rubidium into strontium, and they all agree on the date, even though these are decay processes that run at different rates. All the radiometric hourglasses they’ve used give the same answer: 3.75 billion years. None of them say 6,000 years.

I think you’re off to a great start — being brave enough to ask older people to explain themselves is exactly what you need to do to learn more and more, and open up the whole new exciting world of science for yourself. But that means you have to ask good questions to get good answers so that you will learn more.

Don’t use Ken Ham’s bad question, and most importantly, don’t pay attention to Ken Ham’s bad answers. There’s a wealth of wonderful truths that reveal so much more about our universe out there, and you do not want to close your eyes to them. Maybe someday you could be a woman who does go to the moon and sees the rocks there, or a geologist who sees how rocks erode and form here on earth, or the biologist who observes life in exotic parts of the world…but you won’t achieve any of those things if you limit your mind to the dogma of Answers in Genesis.

Best wishes for future learning,

P. Z. Meyers

The best response to such nonsense is to turn it back on them, and then start asking them the same basic questions about their own claims including their religious notions and where everyone goes when they aren't in line of sight.  Do they just vanish, like a ball that is out of the sight of a baby?

Now, chances are, the person posing this is some form of *presupposationalist*.  Presupposationalist Christians literally presuppose that some things are true as axioms, such as Christian dogmatic ideas (often Young Earth Creationism and partial Biblical literalism).

Since they presuppose those as true, when evidence comes up that contradicts those axioms, they toss out that evidence and any conclusions from it as either unimportant or misunderstood.  

(Note: Having axioms is fine, though usually reliable axioms are based on very narrow and focused ideas that are also up to be questioned and not complex structures such as religious dogmas that can never be questioned.)

If you want to see a real asshole pushing presupposational arguments, just look up anything by Sye Bruggencate.  Related to that;

&gt; First of all, I think that I would tell them that they need to understand the proper relationship between faith and reason. And my view here is, that the way I know that I know Christianity is true is first and foremost on the basis of the witness of the Holy Spirit, in my heart. And that this gives me a self-authenticating means of knowing that Christianity is true, whole apart from the evidence. And, therefore, if in some historically contingent circumstances, the evidence that I have available to me should turn against Christianity, I don’t think that that controverts the witness of the Holy Spirit. In such a situation, I should regard that as simply a result of the contingent circumstances that I’m in, and that if I were to pursue this with due diligence and with time, I would discover that in fact the evidence, if I could get the correct picture, would support exactly what the witness of the Holy Spirit tells me.

If God were truly loving, why does he allow Lucifer to torment his creations with impunity?

If God truly possesses these traits, we must assume Lucifer operates with God's tacit approval. Are they, then, partners in unending torment? Thoughts?

If God is omniscient, he knows the destiny of his creation even before he performs the action of creating anything. This is valid for entire peoples and individual souls. If God is omnipotent, he is not forced to create anything he doesn't want to.

Red5point1,"Ask them to explain why were the [Sumerians](http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/) writing about the key biblical stories thousands of years before the bible or torah were even a concept.  
And they were telling these stories as they happened thousands of years before their time.  

example 1:
&gt;The story of our poem, briefly sketched, runs as follows: Once upon a time there was a huluppu-tree, perhaps a willow; it was planted on the banks of the Euphrates; it was nurtured by the waters of the Euphrates. But the South Wind tore at it, root and crown, while the Euphrates flooded it with its waters. Inanna, queen of heaven, walking by, took the tree in her hand and brought it to Erech, the seat of her main sanctuary, and planted it in her holy garden. There she tended it most carefully. For when the tree grew big, she planned to make of its wood a chair for herself and a couch.  

&gt;Years passed, the tree matured and grew big. But Inanna found herself unable to cut down the tree. For at its base the snake ""who knows no charm"" had built its nest. In its crown, the Zu-bird--a mythological creature which at times wrought mischief--had placed its young. In the middle Lilith, the maid of desolation, had built her house. And so poor Inanna, the light-hearted and ever joyful maid, shed bitter tears. And as the dawn broke and her brother, the sun-god Utu, arose from his sleeping chamber, she repeated to him tearfully all that had befallen her huluppu-tree.  

&gt;Now Gilgamesh, the great Sumerian hero, the forerunner of the Greek Heracles, who lived in Erech, overheard Inanna's weeping complaint and chivalrously came to her rescue. He donned his armour weighing fifty minas--about fifty pounds--and with his ""ax of the road,""   

Example 2: 
&gt;All the windstorms, exceedingly powerful, attacked as one,  
The deluge raged over the surface of the earth.   
After, for seven days and seven nights,   
The deluge had raged in the land,   
And the huge boat had been tossed about on the great waters,   
Utu came forth, who sheds light on heaven and earth.   
Ziusudra opened a window of the huge boat,    
Ziusudra, the king,    
Before Utu prostrated himself,    
The king kills an ox, slaughters a sheep.

If you want a conversation and not just to be treated like a target to sell to, you have to get them off the script.  You have to get at why they are actually convinced that any gods exist.  So, ask them;

* *If you are* ***personally convinced*** *that any gods exist, what* ***personally convinces*** *you?*

The goal is *not* to give a slam-dunk refutation of their ideas.  The goal is to get them to actually answer that question.  So far, I have heard many consistent or similar answers once I get past the BS sales pitches.  They don't convince me, though I do think that the people who tell me what *personally convinces them* are being honest.  You have to be able to get them to stop promoting the BS over the real reason(s), though.  That can take quite a bit of patience.

English soccer hooligans are a great example of this tribal thing getting out of control. It has gotten so bad that every bar in London has to declare loyality to a particular club, or refuse entry for anyone wearing a soccer jersey. For the religious... these competitive tribal ""juices"" combine with complete faith to create dangerously deluded people. The Bible catalogs a long history of this tribal process and the New Testament specifically warns its followers against it in many places. E.g. ""Love your enemies..."" (Luke 6:27), ""Love your neighbor..."" (Mark 12:31), The Good Samaritan Parable (Luke 10:25-37), ""...Judge not, that you be not judged."" (Matthew 7:1-2) ""turn the other cheek"" (Matthew 5:39), etc. These lessons are ignored by the religious fanatics because Tribalism, not God, rules their lives. Early Christians fought bitterly over this tribal issue and the evidence of these disagreements is actually preserved in the Bible.  For example,  even the New Testament states that Jesus declared he ""...was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.""(Mark 7:24) in reply to a poor Canaanite woman asking him for help. Does it get any more tribal than that? Wasn't he sent here to save the whole Earth? Is Jesus lying here because he was annoyed by this woman? Maybe, but the more likely reason this contradiction appears is because the early Christians were still trying to decide if they wanted Christianity open to everyone, or if it was to continue to be restricted by blood.

&gt;4: ""Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect (i.e., if both actual and potential, it is actual in one respect and potential in another)."" **the existence of the superposition of quantum states proves this assertion to be false**

&gt;5: ""Therefore nothing can move itself."" **not granted. it is not possible for subatomic particles NOT to be moving: the uncertainty principle means that it is physically impossible for any particle's momentum to be zero**

&gt;6: ""Therefore each thing in motion is moved by something else."" **whatever, we'll grant it and get to the conclusion...**

&gt;7: ""The sequence of motion cannot extend ad infinitum."" **granted...**

&gt;8: ""Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone understands to be God."" **the existence of a first cause is obvious - causal chains cannot extend indefinitely because we know the age of the universe to be finite. you cannot fit an infinite causal sequance into a finite universe, ergo a first cause must be present. this ""proof"" is only valid for proving the existence of some form of first cause: It is not valid for proving the existence of a theistic god.**

+++

the second proof... is basically the same argument. Okay, we accept the need for there to be a first cause. Again, this argument fails to prove that first cause = god. There is a non-sequitur involved. It follows that there is a first cause. It does NOT follow that said first cause must be a theistic god.

+++

The third proof is debunked by the existence of evolutionary forces. In a universe in which things can evolve, there is no need for there to be a sentient agent at all times.

+++

the very first premise of the fourth proof is:

&gt;1: ""There is a gradation to be found in things: some are better or worse than others.""

This is not granted. A big stone is not ""better"" than a small stone, nor is up ""better than"" down. humans are not ""better than"" mice, we are simply different. Any evaluation of a thing as being ""better"" than something else is a purely subjective one, and prejudiced. a hotter star is not a better star, it is simply a hotter star. The first premise is completely flawed, I reject it outright, and with it all subsequent reasoning.

+++

The fifth proof is similarly flawed from the outset:

&gt;1: ""We see that natural bodies work toward some goal, and do not do so by chance. ""

This is the teleological argument. 

What is the goal of a mountain? Or of an asteroid? What is the goal of a comet orbiting a distant star in a system containing no worlds with any form of life. What is the goal of a quasar billions of light years away? What is the goal of a hydrogen atom lost in intergalactic space? What is the goal of water, or of solar flares?

Clouds are not ""for"" raining: they don't have the ""goal"" of raining to water crops. The fact that clouds DO rain and that crops are watered as a result, can be explained as an emergent phenomenon of natural forces without having to invoke the notion that this was the cloud's objective.

Aquinas was ignorant to the possibility that natural forces can play out in a sequential, non-random way without the need for conscious direction. An arrow fired from a bow does not fly because the human wishes it - the human is instead exploiting an emergent property of the laws of physics. Aquinas has the relationship between action and intent backwards - humans do not cause the phenomenon, they exploit it.",null,0,cdni317,1rhvy1,atheism,new,2
Santa_on_a_stick,"1. A twist on the first cause argument. What moved god? Moreover, I'm not sure I accept all of the premises suggested. We have observed spontaneous movement/creation on a subatomic level. 
2. Exact same argument, exact same problems. Complete rejection of a few premises, at least on a technical level (especially in the context of his argument).
3. Misuse of probability and definition. Again, he's saying that something like, oh, a rock is a contingent being, sure, but that's not actually the thing that's popping out of nothing. The atoms of the rock existed prior to the rock and just rearranged. Moreover, one of his premises has the words ""could have"" in it. This is not a proof. 
4. This one is maybe the worst one. He does not define ""better"", or make any attempt to describe a metric to measure these things. Moreover, literally every premise is nothing more than an assertion. 
5. I lied. Argument from design is the worst.

All that exists may well be a quantum fluctuation grown very large.

This actually helped to question doctrine, and eventually wean me off of religion altogether.

another positive thing that was brought about thanks to being raised a Baptist is that my particular church was hugely into charity, which was a real eye opener.  the church would often have fundraising events for poor community members, and for Christmas we would do food drives and collect toys for indigenous villages in Mexico.  seeing first-hand the extent of poverty that these people lived in and the effects of this poverty on their culture really gave me insight on the issues that plague our society, and honestly it was humbling.

My school had right around 100 students, which meant teachers had more 1 on 1 time with students that needed it, and lead them to be able to teach a more advanced curriculum. I actually think some of my subjects in 8th grade were more advanced than some I took in HS
Another positive i could take away was I do have a good understanding of the christian faith and the way they think, which makes me more knowledgeable and understanding as an atheist.
Few other things that I could take as a benefit was there was a real sense of community, everyone knew everyone, and for the most part were good people who would give you the shirt off their back. After reading alot of posts on r/atheism I see a lot of hatred and intolerance, and while it exists in every sect of faith or non-faith for that matter, most Christians simply aren't like that. Most people are kind good hearted people living the way they believe to be best for them and their family.

Aside from those who believe that they have to proselytize, or perhaps physically pray in a certain way or at certain times, all of which would create a potential workplace problem anyway, keeping your beliefs to yourself shouldn't interfere with your ability to practice your faith.

This is always the first thing I think of whenever someone talks about prayer being ""removed"" from someplace like schools or the workplace or government buildings.  Not only is there no way to tell when someone is praying if they're doing it silently, there wouldn't be any way to stop them.

This is separate from admonitions in faiths such as Christianity to keep prayer private and to avoid prideful displays.  Posting your faith on social networks could certainly be interpreted that way.

As soon as a penny of their non-taxed, collected money starts lobbying for their favorite (probably catholic) politician then that is where the problem lies.

I don't think suffering is the be all and end all of morality, but it is an important component.  To me, compassion is moral, and a lack of compassion is immoral.

We are social animals as a result of our evolutionary history. We live and toil together.  We therefore interact. I don't see any need or even reason to have some inchoate, invisible, supernatural being involved in our social interactions (aka interpersonal connections). 

Did you know that [chimps mourn their dead](http://www.livescience.com/6335-chimps-understand-mourn-death-research-suggests.html)?  

&gt;One such instance came with the final hours of Pansy, a chimp more than 50 years old who lived in a Scottish safari park. 

&gt;In the days leading up to the elderly chimp's peaceful demise in 2008, her group was very quiet and moved to sleep near her, the researchers found. Immediately before Pansy died, others groomed and caressed her often. One male chimpanzee, Chippie, apparently tested her for signs of life as she died by closely inspecting her mouth and moving her limbs. 



&gt; ""When the adult male behaved as though he was testing Pansy for signs of life, it struck home that the chimpanzees might indeed have greater awareness of the difference between life and absence of life than we previously thought,"" said researcher James Anderson, a primatologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland. 

&gt;Soon after Pansy died, most of the chimpanzees left, but her daughter Rosie returned and remained by her mother all night.

King-Hell,"There is no agenda in Atheism. There are no additional beliefs necessary beyond the belief that there is no god. That's it. Simple: An atheist is someone who does not believe in God(s). 

We are not expected to endorse evolution (though most do). We do not support, or oppose homosexuality. We are not necessarily liberals. We have no idea how the universe was created, except that we don't see any evidence for it being at the command of a god. We are open to any evidence that contradicts our beliefs. So, if Jehovah, or Shiva, or Allah, or some other omnipotent supernatural entity comes thundering out of the sky tomorrow and makes him/herself known, we'll probably stop being atheists. But we are guessing that, based on the evidence so far, that's not likely to happen. 

We do not try to prove there is no god, because we could not prove a negative - any more than you can prove that the spoof deity the Flying Spaghetti Monster doesn't exist. The burden of proof lies with the people making the extraordinary claims. So when someone witnesses to me and says ""My God is great"", I say ""Show me the evidence and I'll believe you"". 

There is no actual evidence in the Bible or Qu'ran. There is very little outside evidence that corroborates them either. A Christian, or a Muslim, is 99.9 percent as much an atheist as I am. We agree that almost every religion on the planet, and there have been thousands through history, is bogus. False. Made up.

I don't understand this. At all. Belief? What do you mean? What do you think this word means (I never get the same answer out of any two theists)? Lets start with definitions, so we know we're talking about the same thing.

Bigger than myself? I'm on the 19th floor of a 20 floor building. I'm next door to one of the biggest buildings on Earth. I'm on a planet, of which I've seen enough to accept it is bigger than me (it doesn't take much). I accept our science that tells us of stars and distances. Yes, there are big things out there, and I accept that.

Perhaps you imply there are things that are more important than... What? My life? What I'm doing right now? Ending global conflict is more important an accomplishment than anything I have ever personally acheived. Erraticating sicknesses, I like that one. That's more important than the shit I do. Increasing education and literacy? Probably the most important of all.

A criticism of the Christian concept of God leads inevitably to the same conclusion.— A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive, to its virtues—it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make sacrifices.... Religion, within these limits, is a form of gratitude. A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a god.—Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he must be able to play either friend or foe—he is wondered at for the good he does as well as for the evil he does. But the castration, against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone, would be contrary to human inclination. Mankind has just as much need for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn’t have to thank mere tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence.... What would be the value of a god who knew nothing of anger, revenge, envy, scorn, cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous ardeurs of victory and of destruction? No one would understand such a god: why should any one want him?—True enough, when a nation is on the downward path, when it feels itsbelief in its own future, its hope of freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self- preservation, then it must overhaul its god. He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous and demure; he counsels “peace of soul,” hate-no-more, leniency, “love” of friend and foe. He moralizes endlessly; he creeps into every private virtue; he becomes the god of every man; he becomes a private citizen, a cosmopolitan.... Formerly he represented a people, the strength of a people, everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a people; now he is simply the good god.... The truth is that there is no other alternative for gods: either they are the will to power—in which case they are national gods—or incapacity for power—in which case they have to be good....

""In this context, some people continue to defend religious theories which assume the existence of a heavenly savior, birthed by a virgin, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world after an apocalyptic ending where there are lots of locusts and plagues and shit. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding religious indoctrination power and in the sacralized workings of the various old ass texts that have been re-translated and altered countless times. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting. To sustain a lifestyle which excludes others who do not share our faith or whom we feel are not living according to our lifestyle standards, or to sustain enthusiasm for that self-righteous ideal, a globalization of dogmatism has developed. Almost without being aware of it, we end up being incapable of using logic in developing our beliefs, applying the scientific method, and in general, thinking for ourselves, as though all this were some divine being's responsibility and not our own. The culture of dogma deadens us; we are thrilled if the Church offers us meaningless exhortations; and in the meantime all the overwhelming evidence to the contrary of our dogma seems a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.""

There were plenty of Christian Evangelicals on TV talking about Satanism on the rise, Jim and Tammy Bakers air conditioned dog house, Rev Al Sharpton in his track suit and 70's disco medallions. The thing is, it hasn't gotten worse or better. It just there is more information floating around today and you are paying closer attention to it. Back in 83, CNN was new. Before that there wasn't 24 hour news coverage and most people only watched the local news. We got our information from the public library or the book store, or worse, second hand. 

Things seem more messed up because you are older, 25 years ago you were 5 and I was 17. Everything was cool in your world (I assume). At 17, I was aware of the Student Protests in Red China, the tensions in the middle east, the end of the cold war, megachurches, the rise of satanism and daytime talk shows, CGI was in its infancy, and the religious nuts were just as the are today.

I think It's because you are older and are more observant of the world around you. You also have better access to information thanks to the internet. The internet, a place where every crack pot and asshat has a voice.

I read my daughter stories about Santa from a young age. I also read her Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Harry Potter. When she was little, questions of what's real just didn't come up. Later, as questions did arise, I answered her straight for most stories, but for Santa (and also the Tooth Fairy) I asked her, ""What do you think?"" I wouldn't confirm or deny, but just let her think out loud. 

Eventually -- at age 5/6 -- she really pushed me hard on the Tooth Fairy. ""It really is you and Mommy, isn't it?"" she said. I asked, ""Are you sure you want me to tell you?"" She said yes, and I was honest. (She hasn't pushed that way yet on Santa.)

But she didn't really want to hear the truth, I think, so later, when she talked about the Tooth Fairy some more, I didn't ""correct"" her. I also don't correct her when she takes all of the cushions off of the couch, builds a ""rocket ship"", and tells me about her trip to Mars. For now, she still puts her teeth under the pillow, and we still replace them with money.

Logically, there is no way to prove a negative.  I can't disprove the existence of gods, ghosts, leprechauns, fairies, trolls, or elves.

However, no theist (yourself included) has ever provided evidence to suggest that any deities exist.  

Further, most atheists don't make the claim that ""no deities exist"".  Rather, we lack belief in any deities because no theist has ever provided evidence to suggest that they do.

Ok. The first cell was just a biofilm that happened to trap some replicating molecules. Not DNA.

As the replicators grew, the biofilm stretched and eventually split into two 'bubbles'. 

Mind you, that is a bit of a simplification. But both replicating molecules and biofilms occur naturally even today. 

Second, it is impossible to prove anything doesn't exist. What is your proof that I am not superman?

We have an amazing and massive amount of data from such diverse subjects as microbiology, paleontology, ecology, earth sciences, molecular genetics, virology, immunology, and on and on and on. All of the information in each of the diverse fields points to the same conclusion, and all of that information makes up and is contained with the sound and completely supported *theory* of evolution. Note, *theory* is the highest possible idea in science. The one that is best supported.

We have seen evolution happen in front of our own eyes in the laboratory. We have watched ring species evolve. We have seen the outcome in many, many ways through breeding of domestic animals.

The fact of evolution (that it happens - we know because of the above mentioned massive evidence as well as direct observation) is contained within the theory of evolution (ideas about how and why it happens).

SpHornet,"Many organisms have similar genes that differ in sequence in certain unimportant structural/coding regions of that gene. Some of those sequences look more similar then others. So you get clusters of sequences that look more similar and other clusters that are similar within their cluster but more different then other clusters (and some sequences that just are very different from the rest).

this could just be coincidence, when you look at differences in a group you will always find this. But the problem is (for creationists) that we didn't just look at 1 gene, we looked at many, and all those genes showed the same clustering. This shows all organisms are ordered in a specific way, and not because these sequences have slghtly different functions and contribute to small changes that define the groups. Like I said in the beginning these are unimportant parts of the genes; we can change them and nothing changes in the organisms themselfes.

Now the argument; If god (or anyone intelligent) created the DNA he would not use slightly different genes that are also slightly different in unimportant parts in a way that suggested similar animals would have the same changes; we would expect the unimportant DNA to either be all the same or differ at random.

Yet we find that not only that those clusters match in every gene, those clusters also correspond to same evolutionairy tree that was already proposed by morphological analysis of species. (And again, very important; these small differences are not responcible for the morphological differences, because we can change them at will and nothing changes)

For god to have created DNA like this he would have intended to make it appear organisms evolved; So either life evolved or god wanted to make it seem it did; either way, why wouldn't you believe it did?

As used in mathematics infinity is a useful symbol.  That's all, it doesn't _mean_ anything.  When Georg Cantor was fooling around with infinity, developing his theories of transfinite cardinal numbers, he nearly upset the whole mathematics apple cart.  The great David Hilbert, at the first ever international congress of mathematics held at the turn of the 20th century, had a list of top challenges for math in the new century.  High on the list was ""WTF is Cantor on about???""  Not too very long after that Kurt Gödel settled the matter with his completeness and incompleteness theorems.  So again, in mathematics infinity is just a fucking symbol - a damn useful one but nothing more than that. 

Still within the relam of mathematics, there are many actual infinites There are many infinities. And they're not all the same size.  There are infinitely many integers. For each pair of integers there is an infinity or real numbers between them. Some infinities are countable - the integers for example.  Some are uncountable.  

Fractals. The Koch snowflake has finite surface area but the perimeter is infinite. How cool is that?  

In physics, ""infinity"" may be the mathematical symbol or it may be used to describe some charcteristic of the universe.  In which case I think it's probably misused.  I'm pretty sure the universe is finite.  (Discrete too but that's another topic altogether.)  Is the space between two points infinite? Maybe.  Maybe it isn't, maybe it's limited to Planck dimensions.  I'm sure to get anargument here but the point is just to enumerate yet another infinity.

YourFairyGodmother,"Whattabunchadicks.  As you can see, many of the regulars around here get real tetchy about ""spiritualism.""  They don't recognize that ""spirit"" has many meanings, most of them having nothing to do with supernatural shit or new age woo. I suppose it's precisely because the word is so often asscoiated with new age woo that the young folks here have such a marked antipathy. 

Spirituality is, to me, one's state of mind and emotions. Attitude, perceptivity, mindfulness.  Sense of wonder, awe, mystery.  Awareness and respect of the natural world and one's place in it. Sense of connectedness, meditative restfulness, etc. etc. etc.   Calling that stuff collectively ""spirituality"" makes perfect sense to me.  And certainly easier than listing all those things out.  

Buddhism - the brand where there are no gods, not the highly supernaturalificated versions - is prety much spirituality in a nutshell.

As to what you label yourself, don't worry about it. One of the things about being an atheist is that all you have to do is not accept the existence of a deity as claimed by others. Some people around here have really strong feelings about labels, but they're just adding on their own baggage. 

The standard advice for young atheists who are still under their parents control is to keep your mouth shut. If the natives rub blue mud into their belly buttons, you go right along and rub that mud.

There's no such thing as magic, and there isn't a god listening, so there is no reason to not participate if it saves you trouble.

If at all possible I would suggest to the parentals that you postpone confirmation until your senior year or something where you may make the appropriate decision of your choosing. I may be confirmed Catholic but I do not practice nor do I care to practice that religion. You will be able to chose your path later but right now you have to remain in your parents house.

Now, I was raised Catholic. I went through Confirmation. I am an Atheist. Just remember, *it means nothing*. It is a stupid ritual that 'confirms' that they've successfully brainwashed you. They haven't, but it doesn't hurt to play along. Go for it, have fun, do whatever, and then walk away with the knowledge that your participation has earned you another 4 years of provisions and protection. 

We give this advice constantly and thankfully the people we give it to mostly listen. Here it is: *Do not endanger your well being just to come out as an atheist.* This means that if your parents are fundies, *don't tell them*. This means that if you can't support yourself without certain religiously devote people, *keep it to yourself*. 

With that said, small victories matter. I made a fairly comprehensive list in an earlier post, but I'll paraphrase here - Take 'god', 'jesus', and 'mother mary' out of your speech. Watch secular programming (bones, house, etc). Decorate with eye towards blasphemy (hang Thor movie posters, for instance) - some of the artwork from other religions/faiths is quite beautiful and the sarcastic edge is always good for an inner chuckle. Pick friends who aren't 'devout' - their silence on religion is enough. Pick sports/activities that encourage free thinking or at least don't have the 'pray before the game' mentality - martial arts are good for this if you need something physical. Get involved with the democratic party - you may not find many openly atheistic people, but their other values will probably coincide with yours.

Mechaniacal,"1.) I'm not sure what you point here is. Death seems a huge factor of Christ's story. It's the central theme. Death, assumption of guild, and rebirth. Death is also the 'finish line' so to speak, for Christians specifically to succeed in their 'Great Commission' to be 'Fishers of men'.

2.) Care to give some examples? I'm not sure what science it is you're referring to that isn't backed up. I'm curious as to the details of your experience with those arguments, though. About the ad homs - this may well happen, but just as often (I'm being generous here, in my experience is much more often. Theists often tie their sense of self to their doctrine) criticism of a religion or the justification of it by a follower is often taken as a comment about the adherent.

3.) Most *people* don't possess that sort of awareness of the progression of arguments. This isn't a theist/ atheist thing, and from my experience the majority of discussions between the two groups begin with charged emotions and only get worse. They don't start in a stoic discussion over cordials in the library. Aside from that, the basic assumptions of valid arguments from either side are so disparate that it's always a struggle to find common ground of any sort when it comes applying standards to a conversation.

4.) It seems to me that theists deny religion not because they are *afraid* that it contradicts the claims of doctrine, but because they *know* it does. That's the entire basis of apologetics.

5.) I live in the U.S. - every day I'm shown that this is less and less likely to happen with about 1/3 of the population of theists because their book trumps many basic ideas in the modern world. Civil issues, finances, gender roles, etc. The next third can agree on  on some basic science, and are beginning to come around on social issues. They basically have the attitude of ""Keep it over there, you're responsible for yourself, but i can't condone it. It's not an actual harm, so I don't feel comfortable banning it either"". The last third are the 'Liberal Theists' who I prefer to term as 'Spiritualists' who really just use religion and doctrine as the vehicle of a narrative of understanding some sort of vague, wishy-washy deity or 'presence'. Personally, I made my way from one end of the spectrum to the other over the course of about a decade, starting in high school. I'm now an atheist.

The vigor, perhaps, but that tends to be where it ends. You could say the same about a person who loves the Green Bay Packers, or soccer, or someone passionate about ketchup. 

The issue stems from the fact that many of us see the harm done in the name of religion first hand. When it becomes personal, it's a lot harder to be ""polite"", especially when the thing you are opposed to it neither polite nor deserving of respect. 

What makes it worse is that many of us live in an area where the issues we see pale in comparison to some of the problems in less affluent countries. It becomes extremely difficult for me to keep quiet when I hear of the pain others suffer at the hands of religion.

My experience shows that intelligence is not a key factor.  
The main reason people stay religious is that they are no willing to change.  
Humans are habitual by nature and we hate change.  
Religious people use religion as means to justify their current lifestyle. They have been indoctrinate to **think** that their religion guides their lifestyle, however the reality is the opposite their lifestyle guides their religion.  
  
So, it depends on how you get a long with your family which will determine how you see them.  
I love my family so when I became an atheist I saw them not as stupid or crazy. I saw them as indoctrinated victims of a cult that they had not say in it.  That is all they knew, that is how they grew up. I could not fault them for that.  
So, I made it my duty to free them, it took 8 years of energy and patience but I did it.

Do you live your life as if there's a god? Do you pray? Do you ""see"" and ""feel"" god in things? Do you ""hear"" god? Do you feel god's presence? Do you attribute things in your life to god's influence? (This is a punishment, this is a reward, this is a trial, etc.)

Red5point1,"There is not unifying reason why people become atheists.  
The only one thing we atheists have in common is that we ""lack a belief in god/s"" that is it.  
Why and how we have that lack is unique to every atheist.   

Personally I was born Catholic, but eventually left religion because I found the ""most"" religious people where the most hypocritical.  
One main point that believers could not answer was the following.  

Explain why were the [Sumerians](http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/) writing about the key biblical stories thousands of years before the bible or torah were even a concept.  
And they were telling these stories as they happened thousands of years before their time.  

**example 1:**   

&gt;    The story of our poem, briefly sketched, runs as follows: Once upon a time there was a huluppu-tree, perhaps a willow; it was planted on the banks of the Euphrates; it was nurtured by the waters of the Euphrates. But the South Wind tore at it, root and crown, while the Euphrates flooded it with its waters. Inanna, queen of heaven, walking by, took the tree in her hand and brought it to Erech, the seat of her main sanctuary, and planted it in her holy garden. There she tended it most carefully. For when the tree grew big, she planned to make of its wood a chair for herself and a couch.   

&gt;    Years passed, the tree matured and grew big. But Inanna found herself unable to cut down the tree. For at its base the snake ""who knows no charm"" had built its nest. In its crown, the Zu-bird--a mythological creature which at times wrought mischief--had placed its young. In the middle Lilith, the maid of desolation, had built her house. And so poor Inanna, the light-hearted and ever joyful maid, shed bitter tears. And as the dawn broke and her brother, the sun-god Utu, arose from his sleeping chamber, she repeated to him tearfully all that had befallen her huluppu-tree.   

&gt;    Now Gilgamesh, the great Sumerian hero, the forerunner of the Greek Heracles, who lived in Erech, overheard Inanna's weeping complaint and chivalrously came to her rescue. He donned his armour weighing fifty minas--about fifty pounds--and with his ""ax of the road,""   

**Example 2:**  

&gt;    All the windstorms, exceedingly powerful, attacked as one,  
    The deluge raged over the surface of the earth.  
    After, for seven days and seven nights,  
    The deluge had raged in the land,  
    And the huge boat had been tossed about on the great waters,  
    Utu came forth, who sheds light on heaven and earth.  
    Ziusudra opened a window of the huge boat,  
    Ziusudra, the king,  
    Before Utu prostrated himself,  
    The king kills an ox, slaughters a sheep.

You should realize that atheism is not a world view.  We are all very different except for one thing, the rejection of the claim that a god or gods exist due to lack of evidence, proof, or reason. Essentially, an atheist views the ""god"" claim as a failed hypothesis.  Historically, atheists were tortured and murdered at the hands of Christians doing ""god's"" work.  They were convinced that if someone didn't believe in the Christian god, then they were of Satan and should be destroyed.  In the more civilized time, atheists were shunned, prevented from holding public office (a practice still going on today in the US), and are looked down upon. Many atheists had to pretend to be Christian to avoid the public disgrace that the Christian community would invoke.  Thankfully, we are entering a time of enlightenment when people are realizing that religion is bullshit and is the cause of unheard of suffering, cruelty, and needless death.

Suite_up,"Just imagine, 100 years from now, the Sunday assembly is a massive tax exempt community. Billions of individuals from all over attend the Sunday assemblies in their communities. All religions have been abolished and the current generation are all raised without believing in the supernatural. Most everyone attends the Sunday assembly and the head speaker; the "" class 7 - grand dragon"" heads the assembly with words to inspire and preach good behaviour for the sake of being good to one another. A collection plate is passed around and members donate to the cause.

Enter Timmy. Timmy doesn't go to the Sunday assembly, he doesn't see the point, Timmy believes he can be a good person without attending and chooses to spend his Sundays reading or playing Ps26 games. Because of this, Timmy's friends are weary of him. ""How can you be a good person if you dont attend the assembly? Where's your moral compass?"" ""I know right from wrong"" Timmy replies, but his friends are still skeptical of him. ""How can we trust Timmy? he's an unattendee!"" they think to themselves. 

As Timmy grows older, more people come to learn of his being an unattendee. ""I just don't understand why you aren't you an attendee! Where did I go wrong?"" Timmy's mother wails. ""It's okay honey, he'll come to attend sometime, he just needs to figure it out on his own, you'll see"" Says Timmy's dad watching his son slam the bedroom door behind him in anger. 

Timmy's girlfriend has been reconsidering attending the Sunday assembly, but still she holds firm that she must ""But Timmy my dad is very strict about attendee values, if he ever found out you were an unattendee, I think he'd stop talking to me"" ""I just don't see the point, I know how to be a good person without attending the events, look, just the other day I helped an old lady with her groceries, isn't there more merit in doing good things without having it drilled into you at the Sunday assembly?? You know, doing good without being told you must""
""I just don't think I can be with a unattendee... I'm sorry"" 

As the years go by more happens to Timmy, at his job everyone is an attendee and they preach about the values they learnt at the Sunday assembly, it makes Timmy's blood boil that they should think they're so superior to him, he finally snaps and starts talking to them about how unecessary it is to attend the Sunday assembly, and how moral are obtained through empathy and not the teachings of some mega corporation. ""Why are unattendee's so angry all the time"" ""I'm being persecuted for my moral standing!"" his coworkers say.
He is promptly called into his Boss's office and dismissed, Timmy puts it down to his difference of opinion, and it causes his anger to grow.

Later, while surfing the web on his Virtual Reality Pro; Timmy stumbles across a reddit board by accident r/unattendant. Immediately he is taken in by all the posts pertaining to other unattendees who have been persecuted, pushed around and dismissed from their families, SO's and workplaces for their difference of opinion. He smiles, and feels at home with others just like him.

ca3799,"I think it is a fine idea.

I do attend a UU church (as an atheist) and enjoy it. Many of their sermons come down to two big issues: relationship and community- two things missing in the very individualistic, atheist world.

I can see why Atheist Assemblies would appeal to some for those two reasons alone. I would go if there were one near me. I like the UU's but I don't really care for the religious aspects.

I think a good question is ""Why do people attend church?""

Of course, the religious go to worship and/or praise God and to seek eternal life. But there are other reasons as well- to show gratitude and reverence, to belong to a community.

Atheists, humanists, agnostics, skeptics, the 'spiritual but not religious' and even some Christians who don't 'fit in' with the various flavors of Christianity available in their neighborhoods might like to place and time to meet up. Sundays are the traditional time we have done that here in the US, so Sunday it is.

Many people attend church less for the religious aspects and more out of habit, for family, sometimes to hide their non-belief.

But having a secular place where like-, or even unlike-, minded folks can discuss the big ticket issues in life such as 'why are we here' and 'where are we going', seek fellowship, celebrate good fortunes and losses, and garner a sense of support and belonging, to engage with others politically and morally, to express gratitude and/or reverence for this awesome life we have, and to discuss and ponder what it means to be human and consider our obligations to each other.. well, that just can't be a bad idea for those interested.

I speak only for my own experiences, but after I started to identify myself as an atheist, for about 3-4 years, I was completely overtaken with a very unhealthy contempt/disgust/hatred for Christians &amp; all things relating to Christianity. Every problem that I had or that I identified in the world was the fault of a Christian.  Rejecting, Mocking, and Distancing myself, like you described, is what literally defined my atheism for that period of time.  It was pretty rough :/

BUT, I am happy to say that I am in a much happier place now… Neither love nor hate of religion has any sort of hold on my thoughts and emotions any longer, which feels incredible, because this is exactly how I thought atheism would feel like since I was kid… but I've definitely learned to respect people as human beings and not define them by any particular faith.

Ultimately, first cause arguments boil down to special pleading. He wants to say that it was a god that caused the universe, but it could just as easily been something that isn't a god.

shaved_neck,"Morality is, by mutual consent of those using the language, the question of what does or does not harm sentient beings.

Because we live in a physical universe, with a physical state of mind running on physical brains housed in physical bodies, there is an objective physical answer to this question. However, because our bodies and minds and interactions with each other and our environment are hideously complex, these questions are difficult and intractable. This does not make them subjective, it makes them complicated.

People who expect morality to ignore the situation, for a certain thing to be wrong in any and all circumstances, are like people who expect two plus any other number to always equal seven. Addition isn't subjective either, but the answer can change depending on the inputs, because the addition function takes multiple arguments.

We're guessing at the objective morality, because it's complicated and difficult, but also pretty damn important. It took us a while to realize certain answers we had about morality were just wrong. But we won't be going back to those wrong answers. Our progress is incremental, like it is in every field of study.

And even though we don't have the complete right answer, there's some pretty blatant ways to factor that problem. For example, stabbing? Pretty much always bad. Don't stab people, kay? And again, there are objective examples where that is okay, for objective reasons. You're a doctor, you have the good knife, and stabbing them just so makes them better by getting rid of the bad thing hurting them? Time to stab.",null,0,cdo0nte,1rjwjd,atheism,new,5

MisanthropicScott,"Whose death is a good question that should not be ignored.

When dealing with the death of a loved one, there are three possibilities.

1. The person died after a long bout of suffering. Having seen up-close-and-personal that there are indeed fates worth than death, death can sometimes be a relief. Imagine quality of life as a scale from 1 to 10 where 10 is perfect health and 0 is death, hence not part of the quality of life. Quality of life can actually go negative. This is when life is worse than death. In such cases, death is an improvement in condition. Read the lyrics to the theme from MASH (which were never played on the TV show). They're quite uplifting and comforting for those of us who have seen worse than death.

2. An untimely death. These are the worst deaths with which we sometimes must deal. There is precious little comfort to be had from religion or non-religion in such times. Family members of mine have lost faith at times like these. All one can do is cling to the loved ones who are still with us and grieve together. I don't have any great advice here. However, I can say that religion in such times is actually downright scary. Were I to have religion, at this point, I'd be thinking that some god or other actively had it in for me and my family. I'd be looking over my shoulder wondering what was coming next. In a better place? With the sick god who just took my loved one from me? That's not a better place. That's worse.

3. Someone who goes peacefully at an appropriate time. There are times when someone has not suffered unduly, has never had their quality of life go negative, and simply dies, preferably in their sleep. Here, I would grieve the loss of life, of course. And yet, I would honestly feel some hope that I might have the same opportunity when my time comes.

Lastly, there is one's own death. Many people fear death and have trouble dealing with the fact that death means oblivion. To me, I just imagine the way that I felt before I was born or even conceived. Why would I fear that?! As I was for the first 13.8 billion years of the universe, so I shall be again.

I do not fear death.

I do, however, fear fates worse than death. My big fears are always about the road toward death and what it may entail near the end. To that end, I have made a living will. I hope that my lawyer has correctly worded my living will to say the legal equivalent of ""If you're reading my living will, pull the plug.""

The idea of having air pumped through the meat that used to be me for many months or until my money runs out is my own biggest fear. 

I take comfort in the fact that as an insulin dependent diabetic, I have a reasonably painless way out involving a very large dose of insulin, far larger than the one that left Sunny von Bulow in a coma for 20 years. Unfortunately, this requires me to be conscious and in control at the time.

BTW, for atheists writing up advanced directives, talk to your lawyer about the fact that hospitals need not honor them. One extra bit of protection that may or may not help is to put in a clause that if you are ever taken to a hospital that will not honor your directives, you wish to be moved to one that will as soon as possible. This may help give your family some leverage to get you out of a Catholic or other religious hospital that believes in preserving ""life"" at all costs.

Death is always a tough one. I hope I've given a bit of help.

But death is a great evil, and I will oppose it whenever I can. If I could create a world where people lived forever, or at the very least a few billion years, I would do so.

Maybe it helps to believe in an immortal soul. I know that I would feel a lot better if [my brother] had gone away on a trip somewhere, even if he was never coming back. But [my brother] did not ""pass on"". [My brother] is not ""resting in peace"". [My brother] is not coming back. [My brother] doesn't exist any more. [My brother] was absolutely annihilated at the age of nineteen. Yes, that makes me angry. I can't put into words how angry. It would be rage to rend the gates of Heaven and burn down God on Its throne, if any God existed. But there is no God, so my anger burns to tear apart the way-things-are, remake the pattern of a world that permits this.

I wonder at the strength of non-transhumanist atheists, to accept so terrible a darkness without any hope of changing it. But then most atheists also succumb to comforting lies, and make excuses for death even less defensible than the outright lies of religion. They flinch away, refuse to confront the horror of a hundred and fifty thousand sentient beings annihilated every day. One point eight lives per second, fifty-five million lives per year. Convert the units, time to life, life to time. The World Trade Center killed half an hour. As of today, all cryonics organizations together have suspended one minute. This essay took twenty thousand lives to write.

I wonder if there was ever an atheist who accepted the full horror, making no excuses, offering no consolations, who did not also hope for some future dawn. What must it be like to live in this world, seeing it just the way it is, and think that it will never change, never get any better?

I could perhaps understand if you were something like a Southern Baptist, but evolution just demolishes Catholicism without even needing to go further from the first and most important premise.

To answer your question, however, atheism is not a belief. Atheism is a lack of active belief, like not-bowling is not a hobby. There is a tendency for SOME atheists to take their cues from science or philosophy, though this is is not a requirement to be an atheist. Atheists do not exert that there is no god, but that we have no reason to believe one exists. Moral philosophy is quite difficult, and reading Hume, Hobbes, Williams, and a lot of contemporary philosophers shows that there is no consensus there. However, I do think that Sam Harris is spot on on the topic of how we should treat others: we should treat others not the way we'd like to be treated, but how they'd like to be treated. Harris doesn't say this exactly, but I think this is the logical conclusion of what his argument must be. If we lived in a universe with only two people and two types of resources, rocks and paper, and person A liked rocks and person B liked paper, does it make sense for person A to give person B rocks? If person A deprived person B of paper and gave person B rocks, is this a moral society? To be clear once more, this is NOT what Harris says, but an interpretation of the implications. 

All people are different. There are things that make us similar in many ways, but people have different needs and preferences. Some people like jelly donuts, others like cream donuts; some people like video games, and others like books. People are very often biased because they play the game of life in first-person mode. They each feel like the main character, and quite often, they feel that they are not only incapable of making mistakes, but also incapable of not understanding what is good for every single person in the world. Treat each person as an individual, not the caricature of the person you think he is or want him to be.

Calling atheism is like somebody telling you if you eat a lot of junk food you'll get unhealthy, possibly fat, and you replying, wow, that's a nice belief system, I wonder how it compares to major religions. .... What I mean is, we don't see evidence for religions being anything other than man-made cultural constructs and we don't consider them applicable or valuable. Kind of like you wouldn't consider sacrificing a goat to the moon god for the fertility of your wife relevant or valid. It's not a matter of belief, it's a matter of rationality. If there was evidence, but..... Do you want me to tell you in how many ways christianity is flawed? Probably not, and as long as you're treating people well I don't much care what you believe in.

As for being a good person, well, getting out from the dogma of your church would be a start. Then perhaps decide what kind of a good person you think you want to be and can be. Do you think you want to educate people, feed people, make people happy? Think about what you think makes a good person and be that. Not because some church demands it (one having a history of selling god's forgiveness and headed by people that actively protect pedophiles), not because some god demands it, not because that god will reward you, not because you fear that god's punishment, but simply because you choose to be. There are many ways to be a good person. I don't know, make someone smile every day, be kind, be charitable, be there for people when they need a friend, be there for christians and non-christians, be they atheist or hindu or something else. Contribute to the wealth of wisdom, learn and teach. Donate to wikpedia. Something.

If you want to know what makes a good person, try learning a little bit about philosophy, a little bit about psychology, study a bit of ethics. I'm not sure which specific books to recommend, but there is much written over the ages about what it means to be good. Plato wrote some stuff, and many thinkers before and since.

This might be a silly question but why do you want to be a better person? I don't mean it's not a worthwhile goal, IMHO it's a very laudable one, I would like to understand your motivation so I might offer more specific responses.

Unlike your belief, I believe this one life is the only one that we get, so make it count.

------------------------

My main problems with most christian sects, including catholics, is the extreme hypocrisy.  ""Love thy neighbor"" is preached in one breath and in the next breath it is preached that gay people don't deserve to be married.  If you step in the way of people's right to peruse happiness, you do not love them.  There is no such thing as ""loving the sinner, not the sin""; it is complete and utter bullshit.  

Another example is that of contraception.  The church will tell you that it is god's will if you get pregnant and birth control is going against god's will.  Yet they have ZERO problem with viagra.  If it was god's will, he would give you the ability to get a boner and taking viagra is going against god's will the same way that contraception is.

xrancorx,"Ahh, the muddy waters of ethics, where even giving a dollar to a homeless man becomes a philosophical quagmire.
Is it a moral action?
What if your intentions were to get a reward for donating?
What if he will only use the dollar to fuel his crack addiction that is keeping him on the street in the first place?
Does the outcome matter, or the intention?
Should we be following some sort of hard and fast rule to guide our moral actions?  Where would such rules come from anyway?

Since as atheists we lack a cohesive belief system, our moral philosophies tend to be quite varied from person to person.  Perhaps some believe that morality comes from whatever society you are born into, or that there are sets of virtues that contribute most to human happiness, and that your intentions to fulfill these ""duties"" is what counts.  Other might say that we should somehow calculate the outcomes of our actions and choose those which contribute most to human happiness (or at the least cause the least amount of suffering) to find what is the ""right"" thing to do.

I think that, since there are probably no gods that are giving us the hard and fast rules to live our lives by, each of us is free to choose our morals and ethics in a profound way.  The responsibility lies with each person to decide what is moral or not, and there is really no objective standard by which to judge our actions; we must each create our own to our best ability.  In fact, I would say that this is what every person on Earth does anyway, consciously or unconsciously.

Personally, I like Kant's idea that I should always treat other people as ends in themselves, never as means to an end.  As a caveat, I must be very careful when we are choosing to act in somebody else's ""best interests,"" because how can I know what their best interests are anyway?  I need to think about the outcomes of my actions as well as my intentions because my intentions are reflections of who I am as a person.  Above all, I need to be willing to struggle with these moral questions and not rely on some outside force to give me hard and fast rules on what is right or wrong and how I should live my life.

Wingflier,"I've definitely re-thought monogamy since I became an atheist. For many years after I left Christianity, the concept of monogamy never even occurred to me as potentially flawed. It was only after I began to study the divorce rates of industrialized nations that I really began to notice that there was a problem.

To me, the question is whether monogamy actually produces the most happiness and success for the individuals. There is also the question of children, and what is most beneficial for them as well. However, as a person who has no plans on having children, this is not a factor for me. I recently read a study which seems to prove that unmarried couples are happier, in general, than married couples. http://news.health.com/2012/01/23/living-together-may-be-mentally-healthier-than-marriage-study/

There have also been societies in the past which did not put such a strong or mandatory emphasis on ""monogamous relationships"", and which were quite successful in spite of that.

One reason I despise the idea of monogamy in the 1st world is that nobody is truly monogamous anyway. What we have is known in psychology as ""serial monogamy"". In other words, we're monogamous with one person until we're tired of them or they're tired of us, and then we search for someone else to be monogamous with. When you look at it from this perspective, monogamy just seems ridiculous to me. I've seen so many examples of women (men too) who are extremely nice and caring to me, and who I have daily conversations with, until they get a boyfriend, after which they disappear off the face of the Earth. They will continue to avoid contact with me until that relationship with their new boyfriend ends, after which they will come back into my life acting like nothing ever happened. This wouldn't be that concerning if it had happened only once or twice, but it has happened to me countless times. In fact, I think it's a bigger part of our American culture.

As a person who studies and adheres to the Buddhist philosophy, and as a person who is mastering in Psychology, I think that jealousy and possessiveness are two of the worst characteristics any person can display, especially when it comes to their mental and emotional health (and the heath of the relationship). While I also disagree with polygamy, as I feel that it puts women (in most cases) into the position of second-class citizens, I do wish people in America and other 1st world countries would re-evaluate their stances on marriage and monogamy when clearly they do not work exclusively speaking.

I'm not sure doing away with monogamy will necessarily lower the phenomena you mention. You can still be jealous and stressed in a polygamous relationship.

On to your question, my atheism has not influenced my view on either monogamy, or marriage. I find a monogamous relationship to be much easier to manage, not to mention I am fully satisfied emotionally and happy with my mate.

As for marriage, I never considered it the normal thing to do once you settle down with someone; I just see it as a thing many couples do. The fact that I don't have a Christian upbringing likely has something to do with it.

Something my atheism has surely led me to consider is the general motivation behind people getting married. Too often I've seen couples get married to feel they get some kind of spiritual insurance together; absurd, folkloric and unnecessary hogwash if you ask me.

MyJokesArentFunny,"Marriage and the concept of monogamy being the norm was created by humans.  Essentially, polygamy is the 'true' norm, as it is in our primal nature.  Naturally, men and women have urges to have sex with attractive people, whether they have a partner or not.  It is an involuntary response to sexually attractive stimuli which we acquired from our ancestors down the evolutionary line, who did not practice monogamy as ritually as we do today.

It's a little crazy when you think about it, how finding *one* man or woman to be your husband or wife is considered the normal thing to do.  Because of our natural instincts, I do not think less of people who are polygamous or who are in unorthodox relationships.

skinny_atheist88,"In a word? No.

IMHO, jealousy and dishonesty are part of the human condition. The only difference between a monogamous relationship and a polyamorous one is, your spouse (if he/she is the jealous type) will be jealous of the other spouse instead of your potential mistress(es). Her ire will be the same, just much more focused.

Now, as for raising kids... Raising a kid isn't a full-time job, but it isn't a hobby either; it's more like a part-time job. And no one person can be expected to be there for his kid whenever he is needed, 24/7, every day of every year: put simply, shit happens. For this reason, I believe that, ideally, every child should have at least two parental figures in his or her life. 

Unfortunately, it isn't an ideal world. Some people marry the wrong person, or find the right person but can't get married to him. Other people get pregnant while single and choose not to get an abortion (or, for whatever reason, can't get one).

I'm not saying that if you're a single, you need to grab the nearest available partner and slap a ring on him. Or if you are in an unhappy/abusive marriage, you must stay together for the sake of your children. What I am saying is, raising a child should be something that you plan for ahead of time, with another person whom you have a stable, long-term relationship with (preferably someone who lives with you).",null,0,cdofsob,1rk5z6,atheism,new,1

Thorw4w4y4cc0un7,"This is just my opinion on the matter. 

Personally, as far as I'm concerned, I prefer monogamy. Relationships and living together, in general, are complex enough without complicating the equation by adding extra variables. I have a Redhead that's quite devoted and loyal to me, and in exchange, I provide the same. I don't expect anything from anyone I wouldn't expect from myself, so there is that to consider, as well. 

Legally speaking, there are reasons to not allow polygamy. For example, in the case of HIPAA exemptions, imagine 5 wives, all trying to cram into a single exam room, or hospital room to visit their husband in the hospital. The room would be so crowded, the staff wouldn't be able to do their jobs. In the case of Inheritance Laws, consider, 5 wives, each with a child, and the Husband left no Last Will and Testament to bequeath his estate. Who decides who gets what? There would be a massive fight, legally, verbally, and quite possibly physically, over the Estate.

I would disagree with the idea that ""Marriage is Inevitable"", as well as the attendant ideas. I have an atheist friend, who is nearing retirement age, who has gone his entire life single. I see no reason why the idea of marriage, in it's current incarnation, would be considered ideal as a one-size-fits-all. Personally, I think those that cannot/will not commit themselves to monogamy, or at least an ""Open Marriage"", should keep away from the concept. There's nothing wrong, from my viewpoint, with cohabitation, and in fact, would probably be a lot better for society in the long run if more people exercised it. 

If you're happier being a Swinger, or even a ""Serial Monogamist"", then by all means, the legal system allows for such a stance. And it's not like we lack the ability to have multiple women devoted to the same man, or even the other way around. It's just that, for reasons stated above, the legal benefits of marriage are reserved for monogamous couples.

Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic?

Does it matter to you which quirk of evolution gave you the ability to enjoy your time with your lover? Or the ability to look at some nice work of art and wonder in amazement? I can explain some of the feelings and it doesn't detract one bit from them. What's sad in my case is that understanding how my depression works doesn't make it any easier not to feel desperately lonely and want to kill myself. I know it's only chemicals, I know which part of my brain is making it so, but the feeling isn't any less severe. Nor was my enjoyment of love any less powerful when I was loving and loved. Just because I could tell what chemicals were involved didn't make my feelings any less enjoyable and doesn't make my current feelings any less hopeless. And my ability to explain what makes me want to express myself takes away from my wanting to give you a response. So I'd say, other than attributing your feelings to the wrong cause you're doing all right.

So when a Christian thanks God for something they have accomplished or succeeded at, they are acknowledging that their ability to achieve that is because of who He has made us.

Admittedly, some Christians get carried away and thank Jesus for finding them a parking spot....but most Christians are sensible.

By contrast, an atheist would say that their gifts and abilities come down to genetics and environment.  Christians would also acknowledge these but again, believe that even from an evolutionary perspective there is a divine plan involved.

MalakElohim,"As a fellow Australian and Atheist, keep your grades up. Since you're planning on getting a university education and going white collar, don't give a crap about school captain's, student council etc at high school. Employers aren't going to look at what you did in High School if they have 4 years at uni to look at.

This isn't like the states where quality universities will go through your achievements and tut-tut over them. Ensure your ATAR or equivalent is high enough to get into the course you want, or at least a related course, then you should get a CSP and be done with all the religious crap.

That said, if you go to the *right* government school, their education is as good, if not better than the religious schools. I did High School in Victoria, in Bendigo in particular and there were 3 schools in total where I could do my VCE (HSC equivalent). Bendigo Senior Secondary College, Girton Grammar, Catholic College. Girton was Anglican. Girton had by far the best average marks across the board, but their marks were matched by BSSC on raw numbers. Of course, BSSC had far more people and accepted anyone. Catholic College had an average similar to BSSC, but no where near as many high performers.

Do your research, you might be lucky and have a decent government school nearby (or you only have access to shit ones, it's a lottery), but if you do, think about moving there, it sounds like it might be worth it to get away from the bullshit religion.

That said, if you want a high paying job, to improve your chances, go into a STEM degree (especially Engineering or Medicine) or Law. Essentially professional degrees, where they directly qualify you for a job/it's illegal to do the job without the relevant degree. Aim for a Group of 8 University if possible. Will the education be any better than a non-Go8 uni? Probably not if you're dedicated. But that doesn't really matter, for that first job, it's getting in the door and reputations count for a lot.

If you're looking for an Arts/Commerce degree, good luck getting a job, unless you're rocking Acturial studies or are doing it as a double degree, that said Commerce/Arts is GREAT as a double with Engineering, it gives you down-time from Engineering subjects, lessens the stress levels and gives you the opportunity to study things that are interesting to you. 

Also, here's an example, I'm an Engineer, which is why my examples all revolve around it: If you can't get into say an Engineering degree, do a closely related Science degree to the type of Engineering you want to do. It might push your degree back 1 semester, which can be made up over summer breaks, but it gets you in the door. Getting INTO uni is the hardest part of getting into the degree you want. Keep your grades up through the first 6 months to a year and you can transfer unis/courses.

I was especially blown away by the quality of the Biology, Chemistry and English that I got and the school was completely secular... So I can only recommend going that route.

The religion thing being pushed at your school I find really ridiculous. All of your issues were good objections and based on good arguments, so your thinking is in the right place. Keep reading and learning independent of school, it always helps.

I have to agree with MalakElohim (I have no idea how to link users) that your school captain etc stuff is not super important. IF your uni even considers that type of stuff upon entrance, just do something in your local community. Want to go into medicine? Volunteer at the local hospital. Or help at the library or organize something that could really help people out in your local area. What they want to see is that you are capable of engaging and caring in things outside of your own education. So think about what your skills and interests are and challenge yourself to do something fun and interesting with them. I wanted to be a dentist when I started uni, so I went and job shadowed the dentist in town while I was living in Australia. 

If you want to be an engineer, MalakElohim makes a good case for how to approach your studies. If you don't want to be an engineer, then take it as an example of how you can approach your studies if you like, but ignore whatever doesn't interest you and do your thing :).

This begs the question being asked. The burden of proof is on the theist who claims the existence of a god. You can't say ""I claim a god exists, and that it is that god's responsibility to prove me right!""

Moreover, 

&gt; Theists say that the burden of proof rests on the non-believer, to explain how our existence could be possible without an intelligent creator. 

The answer ""I don't know"" is perfectly acceptable, because many atheists don't posit a solution to this. We are here, clearly, but we just don't know how (yet).

scornucopia,"&gt; Atheists say that the burden of proof lies with the person making a positive claim that something exists. (Again, **many other alternatives**). 

Not really. Whether something exists or not is a purely empirical matter. Either there is evidence that it exists or there is not.

When entertaining such claims, there are essentially only two rules we can apply: either we work on the assumption that an existential claim (*X* exists) is false until we have empirical evidence that it is true, or we assume that it is true until we have empirical evidence that it is false.

If someone says “leprechauns exist”, we assume that's false until someone shows us a leprechaun. If we apply this rule consistently, we don't have to admit the existence of fairies or goblins (or gods) without evidence.

If, however, someone says “God exists”, suddenly the shoe is on the other foot, and we're expected to assume that it's true until we can show evidence that it's not? But if we apply that rule consistently, we then have to admit leprechauns and goblins until we can “disprove” them too. This is untenable.

The only rational rule for existential claims is that we assume that they are false until there is empirical evidence for the claimed thing.

If you apply one rule to leprechauns and goblins, and the other rule to God, you are guilty of [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading).",null,0,cdoget6,1rl7kh,atheism,new,4

Thestrangeone23,"Once again depends on how you define god. And if you're trying to define god into existence, then it is not begging the question as you had assumed, but rather moving the goalposts. You see we can argue against the bible and it's claims of infallibility, inaccurate historical descriptions and all around just some absolutely awful advice, so if you define god as the bible (or Koran, or book of Mormon or some other holy text) then it is easy to disprove him. But when you define god as a bland and generic 'creator' or 'higher power' that's when moving the goalposts come in. Because a bland creator/higher power does nothing to speak to any of the claims of the bible or any other similar holy text. Also, most if not all of the arguments for the existence of even such a poorly defined and vague god are riddled with logical fallacies. 

If you want to believe in a god, that is your choice, but simply know that it is indeed a choice. It is not a decision made out of a rational consideration of the evidence, but on a purely emotional level and in some cases despite the evidence. You choose the god that is familiar to you, just as the muslim chooses the god that his parents taught him, or the Hindu chooses the gods that were taught to him. Even if you weren't born in a religious family, the supposedly tolerant America tends to have an attitude that Christianity is the only true religion and all others are false. So, if you are in an emotionally vulnerable place, the first person that is going to race to stuff your mind full of nonsense will most likely be a Christian. There's a reason conversion stories often have a 'bottoming out' part. It's the emotionally vulnerable place where intellect is put aside for the sake of pure emotion. So many arguments from the cosmological argument, to the watchmaker argument, to the ontological argument all involve pure appeals to emotion rather then any actual data supporting any one religion.

The only reason he'll finally agree to do it is because his wife will forgive him and tell him to move on, and that their daughter's death wasn't his fault.

Stopped again at the face at 39 seconds in. Is he constipated? Does reading whatever he's reading on his laptop cause such a blockage?  Let's hear his story, hopefully God can provide him such relief. 

Stopped again at 50. Is this really the premise? He's the janitor? I work in a school, so maybe I should doublecheck this, but I'm not sure they count as members of the faculty that can ok student activities. And I'm still lost as to why this should be a religious thing. The kids clearly want to do some sort of play that the school doesn't want them to do, (oh also, no religion either, ya know, like the law says)

Stopped it again at the minute mark.  THERE HE IS! The evil antagonist that is the science teacher! How DARE he care about their education. He's really gonna try to take a stand against the janitor collecting kids after school to help them out with their religious affirmation. That's not creepy or weird in the least.

Made it a good while before the next stop, managing to get past that awkward dance. Cue action music at 1:45. This kid looks like he's about to kick ass for God!

Stopped at 2:10 with the lawyer arguing that it's not establishment of religion, it's just the speech of the students... which technically isn't even really a protected thing, but hey I agree with him.... cuz I still have no idea where the hell religion actually fits in this. Seriously, what play do they want to do? The nativity scene? The crucifixion? What?

Stopped again at 2:16. No real comments, just a lot of laughter about all the locker pushing.  Shit's getting serious.  I guess turn the other cheek means grab a kid by the neck and shove him into the wall. Religion, teaching kids good morals since... well.. never, really.

Santa_on_a_stick,"&gt; It isn’t that the proofs for God lead us to God, but rather that God may be found — or may be shrouded — in the language of proofs. People see God in different settings. Some see God in song, others in nature, and others still in humanity as a whole. Schneider, in searching for his God, finds it revealed in the souls who historically sought out proofs for what they believed in. 

And the bias of the book shows its face. Sorry, but that's just not how it works. Essentially, it's a ""there are so many failed proofs for god, there must be a god!"". ",null,0,cdofopi,1rliyt,atheism,new,2

Essentially, what happens each squadron is given a yearly budget. If you don't meet your budget (you're more effecient than you thought, don't need as much, whatever), are you rewarded?

Nope. You obviously don't need as big a budget. So, your budget for the next fiscal year is cut. Now, this is one thing if you're genuinely being more effecient. However, if that reduction in expendetures is temporary (someone PCS'd to a new base early, for example), you're stuck holding the bag next year. And fun story, getting your budget *increased* is a lot harder than getting it cut.

Now, how do I offset any unexplained non-spending? Why, by blowing through any money on miscellanious crap at the end of the year. Saw it happen nearly every year myself when I was active duty. Not quite enough money to fix the broken shit that needs fixing (test equipment and the like), but more money than you can frankly afford to lose when you're in the military.

It sucks, it's wasteful, and needs to be fixed (immediately, if not sooner), but it's *not* evidence of some christian lie to overtake the military.

Don't get me wrong, I have my beefs with ""Congressman"" Flemming and the others myself (getting told I don't exist/I have no morals/I'm incapable of feeling remorse or depression due to my job -- agnostic in the military -- is always sure to be a fun conversation), but if you're going to bash them, bash them for what they're *actually* doing.

Like you, I'm opposed to causing needless suffering in any animal, and there are lots of endangered animals I'd hate to see disappear (as many of them almost certainly will), but in the grand scheme of things, nature and the universe don't care what lives and what dies.  There have been several mass extinctions, one of which killed practically every life form on the planet.

Most of our feelings toward animals are instinct-based. We admire powerful predators (eagles, lions, wolves, etc), more intelligent animals (elephants, dolphins, wolves, etc), and cute or beautiful animals like deer, koalas, penguins.  But almost no one loves scorpions, tarantulas, cockroaches, etc.  (Though I've always liked non-poisonous snakes - go figure.)

This was written in to the bill of rights and is a intertwined with the 1st amendment and will probably never change, and i like that.

The true problem is when so called non-profit organizations start intermingling with politics. As soon as a penny of their non-taxed, collected money starts lobbying for their favorite (probably catholic) politician then that is where the problem lies.

Sit down with her and tell her you appreciate the sentiment, and that while it doesn't coincide with your view, you understand that it was a gift she got for you because she cares for you. While you are atheist, you understand that she loves and wants the best for you. You simply ask that she understand you are trying to find your own understanding and meaning in life, and maybe one day the two of you can have a discussion about religion as simply two adults with different views.

It's difficult to get new ideas across to the elderly some times. Especially when it comes to religion, those who were never raised to question it may be actually incapable of seeing the world any other way.  Remember that the more you have a thought the more it is reinforced in your brain as the neural pathways become stronger for that specific idea. Perhaps your grandma is 80? That would likely mean she has thought of and accepted this idea as truth for 80 years. That would be hard to ""undo."" however, she has likely had her own ideas and dreams which others disagreed with in her days; perhaps trying to relate to her in that regard may let her see that you are simply trying to find your own answers about the universe. Hopefully she can see the importance in that.

If she simply pushes bible quotes and the like at you, ask yourself this: do you still love your grandma? If so, just treat it as her being your crazy old grandma and enjoy everything else you do with her.

I'll guess enough trouble will come your way that you don't need to provoke it. It is not uncommon in situations like this for well-meaning family members to challenge you and ""put you in your place."" Whenever possible, rather than saying, ""I'm an atheist because..."" try to say things like, ""I have trouble understanding (or accepting) ..."" Try to direct the focus on the things that you believe are problematic.

At some point I guarantee that someone will tell you that you ""just need to have faith"". This will usually happen when someone cannot address one or more of the difficulties you have pointed out. It is also an opportunity for you to end the conversation relatively peacefully if you play your cards right. While it is tempting to launch an attack on the bankruptcy of appeals to faith, I have found that very often a better response is to say, ""well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that."" If said calmly and pleasantly, the other people may give up, at least until another time.

It really really shook me and for the first time in my life I asked ""why did he deserve this"" He smoked earlier in his life but had quit for years.. the next question was simply ""what kind of loving god would put someone through this"" and from there I got angry because the answers I found were it was because of original sin. Simply put my Dad died of Cancer because some bitch and asshole ate an apple they shouldn't of 3,000 years ago.

I then thought about other religions and how each religion thinks they are right and then thought why I am right.. it was chance I was born where i was, so a person living in a remote jungle on the other side of the world who is not exposed to Christianity would burn in hell because they were not exposed to it?

For me really came down to 1 basic question. Does this make sense? I then applied it to a lot of what I was taught and came to the conclusion that I could no longer accept that there was a specific religious god (i actually do not believe there is any kind of supreme being) because frankly it did not make any sense.

xKaylaTaylor,"* First, letting your wife know:

When I decided that I should tell my SO about my change in what I identified myself as, I started by telling them that I'm not sure what I believed in was true anymore. I moved that conversation towards that I could not call myself a Christian anymore, and instead am an atheist (to simplify it because most people won't understand agnostic atheism, Humanism, or skepticism). 

Of course it will come with a negative reaction most of the time, if they are truly Christian and aren't keeping their non-belief from you. I encountered many fights over that fact that I changed religion to non-belief, including my SO saying that I was lying, that I was joking, that my SO did not need to know that non-belief was an option, and my SO saying I was still Catholic. 

Just prepare for some fights and the storm will eventually settle. Most people will get over the fact that you aren't Christian and understand that it doesn't matter, unless they are a extremely right-wing Christian (morals come from Christianity, Gays will burn, everyone must believe what I do). Most Christians these days aren't right-wing and will accept people who they are, no matter their religious or sexual preferences, so hopefully your marriage won't have but a tiny bump discussing your new-found (non)religious identify.


* Second, raising your kids:

Think about how you grew up. Chances are you were born into a family with both parents believing in Christianity, (since you hinted towards your wife being Christian), as I did, and we managed to make our way towards Atheism/Agnosticism. That being said, we are probably two of the few that make it past that. I don't think that if your wife starts wanting you and your children to attend church that it's the end of the world. You can always talk to your children, and tell them to be skeptical of what they hear from others, to always ask questions, and come talk to you if they need any help.

.

I am sorry you had to deal with the stress of realizing everything you grew up with about your beliefs may not be true, but I am happy you took the red pill.

Maybe you could sit down with her and go slow, explain to her what made you question your faith and come to your conclusions and listen to her. It's not going to be easy, and depending on her in may or may not work. But it's possible for religious people to love and live with non-religious people. You'll need to be patient. This will be a shock to her. In part that's a perfectly normal reaction, after all, she has a complete picture (right or wrong) of what it means to be a christian and what it means not to be one, and she also has a picture of who you are and she thinks of you not believing any more as if you'd suddenly changed. You'll need to overcome all of that. There is a lot of emotion invested in our world view, and in our loved ones especially. And you'll have to overcome many indoctrinated views on top of that. Many christians can't imagine a person being moral without the bible. Those can be helped more easily. Some christians would say they are afraid for your soul. That's more difficult to argue against without arguing against religion. You can say that if there is a good and loving god, he would know what I deserve. But it may or may not work.

But children don't just learn at home and don't just learn in church and don't just learn in school and don't just learn from one parent. Another thing to consider is that religion is just one part of a person. I've met perfectly nice and perfectly reasonable believers, kind and generous. And I've met complete assholes, intolerant miserly bigots. My mother was religious and she taught me to value education and to help. She never once said I should do anything because of a religion. I learned from her words and her example. You can teach them to be critical in their thinking while they believe, there isn't as much of an inherent contradiction as some people imagine. Sure, there is some contradiction, but not as much as some intolerant people would like us to believe. But as long as you give them the ability and the desire to seek questions they'll be able to. That's my humble opinion. Teach them so they might learn. Nurture them so they might grow. Support them so they might succeed.

PS, your children are people too, they have just as much of a right to be religious as they do to be atheist or to follow a different religion. Just because I am an atheist and am sure religion is BS doesn't give me the right to deny people a personal choice. I argue against religion all the time, but I respect sincere choice.

It's one thing to avoid being lumped into a group by not participating and another to join in with insults in order to feel like ""one of the group."" Don't call out your brother in front of the family. We shouldn't act like assholes. That's going to make him feel betrayed or escalate his behavior. It may even start your family picking on him as well. Even though it would be ""equal treatment,"" you would have made things worse.
What you can do is just talk to him like you did when you two were alone. Don't just ""get over it."" This is a bully mentality: if a kid was being bullied and his friend didn't want to be lumped with the bullies, we would all agree that he would become just like the bullies for a time if that friend joined in, even if he wasn't REALLY a bully. Talk to him face to face. Tell him how you feel. Even if your brother is the annoying brother type, he should be open to receiving you. But don't accuse him or anything, just explain to him that he is not helping. Use the bully analogy if you want. But make sure you are heartfelt and not aggressive (this turns people away). This is more a psychology issue, but truthfully, psychology is one of the greatest ways to get to people. Then if it goes well you should ask him to do whatever you want him to do to stop what he's doing. Just pay attention to his comfort level as well; it's hard to act when you are afraid.

TL;DR your brother is acting like a bully because he's afraid and you should talk to him alone, but honestly and gently. And move on from there.

I'm not a psychologist or anything (though I'd like to be) so even if people tell me that my advice is almost always sound, you should still take it with your situation in mind.

In fact, they are not.

Although the chapter 125 can teoretically be penalized with a forced labor sentence for up to 1 year, such kind of punishment is only reserved for medical personnel who refused treatment despite being obliged to provide it etc.

Thorw4w4y4cc0un7,"Here's my experience, as far as In-Laws go.

For one, it was a bad idea to just come out and say, in essence, ""Yeah, we're having sex. Hot, steamy, bangin' sex. And she's tighter than an overapplied tourniquet."" That's their kid, and even if you just said, ""Yes, we're having sex."" the above is precisely what they will end up hearing.

As for the hostility, back off of the mother. Next year, if you're still together, propose going to meet with your family. It's not unheard of to alternate years, and your Gf's Mother *should* be understanding, in that given this year, you visited them, it's only fair she visit your family next year. The next year after that, if you're still together, give her Family another round. If they're still hostile, then simply stick to visiting your family, but allow the Gf to visit hers, with the option of coming with you to visit yours. Or, why not start doing your own, private, Thanksgiving Dinner-for-Two? When the Mother begins asking why you don't come for Thanksgiving Dinner anymore, simply have the Gf explain, ""He's sick of the hostility he gets treated with, so rather than come and spoil everyone's holiday by putting them in such a bad mood, he has excused himself from our presence. Perhaps if he were treated a bit nicer when he was here, instead of being glared at all the time...now who wants Dressing?""

As for Mother hurting your relationship on down the road, it would depend on how tightly knit her mother is with her, and how seriously Daughter takes her mother's suggestions, in this arena. I am assuming your Gf knows about you being an atheist. If Gf loves you, despite knowing this, she should love you enough to stick up for you, should people start badtalking you behind your back. There's no reason why Mother-in-Law should interfere with your own life, but it happens, and people let it happen. You can't control what goes on under her roof, but under your own, you make the rules(In junction with your Gf, I hope).

I think if you drop the reveal at this point, though, you stand to gain little, and lose quite a bit. Dropping the a-Bomb at this point, would ensure the hostility would most likely continue, and from what I see, you're wanting to build bridges, not incinerate them. Save the Big-A for a time when things are a bit smoother. 

Something we may be overlooking, is that it's entirely possible that this hostility is not intended. It's a well-known social dynamic in Pack Structures (Which are quite similar to Human Family Structures) that outsiders are potential interlopers, and thus not to be trusted until they have earned the approval of the Pack. Despite our evolution into intelligent social primates, we still have quite a bit of that reptilian brain left over, just enough to keep us acting on feral instinct when we are not aware of it. Sometimes it's a good thing, like when we get that gut feeling not to go down that dark alleyway before we realize it's a dark alleyway. Other times, it leads to inconveniences. Hence why I suggested the above scenario of alternating visiting years. That way, it gives you time to work out precisely why she's being hostile, because, despite appearances, it's possible she may not even be aware she's doing it.

Just some food for thought. Hopefully she'll realize that a) she's not losing a daughter, she's gaining a son, and b) acting hostile, assuming the two of you are devoted enough to break from the Pack and forge your own path, is just going to lose her both.",null,0,cdow37m,1rmqxq,atheism,new,2

Part 1

**Neither Veil nor Submission
Maryam Namazie**

The niqab (and burqa) must be banned to protect women’s rights and secularism – and not just out of concern for security. It’s a shroud, strait jacket, and mobile prison for women and girls who are bound and gagged and made invisible. According to Algerian writer Karima Bennoune, the veil represents ‘the ever-encroaching fabric erasure of women’s bodies.’

Calling it a ‘right’ and ‘choice’ is as formal as formal can be when it is often deemed compulsory and imposed and policed by Islamists – often using brute force. Also, let’s not forget, the veil is a tool like many others to control and restrict women and girls. To me, saying it is a right and choice is like saying FGM, the chastity belt, foot-binding, or Suttee are such.

A ban is not a violation of the right to religion. Whilst the right to religion and belief is absolute, the right to manifest and express one’s beliefs can be and is at times restricted for a number of reasons, including protecting public security, health, order, and the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.

Men in Shi’a Islam might have the ‘right’ and ‘choice’ to marry four permanent wives and unlimited temporary wives, for example, but it is nonetheless banned in many places because it is deemed to be exploitative. Uniforms are another way in which the right to dress is restricted in society for health reasons.

The European Court of Human Rights confirmed this when it ruled in favour of Turkey’s right to ban the veil at universities (now under question due to Erdogan’s efforts to Islamicise the country). If dress can be restricted to protect health or public safety, why not to protect women’s rights and secularism?

Moreover, rights often conflict with one another. What about the adverse impact of the niqab and burqa on the rights and choices of unveiled or differently veiled women? It is not as harmless as is often portrayed. In the Shabina Begum case, the House of Lords granted that restricting Shabina from wearing the jilbab to school was permissible in order to protect the rights of others who feared being coerced into veiling. As Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas says: “The ‘right’ to veil is always followed with the right to beat up women who do not.” Clearly, the right to veil has a corresponding right to unveil or not veil at all. The unveiled or improperly veiled woman is always held up adversely in comparison to the chaste, veiled woman.

Moreover, this is more than merely a question of ‘dress.’ It is important to remember that the niqab (as well as the burqa and the veil in general) is a highly contested political and social symbol. Many Muslims or those labelled as such are at the forefront of the fight against the burqa, niqab and veil – often at great risk to themselves.

In Iran, the slogan ‘neither veil nor submission’ has become a rallying cry in the ongoing fight between women and Islamic regime’s morality police. In another recent case in Sudan, Amira Osman Hamed who faces flogging for refusing to wear the hijab says: ‘I’m Sudanese. I’m Muslim, and I’m not going to cover my head.’In this day and age, the veil in general and the burka and niqab in particular are associated with Islamism’s efforts to limit rights and impose Sharia law. The enormous increase of veiled women and girls across the world and in Europe is a direct result of the rise of the contemporary Islamist movement and the ensuing pressure on women and girls to veil. Women are always the first targets of Islamism. And veiling restrictions on women is a particular signifier of things to come. The lawyer putting forth Turkey’s case for restricting the veil at universities said it well: ‘the hijab is not just a dress but a sign of political conviction; it shows near and present danger.’

A good case in point is Madani Free school in Derby where girls as young as 11 have to wear the burqa; all teachers, including non-Muslims, must wear the veil. Those who criticise the fuss over a ‘piece of clothing’ miss the point. The niqab and burqa are the most visible signs of Islamism’s war on women. It also represents sex apartheid and Sharia law and all that follows. In Madani School, burqa-clad girls must sit in the back of the classroom. On school trips, they must give way to boys and male teachers who cut in front of them in queues. Music is banned… (As an aside, child veiling is tantamount to child abuse. In the same way that children are not labelled Conservative or Marxist children because of their parents’ political beliefs, children should also be free of religious labels and faith schools until they are ready to make a choice of their own upon reaching 16.)

Calling for a ban on the niqab or burqa is not about criminalising Muslim women anymore than banning FGM criminalises girls and women who are mutilated. Whilst a ban won’t solve everything (there has yet to be a single prosecution with regards FGM) changes in the law, including bans, are important steps in changing culture and attitudes and defending rights.

Moreover, calling for a ban is not about cultural imperialism or colonialism. Islamist efforts in many places are forms of colonialism too. The burqa and niqab are not traditional forms of dress but newly imposed ones for a majority of contexts. Plus there are bans on the niqab or veil in a number of countries outside of Europe. This is not about East versus West. In Egypt, the Ministry of Health has prohibited the wearing of the niqab by nurses in hospitals. Egypt’s top Islamic school, al-Azhar, has issued a ban on wearing the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes. Al Azhar also obliges women to show their faces in court via a decree issued in 1880. In Iraq, the niqab has been banned by a fatwa. In Kuwait, women wearing the niqab have been banned from driving. In Azerbaijan and Tunisia, veils are banned from public buildings and schools. In Syria, until recently, teachers were banned from wearing the niqab…

Unfortunately, many secularists in Europe have shown a lack of clarity and moral courage when it comes to banning the burqa and niqab. Secularism is a human right (as philosopher AC Grayling says) and one that needs to be actively defended, promoted, and articulated; it is a fundamental precondition for women’s rights and equality.

Secularists have a responsibility to seize the initiative (particularly given the far-Right’s attempts at hijacking the issue to promote their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim bigotry). Calling for a ban is not in and of itself racist though racism and prejudice are very real and need to be opposed on par with sex discrimination.

A ban has nothing to do with a ‘clash of civilisations;’ it has everything to do with a global struggle between secularists, including many Muslims, on the one hand and theocrats and the religious-Right on the other.

A Manifesto against Totalitarianism which I signed in 2006 with 11 others including Salman Rushdie on the Danish cartoon controversy still applies today:

“We reject the ‘cultural relativism’ which implies an acceptance that men and women of Muslim culture are deprived of the right to equality, freedom and secularism in the name of the respect for certain cultures and traditions.

“We refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of ‘Islamophobia,’ a wretched concept that confuses criticism of Islam as a religion and stigmatisation of those who believe in it.”

And to that I must add the wretched concept that confuses a criticism of the niqab, burqa and veil as a stigmatisation of those who believe in it and wear it…

You're being nice, but you're not being *respectful*. You're judging. You may not be judging in a hateful ""all atheists are evil"" kind of way, but you're still judging in an ""all atheists need to hear the Good Word"" kind of way.

Speaking for myself, I don't. telling me that God loves me doesn't make me feel touched and grateful, it leaves me feeling like I've just been talked down to, like I've had my entire life philosophy ignored in one pleasant but dismissive sentence.

If I were to sign off an open letter to Christians with: ""Remember - you may not agree, but God doesn't exist so we're all free to guide our own destinies and that's wonderful"" would you feel like you had been respected?

You life view is your own, and you don't need to defend yourself against the excesses of other people. You believe in God and Jesus and so on? Great! I can't share your beliefs and if you were to invite me to do so I would explain why I think they aren't worth believing in, but ultimately it's no business of mine how you view the universe, and I'd have to be a deeply unfair person to equate any one Christian with any other Christian just because of their shared theology. 

You're a nice person, and I'd take you up on that kayak fishing offer if I could get to Florida. I don't judge you for the actions of a pair of hotel owners in Cornwall.

Do people act positively in society for religious reasons?  Yes.

That's not in dispute.  Though, is there a good reason to promote religious organizations and individuals beyond how they already promote their own virtues?

* ***Is religion a net-positive on society?***

I say it is not, and I think that the case that it is not can be made with using the best available evidence.

Here are some of my notes and some databases that can be used to check the evidence;

* http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/forums/index.php/topic,2076

Also, we can ask questions about morality. 

* Here is a repost of mine on that topic;

-----

What you are asking is that we trade good deeds done to one group for bad deeds done to another -- or in this case, done to the same group.  While I see the need to compromise, I want you to realize that what you are asking is unethical even if it results in some people benefiting.

Consider this;

---------------------------

* ***If religion is a net-negative, and I think it is demonstrably a net-negative, then why not criticize it as a whole without having to constantly say there are some good things about it?***  

There are plenty of good things about the tobacco industry, yet that does not mean that those good things should be emphasized in all discussions to have some sort of balance or fairness.  (My notes, including databases that can be used to examine the issue: http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/forums/index.php/topic,2076 )

In addition, I pose this question to many religious theists;

* How many good deeds done to one group of people make up for the bad deeds done to another?

The answer may seem so obvious that it is silly.  It should seem obvious.  Yet, it is not.  The issue of vicarious redemption or forgiveness permeates some religions (ex: 'Jesus died for your sins', 'you can ask God for forgiveness for deeds done to others', ...).

Here are some comments that I made in another thread with the above part in context;

-----------

If you walk out of a grocery store and a kids club has a table where they are selling cookies, should you buy the cookies?

If you know nothing about the kids club, you will casually make an assessment and buy them depending on your mood, what your views of kids clubs are, and/or what they are selling. There are no special responsibilities involved, and no deep moral issues.

You may even get a lift out of supporting what you see is a small contribution to the grand effort at building tomorrows leaders. You feel responsible for their success, however small your individual contribution. Every bit counts, after all!

Yet, let's say that you learned earlier in the day that the kids club will use the profits of the cookie sales for their summer camp program, to help with a soup kitchen, and to fund new robes for the local chapter of the KKK (Ku Klux Klan).

Assuming that you see the last item on the list as a bad thing, do you have any responsibility for that bad deed -- supporting the KKK -- if you buy the cookies? Are you only responsible for the good? Do you have no responsibilities either way? If so, did that change from before your learning where the money went to?

To expand on the example, let's say that you were a kids club group leader, and up to this point in time you were completely unaware of the group giving donations to the KKK for the robes. As a group leader in the club, do you have a responsibility for the donations from before? What about the donations from this time forward? If you do, and you think that the KKK robes are a bad thing, then what do you do to meet your responsibilities? Do you even have any? Where do you draw the line?

To put it another way;

* ***How many good deeds are needed to pay for the bad deeds done to other people?***

Just because he sees design in a complex universe doesn't mean design exists, that's his assumption. His use of a probability argument is also ridiculous creationist PRATT. Here's a part when I responded to a similar probability argument:

&gt;But this is all trivial, because this argument from likelihood is irrelevant. Let's use poker as an example. With 52 cards, there are 311,875,200 possible 5-card hands, so the probability of getting any one specific hand is 1/311,875,200 = 3.20641 x 10-9 . That probability is the same for a specific royal flush and for a specific hand full of nothing. Now, there are many more ways to get a hand full of nothing than there are to get a royal flush, so it is more probable to get a hand full of nothing than to get a royal flush.

&gt;Specifically, there are four ways to get a royal flush, so the probability of a royal flush (p) is 1.2825643 x 10-8 and the probability against (q) is 0.999999987. Very unlikely that you would deal a royal flush in one single hand. But get 10,000,000 poker players to deal 100 hands each for a total of one billion hands and the probabilities reverse themselves such that p becomes 0.9999973 (almost a dead certainty) while q becomes 2.6908776 x 10-6 (very unlikely).

&gt;Similarly with proteins, there would not be just one single trial, but rather a very large number of trials going on all around the single event you were dealing with.

&gt;But this begs another point: I've just been dealt a hand. What is the probability of my having been dealt that particular hand? 3.20641 x 10-9 ? No, the probability is 1.0, dead certainty. It is a fixed point in time; it has already happened. Nothing can possibly change the fact that that is the hand that I had just been dealt.

Oh, and Hugh Ross has bad credibility within the scientific community. He misunderstands basic concepts of thermodynamics, but that's the kind of thing that happens when you try to make the facts fit your preconceived notion of the nature of the universe. He's a hack.

2) doesn't really answer your question, he's talking about death, not evil. Technically the serpent tempting Adam would be evil, so ultimately he cannot use this argument as the origin of evil, because that would be God.

But, when I see many religions each claiming to be the only answer and none of them providing anything better than ""I am right because I have a book that is right that says that the book is right"" what I conclude is that all of them are equally invented. If and when one of them can be verified externally I would reconsider, but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If someone told you ""yesterday I ate grapes"", you wouldn't find it difficult to believe, but if he continued with ""and then I went to the toilet and when I was done what I found out what came out was solid gold"", you would have a hard time to believe it. If someone said ""there was a guy who preached"" I find it easy to believe, and if he continues with ""they killed him and he came back to life"" I find it hard to believe. What would it take for your pastor to believe I excrete gold after eating grapes? If he believes it just based on my claim I have some more claims for him.

What he should do is study the history of the bible from a historical point of view and **not** just choosing what he accepts based on what he already believes.

catch_a_park,"The reason that there are so many copies of the bible is because the same organisation that had a vested interest in the religion was also responsible for making all the copies. The church focused much of it's energy on it. It didn't happen by accident.

We don't have any of the originals. We have copies of copies and translations of copies. No two copies are the same. They all have mistakes as they were copied by hand. The fact that the Dead Sea Scrolls match only means it is a copy of a copy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible

The Gospels were written decades after the events they describe, by unknown authors, none of whom ever actually met Jesus. They were not eyewitnesses. At best the Gospels are hearsay.

The idea that Adam and Eve had a choice is also misleading because they were completely ignorant of the concept of sin until they ate the apple. If someone tells you that you have a choice and then punishes you for not choosing the choice they had already chosen for you then it is not much of a choice. It's like a robber holding a gun to your head. You can choose to get shot by not cooperating but its not much of a choice.

This thing about taking something out of context. When God says it's ok to buy slaves from neighbouring nations, how is that taking it out of context? Some would say that being a slave is better than dying in the desert but there are many examples in the Old Testament where the Israelites killed other tribes and burnt their cities to the ground and took slaves for themselves. In one case, Moses gets angry because they took the women and children and cattle. He told them to kill the non-virgin women, male children and cattle but keep the young virgin girls for themselves. http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+31%3A1-18&amp;version=KJV This is the behaviour of warring tribes and the kind of morals they had.

ryna3007,"1. The bible is not the most printed book. There is no single bible anyway but a collection. And they are not the same book. The Q'uran, Buddhist scripture, Confusus texts, Pythagorean geometry textbook (or something like that) are among the most printed books too. The biblical text changes over time, the dead sea scroll was translated into latin then old English then modern English. In the process, many things were changed (I learnt this from history channel). Even when you grab 2 different language versions of the modern bible, they don't appear to say exactly the same. Cultural differences render meaning variation. That should help with the 99% identical bogus claim.   The second part about evidence of the existence of something prove the creator can be countered with any other diety or a flying spaghetti monster. Ask your friend if the bible (or himself) claims that the evidence of existence proves a god then what about the taoist text that claim Pangu or Vishnu's dream of the universe as the creator. There is an experiment where Lego blocks were put into a washing machine. After many cycles, blocks of certain size and connection were found to form more frequently than others. The formation of things in the universe is not about creating something meaningful but the formation of stable bodies. 

2. So we are dogs and god owns us? Ask your friend what he think of a person that owns a pair pet, puts a tasty treat in the middle of the house, and beats the pet whenever he eat the treat because his mate urge him to. Also Adam did not eat the for bidden fruit because he wanted to sin, he did it because he love Eve. And his god was a sadistic being who wanted Adam to love him and only himself, so he punished the couple out of jealousy.

Say that since humans are so error-prone, it would be ignorant to assume that the Bible, having been translated, amended and edited countless times throughout history, is indicative of the word of a god. Thus, they are the fools for throwing out that verse.

BuccaneerRex,"Consciousness is the mind modeling itself. The idea that there is a 'you' separate from the body is a silly one.

The concept you're dancing around is that of 'continuity'. I have the illusion of continuity with my past self, because I remember being that self. If I were duplicated, each of the duplicates would be exactly as much 'me', since they too would share the illusion of continuity. Whether or not there actually is a continuity between the duplicate and the 'original', as long as the duplicate believes there is, then there is. Eventually, we would diverge, and we'd be two different individuals with a shared history.

What 'you' are is a point of view. As long as that POV is preserved, then 'you' are alive.

If you were mind-wiped, in the old sci-fi trope, 'you' would be dead, even though your body still walks around.

Do you believe in God?

What religion?

Why that one, was your choice driven by your emotions (It just felt right, you've felt him in your heart etc)

Do you go to church? If so, how involved are you in it? (give offerings, deacon, pastor, etc)

What is your understanding of the fact of evolution? (If they say it's theory not fact, explain to them that evolution has been proved to the same degree that the earth being round has, and theory doesn't mean hypotheses)
If they say something factually incorrect, or ask you a question about evolution, answer them respectfully.

Now that I've filled you in on how evolution works, what do you think of it?

What drives you *away* from atheism?

Do you think that religion is needed to have morals?

If you want to, and if their minds are open enough, recommend them  (Or if you're generous enough, buy some copies to give) these books:

Richard Dawkins - The Greatest Show on Earth

Jerry A. Coyne - Why Evolution is True

Nunleft,"First off my I suggest having a look at several political leaning documentaries (Bowling for Columbine [Michael Moore], Expelled [Ben Stien] or Zeitgeist.) Analyze them carefully, look at how they craft a story, uses juxtaposition and highlights certain aspects. You may not agree with their message or think it is objectionable. But, take notes how they try to lead the discussion any sway viewers.

Secondly, What are you focusing on? The amount of topics covered by the topic ""religion"" is to many. Pick a focus and build a story. Hypothetically here is a documentary I would make:

Topic: Religion impacting Politics:

* Title sequence, display clips of politicians claiming religious views
* Interview a secularist
* give a history lesson on a religious swing (McCarthy)
* Show Religious activists in action (interview them at a rally if possible)
* Monolog on the harm religion has done, transition
* Interview several religious leaders on the role of religion. juxtapose with footage of right wing pastors
* Return to the first interview to give the secular person a response
* closing monolog with an appeal to secular values.
* credits

It is simple and shows why you believe religion is harmful, the questions you raise would be worded in a particular way. There would be someone leading the documentary and the discussion. I would edit it to have a grim feel to it, to try to convey how serious some of the people are.

Here are some aspects which you should be able to get a decent documentary out of:

* Women (Either in or outside the Church)
* Sex
* Multiculturalism (Both Ethnically and Religiously)
* Abortion
* Secularism/Dominion-ism
* Education (The battle over Good Science in schools)
* Religious Home Schooling
* Vaccination/Religious exemptions in medicine

Finally, Please do not do what ~~Ray Comfort~~ Most documentaries with political/social leanings do, edit interviews. Give full context, let people speak. Let them make their own points, instead of you twisting their words and changing their meaning.

I assume this statement meant that they had a policy of only allowing shared bedrooms to couples that are married.

I don't see anywhere stated in the article the the gay couple were in fact married, refer ""his civil partner"".

If instead of the gay couple, a straight man and a woman were turned away for not being married (only a civil union) , is it still a discrimination case?

Is it a discrimination case based on the fact they personally don't consider a civil union a marriage? (assuming the court didn't show that previously they had no issues with straight civil union couples).

While they do state that ""We’re just ordinary Christians who believe in the importance of marriage as the union of one man and one woman."" (which is a discriminatory statement)

Almost as strange as the bible.,null,4,cdpbjbo,1roasf,atheism,new,39
AcademGreen,"AA has been ruled religious in two district courts.

It is based off of the Christian Oxford groups.

The big book is holy and treats agnostics as being in need of conversion to join the AA way.  Atheists are just called savage by the literature.

The preamble to each meeting says that AA believes only god can remove our desire to drink.  Each meeting ends with the Lord's Prayer.

Top it off with work that shows AA is as affective as doing nothing, and you end up with a pseudo-civil religious church.

I am forced to go to meetings for my first DUI.  The constant god thing gets on my nerves.  I don't pray or believe in the supernatural, so it feels like I am an outsider or not doing the program ""right"".  

Overall it is a cult with bad recovery rates that courts force people into.  The people may be nice sand helpful... but the program is 70 year old Christ-light dogma about identifying your sins and repenting.",null,2,cdpc2u1,1roasf,atheism,new,30
xpass,"For me it was the only thing that actually worked. I'm an atheist, and I particularly like the later steps which no one really talks about, and they have to do with figuring out my own mistakes, making sure I don't make them again, and trying to mend my relationships with other people. 

All other treatments I tried left me with no clue what to do with myself after I stop drinking and blasting through drugs.

Another huge benefit is the abundance of meetings. I am all up for options, but I don't think I can find anything else with the sheer amount of support that AA gives me.

What would really make me happy is if there were other options for people. Seems everyone only bitches about AA and ""god"". That's easy enough.

wuollett,"From the Article cited by the article OP cited:  

&gt; Support from a husband or wife was important in sustaining the resolution. **(In reference to people that quit on their own)**
*Treatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction — Part III, The Harvard Mental Health Letter, Volume 12, Number 4, October 1995, page 3. 
(See Aug. (Part I), Sept. (Part II), Oct. 1995 (Part III).)*
So much for the sayings that ""Everybody needs a support group"" and ""Nobody can do it alone"". Most successful people do. 

**(This is a contradictory statement, having the support of a husband or wife isn't ""doing it alone"")**  


&gt; Nothing could be further from the truth. Even the most ardent true believers who will be honest about it recognize that A.A. and N.A. have at least 90% failure rates. And the real numbers are more like 95% or 98% or 100% failure rates. It depends on who is doing the counting, how they are counting, and what they are counting or measuring.

In 2001-2002 a different study the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) conducted the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC). found data from a survey of 43093 people where 1441 responded that they had been in an AA-type meeting, a 35.2% continuance rate was shown after 1 year of AA. *(Cited from Wikipedia as:  L. A. Kaskutas, Y. Ye, T. K. Greenfield, J. Witbrodt &amp; J. Bond (2008). ""Epidemiology or Alcoholics Anonymous Participation."" Recent Developments in Alcoholism, Vol 18: Research on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery. 261-282)* 
 
From the article itself:

&gt;I believe that whatever successes AA can claim are due the the dedication and tireless efforts of the volunteer sponsors. That is a life-affirming, positive way to help someone in the grips of alcohol or drugs. 

So the article OP linked cites an article that states a support group doesn't work, but in the article itself it clearly states that the sponsor system, which is a form of support group, is a good way to help. And with a group like AA to bring them all together, how would addicts find these sponsors?

Furthermore, studies have proven that more studies are needed to properly determine the effectiveness of AA. *(Cited from Wikpedia as:  Ferri M, Amato L, Davoli M. Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes for alcohol dependence. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 3)*

Both articles make the statement that Christians elements in AA make the program have a negative effect by citing data that doesn't really study the actually effectiveness of AA. Nothing is said in regards to time it takes for spontaneous remission to occur, and at that point the effects of constant alcoholism may be much more pronounced.

What needs to happen is a long study that shows the effectiveness of AA versus non-treatment and alcohol addiction specialty centers, and the differences in health between the three groups, as well as the amount of people who stay completely and utterly sober (as opposed to 1 or 2 beers every now and then and being considered ""not an alcoholic anymore""), whether the alcoholism had any pronounced medical or personal effects and the amount of time between when they started drinking and when they stopped and if AA was more effective in reducing this time. 

If you can provide data showing that people who were turned away by the God aspect of AA quit completely by themselves in the same or less amount of time those that stayed in AA did, and stayed sober longer, I will believe that AA has a negative effect, but until you can produce this data, I highly recommend not citing inconclusive sources, since all of this is really not comprehensive enough to make the statement that the God aspect of AA makes it negatively effective.

Small group sessions and counselor sessions helped as did a ton of free time for me to write and do self-reflection.

I do agree that religious indoctrination of those who have an inclination towards the one side is wrong, as is any other outside pressure on the development of the Self, but if I really wanted to, I am sure I could be attracted to a man. 

Would have to be the perfect man, but still, it is possible. This thinking in black or white is hurtful to those who discover they are Bi after first choosing one orientation over the other. Practically Everyone is Bi, but you would obviously choose to associate closer to the side where you are more likely to find a mate. Thus, I consider myself straight.

Then on the other hand, if someone is 40% straight and 60% gay, then social stigma would probably force him or her to align with Heterosexuality. Easier that way, as long as they dont actually fall in love, and have it reciprocated by a member of the same sex. This is also wrong. 

IMHO

Hetero: 100% Hetero to 75% Hetero

Gay: 100% Gay to 75% Gay

Bi: 75% Gay to 75% Hetero

And what the fuck does it matter anyway? That is noones business, unless they are in love with someone with a definite different sexual orientation. If they are, well that sucks. I am not attracted to very fat people, idiots or boring people either. 

In short. the whole gay-straight discussion is pointless and hurtful to everyone involved.

if you are 60% gay, then obviously it is a choice. just ignore whatever lust you feel for the same sex, and live on 40% of your sexuality. If you do, however, then you are a chicken and not living your life in full. I would feel sorry for such a person.",null,1,cdphog6,1robbw,atheism,new,3

Anyway sorry you have to deal with that.  Remember that some people just have a very hard time accepting the reality of same-sex attraction.

I don't speak with my own father.  My younger brother gave him my phone number but I still haven't responded to any of his texts for a good few years now.  At this point I'd actually be okay with trying to talk and get past some of the crap he's pulled (and ask for forgiveness for a few mistakes I made, too); but he remains strongly religious.  His holiday cards/texts *always* wish me blessings, etc.

I see religion as part of what's really wrong with the US/world.  I'm not just atheist but staunchly anti-theist.

Any conversation we might have is going to come back to God because he's shaped his entire 60+ years around his faith.  It's a huge part of who he is.  I can't talk through our issues when he continues to insist on the legitimacy of his damaging worldview.

BuccaneerRex,"Your first problem is this:

&gt;As atheists, we can proudly say that we have questioned the existence of God and certainly religion itself. We have used our critical thinking skills and curiosity to look beyond what others have told us.

This is not the case for everyone. Some people never accepted the existence of a deity in the first place, therefore have nothing to question. Some of us have never been a member of a religion. And as annoying as it is, some people are atheists merely because nobody ever taught them religion; they never reasoned their way into or out of anything.

You do not require a deity to have a religion, this is true. But your definition of religion is more of a definition of Abrahamic religion, not all possible religions. Not all religions include afterlives. Not all have a central text. Not all believe their deity is the creator. They do all generally include moral prescripts, so that's one. Not all include eternal punishments of the ones that do include afterlives. And some do not believe that any deities intervene.

It's a good start, and defining terms should really be the first effort of any intellectual activity.

Everything In the universe pretty much works the same way. 

If it can persist and we can observe it then it is energetically favorable that it exists for the moment. That goes for a neutrino to a religious text. If you think of the existence of a droplet of water in the same context as a discussion in a church about the bible, then ones model for the universe encompasses belief systems (We all have them even if we are atheist). 

However we are terrible observers, we are trapped in a snapshot of time and space and our perceptions are geared to survival in the context of our genetic code.

we get pissed when you pretend to know who the deity hates. Then we start demanding you give us his phone number so we can check for ourselves.

also people are in a bad habit of doing what you just did.. not chastising because it is human nature people dont think of it this way. But especially for some atheists when you say 

&gt;Belief that a deity may or may not exist

we are going to say, well that is all and good, but you have to remember then, that there is an infinite number of things that might be, picking a deity makes no more sense than all the other things.

If someone demands that their is no way you can prove there is or isnt a deity, so i should be open to that. Then i demand you be open to the idea that, that deity is the spaghetti monster, or you have to be open to teh idea that all of life is just a hologram on a surface(and some science thinks that).

For me it is just spin, religion loves to live in the infinite unknown, no matter how much the ""known"" grows that infinite unknown is sanctuary for them. Your talking about agnostics but religions do it all the time with more specific claims. It was initially religion that rejected the idea of an earth going around the sun.. when they were proven wrong, they just move to other unknowns and say ""therefore god"".. well when it is unknown it can be ""therefore anything possible and even things we dont know if they are possible"" 

so when you say there may be or may not be a god, i say there may be or may not be an advanced civilization that made a computer and we think we are alive. its meaningless conjecture and really serves little purpose outside of philosophy. nothing in the info about it might or might not exist can tell you anything about your life, how you should live it or anything at all.

Tell her how Santa will judge her and if she does not meet his standards of a perfect obedient child Santa will leave her without gifts, or even worse gives something awful for her just to rub it in.

Now that she is all shocked to hear this and reflects on her behavior, you tell her ""and this is what many children believe because their parents told them this lie without any regard on how it would feel to the person who is being lied to"" and then you say ""but it is not true, Santa is not really judging you, Santa does not see everything, because there is no Santa. Santa is a lie everyone has agreed upon to tell to the children who still are not in on the joke to control them better and to make them feel like there's something magical about being obedient and good **because** they do not trust their children to know right from wrong, and to be able to reflect their own actions without such threats""

The historical Jesus of Nazareth was an [apocalyptic Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature) preacher who was charismatic enough to gain a bit of a following. I believe he may have thought of himself as a [Jewish messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_messianism) of sorts, and that he would raise an army of his fellow Jews to fight and defeat the Roman occupiers, thus establishing God's kingdom in Judea. After entering Jerusalem and attempting to provoke the authorities, however, he was arrested for claiming to be the King of the Jews. This was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of Caesar and was a crime punishable by death. As a result, he was crucified by the Romans.

As for the mythical Jesus Christ, we can't really say what, if anything, written in the New Testament is true. The earliest books in that canon are those of Paul, who never personally knew Jesus. The earliest gospel is Mark, written sometime after 72 c.e. by someone who could not have known Jesus. Consider also that the writings of the New Testament have been changed and edited countless times since they were written and that none of the original copies exist. The bottom line here is that we simply do not know what this character named Jesus actually said or taught, other than that it was probably apocalyptic in nature.

If you consider his teachings to be socialistic in nature, as the teachings in Matthew suggest, then they are really no different than those of most other ""great teachers"" throughout history.

""I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking.
The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence.

It's a conclusion.

You see, everything we know, everything we can determine about anything, it's all based on *evidence.* Empirical, repeatable, testable *evidence.*

That's part of rational, skeptical, and critical thinking.

Many (though not all) atheists have come to the conclusion of atheism due to this rational, skeptical, logical, and critical thinking.

Quite simply, there is absolutely no evidence anywhere, whatsoever, at all, for deities of any kind.

Thus, there is no reason to suppose such things exist.

You are, no doubt, no different in most areas of your life. I suspect you don't believe in leprachauns. Or fairies or unicorns. Because we know there's no evidence at all that such things exist. We also know a lot of where, how, and why these stories were made up.

Exactly like religions. And deities.

Thestrangeone23,"I think a better place to start is why you chose Christianity. Because I can't truly address your misconceptions if I don't know what they are. 

But starting with the limited information I have, I will address the exact words you said. Your first misconception, which is rather common, is that atheism is a choice, implying it is a religion. It is neither of those things. 

Atheism is first and foremost the rejection of all deistic claims. If you ask me why I reject the god of the bible (which I assume the title of Christianity means that specific god) I would first ask you why you reject Allah, or Vishnu, or Xenu, or Zues. Because if your answer has anything to do with faith, let me tell you something, there are people out there who have the exact same amount of faith and certainty that you do, in fact some of them even more, that believe that one of these gods are real. So now the question becomes how do you determine which is true. Because that is what would matter, if it mattered at all. I mean if the bible is wrong and Islam was true, then you could see where calling yourself a Christian could become a problem for you.

Think about the radical muslims who engage in acts of terror. How much faith do you have to have in order to strap a bomb to your chest and detonate it? I bet you that guy is pretty damn convinced that his religion is true. And if it is true, and yours is wrong, once again, you can see where you might end up running into a problem somewhere. 

You see the thing that you don't understand is that you are actually an atheist as well. You do not believe in Allah, you do not believe in Zues, you do not believe in Vishnu. I'm betting you know pretty much next to nothing about hinduism, yet you instantly reject it without knowing a single thing about it. Back in the Roman times the christians were the athiests as they were denying the deistic claims of the emperor. All Christians are actually atheists as they deny many many deistic claims, often without ever considering them. There is only one difference between you and me, and that is I deny  one more god then you do. 

By the way nondenominational, many Christians would view you no better then an atheist as they would believe you to have just another one of the wrong religions. Some Christians take those denominations very seriously to the point that they view everyone who doesn't agree with them as heritics (see baptists and catholics) 

and going back to your point about seeing no problem with science, that doesn't actually tell me anything. I know another christian that tells me that same thing, yet he also believes in a literal 6 day creation along with the idea that Noah's flood actually happened, and all of the other supernatural events of the bible actually happened. So, I'm going to need a little more than that. 

So I'd like to know your position first, in order to properly explain my position, as I cannot explain something if I don't know what you actually know yet. You are coming in with some very clear and obvious misconceptions and I need to know what those are before we end up having a big misunderstanding about what we actually think. A nondenominational christian who sees no problem with science really doesn't tell me that much about what you actually think or why you think it. And I need to know that. I need to know what your methods are for determining truth and whether or not you care if what you believe is true

I was hanging out at Starbucks last week having my morning coffee when this guy comes up to me, 30ish, kinda hippy looking but a pleasant enough guy.
Hi, my name’s Larry, I’m the son of God and I perform miracles” he says.
“Really? When and where did this happen” I asked.
“About 70 years ago in a town you probably never heard of”, Larry says.
“What did you do?” I ask, warming to his story.
“You know, walk on water, make the blind to see, rise from the dead, that sort of thing.” he tells me.
“That’s a pretty big claim Larry. Got any evidence, any proof that this happened”? I asked.
“Of course, I wouldn’t make such a claim without proof. Look some of my buddies wrote down last week.” he says.
“Last week?  Why didn’t they write it down when it happened?” I ask.
“Ah, none of them could write and, you know, one thing leads to another, you get busy and before you know it, seventy years have gone by” Larry says with a shrug.
“Hmm, okay, let’s see it”.
“Here, see, four of my buds describe it all right here, a whole BUNCH of miracles”, he says handing me a stack of papers.
 “This isn’t evidence Larry, this is just CLAIMS that something happened. “ I point out.
“Look, five hundred people saw it! ” Larry says.
“No, Larry, one of your friends SAYS five hundred people saw it. That isn’t the same as five hundred people actually seeing it”.
OH…..oh, I know where you’re going wrong.” Larry tells me. “You have to KNOW it’s true before you’ll know it’s true. It also works if you feeeeel it’s true”. He tells me.
“Larry, that's NOT evidence.” I say, making sure Larry’s not between me and the door.
The conversation ends when Larry tells me that the problem is that I’ve “Hardened my heart against him.” and as I walk out the door Larry asks in a loud voice “And, why do you hate my Dad?”

In the same vein, would you say that children who believe Santa brings gifts and children who believe their eyes when they see the gifts bought, wrapped and placed by their parents, are the same kind of belief?

As was pointed out, you also reject many gods you know about and countless gods you have never heard of.

As for christianity, christianity came from judaism, jesus promised a kingdom of god on earth and bodily resurrection but people seem to believe these days about heaven which jesus never mentioned, it was also promised to come around his time, and it's quite overdue. Judaism has evolved from polytheism by first elevating one of the god of their pantheon to a major position, then to the exclusive position, look at the language of the first commandment, or better yet, study the history of the jewish bible (old testament). And Santa Claus (reindeer, tree, gifts) is made up too, I assume you don't need my reasoning for that.

As you can see, it's not much of a choice not to believe in Santa when you saw the gifts tucked away a month before Christmas year after year. The same way it's not much of a choice not to believe in gods when you know how these belief systems evolve (cultural anthropology) and how they affect people (psychology) and how they're exploited (just look around).

Those hypothesis are respectively - solidly proven, possible and indicated by evidence but unproven, possible but unproven and under increasing tension with the evidence, solidly rejected and finally worse than wrong, ie unscientific for not offering no empirical tests.

It was very traumatic for me- I started believing there was something wrong with me: If religion changed millions of other peoples' lives, why didn't it work for me? What was wrong with me?
 I also started to realize many of the hateful and weird teachings in the Bible and specifically at my dad's church (gay people are sinners, sex before marriage is a sin, women who stand up to abusive husbands are sinners, sin sin sin sin sin).
Now I am sort if an outcast from my dad's family. They don't understand and are very judgmental.
Maybe I don't belong here because I really turned out to be agnostic, but all I'm trying to say was I didn't choose this. In fact I tried to choose religion- but it didn't work.",null,0,cdpkjjo,1roxnm,atheism,new,1
Aberu,"I will spare the common answer to this, which isn't the answer you are seeking. The whole ""we didn't choose atheism"" kind of thing.

To answer the question, how did I become an atheist (which is the implication of your question), it was because I wanted to rationalize the things I believed. I was raised Southern Baptist. Moved around to many non-denominational churches, seeking answers for conflicts that I saw in each branch that I had arrived at previously. I converted Mormon since a good friend of mine was Mormon and opened me up to listening to the missionaries. They had answers for why the bible seemed conflicting, edited for power and profit grabs, etc... Then the next logical step was to question the Mormon church (after being baptised for some reason, my skepticism wasn't honed fully yet). 

I found it difficult to question the Mormon church without every source being tainted by Christian apologist writers and their criticisms, or Mormon apologists and their responsese of those criticisms. I couldn't find a verifiable independent source. I don't remember what I found since it's been about 9 years, but I found a pretty independent source and it opened me up to thinking very critically about what I believed. I used to wear a religion like a badge amongst many badges on my vest, and I never felt like it was the most important thing to know anything about. Just one of many things I felt I was expected to have an opinion on and expected to have a belief in something. And I thought it was a given to believe in God but I always assumed everyone else believed in God in some form or another.

After questioning Mormonism I approached a kind of Deism, and was firmly opposed to religious institution. I had a deist friend bridge that gap comfortably for me, in the same circle of friends as the Mormon friend. Then I discussed my ideas with a coworker who I respected greatly, a british born, Californian punk rock bassist who was there washing dishes with me at the pizza place as a fellow delivery driver. He got me to the point to ask myself ""How do I know what I think I know?"". In other words he was requiring me to rationally justify the existence of a deistic god to him through logic. I couldn't, and I started sliding slowly into becoming an Atheist over the next year. First time I admitted I was an atheist was after hearing a debate that Christopher Hitchens did (I don't remember who it was against, it was a while ago) and he just made very good arguments to embrace what I had already been feeling, that I was an atheist. He was a brave voice that made me much more comfortable with being outspoken about it, and outspoken publically against irrational beliefs. That was my introduction to me ""enlightenment"" (I don't like calling it this, but I don't know a bettter word).

You likely have an interest in the fact that if you use a map to drive somewhere, the places on the map actually exist when you arrive.

As a skeptic, I try to *consciously* be aware of my beliefs and whether I have good reasons for having them. If I discover I believe something without good reasons, I'll be honest and say ""I'm not confident enough to be reasonably sure."" You see good scientists do this all the time: if you ask them a tough question that's even slightly outside their area of expertise, they are very careful and admit that someone else would likely have better answers.

gidikh,"Mine started with the 10 commandments.  The one thing in the bible that god supposedly wrote himself.  He starts off by saying ""...for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me...""  then proceeds to wrap up the commandments by telling us not to be jealous/envious of our neighbors.


The first thing that struck me was that this supposedly perfect being gets jealous?  I don't get jealous beyond thinking someone is a d-bag for hitting on my wife in front of me.  But this all powerful, all benevolent god gets jealous enough that he punishes children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren if someone doesn't love him?

I then proceeded to start reading the bible objectively and wow, the god of the old testament is such a dick.  Even if you skip all the parts where god is helping his chosen people (btw choosing a small tribe of illiterate nomads out of the entire world as your favorite seems a little weird to me, but whatever floods your planet) kill, rape, and pillage their neighbors, you still have stories of god screwing people over for no other reason that to prove how 'great' he is.  Read exodus, pharaoh is ready to give up and let everyone go, but god hardens pharaoh's heart just so god can unless his plagues and get the credit for freeing the slaves.  Those plagues, by the way, include slaughtering the first born of each family (include babies), unless of course you painted your door with lambs blood, because god apparently couldn't tell the difference between his people and the egyptians.  This is just one example of many.

Then we move into the new testament and suddenly god isn't as much as a dick any more.  If god is perfect, why would he have a mid-eternity crisis and suddenly become the cool dad?  Jesus shows up and has some pretty good things to say, but then they have to throw in some pretty pathetic 'miracles'.   Your average doctor has cured more diseases and saved more lives by several orders of magnitude greater than jesus did.  My favorite was using his omnipotent powers to save a run to the liquor store during a wedding.

So after being thoroughly disenfranchised, I started looking at some of the other major religions, and found flaws with those as well.  I then came to the realization that if there was an all powerful deity that cared whether or not we knew of it and worshiped it, there wouldn't be any sort of doubt.  It could easily come up with a way to get all it's laws and such distributed to it's creations that doesn't include having a bunch of illiterate desert dwellers witness something that takes them several decades before they find someone to actually write it down.

This lead me to the conclusion that if there is a super powerful intelligent being that created everything, it doesn't care about us. Or much more likely, we are just a random fluke of natural processes.

When you leave that environment, i.e. think as an atheist, it's almost a no-brainer to consider that the breeding-for-excellence humans have been doing with animals for thousands of years could and likely would also work with humans. As intellectuals came out from underneath the shadow of the churches, this became a legitimate topic for thought and discussion. I'm not surprised that Russell considered it: thinking about stuff like this was his job, after all.

Anyway, my point is that yes, because this kind of thinking was anathema to most theists,  you're more likely to see it associated with atheists. Interesting exception: Hitler Germany was 97% theistic (Catholic/Lutheran), officially nearly as hostile toward atheists as Jews, and yet did a lot of thinking (and some practical work) on the topic of creating the ideal German. The German Aryan movement displayed a weird mixture of national patriotism, religiosity (with some Nordic/Pagan influences) and pseudo-scientism.

Getting back to Russell, I don't know that his alleged support for eugenics isn't exaggerated in that piece from Vice. What does seem apparent, from a brief jaunt [into Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell's_views_on_society), is that, after noodling on the topic for a bit, he was no big fan of eugenics:

&gt; Russell later criticized eugenic programs for their vulnerability to corruption, and, in 1932, he condemned the ""unwarranted assumption"" that ""Negroes are congenitally inferior to white men"" (Education and the Social Order, Chap. 3).

This mention of ""eugenics programs"" led me to looking at the role of eugenics in the USA as a whole. I highly recommend the article on [Eugenics in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States)! I was a little shocked to see this:

&gt; Eugenics was widely accepted in the U.S. academic community.[6] By 1928 there were 376 separate university courses in some of the United States' leading schools, enrolling more than 20,000 students, which included eugenics in the curriculum.[12] 

I find it hard to believe that this was a field worked only by atheists. It was quite apparently a societal fad at the time, as

&gt; Several feminist reformers advocated an agenda of eugenic legal reform. The National Federation of Women’s Clubs, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, and the National League of Women Voters were among the variety of state and local feminist organization that at some point lobbied for eugenic reforms.[18]

There's more on eugenics advocated by organizations in the deep South, and I'm willing to bet these weren't exactly hotbeds of atheist thought.

My conclusion? This is like saying that slave ownership in the US was an atheist thing because Thomas Paine was an atheist and slave owner. Russell was singled out because he was a vocal atheist. Pieces like the one you linked try to make it look like this was his idea. Condemning atheists today for intellectual work done by (not only) atheists a century ago, from which all of society eventually learned a better understanding and rejection of eugenics is a cheap shot, viciously unfair and deeply anti-intellectual. I feel the authors should be ashamed of themselves for it.",null,0,cdpi4hc,1rpa5a,atheism,new,6
SpHornet,"Biologist here; I'm actually in favour of Eugenics

1. it already happens (and you are okay with it)
2. it will be necessary in the future

Let me first define eugenics; changing the human genepool by human intervention

1. it already happens; people with down syndrome are discouraged to have children because they have 50% chance of passing the syndrome to the next generation. (I believe) it is not forced, but it still fits the definition

2. our medical advantages have one big downside; there is no more selection on treatable genetic defects. this will mean that more and more people will get those defects in comming centuries and if left untreated in time all people will become dependant on medicine and eventhough it is not lethal they will have a reduced life experience

genetic modification or sperm/egg selection can solve that dependancy on medicine. The sooner we start; the less we have to do it and the more people will benifit from this by no longer needing medication",null,0,cdpib0p,1rpa5a,atheism,new,3

Any opposition to breeding for reasons pertaining to ""purity"" in race or ethnicity or in genetic favorability is eugenics. This has been practiced throughout human history by people of all different religious identities. The ""Eugenics movement"" in the first half of the 20th Century was just a continuation of this, but using newly emerging knowledge and technology. The discovery of genetics did contribute to giving the ancient practice of selective breeding a scientific flair, but it also helped to break down many myths and misconceptions about some things that had, until then, been mistakenly attributed to breeding and genes.",null,0,cdpmht7,1rpa5a,atheism,new,1

I guess people who attend a megachurch have to focus on some smaller group within the church to be their small town.)

My advice is: think of one thing you'd like to do to make the world a better place. It could be anything: entertaining old people in nursing homes; picking up litter in public parks; getting a certain candidate elected to the school board. The important thing is: it must be something you believe in, will enjoy doing, and will give you a sense of pride and purpose. Start doing it, and at the same time, start gathering other people to do the same thing. Maybe you will discover that an organized group already exists for that purpose, and you can join them, but if not, start your own organization, or at least an informal group that gets together occasionally for both purposeful work and recreation.

When evidence is used to inform your beliefs, it creates knowledge. Knowledge is demonstrable. It allows you to issue commands which the universe must then obey. Reality is the arbiter of truth, and what it says goes. When you disagree with reality, you are wrong. When you examine evidence, you are getting reality's statement of what it does in a certain situation. When you use something else besides evidence, you find that reality doesn't give one pitiless shit what you thought, wanted, wished, or preferred to have happened instead.

Deductive logic starts from a few assumptions (for example, we assume that inference works, that modus ponens holds etc., and there are other axioms that can be adopted for various purposes), and then under those assumptions we can prove things with certainty. The weakness of this system is that it relies on our rejection of absurdity. Our axioms are considered strongest when the negation is most absurd.

Scientific reasoning is a bit different, in scientific reasoning we come up with the simplest possible explanation, then expand the field of testing as widely as possible. In science, we accept things tentatively, and do our best to get them thrown out. Each real test a theory passes strengthens it. But again, this is based on the rejection of absurdity, and also on a more practical usability.

Interestingly, though, no epistemic system could ever escape from insanity or deception. The fundamental problem many people on this subreddit seem to ignore when they profess themselves radical followers of scientific realism, is that you have to assume as axiomatic the (at least partial) reliability of your own senses as well as the method of verification you derived from them. Since sensory input is the only source of human knowledge, it must also be the foundation of our techniques of natural deduction and verification. Therefore, no proof of soundness or completeness could ever be given with regard to the senses; our very source of knowledge is inherently unreliable, and any workaround to that fact (e.g. Kant's ""a priori"" knowledge, instrumentalism, pragmatism, structuralism, etc...) can only attempt to convince you through examples of its practical success, not some sort of formal irrefutable proof.

You mean hypothesis. ""Belief"" in science is different from faith because science has proven results. One of the reasons for this success is self correction. The whole point of searching for a unified theory is because we know that general relativity, the standard model, and quantum mechanics are flawed. 

Does that sound like your faith? Does your religion test it's doctrine to insure reliability? Does your religion admit flaws in it's core doctrine and search for a more correct doctrine? Religion would rather reform it's members than it's teaching. ",null,0,cdppbeb,1rq2pi,atheism,new,6

Also the flying spaghetti monster theory is used by some atheists as an example of the amount of tangible evidence that exists surrounding gods, most atheists don't actually believe in a flying spaghetti monster.

That's it. That's it about our ""beliefs"". 

As for your question, I will answer not as an atheist, since the question has nothing to do with my nonbelief in god(s), but as someone with a little bit of knowledge about science.

A theory, in science, means that the idea has a LOT of evidence, and NO evidence that contradicts it. A hypothesis is an idea that does NOT have a lot of evidence for it. If evidence is gathered for the hypothesis, it eventually becomes a theory, if all evidence shows it to be correct. However, people usually use the word ""theory"" to mean ""any old guess or idea that explains something"". As you can see, the word ""theory"" means two different things.

Therefore, it is unfair to use the word ""theory"" in one sentence, with two separate meanings. ""Theory"" for scientists is NOT the same as ""theory"" in the common vernacular. The Flying Spaghetti Monster is NOT a scientific theory. At best, it's an unproven hypothesis. Just like any other religion. 

If scientists and mathematicians are looking for a grand unified theory, it means that they have some reason(evidence) to believe that it MIGHT exist. And to determine whether it really exists or not, they are doing experiments and such, looking for evidence.

Comparing scientists who are experimenting and figuring out how reality works and trying to determine the truth of whether a certain concept exists or not, is NOT the same as believing an idea with absolutely zero evidence that it's true. 

So, no, believing that a unified field theory may exist and looking for it,  is NOT the same as believing in a supernatural being.",null,0,cdpq05e,1rq2pi,atheism,new,3

If free will is real, then he's made a decision based on that free will to accept free will.  If free will *isn't* real, then he has no choice but to accept free will as being real.

If there is no free will, then punishment/rehabilitation for crimes is even *more* important, since those things (or the threat thereof) might influence the state of someone's mind and prevent them from hurting others, thus transitioning the state of affairs from ""I had no choice but to hurt those people, because I have no free will"", to ""I had no choice but to *not* hurt those people, because I have no free will.""

We can put satellites where we need them. We can land probes on other planets. And on and on.

I say, explain to the priest where you stand, if you feel it's that important. Otherwise, just ask him specifically what's expected of you, then show up on time and perform. 

Have you ever been in a wedding held in a church? This is no different. Sure, you're there to console a grieving widow, rather than fulfill the whims of a bride, but essentially, it's the same. Ask the priest where you should stand, what you should wear, and if you have any lines when you hand off the bread and grapejuice. Even if your only line is ""Amen,"" stand and deliver.

The thought you're giving this shows that you're a person of conviction, even if faith isn't really your thing. If putting on this kind of act is more theatre than you care to engage in, just let the priest know, and I'm sure they can find somebody else. If you feel that doing so could alienate family though, well, if that's priority one, you'll just have to bite the bullet I'm afraid.

MeloJelo,"While God will forgive any sin you ask forgiveness for (but only if you're really sorry!), you still have the risk of eternal damnation for not asking for forgiveness for all your sins before you die--what if you forget one?--or aren't really sorry enough for God's tastes. 

Beyond the slip of the mind, there a large number of rules unrelated to modern morality that could get you sent to Hell--cutting your hair, wearing clothing of mixed fibers, eating shellfish, being gay, and, most especially, blaspheming the Holy Spirit. There are even more depending on what sect you're a member of--I know Catholicism adds the Seven Deadly Sins among others.

So, I think a more pertinent to recognize how amazing it is that people who believe that the Bible and/or their religion's doctrines are absolute Truth can actually be functioning members of society and not pedantic, obsessive, anxious individuals eternally fearing their very likely damnation to Hell.",null,0,c21fqaa,i74bd,atheism,new,2
