chillichill,"Lithium-ion batteries are common so I'll use those as an example. A battery has 4 major components, a cathode, anode, electrolyte and wires to connect the electrodes and complete the circuit (plus all the other bits that hold them together). This circuit is attached to a power supply during charge (to provide electrons) and a device when discharging (to be powered by movement of electrons).  The cathode and the anode are materials which can hold Lithium, while also allowing it to leave the structure reversibly. The electrolyte is a material which allows lithium to pass through, but not electrons.
When a lithium battery is being charged lithium ions (Li+) move from the cathode to the anode, through the electrolyte. When the Li+ reaches the anode it takes an electron from the power supply to form a (relatively) stable state. The Li is stored in the anode until a device that requires power is connected (discharging the battery). 
When a device that needs power is attached, the Li in the anode releases an electron to form Li+ which moves to the cathode. The released electrons cannot travel through the electrolyte therefore travel around the circuit, powering the device. At the cathode the Li+ recombines with an electron from the circuit.

hail = a liquid or partially melted phase in the process, most likely involving a re-freezing event prior to reaching the ground. 

Ive never learnt much about snow formation, but i can tell you about hail. 
In a cumulonimbus cloud, water is cooled below freezing point but it hasnt frozen, called 'supercooled' water. supercooled water will freeze when it comes into contact with something that can start the crystal growth, such as a dust particle or some frozen water. So supercooled water is blowing around in the cloud, being pushed up by updraughts and falling back down when the updraughts cant hold its weight any more. It will cycle around the cloud falling and then riding updraughts back up again, all the while it will be accumulating water (some of it supercooled liquid water, some of it water vapour) until it doesnt find an updraught strong enough to hold it in the cloud and it falls out. Because the supercooled water is liquid and doesnt necessarily freeze instantly, the stone will be wet on the outside, which means stones will stick to each other by touching and then freezing. the sticking together of stones into larger stones makes the irregular surface of the ""random chunks"".

thetripp,"Your son is basically describing the theory known as ""Tired Light.""  The reason we don't think tired light is true is that we've never been able to come up with a mechanism that would cause energy loss in photons, yet still match our observed data.

For a tired light phenomenon to be true, it would have to:

1) Explain energy loss of photons over long distances, and match the observed redshift.

2) Not scatter photons so much as to induce blurring (since we don't observe significant blurring of distant objects).

3) Also explain the observed time dilation of distant events

4) Cause the same effect in every wavelength band, or in other words photons must ""tire"" in the same way, regardless of their frequency.

The wikipedia page on [Tired Light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light) has a nice list of some of the historical proposals related to this theory and why they don't match the observed evidence.",null,1,cdnl44c,1ri89x,askscience,top_day,13

There happens to be a mountain of other evidence (search this sub for this question being asked previously to find specifics, mostly related to the cosmic microwave background, I believe), that suggests the same thing, i.e. expanding universe.  So, we don't really *know* that expansion causes the observed red shift, but it is certainly one valid explanation (as you already know), and it also explains other things we observe.  Additionally, and potentially more importantly, we have no experimental evidence to the contrary. 

That said, the requirement of ""dark energy"" energy seems to be a bit of a blemish...there is no doubt something in the recipe we have no understanding of.  I guess we'll find out exactly what as we go!",null,1,cdnlgh3,1ri89x,askscience,top_day,6

No, it would not.

You are talking about an entire class of alternative explanations of redshift, grouped under the umbrella of the ""tired light hypothesis"". The have pretty much been debunked in bulk.

You cannot have light become ""tired"" by magic. There has to be some physical mechanism for photons to lose energy. If so, the energy loss will tweak the properties of those photons a little. As a result, a series of effects would become apparent:

- images from distant objects would become a little blurred, due to the scattering of the photons via energy-sapping interactions

- distant events would be observed to take place at the same rate of time; there would be no time dilation, like in the relativistic redshift models

Other effects would also become observable, depending on the particular ""flavor"" of tired-light theory, none of which have ever been observed.

Bottom line: the expansion of a relativistic universe is the only model that accounts for everything we observe out there.

WhoH8in,"Well light does loose energy as it goes, in a sense anyway, every time it doubles its distance its energy is 1/4 what it was because intensity dissipates. This does not affect wavelength though. There are other phenomena that affect wavelength though, like movement. If somehting is moving toward us the light it emits doesn't seem to hit us any ""harder""(b/c light only goes c, no faster, no slower, ever) but that energy is accounted for, the light decreases its wavelength. If it is moving away then the wavelength increases which makes it appear redder.

Now when looking out into the stars hubble noticed that the further an object was the redder it appeared to be compared to what we know that objects [emission spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum) *should* look like. Now if the Universe were static then we would expect that, overall, half of all objects must be moving toward us and half be moving away and some tiny minority not moving relative to us at all. It is incredibly unlikely that, in a static universe, all objects would be moving away form us, we would ahve to be a truly uniqe body to observe that, literally the center of the universe. If the universe is expanding though it makes perfect sense because every object percieves every other object as moving away from it (ignoring of course nearby objects).

Use the expanding balloon analogy to understand it. If you have a barely inflated balloon and you draw three dots on it then start to blow it up those dots appear to be moving away form eachother but none fo them are actually moving, the space between them is expanding.

chrisbaird,"To get to the core of your question, which no seems to have addressed yet:

Many materials (cloth, paper, cement) have a microscopic structure which provides multiple reflecting surfaces. For instance, a solid chunk of ice is mostly transparent, but snow is white. They are both made out of the same substance, but the microscopic structures in the snow flake and not in the ice provide multiple surfaces for light to reflect off of. Optical reflection takes place at the *interface* between one material and another material with different optical properties, such as at the surface separating air and ice. Creating a microscopic structure (scratching up a surface, weaving a fabric, injecting air bubbles) introduces more reflecting surfaces, so the incident light has a higher chance of getting reflected rather than transmitted. A solid, pure chunk of salt is transparent, put a pile of table salt granules is white because of all the reflecting surfaces.

Which brings us to your question. If we get rid of the microscopic structure, we can make white material clear again. Melt pure white sand down and let it harden as a solid piece of glass or quartz and it will be transparent. Melt snow flakes into a homogenous pot of water, and it becomes transparent again. Another way to optically get rid of microscopic structures is to add water. Water behaves optically similar to many materials, such as cloth, ice, glass, or snow. Pour water on a material with microscopic structures and the water will fill most of the cracks, scratches, pores, holes, and bubbles that used to be filled with air.

santa167,"BA in Astrophysics here.  Your question involves how galaxies and star systems are formed and why they typically stay in the same plane.  Since it seems like no one has answered yet, I'll try and help you out.  To answer, I'm going to do a little background, first on galaxies, then on stars, and then I'll explain why there should not be as much matter above and below the plane of the Milky Way and our Solar System.  

You're correct in assuming that space is infinite, but from the sound of it, you are implicitly also assuming that it is isotropic on any level.  Essentially, the reason flat diagrams are bewildering is because you're thinking of space as completely evenly spread out with stars, planets, and other matter (like Hydrogen clouds and black holes and white dwarfs, etc.) roughly taking up the same spacial distance away from one another.  Space isn't like a 3D grid, however, especially on smaller scales.  

Astronomers recognize that on a [very, very, very large scale](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Earth's_Location_in_the_Universe_(JPEG).jpg), above the scale of the local superclusters of galaxies even, the isotropy of the universe can be assumed as true.  As you can see in the picture, this is not true on the scale of our Milky Way Galaxy.  Isotropy means that no matter where you look, everything appears similar and there's no distinguishing point of reference.  In the image, we can see that matter is pretty much equally spread out only on the observable universe level.

That being said, now we should consider how galaxies form.  There are four basic different structures to galaxies: spiral, elliptical, lenticular, and irregular.  These were proposed as a sort of ""evolution"" by Edwin Hubble and called the [Hubble Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence).  First, the Hubble Sequence doesn't take into account irregular galaxies, which formed (as you can assume from there name) in a very strange way, mostly in the beginning stages of the universe where matter interactions were really hectic.  

I'm going to put irregular galaxies aside because they aren't really what we're focusing on here, but there's not much more to say about them anyway.  What's left are spiral, elliptical, and lenticular galaxies.  They have different characteristics and form in different conditions.  Long story short, your question only involved star formation and spiral galaxies so I'm going to get into that specifically.  Spoiler: there is a more equal spacing of stars and matter in elliptical galaxies because they formed from galaxies merging together and are shaped, you guessed it, like an ellipse.

Finally!  Onto the good stuff.  Star formation and [spiral galaxies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy#Origin_of_the_spiral_structure)!  Our Milky Way and Solar System.  Both are surprisingly similar actually, so let's get down to it.  First off, spiral galaxies are classified by two things, whether they have a ""bar"" in the middle of them, or not.  This is shown in the Hubble sequence as the fork separating SBa from Sa.  As you can imagine, spiral galaxies are shaped in a spiral way with a group of stars in the middle surrounding the center.  Much like a sprinkler that is shooting water and spinning for a long time, the water or arms in this case appear to be curved due to the rotation of the center.  The spinning of the center is very important and will play a part in answering your question.

Star formation will actually explain both processes so I'm going to jump out of galaxies for a minute.  Imagine a cloud of Hydrogen and other dust just floating around in space.  If the conditions are right, maybe perhaps in the spiral arm of a galaxy where lots of new stars are formed, the cloud might be heated up and have the right pressure to start clumping Hydrogen molecules together.  Obviously, we know that the more mass something has, the more gravitational pull it has.  Even you and I have a slight gravitational pull.  The Hydrogen and other dust starts clumping together at a certain point as more and more matter is pulled toward it.  As more matter is pulled in, the center of the cloud where it's being pulled starts to rotate from being hit with particles.  Fast forward to lots of matter pulled in and gravity of the matter causing immense amounts of pressure down on itself, and you have a cloud with a [protostar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar)!  

Fast forward some more.  More and more matter is being gravitationally pulled into the protostar and more matter on top means more pressure at the core from matter pushing down on it.  It also means more rotation done by the protostar.  In the cloud, matter starts to orbit around the protostar because it is too far from the protostar to be pulled in and the spinning of the protostar has caused the matter to achieve a tangential velocity creating an orbit.  Now, we're at the point of the cloud looking like a rough haze of particles around a really hot ball.  As the particles in the cloud orbit, they too clump together to form planets, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, etc.  Here's where we get to the crux of your question.  Why do the planets form on a similar ""plane"" of the star system?  The reason is actually because of the spinning protostar.  

The protostar's spin causes the particles of dust and Hydrogen in the cloud to orbit in a specific direction.  That's all well and good, so now everything is orbiting around in the same direction as the protostar is spinning.  Back to another analogy.  If you have a rubber ball and you decide you want to spin it while throwing it in the air straight up, what should happen?  If you spin it like a pizza, the rubber balls top and bottom actually sinks into the middle part because of the spinning acting upon the particles in the rest of the ball.  The top and bottom contract in to the middle plane of the ball where you spun it!  Same concept, but on a much larger scale.  Spin the protostar fast enough, and the particles in the upper and lower parts of the system (not on the same plane as the spin) want to sink down into the plane, forming a sort of CD-like shape with the protostar in the middle and everything else orbiting the same way.  

Eventually, [the star gets big enough, hot enough, and has enough pressure to start Hydrogen fusion in the core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation) when it explodes with energy and blows off a lot of the remaining dust and cloud in the system, leaving planets, comets, asteroids, and moons behind.  The planets are still orbiting the star in the same rotational way, also rotating themselves, and their moons as well.  The system looks like a CD and there is little matter above or below the CD plane because of the rotation of the star enacting a force to push and pull everything *into* the plane itself.  You can actually apply the same principal to the formation of a spiral galaxy, although the formation is a little different.  

I hope this answers your question.  Let me know if it doesn't and I'll try and clear it up a little better.  

**TL;DR:** The star/supermassive black hole in the center pushes and pulls matter as the system/spiral galaxy is forming into a disk.  It pulls the matter into the disk by spinning and applying a force into the plane that acts on the matter.  When the matter is in the disk, the rotation/force around the still spinning star/supermassive black hole doesn't allow it to leave.  That's why there's not as much stuff above and below the plane of the system/spiral galaxy.",null,33,cdnfpuh,1rhu7r,askscience,top_day,199

TraderMoes,"The reason the solar system and galaxies are depicted this way is because they largely are flat. All of the planets in our solar system are in the same plane, give or take a few degrees. Pluto isn't, it's orbit has a tilt of 20+ degrees (not sure of the exact figure off the top of my head), and that is one of the reasons it was demoted from being a planet to being merely a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of asteroids on the outskirts of the solar system. Even further than the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud, and this is actually spherical and surrounds the entire solar system. 

The reason the main solar system is essentially horizontal though (by main I mean the planets and the sun), has to do with solar system formation. The solar system formed out of a cloud of gas that condensed and heated up. As it did so, due to conservation of angular momentum the gas started to spin faster, and as it spun and gas particles collided their orbits would change, and gradually align into roughly the same plane. That's why later when the sun and planets formed out of that gas, they all occupied the same plane, and all orbit and almost all rotate in the same direction. 

I'm not certain why galaxies are flat-ish as well, that's a good question. But to answer the rest of your question, the universe is actually not infinite, although for our purposes it may as well be since we can never reach or even see the edge. But yes, there are galaxies all around us, in every direction. The galaxies themselves are relatively ""flat,"" but they can be oriented in any direction and be in any direction from us. That is why we have photographs of some galaxies that look like we're looking at them from the top, while others we see only from the edge, and so forth. ",null,0,cdnggm8,1rhu7r,askscience,top_day,6

HappyRectangle,"Most of the planets and asteroids have been spun into the same plane by the forces of gravity and angular momentum. But not entirely -- Mercury is off by about 7 degrees, and Pluto is out of alignment by 17. 

But the ""above"" and ""below"" areas aren't completely empty. [Scattered disc objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc) are asteroids that take all kinds of orbits, are often found wildly outside of the plane, and can change their distance to the sun quite a bit as they orbit around it. 

The main problem with having such an off-kilter orbit is that sometimes, you'll come into close quarters with a large planet. While the chances of actually hitting the planet itself are very small (space is just so much bigger than the sizes of the planets), the gravitational pull of the planet will be enough to slightly alter your trajectory and put you into a different orbit. A kind of cosmic natural selection happens: if you can maintain your orbit for a billion years, that means you either have a nice, circular one, or you just happen to have a key position that never gets near a planet.

Pluto is an example of the latter. While Pluto's orbit crosses near Neptune's, it's aligned so that two Pluto orbits take exactly the same amount of time as three Nepture orbits. This ensures they will never get anywhere near each other by accident. (There are other planetoids that have this 2:3 resonance with Neptune too -- we call them *Plutinos*.)

By the way, if the dust cloud that made our solar system settled naturally, there would be much fewer scattered disc objects. The reason we have so many is because at some point a long, long, long time ago, the orbits of the outer planets [""abruptly"" shifted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model), and Neptune flew into an outer belt of asteroids, scattering them all over the place with its gravity (I put abruptly in quotes because it actually took millions of years).

GhengopelALPHA,"Since other people are focusing on the question of how the solar system is in a plane, I want to answer your hidden question about the difference between space and objects.

You seem to be confusing the term *space* as including all objects in it; the planets in their plane, the galaxy, etc. It is true that the space is (probably) infinite, but the solar system, the Milky Way, etc, are things in space, and are not including everything that is in space. A diagram of the solar system only includes the planets (which orbit in a plane) because those are the larger objects in the space between the Sun and other stars. There are plenty of comets and Kuiper Belt objects that orbit above and below this plane, but they are tiny compared to the planets. Likewise, there are the Large and Small Magellanic clouds which orbit (I think?) the Milky Way on tilted orbits, and of course, there's the Andromeda Galaxy, but each is an entirely separate object from the Milky Way.

The result of condensing gas clouds are a few rings of condensed matter on a plane where the total angular momentum along 2 axes more or less added up to 0, while the angular momentum around the 3rd axis keeps stuff rotating locally around nearly parallel axes.

severoon,"I thought you might find this interesting -http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=205 - which basically explains why accretion discs are flat.

The basic idea is: if you release a bunch of particles of matter in empty space and they're all stationary relative to each other, they'll just fall directly toward the center of mass of the whole system and crunch into a sphere. But this never happens. Things are always moving around.

Now you can imagine that if everything is moving directly toward that center of mass of the whole system, they'll all just accelerate and crunch even harder. But once again, this never happens. Things in the universe that get caught up in a system never happen to be flying directly toward the center of mass of the system.

Ok, so they're coming in from all directions. If it's going fast enough, a particle won't get captured by that system, its path will bend, but it will ultimately fly on through. But if it's not going fast enough to escape and it gets trapped, then it will start a spiraling orbit toward the center of mass of the system.

Now we have a bunch of stuff randomly spiraling in toward the center of mass. This still isn't a disc though, so why do we only see discs? Shouldn't it be a big swirling spherical mass? Seems like it should...

But if you think a little more, and give this system a long, long time to settle down into a stable situation, you'll see that it isn't the case. This is because every system has a net angular momentum. In other words, from all these random things falling in, you can add up the linear momentum, and that will tell you how the system as a whole is flying through space (in a straight line). About that point, though, everything is also rotating, and that's the angular momentum.

Over time, all these different things will collide with each other and all the momentum that is moving perpendicular to the accretion disc plane will start to cancel. Furthermore, the gravitational effect of all that mass in that accretion disc plane tends to pull things into it. From there, this matter all starts to compress together into local chunks, and you get planets. You may get a bunch of matter that happens to not settle down before it gets close together and collapses into a local chunk, and you have Neptune (the planet in our system that doesn't fall in our accretion disc, or some theories say it formed and get ejected from some other place and got captured by our sun).

santa167,"BA in Astrophysics here.  Your question involves how galaxies and star systems are formed and why they typically stay in the same plane.  Since it seems like no one has answered yet, I'll try and help you out.  To answer, I'm going to do a little background, first on galaxies, then on stars, and then I'll explain why there should not be as much matter above and below the plane of the Milky Way and our Solar System.  

You're correct in assuming that space is infinite, but from the sound of it, you are implicitly also assuming that it is isotropic on any level.  Essentially, the reason flat diagrams are bewildering is because you're thinking of space as completely evenly spread out with stars, planets, and other matter (like Hydrogen clouds and black holes and white dwarfs, etc.) roughly taking up the same spacial distance away from one another.  Space isn't like a 3D grid, however, especially on smaller scales.  

Astronomers recognize that on a [very, very, very large scale](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Earth's_Location_in_the_Universe_(JPEG).jpg), above the scale of the local superclusters of galaxies even, the isotropy of the universe can be assumed as true.  As you can see in the picture, this is not true on the scale of our Milky Way Galaxy.  Isotropy means that no matter where you look, everything appears similar and there's no distinguishing point of reference.  In the image, we can see that matter is pretty much equally spread out only on the observable universe level.

That being said, now we should consider how galaxies form.  There are four basic different structures to galaxies: spiral, elliptical, lenticular, and irregular.  These were proposed as a sort of ""evolution"" by Edwin Hubble and called the [Hubble Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence).  First, the Hubble Sequence doesn't take into account irregular galaxies, which formed (as you can assume from there name) in a very strange way, mostly in the beginning stages of the universe where matter interactions were really hectic.  

I'm going to put irregular galaxies aside because they aren't really what we're focusing on here, but there's not much more to say about them anyway.  What's left are spiral, elliptical, and lenticular galaxies.  They have different characteristics and form in different conditions.  Long story short, your question only involved star formation and spiral galaxies so I'm going to get into that specifically.  Spoiler: there is a more equal spacing of stars and matter in elliptical galaxies because they formed from galaxies merging together and are shaped, you guessed it, like an ellipse.

Finally!  Onto the good stuff.  Star formation and [spiral galaxies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy#Origin_of_the_spiral_structure)!  Our Milky Way and Solar System.  Both are surprisingly similar actually, so let's get down to it.  First off, spiral galaxies are classified by two things, whether they have a ""bar"" in the middle of them, or not.  This is shown in the Hubble sequence as the fork separating SBa from Sa.  As you can imagine, spiral galaxies are shaped in a spiral way with a group of stars in the middle surrounding the center.  Much like a sprinkler that is shooting water and spinning for a long time, the water or arms in this case appear to be curved due to the rotation of the center.  The spinning of the center is very important and will play a part in answering your question.

Star formation will actually explain both processes so I'm going to jump out of galaxies for a minute.  Imagine a cloud of Hydrogen and other dust just floating around in space.  If the conditions are right, maybe perhaps in the spiral arm of a galaxy where lots of new stars are formed, the cloud might be heated up and have the right pressure to start clumping Hydrogen molecules together.  Obviously, we know that the more mass something has, the more gravitational pull it has.  Even you and I have a slight gravitational pull.  The Hydrogen and other dust starts clumping together at a certain point as more and more matter is pulled toward it.  As more matter is pulled in, the center of the cloud where it's being pulled starts to rotate from being hit with particles.  Fast forward to lots of matter pulled in and gravity of the matter causing immense amounts of pressure down on itself, and you have a cloud with a [protostar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar)!  

Fast forward some more.  More and more matter is being gravitationally pulled into the protostar and more matter on top means more pressure at the core from matter pushing down on it.  It also means more rotation done by the protostar.  In the cloud, matter starts to orbit around the protostar because it is too far from the protostar to be pulled in and the spinning of the protostar has caused the matter to achieve a tangential velocity creating an orbit.  Now, we're at the point of the cloud looking like a rough haze of particles around a really hot ball.  As the particles in the cloud orbit, they too clump together to form planets, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, etc.  Here's where we get to the crux of your question.  Why do the planets form on a similar ""plane"" of the star system?  The reason is actually because of the spinning protostar.  

The protostar's spin causes the particles of dust and Hydrogen in the cloud to orbit in a specific direction.  That's all well and good, so now everything is orbiting around in the same direction as the protostar is spinning.  Back to another analogy.  If you have a rubber ball and you decide you want to spin it while throwing it in the air straight up, what should happen?  If you spin it like a pizza, the rubber balls top and bottom actually sinks into the middle part because of the spinning acting upon the particles in the rest of the ball.  The top and bottom contract in to the middle plane of the ball where you spun it!  Same concept, but on a much larger scale.  Spin the protostar fast enough, and the particles in the upper and lower parts of the system (not on the same plane as the spin) want to sink down into the plane, forming a sort of CD-like shape with the protostar in the middle and everything else orbiting the same way.  

Eventually, [the star gets big enough, hot enough, and has enough pressure to start Hydrogen fusion in the core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation) when it explodes with energy and blows off a lot of the remaining dust and cloud in the system, leaving planets, comets, asteroids, and moons behind.  The planets are still orbiting the star in the same rotational way, also rotating themselves, and their moons as well.  The system looks like a CD and there is little matter above or below the CD plane because of the rotation of the star enacting a force to push and pull everything *into* the plane itself.  You can actually apply the same principal to the formation of a spiral galaxy, although the formation is a little different.  

I hope this answers your question.  Let me know if it doesn't and I'll try and clear it up a little better.  

**TL;DR:** The star/supermassive black hole in the center pushes and pulls matter as the system/spiral galaxy is forming into a disk.  It pulls the matter into the disk by spinning and applying a force into the plane that acts on the matter.  When the matter is in the disk, the rotation/force around the still spinning star/supermassive black hole doesn't allow it to leave.  That's why there's not as much stuff above and below the plane of the system/spiral galaxy.",null,33,cdnfpuh,1rhu7r,askscience,top_day,199

TraderMoes,"The reason the solar system and galaxies are depicted this way is because they largely are flat. All of the planets in our solar system are in the same plane, give or take a few degrees. Pluto isn't, it's orbit has a tilt of 20+ degrees (not sure of the exact figure off the top of my head), and that is one of the reasons it was demoted from being a planet to being merely a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of asteroids on the outskirts of the solar system. Even further than the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud, and this is actually spherical and surrounds the entire solar system. 

The reason the main solar system is essentially horizontal though (by main I mean the planets and the sun), has to do with solar system formation. The solar system formed out of a cloud of gas that condensed and heated up. As it did so, due to conservation of angular momentum the gas started to spin faster, and as it spun and gas particles collided their orbits would change, and gradually align into roughly the same plane. That's why later when the sun and planets formed out of that gas, they all occupied the same plane, and all orbit and almost all rotate in the same direction. 

I'm not certain why galaxies are flat-ish as well, that's a good question. But to answer the rest of your question, the universe is actually not infinite, although for our purposes it may as well be since we can never reach or even see the edge. But yes, there are galaxies all around us, in every direction. The galaxies themselves are relatively ""flat,"" but they can be oriented in any direction and be in any direction from us.

But the ""above"" and ""below"" areas aren't completely empty. [Scattered disc objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc) are asteroids that take all kinds of orbits, are often found wildly outside of the plane, and can change their distance to the sun quite a bit as they orbit around it. 

The main problem with having such an off-kilter orbit is that sometimes, you'll come into close quarters with a large planet. While the chances of actually hitting the planet itself are very small (space is just so much bigger than the sizes of the planets), the gravitational pull of the planet will be enough to slightly alter your trajectory and put you into a different orbit. A kind of cosmic natural selection happens: if you can maintain your orbit for a billion years, that means you either have a nice, circular one, or you just happen to have a key position that never gets near a planet.

Pluto is an example of the latter. While Pluto's orbit crosses near Neptune's, it's aligned so that two Pluto orbits take exactly the same amount of time as three Nepture orbits. This ensures they will never get anywhere near each other by accident. (There are other planetoids that have this 2:3 resonance with Neptune too -- we call them *Plutinos*.)

By the way, if the dust cloud that made our solar system settled naturally, there would be much fewer scattered disc objects. The reason we have so many is because at some point a long, long, long time ago, the orbits of the outer planets [""abruptly"" shifted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model), and Neptune flew into an outer belt of asteroids, scattering them all over the place with its gravity (I put abruptly in quotes because it actually took millions of years).

You seem to be confusing the term *space* as including all objects in it; the planets in their plane, the galaxy, etc. It is true that the space is (probably) infinite, but the solar system, the Milky Way, etc, are things in space, and are not including everything that is in space.

severoon,"I thought you might find this interesting -http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=205 - which basically explains why accretion discs are flat.

The basic idea is: if you release a bunch of particles of matter in empty space and they're all stationary relative to each other, they'll just fall directly toward the center of mass of the whole system and crunch into a sphere. But this never happens. Things are always moving around.

Now you can imagine that if everything is moving directly toward that center of mass of the whole system, they'll all just accelerate and crunch even harder. But once again, this never happens. Things in the universe that get caught up in a system never happen to be flying directly toward the center of mass of the system.

Ok, so they're coming in from all directions. If it's going fast enough, a particle won't get captured by that system, its path will bend, but it will ultimately fly on through. But if it's not going fast enough to escape and it gets trapped, then it will start a spiraling orbit toward the center of mass of the system.

Now we have a bunch of stuff randomly spiraling in toward the center of mass. This still isn't a disc though, so why do we only see discs? Shouldn't it be a big swirling spherical mass? Seems like it should...

But if you think a little more, and give this system a long, long time to settle down into a stable situation, you'll see that it isn't the case. This is because every system has a net angular momentum. In other words, from all these random things falling in, you can add up the linear momentum, and that will tell you how the system as a whole is flying through space (in a straight line). About that point, though, everything is also rotating, and that's the angular momentum.

Over time, all these different things will collide with each other and all the momentum that is moving perpendicular to the accretion disc plane will start to cancel. Furthermore, the gravitational effect of all that mass in that accretion disc plane tends to pull things into it. From there, this matter all starts to compress together into local chunks, and you get planets. You may get a bunch of matter that happens to not settle down before it gets close together and collapses into a local chunk, and you have Neptune (the planet in our system that doesn't fall in our accretion disc, or some theories say it formed and get ejected from some other place and got captured by our sun).

Along comes a meteor and nails a planet hard enough to spew a bit of its molten core into orbit around it, and you have the rings of Saturn.",null,1,cdnsbp7,1rhu7r,askscience,top_day,3

Halysites,"Two reasons:

1. When a star is going through [fusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star#Formation_and_evolution), it will combine hydrogen to form heavier and heavier atoms. The basic reaction series would be: 

* hydrogen + hydrogen = helium
* helium + helium = carbon
* carbon + carbon = iron
* there will be other combinations of fusing atoms which would result in the creation of neon, silicon, etc. This is just a very simple list (I'm just a simple geologist and chemistry is not my speciality).

Once a star has burned all it's fuel to generate iron, it will undergo a supernova (or some other process, depending on it's size). Since iron was the last atom to be produced during the fusion process the star will be very rich with iron. If it's goes through a supernova it ends up ejecting most of it's material into the space around it; during this process heavier elements may form as well. So the space around it becomes enriched in a variety of elements, especially iron. This material is what will be used to form planets.

2. Planetary material begins to accrete from the rich stuff spewed out by a dying star. It is very hot and so the material is molten. As the planetoids get larger and larger, gravity becomes a stronger force. Gravity, coupled with a molten states, means that heavier elements are pulled towards the core of the planetary body quickly. Iron, being very heavy, will sink towards the core. Other heavy (metallic) elements will also sink to the core.

Viola, you have an iron-rich core for rocky planets. This process doesn't exactly apply to gas giants like Jupiter (which would be relatively depleted in iron).

It's an intrinsic form of angular momentum. The perhaps most significant or immediate effect is that electrons get a magnetic moment, as you would have classically with a rotating charge.

Spin doesn't actually have any special relationship to entanglement, all the measurable properties about particles can become entangled. Electron spin is just a good example, because it can only take two possible values.

Anyway, the real-world consequences of spin are inestimable, because nearly all matter would behave very very differently if electrons had zero spin and didn't need to obey the Pauli principle. The only chemical bond that would exist in its current form be the simplest molecule of all, H2.

Via the spin-statistics theorem of relativistic quantum theory, spin is in fact associated with the distinction between bosons (which don't obey Pauli exclusion), and fermions (which do). This distinction has unimaginably significant consequences - for example, without Pauli exclusion, matter as we think of it could not exist.

Because it is a form of angular momentum, charged particles with non-zero spin give rise to magnetic effects. Ferromagnetism is a familiar example of such.

Rastafak,"There are two reasons why spin is important. First spin creates a magnetic moment. Magnetism in most materials is directly caused by electron's spin. There is also whole field which studies the effect of spin in microelectronic devices called spintronics. The other reason is Pauli exclusion principle. As others have stated, this is incredibly important for bonds for example. Solids and molecules would look very differently if electrons had 0 spin. 

I can tell you a bit more about spintronics because this is what I'm doing. Spintronics studies the interplay between electron's charge and spin. In other words we study electronics in which spin plays a role. You most likely actually own a spintronics device: the magnetic sensors in HDD's are based on spintronic effects called [Giant Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_magnetoresistance) or [Tunneling Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_magnetoresistance). In these sensors, there are two magnetic layers, one of them has fixed direction of magnetic moments, while the other can rotate in external field. Due to spintronic effects, resistivity of this structure depends on the relative orientation of the two layers. If you put it in external magnetic field, the free layer will align with the field and you can then measure its orientation by passing current through the structure. 

You can also make a memory based on these effects, where 0 is represented by the case when the two layers are oriented in the same direction, while 1 is the case, when they have opposite directions. These memories are not very widespread but they are made commercially and there is a lot of development in that area. [Here](http://www.everspin.com/) is one company, which sells them. Apart from these applications, there is a lot of basic research going on in spintronics.

penisgoatee,"Spin is sort of a big deal.

If it weren't for spin, we wouldn't have hard drives. Electrons can have one of two spin states (spin up or spin down). The different states react to magnetic fields differently, this gives rise to [Tunnel Magnetoresistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_magnetoresistance), which is used in hard drives. So, yes, spin is quite tangible.

So what *is* spin? It's intrinsic angular momentum. Angular momentum depends on how fast you're spinning relative to an axis. For the spinning earth, the outer surface has angular momentum because it is spinning relative to the poles. For an electron, well, there are no poles. There's not really even a radius. And, yet, the electron still has the same kind of angular momentum as the spinning Earth. That's why we say it is intrinsic - it's just always there. 

Spin has the effect of making it seem like an electron is a little loop of current. The electron has a charge that is ""spinning"". Little loops of current make magnetic fields and interact with them. So spin is the origin of many magnetic phenomena, like permanent magnets and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 

Why is there spin? Well, why is there charge? Why is there mass? As Feynman pointed out, ""Why?"" isn't always a productive question. We could go on a crackpot tangent about how the electron is a nebulous ball of energy which may or may not have some intrinsic rotation, but that's not experimentally verifiable or well accepted by the physics community at large.

There are ways to represent it in classical terms like the vector model ""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/vecmod.html"" however I myself don't really like this model and take spin to just exist as whatever numerical value it is in my head.

Spin is essentially the magnetic property of a particle (or collection of particles), it's made up of spin angular momentum component, and a magnetic moment component. Magnetic Moment = Gyromagnetic Ratio x Spin Angular Momentum. The spin angular momentum value is derived from quantum mechanics, and the Gyromagnetic ratio is specific for each particle/atom. As the name implies, the magnetic moment is a moment, and if you want help imagining it, think of it as the moment at which the particle/overall atom is actually spinning, and is usually the quantity used for calculations to do with how much things affect/change spin. The spin angular momentum component of this is limited quantum mechanically to a specific number of orientations, depending on the amount of nuclear particles in question. This means that the magnetic properties can have a quantised number of states for an atom, and this is proven in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. This experiment fired nuclei (of something spin 1/2 I think, so with 2 allowed spin orientations), through a magnetic field and onto a detector. Only two spots were detected, implying that the field only had nuclei of two sets of magnetic properties pass through it, with one spot above the altitude at which the nuclei were fired (horizontally) and one below (indicating a positive, and negative spin, both nuclei were displaced by the same amount but in different directions).
 If you put nuclei in a magnetic field and fire electromagnetic waves at them, their overall spin will change when certain frequencies are used. This is the basis of NMR chemistry and the frequency (Larmor frequency) that causes these transitions depends on the magnetic moment of the species in question, the Gyromagnetic ratio, and the strength if the applied magnetic field. Many complicated extra effects arise from doing NMR and it can be used to figure out the chemical structure of many chemicals, using quantitative methods, in both organic and inorganic chemistry. Even now the field is continuously being improved as the sample quantities required to carry out NMR are too high (because of sensitivity issues caused by radio waves used in NMR being of low energy; compared to waves used in other methods of spectroscopy), these low sample qualities mean that biologists studying cells always wine about not being able to NMR the little things they find etc.

This setup with all the implied constraints (small droplet, same liquid in pool and droplet, most likely water, medium velocity) is complicated and chaotic enough, and even then it's hard to delimit the cases. A very low velocity droplet of water would rest on the surface and ""rebound"" without creating a real secondary droplet, like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynk4vJa-VaQ). A very high velocity droplet would cause outward splash like an impact crater that could go higher than what you call the secondary droplet (which might instead be a disorderly spray). Not to mention that even at medium velocity, there can be more than one secondary droplet.

Keeping this in mind, consider that your condition ""a droplet or an object"" does not place constraints on the objects, so it's even harder to make a useful statement. What about the shape of the objects for example? A brick will impact differently than a marble, and you could probably optimize the shape to increase splashback as well. 

In the picturebook case the viscosity of the liquid and the speed and size of the droplet ( = total kinetic energy transmitted) should be the decisive factors for the rebound behavior (see [Weber number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_number)). Extremely high surface tension could inhibit droplet formation, but realistically its impact would be small outside of borderline cases I imagine.

animeturtles,"What you are probably thinking of is a kind of classic setup [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ37RLXNAgc) with one or two rebound droplets. This setup with all the implied constraints (small droplet, same liquid in pool and droplet, most likely water, medium velocity) is complicated and chaotic enough, and even then it's hard to delimit the cases. A very low velocity droplet of water would rest on the surface and ""rebound"" without creating a real secondary droplet, like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynk4vJa-VaQ). A very high velocity droplet would cause outward splash like an impact crater that could go higher than what you call the secondary droplet (which might instead be a disorderly spray). Not to mention that even at medium velocity, there can be more than one secondary droplet.

Keeping this in mind, consider that your condition ""a droplet or an object"" does not place constraints on the objects, so it's even harder to make a useful statement. What about the shape of the objects for example? A brick will impact differently than a marble, and you could probably optimize the shape to increase splashback as well. 

In the picturebook case the viscosity of the liquid and the speed and size of the droplet ( = total kinetic energy transmitted) should be the decisive factors for the rebound behavior (see [Weber number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_number)). Extremely high surface tension could inhibit droplet formation, but realistically its impact would be small outside of borderline cases I imagine.

If *any* object can be chosen, I doubt that you can find an optimum mass and velocity, and I would conjecture that, given an infinite pool, the rebound can grow more or less indefinitely with the size of the object.

I think to prove mental illness in any species, we have to have a very good understanding of that species' behavior and/or brain functioning.

xavier_505,"This is likely an issue with the way the MPEG streams are configured. Generally MPEG-2 encoding (I am not especially familiar with MPEG 4 but I would hazard a guess that it is similar, or at a very minimum has great flexibility in its configuration) uses three types of frames: I, B and P.

- I (intra) frames are full frames of data encoded similarly to JPEG (~7:1 compression). These do not reference any other frames.

- P (predicted) frames only have information describing the difference between the preceding I or P frame (lower size than I frames, ~20:1 compression).

Both I and P frames are called ""reference frames"" since the information they describe can be referenced by other frames.

- B (bidirectional) frames are encoded from interpolation of preceding/following reference frames (even smaller than P frames, ~50:1 compression).

These various frame types are typically sent in the following way:

    I B B P B B I B B P B B I P B B....

Where the distance between I/P frames (in this case it is 3) is configurable as is the distance between I frames (in this case there are 6).

Why am I telling you this!? Well, a P frame cannot be decoded without its referenced I frame, and B frames cannot be decoded without all of their referenced I/P frame. So, the longer the distances mentioned above, the greater affect a lossy channel will have. You would see the behavior you are describing in the following case:

    MPEG2 GOP structure (m=2, n=4): I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B ....

    MPEG4 GOP structure (m=4, n=16): I B B B P B B B P B B B P B B B I B B B P B B B P B B B P B B B ....

1.2, 1.22, 1.222, 1.2222, 1.22222, etc.

If you count these numbers one by one, you'll notice that it goes on infinitely long. This is a type of ""countable infinity"" (alternatively, [aleph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number)-zero or [beth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_number)-zero), because it's an infinity arising from (surprise surprise) a list you can count through.

However, there are even bigger kinds of infinity -- each of which is ""uncountable"" -- one of which describes the number of numbers between 1 and 2. As it turns out, there's no way to come up with a method to list all numbers between 1 and 2 one-by-one simply because there are way-too-fucking-many of them. Perhaps paradoxically, though, you can show that describing all the numbers between 1 and 2 is just as hard as describing those between and 1000000, so the two infinities are actually said to be the same (specifically, it's called the ""beth-one"" infinity).

Very roughly speaking, it is unclear if there is an infinity between beth-zero (countable infinity) and beth-one (the type of incountable infinity we just discussed). Whether or not this ""beth-half"" exists depends on how you decide to model the world, and is the topic of something called ""[the continuum hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis)"" in mathematics.",null,0,cdnee15,1rhegr,askscience,top_day,2
medstudent22,"There are several known benefits to neonatal circumcision. 

- **It prevents penile cancer.** Squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is exceedingly rare in circumcised patients. Circumcision alone may not be the preventative measure. [Phimosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis) (the inability to retract the foreskin) can only occur in non-circumcised individuals and is associated with a higher risk of penile cancer. Phimosis, in many cases, is preventable with adequate hygiene. It should also be noted that penile cancer is extremely rare 1-2 out of 200,000 men per year. Also worthwhile to note that somewhere between 909 and 322,000 circumcisions would need to be performed in order to prevent one case of penile cancer. 

- **It reduces the risk of UTIs in early life and up to 5 years of age.** Uncircumcised males are 20x more likely to develop a UTI during the neonatal period. It should be noted that 111 circumcisions must be performed to prevent one UTI though. Some cost analyses have shown that there is still a cost benefit to performing circumcisions when just considering UTIs though.  
 

There are some claimed benefits of circumcision with varying amounts of evidence. 
 
- **It may reduce the spread of HIV** (to men, in heterosexual relationships). This is based on several large African clinical trials. It was not found to reduce the risk of transmission to women and has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission in homosexual male couples. 

- **It may reduce the transmission of HPV and herpes (HSV).** In a study of 3393 men (1684 who underwent circumcision), after two years, 7.8% of the circumcised men had HSV-2 antibodies, 10.3% of the uncircumcised group did. In the same study, 18% of the circumcised men had evidence of HPV, 27.9% of uncircumcised men did. ([Study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0802556)) It should be noted that this study was performed in Uganda. Also worthwhile to note that most individuals clear HPV spontaneously and also that a [vaccine is available](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardasil) for the most common HPV strains. Also worthwhile to note that HPV is associated with penile cancer, but more importantly cervical cancer in women.  

The reason I tried to note the conclusions which were drawn based on African studies is that the underlying prevalence of disease has an effect on the study and these results may not be considered generalizable to other populations.  

Multiple groups have issued statements on neonatal circumcision which may contain more information that may be useful to you.

Christmas_Pirate,"All right my time to shine.  First lets examine exactly how information is stored on a DVD, before we get to how much information can be stored.  As I am sure you know, information is stored by essentially burning little holes in a metallic film in the DVD (not completely accurate, but a reasonable enough description of what is going on).  As technology progressed we have been able to burn smaller and smaller holes, hence the larger storage capacities.  Additionally we have been able to burn different ""types"" of holes I.E. DVD +/- (Dual layer literally means two layers of the metallic film, so double the storage capacity per square inch of DVD), thereby allowing more data to be stored since it could be stored in 3 variations of holes, if you will, instead of two (hole and no hole).  The [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) page goes into detail about this, so I wont bother.  

Now, while we have been able to make smaller and smaller lasers, we have not been able to change the laws of physics, one of which is all wavelengths have a [diffraction limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system).  Essentially, no matter how good your lens is, you can't focus a beam of light to a point smaller than half it's wavelength, and this is the hurdle consumer products have yet to overcome.  Blueray DVDs can store more information because the laser being used to burn them is blue, which has a shorter wavelength than red or IR (the other commonly used lasers).  The cost of the respective machines has a lot to do with manufacturing of the diodes, but I digress.

Now to the meat of the question; how much data can we store on a DVD?  Well that all depends how small we can make the burns.  Recently technologies have been developed that allow us to make tiny, tiny, burns.  How tiny?  From what I've read they claimed to be able to store 1 petabyte (that's 1,024 terabytes or 1,049,000 gigabytes). [Source](https://theconversation.com/more-data-storage-heres-how-to-fit-1-000-terabytes-on-a-dvd-15306).  How did they do this?  Well you're just going to have to do a little bit of reading to find that out.

**TL;DR:** Storage is limited by the size burn we can make with a laser in a thin metallic sheet inside the DVD.  The smallest burn we've made allows us to store roughly 1,000 terabyes or 1,000,000 gigabytes, although the technology to do this hasn't been made available to consumers.  It should be shortly as it doesn't use any novel technology, just a novel way of burning with current technologies.

8.5–8.7 GB (single-sided, double-layer)
9.4 GB (double-sided, single-layer)
17.08 GB (double-sided, double-layer – rare)

The unit of measurement, however, is in **decimal metric** - which has base units of 1000. 1000 bytes = 1 kilobyte, 1000 kilobytes = 1 megabyte, 1000 megabytes = 1 gigabyte.

Computers count in **binary** and have base units of 1024. So 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte - so on an so forth.

Therefore, the capacity of a 4.7 gigabyte DVD is 4700000000 bytes in decimal. But when divided by 1024 kilobytes, 1024 megabytes, and 1024 gigabytes, the capacity is ~4.48 gigabytes. Once the disk is formatted you may lose a few more megabytes.

This same principle can be applied to the other sizes of DVD's as well as hard drives - which are sold with the same confusing capacity claims.

A computer will see it as the binary capacity of 976562500 kilobytes, 953674 megabytes, 931.3 gigabytes.

Once you format the hard drive disk you lose a few more kilo/megabytes, but essentially, you have 931 gigabytes.

The reason why your DVD has a capacity of 6.1 gigabytes is because it started off as a 8.5–8.7 GB (single-sided, double-layer) disc, and once the data was burned / copied to the disc - the disc was **mastered / finalized**. This process completes the disc and does not allow any more data to be written to the disc. The DVD will now report to the computer the total size of the data written to the disc.

ThePsuedoMonkey,"Clothes dryers function by evaporating the water in the clothes, and the rate of evaporation of a liquid is directly related to its vapor pressure.  The vapor pressure of water is an [exponential function of temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure#Boiling_point_of_water), roughly 2.5kPa at room temperature and 101kPa when it boils.  An electrical heating element in a dryer will create heat by electrical resistance, and [Ohms Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor#Power_dissipation) states that the power dissipated by a resistor is the product of its resistance and the voltage that is applied to it.

If the amount of water in the clothes were sufficiently small, this would mean that it would be more efficient to dry them at high heat in an enclosed space (do not do this, it is fire hazard).  However, [there is likely](http://www.verber.com/mark/outdoors/gear/clothing-waterabsorption.html) a significant amount of water remaining in the clothes, and based on the room temperature vapor pressure, each kilogram of water will need 44 liters of completely dry air in order to fully evaporate in (which could become a corrosion or electrical hazard when it condenses after the dryer cools).

Because of this, air is vented through the dryer to expel the water-saturated air.  This additional air that must be heated, and there is no guarantee that all of it will be water-saturated by the time it is expelled, but the act of venting air can also help promote evaporation.  The amount of energy lost due to venting is proportional to the dryers temperature and the flow rate of the air, and the amount of energy lost due to thermal radiation is also proportional to the dryers temperature difference with the ambient air due to the first law of thermodynamics.  Reducing the temperature setting would reduce both of theses losses for any given moment, though the drying period would significantly increase due to the associated drop in vapor pressure.

BigWiggly1,"There are a lot of factors brought up by ThePsuedoMonkey's comment, and I recommend reading through his comment as well.

I'm going to go with a bit of gut instinct and tell you **no**. I will proceed by first explaining relative humidity, followed by how the dryer is working, and finally returning to the answer of your question.

For water to evaporate, the air it's in contact with needs to be able to hold it. The air's ability to hold it is measured as it's **Relative Humidity (RH)**. As heat is added to the air, its relative humidity decreases and it can hold more water.
Additionally, the lower the RH of the air is, the more quickly the water is able to evaporate. As water vapour saturates the air, the RH goes up and it becomes more and more difficult for that volume of air to pick up more water (Imagine it's arms are full and the more full they get, the more stuff they drop each time they bend over to pick up something new. Eventually it drops water just as fast as it picks it up).

Dryers work by taking air from the outside (ambient air), raising it's temperature, and circulating it through the dryer before sending it back out through the lint screen. The dryer would work, albeit rather slowly, without heating the air. Ambient air is usually not at 100% RH, so it can still hold more water. Lets say you put your clothes in for 60 minutes. At high heat, that's enough to dry them to your liking. At no heat (tumble only), they may still feel damp. Lets rule that out as not an option, because you've got somewhere to be in an hour and your favourite pants just got out of the washer.

By heating the air, the RH of the inlet air to the dryer is lowered as it's temperature rises, giving it the ability to hold more water (I guess it has bigger arms?). This means that for every volume of air that goes through the dryer, more water comes out with it. Additionally this helps to speed up the last bits of drying, where there isn't much water left. Warmer air will also heat the clothes, giving the water some extra energy to boost themselves into the vapour state so it can be carried off. Without heat, the last bits of water are simply too cold to evaporate quickly enough.

To address the energy efficiency:

Heating requires a lot of energy. Any heating process is a fairly inefficient process. Resistor heating elements are good at what they do, but nobody ever claims for them to be efficient. Moving air on the other hand is relatively easy to do (as long as you clean your lint screen). It's much more efficient to pump a volume of fluid (air) than it is to heat that same volume.

In the first stages of drying, there is so much water on the clothes that regardless of how warm the air is, it will saturate with water. There's simply an excess of water. This may make you say ""So lets heat it even more and it'll take more out with each chunk of air right?"" Yes, you are right. *Instead though*, we know it's cheaper to move air than it is to heat it, so let's be patient and let the moving air do it's work. In fact dryers would be more efficient if they increased the air flowrate in the early stages of the drying cycle, and decreased the heating requirements.

As mentioned earlier, in the last stages of drying when there isn't much water, warmer air is able to force water out of it's little microscopic nooks and crannies by giving it more energy. At this point, air circulation isn't as important because there isn't enough water in the clothes to saturate the air that's in there anyways. Now, air circulation is only to prevent overheating that could cause a fire hazard. Still, every bit of air that gets heated and then vented too soon is a waste of energy.

So now that we've covered what is good at the early and late stages of drying, we can make general statements on what the most efficient dryer would do: Start out on low heat with high circulation, followed by a steady increase of heat until finishing while the air flowrate is decreased proportionally to the temperature, but always above a minimum flowrate to prevent overheating.

Since I don't know about any of these fancy dryers on the market, and most people are tempted to use the timed dry options rather than an auto-dry option (which uses an RH or moisture sensor to determine when to stop drying), I will say that it is most efficient to stick to the least amount of heat necessary to get your clothes to a satisfactory level of dryness, because heating is the most inefficient process in your dryer.

As a good compromise between length of cycle and heating required, **use medium heat**. I've noticed that medium heat often doesn't take noticeably longer than a high heat cycle, and does the job well enough.

Alternatively, if you're looking to be the most efficient you could dry on low and manually increase the temperature every 15 minutes or so.

If you're a dryer manufacturer and reading this, consider making the auto-dry cycle adjust airflow and temperature based on the RH leaving the dryer (based on the sensor already in the installation). ",null,2,cdne9bx,1rh9np,askscience,top_day,13
RabidRabb1t,"This all depends on what you mean by ""efficient.""  Since I can just hang my clothes up and watch them dry (although it takes some time), the application of any extra heat that I then shunt outdoors is clearly wasteful.

If by efficient, you mean in terms of the product your time waiting and cost of drying (economic efficiency), that's a slightly more interesting question.  There are two things to consider: first, that the energy required to vaporize the water in your clothes from room temperature is essentially a constant.  Secondly, the rate of energy transfer is related to the temperature difference between the air and the clothes by an exponential function.  Now, if you keep running hot air over your clothes at a constant rate, relying on the efficiency of energy transfer, we can now figure out the function form of our economic efficiency.
  
Assuming you charge an hourly rate, the opportunity cost to you is simply your rate, R, times the amount of time, time, that it takes to dry your clothes.  The cost to you on your electric bill is the time it takes to dry your clothes multiplied by your power company's rate, P, and the rate of energy usage, E.  Since resistive heating is ~100%, we're going to make the approximation that E proportional to the amount you heated your clothing up.  The only thing left is how much time it takes as a function of temperature (exponential).

So, you're left with:

cost = R * [1/[exp(E)]^2 * P * E

where time is 1/[exp(E)].

Since this function goes to zero very fast, the short answer is that yes, higher temperatures are good for your wallet.  Please note that I did leave out a massive fudge factor, namely that the amount of waste heat is also going to increase in this model since I did not actually bother to take the integral of the exponential; however, the point remains.

&gt;Consumers can dry clothes with less energy by using (in order of energy savings):    

&gt;1. Outdoor clothes lines get clothes dry using no energy and with no HVAC impacts.    
&gt;2. Indoor drying racks use no direct energy but do have an HVAC impact. The total energy impact is lower than any currently available dryer.    
&gt;3. A natural gas dryer is cheaper to operate and has lower environmental impacts than an
electric dryer.    
&gt;4. High washer spin speeds are more [energy] efficient than evaporating the water in the dryer.    
&gt;5. Drying full loads is more [energy] efficient than a larger number of partial loads.    
&gt;6. A “low heat” setting is more [energy] efficient than higher heat settings.    
&gt;7. A “less dry” setting is more [energy] efficient than “normal” or “more dry.” 

Note that I added the ""[energy]"" in there in a few points, because it is obvious from the context that is what they mean by the use of the word ""efficient"" -- which by itself is otherwise an ambiguous word (i.e. something can said to be more ""efficient"" if it gets the job done faster -- so to a consumer a machine that lets them do 5 full loads within 2 hours will be more ""efficient"" than one that only does 3 loads in the same time period.)

c8726,"I would say the high heat would be more efficient. 

Drying clothes is just a phase change from liquid to gas. The total energy required to evaporate the water would be the same regardless of the setting. The energy required would just depend on the initial temperature of the clothes, the amount of water in the clothes, the specific heat of water (4.186 kJ/kg K) and the heat of vaporization for water (2260 kJ/kg). 

Lets say we have m=5 kg of water in our clothes close to room temp, To=300K. We need to heat the water to Tb=373K, the boiling point of water at STP, since we are in an open system to the atmosphere. 
We need 4.186 kJ/KgK x m x [Tb-To]=1,527.89 KJ to raise the temp up to boiling point of water. Now we need 2260 kJ/kg x m=11,300 kJ to vaporize the water. In total, 12,827.89 kJ or 35.76 kWh of energy is needed to evaporate the water.

If you assume that the dryer for both cycles is able to heat the water to the boiling point and the  rate of heat absorption to be the same for both cycles, the only thing that matters is the duration of which the motors run to spin the drum and blower.

RelativisticMechanic,"&gt;Lets say you crush a planet down to mosquito size to form a blackhole.

Alright, we have a black hole of 1 Earth Mass.

&gt;Apparently it would evaporate really fast from your outside frame of reference.

Not really. The lifetime of a Schwarzschild black hole with the mass of the Earth would be about 500 trillion trillion trillion trillion years (as measured by those of us far from the event horizon for the duration).

&gt;But how could any effect pass over the event horizon to reduce the mass of the blackhole?

Nothing necessarily crosses the event horizon; rather, the curvature of spacetime near (but outside) the event horizon produces (nearly) thermal radiation that can be intercepted by those of us far from the black hole. In this process, the spacetime curvature relaxes, manifesting in a decrease in the surface area of the event horizon: the black hole shrinks.

One can, with suitable constructions, model this behavior as a tunneling process whereby particles from inside the event horizon tunnel out; this is analogous to other tunneling behavior wherein particles traverse a classically impenetrable barrier due to quantum mechanical effects.

&gt; I know that things can pass over the EH from their own reference frame - but not from an outside frame.

In fact they *can* cross into the black hole, even in a far-removed frame. The idea that they can't comes from an idealization where you neglect the mass of the infalling object (which we can reasonably assume is very, very small compared to the black hole mass). Even in that approximation, though, if we account for the quantization of light, there will be a final photon emitted from the infalling object. Once that photon is emitted, it will never again be seen by anything outside of the event horizon.",null,0,cdnag5o,1rh0ay,askscience,top_day,3

When the pair of virtual particles are ""created"", if one sticks around with positive mass, then the other must have a negative mass in order to cancel out (and they must cancel out, no free energy)

So the positive mass one shoots off away from the black hole, and the negative mass one enters the black hole which reduces its overall mass. ",null,0,cdn9pcd,1rh0ay,askscience,top_day,1
Nicked777,"The Hawking radiation is a deeply quantum mechanical effect, but here is an intuitive way to think about it. The uncertainty principle requires the creation of particle antiparticle pairs, everywhere, all the time. These particles locally violate conservation of energy, which is allowed in QM, as long as it happens on short enough time scales. This means the two particles annihilate very quickly, as if they were never there. 

The point of hawking radiation is if this happens very close to a black hole's event horizon, one of the particles can get sucked in, and the other will escape, albeit very reduced in energy from its trip. Because of this the Hawking radiation is believed to be very weak. A specialist in this topic could explain why it seems to be only the anti particles that fall in, and why we think this admittedly bizarre idea could me true, but I don't know off the top of my head.

claireauriga,"There are definitely equations that can describe what is going on! Heat and mass transfer are an important part of physics and engineering. 

In order to melt, the ice must be raised to its melting point temperature, then given enough energy to melt into liquid. This energy needs to come from somewhere. Heat moves from hotter to colder places, so the warm air will give energy to the ice (and water) until they are the same temperature. 

There are some complications in calculating all this, however. For example, if the air is stagnant then it will get colder as it gives up energy, which means transfer to the sculpture will slow down. If the air is moving, we also have to think about how fast it's going and if it's removing some of the water as vapour too. 

There are many more and less detailed ways of describing what's going on, but in the very simplest terms, the bigger the temperature difference between the air and the ice, the faster energy will transfer. The lower the ice temperature is below its melting point, the more energy needs to be added to make it warm up and melt. ",null,0,cdngq51,1rgzx3,askscience,top_day,3

If a fluid has a higher cohesive force attracting it to a container wall than the intermolecular forces then the fluid will have a concave meniscus.
If a fluid has a lower cohesive force attracting it to a container wall than the intermolecular forces then the fluid will have a convex meniscus.

Since gels behave is a solid-liquid hybrid way, the presence or absence of a meniscus would most likely depend on the physical properties of the gel. It really depends on weather the cohesive forces described above are enough to deform the gels structure.

Technically, yes. But the technical definition of temperature isn't what you think it is. More on that in a moment. 

Absolute zero is exactly the same as zero Kelvin. 

Who told you that the temperature of a black hole is absolute zero? That's certainly not correct. In fact, it's not possible for any matter to be at a temperature of exactly zero kelvin, due to the zero-point motion inherent in quantum mechanics. We can get incredibly close in a laboratory (somewhere in the range of hundreds of picoKelvin) but it's not possible to attain exactly zero kelvin. 

As for negative temperature: the colloquial understanding of temperature is something like ""temperature is the average kinetic energy of the constituent particles in a material."" That's a very useful tool for intuitively understanding things like heat capacity, but it's not the ""real"" definition. In thermodynamics, temperature is defined as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect to entropy (not sure how to format that symbolically, so I won't try). There are some kinda-convoluted, not-entirely-realistic examples of physical scenarios with negative temperature. That is, you add a bit of energy to the system, and the entropy goes down. For example, suppose you have N light switches, and each ""quanta"" of energy is represented as turning on one light switch. The entropy of a system is related to the number of configurations (microstates) that lead to the same macroscopic result, so let's say that you have N-1 switches turned on. Then the entropy is, more or less, N (since there are N ways to have N-1 switches turned on in a collection on N switches). Now you add one ""quanta"" of energy and turn on the last light switch. How many microstates are there now? Only one. There's exactly one way to have N out of N light switches turned on. Since we added a unit of energy and saw the entropy decrease, the system could be said to have ""negative temperature"" if you like. There are physical systems that come close to this analogy, but I think the ""light bulb scenario"" is easier to digest.",null,2,cdn51ib,1rgv22,askscience,top_day,9

MonadicTraversal,"&gt; Any faster or slower, closer or farther, or difference in direction of travel and the body would de-orbit, spiralling toward the planet or star it's orbiting or flinging off into outer space.

This isn't true. If you smacked a huge meteor into the Earth, you wouldn't knock it into the sun, you'd just change the shape of its orbit a bit. Spiral orbits don't actually exist under inverse-square forces such as gravity; you can show that the only possible orbits are circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. Spiral orbits don't exist except if there's some kind of drag force or whatever dissipating energy from the system; on an interplanetary scale drag doesn't matter. (Note that this is somewhat complicated by the fact that, e.g., Jupiter affects the orbit of the Earth, but in general the perturbations due to planet-planet interactions are small enough to not matter for stability purposes).

&gt; Isn't it difficult for us to keep our own man-made satellites in a stable orbit, requiring periodic adjustments? And yet, the moon is huge and it seems to be in an orbit that will last billions of years with no intervention.

Many man-made satellites are orbiting at an altitude where Earth's atmosphere can still exert some small amount of drag. The moon is so far away from Earth that the drag is essentially negligible. We also want the satellites to be kept in a *predictable* orbit; for a geosynchronous satellite, we want that orbit to be such that it's always above the same spot on the equator.

The_Evil_Within,"&gt;an area of hot air becomes less dense, and so it rises above colder areas of air. 

First, you need to look at it the other way around - hot air doesn't rise, cold air sinks.  As it sinks, it forces the hotter air upwards.

Now, think of a mess (and I do mean 'mess' for the imagery, not 'mass') of cold air, with the molecules fairly still and fairly dense.  Then, something heats up a bit of it near the bottom - what's going to happen?

The molecules of hot air will bounce around a lot more than the cold, and sometimes they're going to bounce up.  When they do, the less active cold air is more likely to fall into the gap than to move in another direction, and now there's nowhere for that hot air molecule to go because it will only bounce off the cold air molecule if it bounces downward again. (Transferring some heat in the process, but we can ignore that for the purposes of this explanation)

All of this applies to your wooden plank example.

To answer your question: And if so, why do they act like an aggregated 'body' with those molecules around them, just because they are at the same temperature?

It's because even in air at atmospheric pressure molecules have a limited mean free path. In air it's [68 nanometers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path#Mean_free_path_in_kinetic_theory).

CosmicWaffle5,"It's called positional alcohol nystagmus. Basically, there are these things in your ears called semicircular canals that are responsible for your sense of balance. The semicircular canals are supported inside of a fluid that is usually the same density as the semicircular canals, but when you drink alcohol it changes the density of the fluid surrounding the membranes and throws your balance system out of walk.

Merrilin,"Anything with a temperature (a.k.a. all matter) is constantly emitting **blackbody radiation**. 

You can think of temperature of an object as being proportional to how much each constituent atom vibrates. The more intense it's vibration, the hotter it is. The short of it is that this vibration causes the release of a photon, which carries with it some energy from the atom, decreasing it's temperature. More on that if I ever get home. 

It so happens that the hotter something is, the higher frequency radiation, on average, it emits. That's why a piece of metal visibly glows when you make it very hot. At room temperature it is emitting light at a range of frequencies, but almost none in the visible light range. As you make the piece of metal hotter, it's blackbody radiation in the visible light range becomes significant enough that a human eye can detect it. 

So, no, matter cannot have temperature without also emitting some frequency of light. And there is no such thing as matter without temperature, so matter is always emitting light. ",null,0,cdmy126,1rg6wj,askscience,top_day,9
thumbs55,"Excellent question.

First of all what is heat and what is temperature? Are they not the same thing?

[Heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) is a measure of thermal energy (measurable in joules like all energies), it can be a measure of the ammount of (highly disordere heat typed energy) energy moving from one body to another.

[Temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) is a measure of the hottness or coldness of a body, two bodies with the same temp will not exchange any net heat and if one body is hotter than the other then the hotter will give energy to the colder in the form of heat.

&gt;everything I can think of that has heat also has light. Stars, lightbulbs, lava, fire, hot metal,

This type of light is called [black body radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation).

&gt;Metal only emits light after it heats up past a certain temperature.

While it is true that the light becomes visible after a certain temperature is reached, the metal is actually always emitting invisible ""light"" (electromagnetic radiation) at any finite temperature due to said black body radiation.

All of space has [Cosmic microwave background radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) which gives ""empty"" space a temperature. (It is not empty of [real] particles if you include the photons giving it said temperature).

The temperature of space (away from stars and such) is around 3 kelvin, so if you have something hotter than that it in space will get colder and if you have something colder than that it will actually warm up.

The heat energy is often stored in the energy of the jiggling of molecules. But for it to move from one place to another it mainly moves in the form of photons (light) but also phonons (sound). If you engineered a particularly exotic system that only exchanged energy in phonons then this system would emit heat with no light.

Nutrenos are also an example of a form of heat (they carry energy from the sun in a manner that is not work) nutrenos are not light. But many forms of nutreno generation would also produce photons.",null,1,cdmyhyr,1rg6wj,askscience,top_day,4

uberhobo,There is no such thing as relative humidity above the boiling point of water.  It will all stay a gas in any proportion with air.,null,0,cdnb8t8,1rg6ug,askscience,top_day,3
whatsup4,it depends if there is something for the water to condense on. Basically think of it like cloud formation. Air high in the atmosphere can sometimes be super saturated and achieve higher than 100% rh because it is hard for the water to form droplets without a surface to form on. Given a large enough decrease in temperature you can see cloud formation.,null,1,cdnaiz3,1rg6ug,askscience,top_day,1
BoxAMu,"The energy of a photon is proportional to frequency, but this energy must match the energy of some transition in the absorbing matter.  The electrons in bonds in glass have transitions in the UV, but not the visible range.

This is the same reason why high energy X-rays are used for imaging: muscle and tissue are mostly transparent to X-rays, while the calcium in bones absorbs them.",null,0,cdmy00a,1rg4zy,askscience,top_day,4
therationalpi,"Basically a whistle is a resonator. You either have a Helmholtz resonator (like a beer bottle) or a standing wave resonator (like an organ pipe).

Driving the resonator is the variable airflow through the whistle. In most whistles you will have a hole with a blade shaped edge on it. When the edge is blown on, it creates turbulent airflow in the form of vortexes. These vortexes alternate from side to side in what is called a ""vortex street."" There's a good picture of that [here.](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/Acoustics/code/adpac/sample/CYLINDER_VORTEX_SHEDDING/) The alternating vortexes create a varying positive and negative acoustic pressure, setting up a wave in the resonator. The resonator, as a result, forces the frequency of the vortexes to align with the whistle's natural frequency. In this way the whistle amplifies the normally irregular vortex variations into a sound loud enough to be heard at a distance.

The reason you must blow at the correct angle is that the flow vortexes will depend greatly on how the moving air stream hits the blade. You must hit the wedge shaped part of the whistle fast enough to create unstable flow, otherwise the wave will not be generated.

Hope that helps!",null,0,cdmz9jk,1rg4zj,askscience,top_day,1
AltoidNerd,"It's puffy.  If highly energetic, roughly spherical.  

You can get fireworks to discharge in predetermined shapes by the way you pack the explosives.   By analogy, the shape of a space flame would depend likewise on the shape of the source,

Nicked777,"The fire will indeed be spherical, this has actually been tried in Space before, it looks pretty cool (I'm on my phone so I won't link it.)

The flame changes colour because the lack of convection causes diffusion to be the dominant transport mechanism. Compared to a terrestrial flame this means the flame burns with more complete combustion, with less soot. (Glowing hot soot is the reason most terrestrial flames are yellow.)
