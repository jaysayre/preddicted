cppdev,"Combining multiple flash units together is actually already how SSDs are made. For example, if you buy a 128 GB SSD, chances are it has 8 16 GB NAND chips wired together. 

As for why you can't combine thousands of little SSD chips to get very fast speeds, the answer is somewhat technical. In digital circuits, each time you have what's called ""fan in"", or multiple wires converging together there is associated with it some input capacitance which is proportional to the number of wires that are converging. So if you have 1000 wires from 1000 flash chips converging to one output (e.g., your SATA cable) you're going to have a very high input capacitance. However, the speed at which you can operate a circuit is inversely proportional to the input capacitance. 

TLDR: You could connect 1000 SATA chips in parallel, but it would end up being much slower than you'd expect.",null,0,cdph1pe,1ro8bz,askscience,top_day,2

NotFreeAdvice,"The answer has to do with the idea of bubble *nucleation*.

So, it turns out that the release of carbonation (ie. the bubbles) is thermodynamcally favorable.  This means that the CO2 would ""like"" to exit as bubbles.  

There is just one problem: to get a bubble, you must first form a bubble.  The *start* of bubble formation (what we call nucleation) is *not* thermodyanmically favorable.

The reason is entropic.  There is much more ordering at the surface of a bubble than inside the bulk bubble or the bulk water.  This presents a barrier to bubble formation that is related to the surface area of the bubble.

At the same time, there is a enthalpic reason to form bubbles, and this related to the *volume* of the bubble. 

The end result is this: when the bubbles are quite small, the effects from the surface area of the bubble, dominate the effects from the bulk of the bubble.  And the bubble will not form -- or forms very slowly.  

Once a bubble forms, then it will grow more easily.  So the bottleneck, if you will, is the initial formation of the bubble.  

By shaking the beverage, you introduce a bunch of gas bubbles into the beverage, and this provides sites for bubble growth -- and an increase in released carbonation.  Essentially, you are providing the mean by which to skip the slow ""nucleation"" step.

gingerkid1234,"I don't know if that shape has a name.  However, shapes whose volume formula is unknown can have it calculated by integrating over the volume of the shape.  All that's required is knowing equations that describe the boundaries of that shape.  It's worth mentioning that this is how the volume equations of shapes you're familiar with are generally derived.  The following may be a bit confusing if you don't know calculus.  In case you don't, the basic principle of integrating a function is that you add the infinitesimally small heights under a curve to get an area, or the areas under a curve to get a volume.

I'll use the xy plane for the cross section, with the flat surface along x, and z for the length dimension of the shape, and assume that the rate of flattening is linear, and that it tapers to a point.  The easiest way to integrate it, it seems to me, is to break it up into triangles in the yz plane, and integrate along z.

I'll use r as the radius at the un-squished end, and L as the length.  I'll also put the center of the un-squished cross-section at the origin.  Now, on the xy plane, a y coordinate along the boundary can be expressed as y=sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ).  If the squishing of the shape is linear, the yz sections will be triangles with height 2 * sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ) and length L.  The area of each will be L * sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ).  A brief sanity check shows that the areas are 0 at x=r, where the height tapers from zero to zero.

By integrating these areas along x the volume can be determined.  The integral in question is the integral of L * sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ) with respect to x as x goes from -r to r, which is equal to V.

This integral isn't terribly easy to solve, but there's a way around actually doing it out.  By inspection, sqrt(r^2 - x^2) is just the y coordinate of a circle.  The integral of this from -r to r should just be the area of a semicircle, pi * r^2 /2.  And plugging the definite integral into wolframalpha, it is!

Plugging that back in and cancelling the 2, V = 1/2 * L * pi * r^2, or half the area of a cylinder.  And intuitively, that makes sense--each cross-section of it is a triangle with the same base and height as full rectangle.  And that shape made of rectangles is a cylinder.  So the volume will be half that.

An important practical note is that squishing a real-life cylinder will result in something significantly different, because just squishing the end won't produce a constant taper throughout the cylinder.

tl;dr it can be determined by summing all the arbitrarily thin cross-sectional volumes of the shape, each of which is an area times an arbitrarily small increment in the direction we're slicing.  By doing out this calculus, the area is A = 1/2 * L * pi * r^2 , or half the volume of a cylinder.

bzishi,"Don't get drawn in, don't get drawn in. Damn.

The key point nobody is discussing is that when you pinch a cylinder, the circumference of the cross section remains the same. You can't simply pretend it is an ellipse where you vary the semi-minor axis from r to 0 while the semi-major axis stays the same. On a plus note, you don't have to use the pain-in-the-ass ellipse circumference equation for substitution, since you know the end points and can write a linear function. The flat 'ellipse' (or line) at the end will simply have a half-length of r*pi/2. The semi-major axis (x counting up from the pinch) will then be 

a = (r-r * pi/2) * x / L + r * pi/2. 

Let q = r * pi/2 =&gt; 

a = (r-q) * x/L + q =  rx/L -q(x-L)/L.

So its the volume of the cylinder multiplied by approximately 0.595.

My approach differs from gingerkid1234. We make the same assumptions but the expression of y and z are simpler I believe. 

Lets orient the shape  with the end of the tube that is a line lying on the y axis centred at 0, and the tube going out in the positive x direction. 

The xy plane cross-section should be a quadrilateral through the points (0, (pi * R)/2), (L, R), (L, -R), (0, -(pi * R)/2). So the line from (0, (pi * R)/2) to (L, R) defines the semi-major axis of the elipses that make up zy cross sections of the tube. The line defined here is: y = (R/L) * (1 - pi/2) * x + (pi * R)/2.

In the xz plane, we have a triangle defined by (0,0), (L, R), (L, -R). So we see the semi-minor axis of the eliptical cross-sections is defined by z = (R/L) * x.

Using the formula for the area of an elipse A = pi * x * y where x is the length of the semi-major axis and y is the length of the semi-minor axis. [ a = b for a circle hence A = pi * r^2 ]

If we plug in the formulas for the lines defining the semi-major and semi-minor axes and integrate over x from 0 to L, we get:

anon5005,"I am thinking that if the flattening is happening linearly in one dimension, then the area of the cross section each proportion r of the way from the squished end to the ordinary end has r times the area of the ordinary end.

Meaning, the cross section halfway up has half the area, and so-on. 

As always, the volume is the height times the average cross sectional area. Here, since the area goes linearly it is the same as the height times the area when it is cut at the half way point.

So the squishing cuts the volume in half.

You can see an example if you do it to other shapes, like a 1x1x1 cube.  Then you get what looks from the side like a triangle of area 1/2 thickened up to have thickness 1. So the volume is 1/2 x 1 = 1/2.",null,1,cdpejjk,1rokpj,askscience,top_day,3
brewsan,"Here's my take.. 

The cross-section is an ellipse (the very bottom being a circle and the very top being an ellipse with the y radius being 0 i.e. a line).  Let's put that on the XY plane. Note that x never changes from the radius(R) at the bottom, regardless of where along z we are. 

So the area of the ellipse is A=pi * x * y = pi * R * y

y changes as we travel up the z axis linearly from R at the bottom(z=0) to 0 at the top (Z=H) so y=R-(R/H)z = R * H/H -R/H * z = R/H(H-z)

Subbing in the A=pi * R * (R/H(H-z)) = pi * R²/H(H-z)
Now to get the volume we need to integrate over z (think of this as adding up all the cross sections of ellipses).

V = Int[z=0 to H]pi*R²/H(H-z)dz 

= pi * R²/H * Int[z=0 to H](H-z)dz 

= pi * R²/H (H * z - 1/2z²) |z=0 to H

YouDoNotWantToKnow,"O      --

Orient your axis at the center of the circle at the bottom of the cylinder. The circle is radius r and let it exist in the x-y plane, so cylinder extends into the z plane. Let the line at the other end of the shape, the ""squish"" point, also be described by y=0, z=h where h is the height of the cylinder.

Now look at the y-z plane in slices for x in {-r,r}. For any given x in this range, the y-z plane contains a triangle. That triangle has a height of h and a base of 2\*sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ).

Now you have a simple calculus integral.

Integrate [sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ) \* h]/2 for x from 0 to r and multiply that by 2 (and to make that simpler, there's a /2 in the integral so just pull that out and divide it out right away).

There's probably a more elegant way of going from here, but to brute force it you can look up (or derive using trig substitution) that the indefinite integral of [A - x^2]^(1/2) is I = 1/2(x(A-x^2)^(1/2) + A tan^(-1)(x(A-x^2)^(-1/2)

Looks messy, but just plug in the integration points. A = r^2 btw, so the definite integral from 0 to r is I(r) - I(0). I(0) is easy, there are x's in both numerators, so I(0) = 0.

I(r) causes the first time to drop out, but the second term inside the inverse tangent goes to infinity. tan^(-1) of infinity is pi/2.

So the integral comes out to just A\*pi/2, don't forget the height constant we left out earlier and that A=r^2.. the final solution is:

V = h\*pi\*r^(2)/2.

Does that make sense? It's half the volume of a full cylinder. So that is the right direction (less). Is it correct? Well, do you think we could form the same shape out of the volume we took out? Think about each slice we made at the beginning. Initially they would have been rectangles instead of triangles right? What part of each rectangle is missing? The area of the triangle is b*h/2. The area of the rectangle is b*h. So the missing area is bh - bh/2 = bh/2. Half the rectangle. So it's pretty clear this makes sense and is the correct result.

anon5005,"I am thinking that if the flattening is happening linearly in one dimension, then the area of the cross section each proportion r of the way from the squished end to the ordinary end has r times the area of the ordinary end.

Meaning, the cross section halfway up has half the area, and so-on. 

As always, the volume is the height times the average cross sectional area. Here, since the area goes linearly it is the same as the height times the area when it is cut at the half way point.

So the squishing cuts the volume in half.

You can see an example if you do it to other shapes, like a 1x1x1 cube.  Then you get what looks from the side like a triangle of area 1/2 thickened up to have thickness 1. So the volume is 1/2 x 1 = 1/2.",null,1,cdpejjk,1rokpj,askscience,top_day,3
brewsan,"Here's my take.. 

The cross-section is an ellipse (the very bottom being a circle and the very top being an ellipse with the y radius being 0 i.e. a line).  Let's put that on the XY plane. Note that x never changes from the radius(R) at the bottom, regardless of where along z we are. 

So the area of the ellipse is A=pi * x * y = pi * R * y

y changes as we travel up the z axis linearly from R at the bottom(z=0) to 0 at the top (Z=H) so y=R-(R/H)z = R * H/H -R/H * z = R/H(H-z)

Subbing in the A=pi * R * (R/H(H-z)) = pi * R²/H(H-z)
Now to get the volume we need to integrate over z (think of this as adding up all the cross sections of ellipses).

V = Int[z=0 to H]pi*R²/H(H-z)dz 

= pi * R²/H * Int[z=0 to H](H-z)dz 

= pi * R²/H (H * z - 1/2z²) |z=0 to H

= pi * R²/H (H² - 1/2*H²) 

= pi * R² * 1/2 * H

= 1/2 * pi * H * R²

YouDoNotWantToKnow,"O      --

Orient your axis at the center of the circle at the bottom of the cylinder. The circle is radius r and let it exist in the x-y plane, so cylinder extends into the z plane. Let the line at the other end of the shape, the ""squish"" point, also be described by y=0, z=h where h is the height of the cylinder.

Now look at the y-z plane in slices for x in {-r,r}. For any given x in this range, the y-z plane contains a triangle. That triangle has a height of h and a base of 2\*sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ).

Now you have a simple calculus integral.

Integrate [sqrt(r^2 - x^2 ) \* h]/2 for x from 0 to r and multiply that by 2 (and to make that simpler, there's a /2 in the integral so just pull that out and divide it out right away).

There's probably a more elegant way of going from here, but to brute force it you can look up (or derive using trig substitution) that the indefinite integral of [A - x^2]^(1/2) is I = 1/2(x(A-x^2)^(1/2) + A tan^(-1)(x(A-x^2)^(-1/2)

Looks messy, but just plug in the integration points. A = r^2 btw, so the definite integral from 0 to r is I(r) - I(0). I(0) is easy, there are x's in both numerators, so I(0) = 0.

I(r) causes the first time to drop out, but the second term inside the inverse tangent goes to infinity. tan^(-1) of infinity is pi/2.

So the integral comes out to just A\*pi/2, don't forget the height constant we left out earlier and that A=r^2.. the final solution is:

V = h\*pi\*r^(2)/2.

Does that make sense? It's half the volume of a full cylinder. So that is the right direction (less). Is it correct? Well, do you think we could form the same shape out of the volume we took out? Think about each slice we made at the beginning. Initially they would have been rectangles instead of triangles right? What part of each rectangle is missing? The area of the triangle is b*h/2. The area of the rectangle is b*h. So the missing area is bh - bh/2 = bh/2. Half the rectangle. So it's pretty clear this makes sense and is the correct result.

The crown of teeth (the part that is visible) are made of two primary materials, enamel on the outer surface and dentin which makes up most of the tooth structure (with pulp in the centre which contains blood vessels, lymph and nerves). When the crown forming there are made of two major cells types. Ameloblasts and odontoblasts. First the dentin in formed by the odontoblasts at the centre of the tooth and dentin is formed outwards. The ameloblasts start from the DEJ (dentinoenamel junction where enamel and dentin meet) and move towards the outside of the crown. They are lost during tooth eruption (when the tooth comes through the gums). 
The tooth is unable to heal since it cannot produce enamel after eruption because there are no cells to make new enamel.

Dentin on the other hand can and does form after the tooth is already in the mouth (secondary dentin forms after the tooth is in the mouth and more dentin is made towards the centre of the tooth; tertiary dentin is made in response to inflammation of the pulp often due to cavities). So in one sense the tooth is healing. However, it doesn't heal like bones since often a tooth fractures in the middle of the tooth and the odontoblasts cannot move through already formed dentin to make new tooth structure on top of old tooth structure (and as the ameloblasts are gone, no new enamel can be produced). 

While I'm not as familiar with bone healing, bone is a vascularized (blood containing) cellular tissue. Osteoblasts (which synthesis new bone), and osteoclasts (which eat old bone) are always working even when there is no damage.

Look up phytic acid and cavities in google. Mostly its bread and nuts that cause cavities as it eats enamel. Once the enamel is eroded sugar will quickly eat to the pulp (sugar is also acidic but much weaker than those found in oatmeal, wholewheat bread etc.). 

Conversely, if you have tartar thats a more alkaline condition and has different health problems. Not cavities though more gingivitis.

The answers in my post will pretty much reverse any tooth sensitivity. You can try eating oatmeal frequently and see how your teeth feel. Mind you milk is alkaline so it will slow the effect but not stop it.

Over time this can become significant, moving the satellite ""off station"" and out of its assigned ""box"", which would require repointing of ground satellite dishes.

[color constancy] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy) is also at a similar level, showing that what you see as a particular color depends on other structure in the same scene.

so under this theory, you can see any clump of stuff as any object that is *known* to you, and while you'll usually get it right, you will often make mental mistakes. so you might see a clump and interpret it as 'dog', and then shift your interpretation to 'pillow' - what has happened is that the identity of objects is something that is filled in by context and features, just as is the color of surfaces, etc; and if the context strongly suggests 'dog place', you might be inclined to mistake a non-dog object for a dog, just as the border in the Cornsweet illusion inclines you to mistake the two sides of the display as being different colors. the difference is maybe that the dog/pillow has internal structure, as well as contextual relations, that help you to make further disambiguations upon a little more analysis.",null,1,cdpqiqf,1rp418,askscience,top_day,2

adamsolomon,"Good question! There are two parts to this answer.

First, gravity is not always attractive. And it turns out that on the largest cosmic scales, it's repulsive: the expansion of the Universe isn't slowing down, as you'd expect, but is speeding up. This means that either the Universe is filled with some exotic stuff (""dark energy"") which has repulsive gravity, or the laws of gravity differ from what we thought they were, in such a way that at large distances/late times, gravity between normal objects becomes repulsive. If the Universe were to one day stop expanding and collapse on itself, it would first have to be expanding but with an expansion that's slowing down. The fact that the expansion isn't slowing down means that collapse is likely not in our future.

But in fact, before we knew about this bizarre speeding-up expansion, we still weren't sure there would be a Big Crunch. The reason is that even if gravity is always attractive, it doesn't necessarily make everything collapse. Think about it in terms of a rocket ship: if it's launched with an initial speed greater than some value (the escape velocity, neglecting air resistance), then the Earth's gravitational pull will constantly slow the rocket down, but never slow it down so much that it stops going up and falls back down.

Similarly, if galaxies were moving away from each other at sufficiently high speeds, then even ignoring this weird repulsive gravity stuff, they still wouldn't ever start moving towards each other. The expansion would slow down but never quite stop. This was considered a good candidate for our own Universe before we discovered the accelerating expansion, which put a Big Crunch way out of reach.",null,1,cdpkdng,1rp4yk,askscience,top_day,5

Rather, it means that these genes give you a certain predisposition to those conditions. You are *more likely* to develop them if you have that genetic marker.

In terms of implications, it means that the patient can become aware of the potential for that problem before they get it, and therefore be aware of early warning signs or have better detection for it.

That's not true, it might help develop treatments in the future, but on it's own it gives no real advantage. 

It's like having a boat with a leak - if it is a small leak you might be able to treat the symptoms of the leak (water in the boat) with a bucket twice a day and leave it at that. If the leak is more serious you will want to know why, however finding out that 'there's a flaming massive hole in the bottom of the boat cap'n!' makes no difference if your only tool is still one bucket. 

We have limited gene-therapy treatments as they need a way to counteract the latent problem in all of the cells affected in your body.

6 | Jupiter | 1.33 g/cm^3

7 | Uranus | 1.3 g/cm^3

So uranus would gravitate around neptune (not really, since even planets make our sun wobble around, since they really gravitate around each other but neptune would move a little less around uranus than uranus around neptune)

NAG3LT,"Well, changing electric and magnetic fields produce electromagnetic waves. Light is also an electromagnetic wave and can be used to vaporise solid. Also, you almost never strip out all electrons from the more charged nuclei, but stripping few electrons out of outer shell is usually enough to break bonds between atoms. When you shine light at a material and it is absorbed, most of its energy first goes into electrons, and then redistributed to the nuclei. The kinetic energy of nuclei manifests itself as a heat and acts the same. 


To put a lot of energy in a form of light into a solid, you can use laser. If you're using a laser that shines continuously, you can melt and then vaporise some part of a molten metal. Depending on the reflectance, thickness and focusing few Watts of laser power may be enough for cutting. However, when you use a non-pulsed laser, even 50 kW lasers will still leave some parts molten, as the absorbed heat has time to diffuse around the spot you shine at. 


There is a way to vaporise metal with minimal melting, however. Going straight from solid to a vapour is called ablation, and it can be achieved with a very short laser pulses. It is currently possible to generate pulses on the order of picoseconds (10^(-12) s) and less. The energy you put into the pulse is absorbed so quickly that the thermal diffusion into surrounding area cannot move it away fast enough. One of the values I've found was done with a 100 fs (100*10^(-15) s) [laser pulse](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00339-010-5766-1). The flux required to ablate copper was 1.7 J/cm^2, which means a peak irradiance of 17 TW/cm^2. The peak electric field strength is 11 GV/m (Gigavolts per meter). That's a lot, as making an electric spark go through the air requires ~1000 times weaker field. 


So, if you want to vaporise material from a solid state, you're looking at very strong electric fields. However, that won't strip all electrons, only the least bound ones on the outer shell. Removing all the electrons gets harder the further you go along the periodic table. Unfortunately I can't give you any numbers for those.",null,0,cdpjek4,1rpaf7,askscience,top_day,1

As mentioned by others, there are other ways involving actual _electromagnetic_ fields (i.e., light). You can use a laser to ablate - vaporizing a solid - your sample embedded in a matrix. The laser also acts to ionize the matrix, which then ionizes your sample. See [matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldi).

    c^d == ( m^e )^d == m^ed == m^1 == m

Since nobody knows d but the private key owner they can also easily compute
 
    s = hash(msg)^d mod n

And we can verify with

    hash(msg) == s^e mod n

Computing the order from n = pq is a hard problem believed to be as hard as factoring, so is computing the e'th root.

DanielSank,"This excellent question is at the root of *many* other questions that show up on /r/askscience.

There are aspects of this question that nobody really understands yet. However, we understand a lot more than popular science and even some physicists will lead you to believe. This will be a somewhat long post but possibly worth your time to read.

Before I say anything else, I want to say that your statement

&gt; How does it ""know"" it was observed? By its interaction with surrounding particles, of course.

is absolutely essential. I hope to explain why below.

**Structure of physical theory**

Any theory of physics has two parts.

* (1) The first part is a representation of the natural system under consideration. For example, if you are making a theory of balls rolling down hills you represent each ball with three numbers (x,y,z) indicating the ball's position in space. You may also have (Vx, Vy, Vz) representing its velocity in all three directions.

* (2) The second part is some way of predicting how this representation changes as time goes by [1]. For the case of rolling balls this could just be [Newton's laws of motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion).

In classical physics these two parts were all we needed to go happily about our scientific lives. However, there's actually a crucially important third part:

* (3) We have to have a prescription for how the representation put forth in part (1) relates to our personal/human/cognitive observations of the natural system. In other words, ""what does a group of numbers (x,y,z) have to do with my observation of the system?""

In the case of rolling balls this is pretty simple. I might use Newton's laws to compute that my ball should be at position

(1 meter, 0.5 meters, 0 meters) at time=1.3 minutes

and we all just *know* that this means that we should see a ball at the specified location and time. This works just fine and indeed in classical mechanics the link between part (1) and (3) is usually pretty straightforward. Note that we never mentioned anything about what we meant by ""see a ball"", because in classical physics we implicitly assume that it doesn't matter. In quantum mechanics it does matter and I'll now try to explain why.

**Quantum mechanics**

The first two parts of quantum mechanics are 

* (1) We represent the natural world with a [wave function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) (or [state vector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state)).

* (2) The wave function evolves according to [Schrodinger's equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) (or [Heisenberg's equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_picture)).

These two together are just as good as (x,y,z) coordinates and Newton's laws. The place where everyone gets confused is in what the wave function means in terms of what we observe in experiments. To answer this question you hear people say things like ""when you make a measurement the wave function collapses into a definite position, chosen at random, and that's what you see."" The crucial thing to understand is that this statement modifies part (1). It says that Schrodinger's equation determines the evolution until some vaguely defined ""observation"" happens, at which time Schrodinger's equation stops being correct, the state collapses probabilistically, and then Schrodinger's equation goes back into effect. This breaks the theory's self-consistency. Suppose I make a measurement and say that the atom's state collapsed. Now suppose that me and my experiment are in a box, which is actually the experiment of some greater alien. For the theory to be true for the alien, there can't be any state collapse until *he* does the observation. Thus we see that state collapse as stated above can't work.

The issue is that as stated above, state collapse modifies part (1) of the theory, whereas we *should* have been looking for a part (3) type statement. It turns out that if we *leave part (1) alone* and make an extra statement like this:

* (3) When a human's brain collects information about a physical system that information will be randomly distributed according to the square of the wave function, and that system will henceforth appear to have collapsed in accordance with the result of the human's information.

then we have a self-consistent theory. I emphasize that it is both falsifiable and self-consistent and therefore must be admissible as a theory of Nature. That said, its not very satisfying. because of this bizarrely anthropocentric rule (3) which seems much more weird than the sort of obvious equivalent rule (3) in classical physics [2].

**Decoherence**

Amazingly we can *almost* get the quantum rule (3) to be as *obvious* as the classical one. The trick is to really consider what happens when we make ""measurements"". In fact whenever you measure something you are connecting that thing to many extra physical elements. If I measure the position of an atom with a CCD camera, I am coupling the wave function of the atom to an enormous number of electrons etc. in the camera's inner workings. Certainly I do not know the wave functions of all those electrons. **This is the crux of the entire story**: It turns out that if you actually compute what happens to the wave function of the atom in the case that it couples to a bunch of extra stuff whose wave functions you *don't know*, then from your perspective the wave function of the atom becomes a classical probability distribution. I emphasize that this comes about *entirely from Schrodinger's equation and nothing else*. From the perspective in which the wave functions of the electrons are known, the atom's wave function *does not collapse*. Therefore, collapse can be understood as an apparent phenomenon, predicted by pure quantum mechanics, that shows up with only part of the information in a system's wave function is available. This is always the applicable case for humans because our measurement apparatuses contain many uncontrollable degrees of freedom.

When the wave function appears to have collapsed for one observer, it may not appear that way for another one who has more information.

This is really interesting because it gets us really really close to being able to explain rule (3) via rule (1). We know that when only some information of a system is available, that information appears probabilistic. What we haven't explained is why humans see only one of those possible results. Nobody knows the answer to that.

**Answer to the original question**

So, how does a particle ""know"" when it has definite position? It doesn't. It never does. Definite position is just an apparent property of things that comes up when we don't have complete information about the system.

**Conclusion**

We have a self-consistent theory of quantum mechanics using wave functions and Schrodinger's equation. Part of the theory is the statement that when humans have access to the prabability distributions furnished by partial access to a complete system wave function, they perceive one particular value, for some reason that we don't know.

[1] For the physicists out there I'd say more generally equations of motion are constraints on how the representation at one point in space-time is related to the representation at other points in space-time.

[2] However I challenge anyone to state a truly self-consistent theory of physics without such a rule.

DanielSank,"Since my other post was so long:

&gt; If none of the particles around it have definite positions either, how does any particle in the universe ""know"" for sure that it was observed?

They don't. Particles don't do anything special when they're observed. We can propose a self-consistent theory of quantum mechanics in which the wave functions don't actually collapse and take on a definite position. The *appearance* of definite position only happens for in cases where only subsets of the system's information is available, which happens to be the case relevant when humans are involved. From the perspective of someone with fuller information about the system, the collapse that *you* see may not happen.

The falsifiability of this theory (described more fully in my other post) is definitely open for discussion. I'd love to have that discussion with anyone else who's interested.",null,0,cdppng9,1rpid6,askscience,top_day,5

From_Ashes_Rize,"The answer is sort of. You can not create an extremely small flame from a source such as a traditional candle. But there is a way to create micro flames.  This is called microcombustion and they are flames smaller than the width of a millimeter.  They are typically made in small hard ceramic combustors (such as alumina oxide) and they burn at temperatures of up to 2000 C. The combustors have small channels through which the fuel flows and the flame burns. They are typically fueled by hydrocarbons and oxygen. Methane, butane, propane, etc.

The two inlet flows of the fuels meet and combine at some point and then you have your combustible gas. The point at which the two flows meet exhibits turbulent flow and this is the limiting factor at ignition for the combustor due to wall conditions and fluid dynamics not worth explaining here. Turbulent flow tends towards extinction for a flame. Typically a large candle type flame will be seen at the end of the exhaust channel.

As the combustor ramps up to its max temp (steady state) the walls of the exhaust channel heat up and begin to provide the thermal energy necessary for the gases within the channel to ignite. You will hear loud pops as ignition events begin to occur within the channel. As the temperature of the wall increases due to the heat seen from the exhaust flame, the ignition events begin occurring closer to the mixing points of the 2 fuels.

Finally at steady state the walls of the combustor at the mixing point of the fuels is so hot that the gases ignite immediately upon mixing. Due to the turbulent nature of the flow, they go out almost immediately.  They are also almost immediately replaced by fresh uncombusted fuel which them ignites. This cycle repeats itself many times per second and you end up with a sustained micro flame. The ratio of gases determines how many times per second ignition occurs and you can actually say that the flame has a frequency (I.e. You can hear the flame buzz while it is lit).

So in short, yes micro flames are possible, just not from a candle.

abt137,"Yes, if you follow the Formula 1 this is a common issue. Drivers in pursuit of another tend to have issues with engine temperature when they are not able to overtake the rival. The more laps they stay behind another car the bigger the overheating risk, and this overheating also applies to other car systems like tires and brake discs (tip: F1 car have air cooled engines). This is referred as being in the ""dirty air"" or ""suck dirty air"", this overheating apart from represent a risk for the engine tends to manifest itself faster in tires and breaks causing unexpected degradation in the tires and malfunctioning of the brakes and also alter the aerodynamic flow so your wings, spoilers etc will not create the desired grip force pushing the car down against the ground.
When the situation above happens you could see drivers getting out of the drag of the car in ahead not trying to overtake but simply to suck fresh air.
This refers to F1 specifically and i can't say about common street cars but I'd say is unlikely to happen since they are liquid cooled; if you are in the mid of a traffic jam the fan starts and cools down the engine temp.

The same thing happens when the ball is spinning. It begins to tip to one side. But wait! The ball is spinning, so the side that it was tipping toward is now on the opposite side of your finger, so the ball starts 'falling' back toward the axis of spin. So, basically, so long as the ball is spinning fast enough, it will right itself every time it begins to tip. If it's right on the cusp of spinning too slowly to correct itself in time then it begins to wobble. When it's too slow, it falls off your finger as expected.

This is one of the features of angular momentum and the gyroscopic effect.

OnceReturned,"A comprehensive answer to that question would have many components, but in animals there are a few dominant factors:

DNA - Cell division is not perfect, and DNA damage occurs naturally due to environmental factors and normal cellular processes.  Genomic robustness and DNA repair capacity is a huge factor in lifespan determination.  DNA damage is generally considered the leading cause of aging.  Species with more robust genomes and better DNA repair mechanisms tend to have greater lifespans.

Physical fragility - There are many potentially fatal events which individuals have some probability of experiencing in any given time period.  These include things like harsh environmental conditions (i.e. a bad winter), infectious diseases, and encounters with predators.  Every organism has some set of such events which are likely to be fatal, and which occur with some probably, such that the more time passes, the more likely the organism is to have been exposed to such an event.  The more sensitive an organism is to these things, the shorter its lifespan is expected to be.  For example, small animals are particularly susceptible to predation, so the odds that they have a fatal encounter with a predator in any time period are higher than the those same odds for larger animals that are higher on the food chain.  

Biological wear and tear:  Tissue and organs get worn out through use.  Small animals generally have higher metabolisms, which amounts to something similar to more ""friction"" or ""wear and tear"" on all of their systems (i.e. more heartbeats per minute).  So, they don't typically live as long as typical larger creatures with slower metabolisms. 

Generally, larger animals live longer.  Dogs are something of an exception.  It's not exactly clear why large dogs don't live as long, but it likely has something to do with the fact that domesticated dogs are highly inbred.  This means they have genetic risk factors that are much less common in wild animals.  This manifests in a variety of ways.  For example, large dogs are more likely to get cancer, and this is likely because they simply grow more cells throughout their lives.",null,0,cdptcay,1rqeob,askscience,top_day,2
