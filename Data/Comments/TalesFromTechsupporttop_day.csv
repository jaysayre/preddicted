dazvn,"&gt; a friend of mine who is really into computers

The worst kind of friend. I had a guy call me up with a brand new 27 inch iMac and proceeds to have a 10 min rant about how expensive it was and how useless it is since his friend keeps sending him an email which he doesn't receive.

Okay sir, let's check the mail app first. No your an idiot I don't use the mail app, oh so how do you normally check emails, I open safari and go to yahoo.com (webmail).

After face planting the desk....hard I then try to explain that the iMac cannot be the problem since he isn't using the mail app and is using webmail, nope I don't know what I'm talking about, I send him an email to prove it, which he receives, nope still don't believe you must be this damn iMac

Then proceeded to call said friend and put him on speaker, said friend insists I'm a liar and just don't want to help and that he 'knows all about computers'. At this point I'm thinking since you know all about computers why don't you just sort it out since you think I'm incapable of doing my job?

I ended the call by finally getting some agreement that the issue is maybe yahoo and transferred him to yahoo customer services.

I bet Â£50 the 'friend' was typing the email address wrong",null,7,cdnppg2,1riix1,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day,29

Moosemistrz,"I hate these friends that ""know everything about computers"". Not only did they usually cause the problem in the first place, they make people refuse to trust actual knowledgeable people either because they had to pay someone to fix the problem or because they trust their other friend more. Yes I'm 16, yes I'm just some teenager, yes your friend told you to do whatever. I can fix your problem in five minutes if you just let me try. I've written several websites, administer my school newspaper's site, installed Windows or Linux upwards of fifty times, and upgraded the entire high school's ram. Doesn't matter, they're still going to trust some guy who knows how to download Chrome because he's 25.",null,1,cdnzt8d,1riix1,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day,3

One that comes to mind was the employee of a client who insisted, incessantly, that she could not do her job without having an all in one printer at her desk. Had to be able to scan and copy as well as print. Had to be a laser. She couldn't explain why to the owner or me, but she just had to have it. Eventually he got tired of her whining and told me to get her one. Fine, it's not my money.
