Qes138,My 65 year old mother is terrible at learning new technology. It took 3 lessons for her to 'get the knack of' using a mouse. My 21 year old little sister occasionally used my Mom's computer. This resulted in hours of my time fixing registry errors and removing viruses. (Windows XP with Norton) I eventually put Ubuntu on her computer. (All she uses the machine for is email and helping my niece with homework.) Now I don't have to act as my Mom's personal tech support all the time.

Sounds about the time when you document everything, go to the principal and tell him either the AD goes or you stop fixing anything related to it.

UltraChip,"I feel your pain, young techie. You will have many similar stories in the years ahead. 

One point of interest though: If your sister is serious about her photo editing then it actually does make sense for her to have an i7. Image rendering is very intensive on RAM and CPU resources, so the more power you can get along those lines the better off you are. Then again, if all she's doing is taking out red eye and brightening up dark shots then you may have a point.

I agree with you that the 1TB hard drive is unneccesary though. If she was editing VIDEOS then 1TB would make sense, but not if she's just diddling around with photos. 

As for Windows 8 I agree with you: It's a pain in the ass to teach new users what to do with it. But in fairness, it's extremely hard to find a pre-built computer with Windows 7 anymore so she was probably going to end up with Win8 any way. ",null,0,cdpnmrh,1rpx0v,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day,12
