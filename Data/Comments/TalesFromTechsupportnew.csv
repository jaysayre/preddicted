I also worked for the same chain as OP. In addition to getting repairs through us, customers could of course take their computer to a third-party authorized repair shop.

One of the guys who owned and operated a third-party place in our neck of the woods was also a former coworker of ours. So sometimes he would just bring in a whole stack of laptops that needed simple things like new batteries or new top cases and let us do it. It was honestly easier for both him and us, and it wasn't fraud – the repairs were all covered under warranty and he was a certified tech running an authorized, registered repair shop.

DARPA's effort to harness 1–2 watts from continuous shoe impact while walking were abandoned due to the impracticality and the discomfort from the additional energy expended by a person wearing the shoes. Other energy harvesting ideas include harvesting the energy from human movements in train stations or other public places[25][26] and converting a dance floor to generate electricity.[27] Vibrations from industrial machinery can also be harvested by piezoeletric materials to charge batteries for backup supplies or to power low-power microprocessors and wireless radios""

* Contribute all this documentation to the internal IT knowledge-base on any areas you are the SME, while also **strictly** redirecting the helpdesk back to the KBs for any issue that they come to you with that already have an existing article.  
* Steadfastly refuse to help them until they have gone through the KB and confirmed their issue isn't addressed therein. Get their management and your management onboard with this idea, and punish them for repeatedly not searching first.  
* Update the articles as more troubleshooting steps are discovered, especially if you find yourself dealing with the same issue more than once. Ask for their input and allow them to propose changes to the KB articles under your domain.  
* Allow the helpdesk to tweak the KB keyword filtering to more closely reflect how the ticket are filed and how they will be searching for this issue in the future; for common issues that really don't need to go through the helpdesk with proper user training, you can unlock the KB articles for your customer-facing help portal.

One of the first and most important things to do is document any common questions you get along with their answers and any if/than/else scenarios related to them. Then make sure everyone has this documentation. When there's only one veteran tech, all of your help desk techs are naturally going to turn to you for policy, procedure and any other questions they have. I've been in this same situation, it sucks for everyone involved. Not just for you but for the tech's getting beat up on long phone calls they don't have the answer to. 

I don't know the extent of training these people have had, the specific nature of your environment or any other variables but just learning the policies of a particular IT environment is something that takes time, let along learning how to manage and support custom applications, learning all sorts of shortcuts and easier ways to do things in your environment. 

Good luck in dealing with it. It's a hard position to be in, I've been there before both on the end of being the lead technician and running the help desk. And being on the side of having to learn a completely new environment with mostly new people. It takes time, it takes training and it's going to be a bumpy road for everyone involved for a while. Just try to be as helpful and constructive as possible. Rather than complain or call them the helpless desk, try helping them. As others have mentioned shadowing is a great way to get your techs up to speed. Are they stuck on an issue they can't fix. Bring them over and show them how to do it. It makes a big difference down the line and the stability you're used to will eventually be there as your techs become more familiar with the day to day stuff.",null,0,ccitevr,1ng998,TalesFromTechsupport,new,1

I work in a finance industry. Time is money. Normally I can't resist making someone work for themselves and submit to me a list of things they've already done before I dive into a problem. I can't do that with the desk. The wrong person cries about not getting their issue fixed fast enough and my ass is grass.

We do have a KB system, loads of docs, and access to other support tools. Since time is money, the company would rather them ask me then spend time searching docs or going through a vendor support channel. It sucks but not much I can do.

Despite the helpless desk being the way they are, there are actually a few that I personally recruited left and they do their best to keep the rest of them away from me.

I haven't been on the desk for over two years. I'm part of Engineering and have my own projects to deal with and any time I spend dealing with the desk, gets logged as such and my project time gets adjusted to reflect it. I'd just rather not be bothered.

In most Med/Surge units, a nurse is taking 5 patients at a time. The EMR must be checked and documented in for each patient for every assessment and intervention. Most hospitals use the computers as a means of communication between nurses and physicians. Prescriptions and schedules are also a part of this. HIPPA requires logging out completely every time you step away from the computer. Often nurses must go from room to room quickly when patients are presenting with emergent issues.

This translates into a lot of login and logouts, a lot of patient switching, and a lot of time clicking through and writing in the EMR documentation.

The sheer volume of these transitions means that when they begin to take too long, the minutes add up, and patient care suffers.

I guess she had someone set up her wifi at home, so whenever she did something at home with her laptop it magically worked, why shouldn't it work anywhere else, too?

&gt;**Older Bro:** Ok bro but first can you teach us how to turn it on.

&gt;**Sexy IT:** *(in my mind: MAGIC OR SOMETHING?! You have got to be kidding me.)* No just press the power button on the front.

&gt;**Older Bro:** I thought that was to say it had power only. I have never had to turn it on i just leave it running.

&gt;**Sexy IT:** Your computer has constantly been on for 3 years?

This standardisation was a long time coming and came about in part due to various lawsuits by smaller, competing telcos fighting the virtual monopoly that existed in the US telecommunications market.

I work as a tech managing computer labs, and like you I have no access to SCCM (we're not licensed for it), no permissions to edit active directory (although I'm part of our self-defined admin group), and no group policy access. Psexec is great in theory, but it takes so long just to start the damn process, and longer still to execute the process. 

There are two options that I can see which both have their pros and cons.

1. You can use remote WMI (windows management interface) which is baked into Windows (although it needs to be allowed through each computer's firewall), and then create a C# or VBScript executable that utilizes the remote WMI interface and runs a batch script on each remote computer.
VBScript example of using WMI: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa389290(v=vs.85).aspx
Needless to say, this method requires a lot more upfront work, but coming from someone who uses this method just about every day, I would never go back. 

2. The other option (which may be more accessible), is to use PowerShell. You can enable powershell scripts on a machine by opening powershell and running ""set-executionpolicy unrestricted"". From there, you can run ""Enable-PSRemoting"", and now anyone in the administrator group can run powershell scripts on that computer by using ""Invoke-Command -ComputerName $dummyComputerName ""Start-Process C:\temp\runInstall.bat""""

PowerShell is a little tricky to learn at first, but in my work with automating silent installs, and general desktop programming, I've found it to be indispensable. There are tons of resources out there for learning PowerShell, my favorite of which is the Hey, Scripting Guy Blog. It has a ton of basic examples for things like copying files, granting permissions to directories, etc. 
http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/

Like you I vowed never to touch more than one machine for a software install again. I've used psexec, and I've used the two methods I described above, and I will never go back.

Of course this doesn't prevent them from submitting move requests less than 24 hours before they *absolutely must have it moved and working*, even though we have policies that state how much in advance they're supposed to submit a request.

It's the maintenance guys you have to watch out for.

hotcod,"No one touches anything in our place, even simple things like swapping a mouse or a keyboard should come to us. In fact this reminds me of a time the accountant complained a staff members mouse was clicking too loudly and wanted it replaced. To put this in context the women sits in an open plan call centre. The Senior Tech refuses on the grounds that we are not going to waste time trying to find a ""suitable"" mouse when it's no louder than any other mouse in the office.

The next week Senior Tech is way and I get a help desk ticket from the user who's mouse was causing all this trouble asking for a new one. Which struck me as a little odd, so I go talk to the user and apparently she was asked by the accountant to raise the ticket. So I wrote a e-mail to the people involved, user, accountant and ops making it clear despite the accountants apparently have a help desk allergy (she would actually go with out a problem being fixed if, after coming down expecting us to jump at it, we asked her to raise a ticket) it's not ok to waste another members of staff time raising a ticket, more so when it's been made clear it didn't warrant action. 

This puts the accountant in a right strop and the ops manager comes to talk to me. I just made it clear that I wasn't going to change the mouse and the whole thing was ridiculous. Not however as ridiculous as popping upstairs later that day to find these two ladies of a certain age crawling about under desks swapping a mouse around. Which it should be noted left the 'noisy' mouse in use (just less so) and it's replacement being, as far as I can tell, exactly as noisy. I had to tell them that if they cause an issue with the wiring on the desk that I wasn't going to fix it and wasn't going to tidy up the cabling either and wondered off to send a few more e-mails to Senior Tech to make sure he was aware of the silliness.

The ops manager was just looking for an easy life, which I can understand as I'd have hung my self if I had to sit next to the mad women and after a Senior Tech has a quite word or two with her we did then make sure to check the desks and tidy it up but only when the accountant wasn't around. Funnily enough after Senior Tech was done talking to her about her behaviour she did actually start to raise some tickets...

I always imagine those people at home, holding an item and going ""*I will surely need this thing at some point in the future again.

lynxSnowCat,"At McMaster University there was one economics prof who would have students move his recycle bin of materials to a room and leave it there unattended for days ontop of a chair, or some such. If any portion of the files were missing, the student was then fined/demerited/ejected from the class.

He (to my knowledge) never correctly expressed when he would need the files, or what portions were missing. And he threw a fit whenever the bin was marked with paint.

Well, the bin sat undisturbed for the two weeks that I started and was accumilating trash, so I assumed it was actually a recycle bin. I asked my instructors, and other students (in the building) who indicated that yes, if was. I collected some acetates (that weren't stained with soda) from the top (overly simplified supply,demand,pricepoint convergence graphs) believing they were free game, then erased them for reuse, showing others how to do this.

A few days later I hear *Professor Dickweed* screaming at his student down the hall for 'losing' the materials and getting trash over everything. Apparently his class started a month and a half after mine. The prof only knew some materials were gone, but did not identify which ones, demanding the student produce a verbatim copy from his own notes, without knowing what sections of material were missing. (prof probably thought the student had misplaced the missing mats, the bin was dug through my my cohert).

I was later informed that the student was given a narrow time frame to deliver the bin to the room to eliminate risk of (the student) being the source of loss. The prof had failed to collect the bin in a timely fashon figuring that it could stay in an unlocked room in a building with heavy traffic until he needed it. My instructer *knew* that telling me to take the acetates would cause Prof Dickweed to throw a tantrum, but did not know Dickweed would blame that student.

Yes, it may be satisfying in some morbid way, but if the president of the company has some interest in her, you aren't going to make any productive change there.

A better way would be to defer her to your boss somehow and explain the situation to him.  Confronting users about wasting time is a job for management at the very least.  Explain to her that you are currently engaged in some critical tasks, but that she can speak with your manager and he can reprioritize your tasks if necessary.",null,3,ccl37hm,1no56q,TalesFromTechsupport,new,2

I proceeded to reboot the system to Safe mode with Networking and started checking the problem out. An hour later, I found this user had over 250GB of little (&lt;5KB) JavaScript files sitting in their Internet Explorer Temporary Internet Files folder, and of course, the adware ""Shopping helper"" crap that tends to accumulate on machines installed.

The machine took over 5 hours to delete all 250GB of those files via Command Prompt, at which time I only went between TeamViewer and whatever else I was doing to keep the system (and connection) alive. The user went off for the night, since this call came in at 8PM about halfway into the deletion. After the deletion finished, I had to proceed with cleaning out the crap that started the mess in the first place. The job finished at 4:30AM and I rebooted the system back to normal.

Thankfully the user had a Fiber connection at their home. Both the speed of the remote connection and the reliability saved on a ton of headache that night. The next morning I got a call from the user, after they woke their machine up from sleep saying they couldn't believe how fast the machine felt again.",null,0,ccl6ksp,1npx99,TalesFromTechsupport,new,1

RamsesThePigeon,"*Sigh*.

You know... it's fun to laugh at these people, but their crazy ideas are really harmful to progress. Personally, I'm absolutely sick to death of this whole ""reptilian aliens are controlling our society"" business.

First of all, the Schraschz are *not* aliens. They were the first sentient species to evolve on Earth, and they were rescued by the ""Greys"" just before the cataclysm that killed off their reptilian cousins. They were transported to Fszst (what we call GJ 667Cc), where they lived for millions of years, eventually evolving into the humanoid reptilian species we know today. While they may very well have inhabited an alien planet, their ancestors were as terrestrial as yours or mine.

What makes the conspiracy so confounding and aggravating, though, is this ridiculous notion that they're somehow secretly in control of our society. Personally, I think we would have noticed if every one of our leaders had a projecting snout, green scales, and soft feathers instead of hair. Of course, that doesn't stop the theorists, who claim that the Schraschz use some kind of hologram technology, or that they *surgically alter themselves* to appear more human.

Oh, but it gets worse. Apparently, the Schraschz are here to enslave humanity (or use them for food, or other equally outrageous suggestions), but they're doing it by allowing us to develop newer and better technologies than they currently have access to? I mean, we're talking about a species that - due to humankind's xenophobia - is forced to live exclusively in regions that we find inhospitable. Even those [small tribes of humans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese_people) they *do* regularly interact with are forced to remain cut off from the outside world as a result.

Look, I understand that they're a bit scary at first sight. The idea of competing physically against a seven-foot-tall lizard is a pretty frightening one. Seriously, though, I [dated a Schraschz](http://i.imgur.com/WFz36by.jpg) for about a year and a half, and other than the obvious difficulties (like sex, which was a bit... interesting), I found the young lady to be both intelligent and incredibly witty. (Hell, even the accent is pretty sexy, I'll admit.) The *only* reason we broke up was because of ignorant bigots who would yell at her, threaten her, or even *physically attack her* any time she went out in public with me. (For those that care, she's living happily in the Amazon Basin now, though we don't keep in touch as much as either of us would like.)

So, yeah, this idea that they're a marauding group of malicious aliens really angers me, and I wish humanity would just learn to accept the Schraschz for who they are. They're a hell of a lot more evolved than us, and we could learn a thing or two from them.",null,23,ccl1ukn,1nq071,TalesFromTechsupport,new,134

Some pointers - If your printer is that dirty and/or has never been serviced (since you've gotten toner on your hands), it may pay to take a can of compressed air or something to it where you have taken the toner out.

It'll help keep the print jobs clean.  There's also paper ""dust"" that cab accumulate in the trays/toner area.

Another useful trick I've found is when there's a jam further down in the paper path, use half of a manila folder and push it through from the tray side.  It should follow the path and push out any stuck sheets/torn pieces of paper that can block sensors and register as jams.

In order to avoid tearing pages in the printer, make sure it's off, and the gears/rollers skills release, making it easier to take the paper out.",null,0,cclcsn5,1nqdld,TalesFromTechsupport,new,1

Last time I ever got a virus due to my own stupidity was in 2003 shortly before I actually started learning about computers. I love when people say they fixed something when in reality they simply clicked the finish button on what I was doing previously. 

When they ask why their password wont work, I tell them their keychain (lol not even a mac, this is a windows environment) got corrupt because of all the viruses they had downloaded on their machine and that it'll take me a couple hours to fix it. I normally don't reset their password to our companies default w/ force password change at logon till the end of the day.

ontheroadtonull,"In a dusty little town in the California desert, a lone figure stands in the middle of Main Street while the shade creeps away into the wood.

High noon.

The knell of the clocktower sounds.  It rang exactly the same way at noon for the past six years since it was built, but for some reason on this particular noon the tone seemed to rattle windows all over the town.

As the shadows in the windows begin to stir, the slender figure standing in the road calls out from grimacing lips.

""Your time is up now Packard!  I'm all set to send you back to your manufacturer!  If I have to come find you to do it, you can bet that it won't be a peaceful end!""

The slender figure glares at each window he can see around him.  He knows that the shadows behind the panes conceal his quarry.

The lone figure bares his teeth and calls out again.

""I'll tear this whole damn town to planks if you make me wait any longer!  Come out now, unless you're too FFFF00 to spare this town from ruination!""

The voice of the figure echoes, as though it could hold itself on the air for a moment.  His gaze causes the shadows to quiver.

He turns to face the building to his left and starts toward it.  He gets two steps from the middle of the road before he hears the creak of a door swinging down the street.  He stops and turns toward the sound.  His lips turn upward into an angry sneer as he squints.

Out from the shadow of the doorway a boxy chassis whirs and clicks its way onto the plank porch of the abandoned Staples store.  It clunks to turn at the figure in the street.  The figure's expression changes to a smile that could be mistaken for the snarling of a wolf.

""It's about time you got out here Packard."" quipped the figure.

The chassis only glared back at the figure.  It knew that no words would spare it from breaking the promise that it had struggled to keep for so long.

The chassis whirred and clicked slowly toward the middle of the road.  Each whir wrought torment in its heart.  It had never believed that prayer was of any use before, but with each whir a prayer of forgiveness was only just held behind its lid.  Each click kicked up a small cloud of dust.  The chassis watched them closely.  They looked like the clouds of heaven to it.  It wondered if the angels would come and offer it peace today.

With a whir and a click, the chassis turned to face the figure.

The figure, eager to have his prey, utters only one more word.

""DRAW!""

The chassis hesitates, but the figure waits.  His twisted ego keeps him from taking advantage so soon.

The chassis sucks in a breath of air and activates its servo.  Its lid pops open, but the figure already has his fingers wrapped around the grip of his gun.  The chassis activates the heat element in its inkjet, but the figure is already bringing his barrel up.  The chassis lets loose with a thunderous blast, but the figure has already fired.

The shots streak past each other in the air like hawks.

Both figures stand, waiting for the other to fall.  Neither of them had ever missed before.

Neither of them missed this time as well.

The figure huffs and staggers.  

The chassis sputters ""Please...forgive me"" as its lid falls shut.  The chassis looks up at the sky as cyan drips out of its paper tray.  ""Please...forgive me"".

The figure falls to the ground and laughs.  With one last bloody breath, the figure becomes a shadow.

rcns,"Sounds like a printer with a PostScript interpreter (limit check is a PS error). These printers often had more RAM than the computers that sent jobs. IIRC PostScript interpreted everything; so if your file contained a complex image that was entirely covered by a simple box, the interpreter would RIP the complex image and then try to figure out how to exclude it as it was covered by a box. 

Limit check errors were very often associated with complex clipping paths (think close cropped irregular images... removing the background with a vector path... a more difficult task than the first example). 

The problems were almost always associated with EPS files which were fully interpreted before rasterization. So, if a 600 pip image 10"" high was printed at 10% size! all of the data was crunched and not just the 10% required as it was scaled. 

One of the advantages of PDF is that the data may be flattened and resampled making processing easier on the interpreter.

Now the Brother DCP7020 laser printer / scanner works great but it sometimes runs short on RAM, especially when I'm trying to print at 1200dpi, but its RAM is not upgradeable. 

When the Brother runs short on memory it prints an extra page with really blurry text explaining that whatever I was trying to print exceeded the memory capacity.

I replaced the element in one with a diode and demonstrated to him that the fuse was indeed polarized, and so must be installed right side up to work.

If they call, and we don't answer, they'll hang up and call back over and over again until we do answer (we won't answer once they've rang us twice without pause).

Our users are some of the shittiest I've ever had to deal with.

I often give the people I manage ""combat pay"" for having to deal with these assholes.    

Once, a lady came in and per her hand on one of the IT guys' screen and wouldn't move it until he stopped talking on the phone.

Once, a lady threw a laptop at someone because he asked her to bring it by when she had a chance (instead of going to her to get it).

Once, a lady who has worked here for over 25 years came in complaining that she couldn't get into email with her old password after she changed the password.

Once a guy came in and said that his mouse wouldn't work.  He brought his mouse, and THIRTY USB -&gt; PS2 -&gt; USB -&gt; PS2 -&gt; USB -&gt; PS2 converters all plugged in.   He was using the converters to ""make the mouse longer"" and it just quit working after 30 converters.

Another guy came in to complain that he hooked another keyboard, mouse and monitor up to his computer, but he still couldn't get another user logged in and working on his computer.

This gets even worse as all applications have the exact same File &gt; Open command and they all open the exact same (OS) file picker dialog. And to make matters worse, while they only list files they open by default, they can easily be told to circumvent that, even though that's never going to lead to a desirable result under normal circumstances (speaking from a normal-user perspective here)

Now working using a file manager would solve that issue (just double click the file you want to open and have the shell sort it out), but file managers are even more difficult to explain to non-versed users and they allow them to do even more damage.

Cheesy_Jones,"I had this ridiculously sarcastic response written, but threw it away because it's simpler to just say this.

Ageism works both ways. For all the fuss on the front page, recently, about this idea that adults don't take young folks seriously, I see as many posts like yours, posts that denigrate older folks because they don't have the same skills as you, or can't see something that is, to you, glaringly obvious.

At 45, many people have spouses, families, mortgages, and are probably raising teenagers, who--and I can tell you this as the father of two such beings--are truly horrible people. They're like the worst roommate you've ever had, who feel utterly entitled to treat you like complete shit. 

Given that perspective, something like a small, perhaps obvious, computer problem, in the scheme of things, is *wholly and completely insignificant*. Yet like all people, when something doesn't work as expected, frustration occurs.

Computers, due mostly, in my opinion, to poor human interface design, often respond differently than we expect, and this can inspire rage sometimes. Microsoft Word makes me want to jump out the window (I'd be more dramatic, but, you know, NSA). ""Fuck you, Microsoft!"" rings as does the clarion call of the Valkyrie, throughout our office. We wish death on them on a daily basis (and if you worked with tables and ordered lists in Word as much as we do, you'd be singing the same tune).

Now, is it fair that these people snarl, ""Fix it!"" at you, which you obviously find humiliating and offensive? No, of course it isn't. But it's your job, and we all have our crosses to bear professionally. 

My boss prides herself on being technically proficient, yet on a daily basis she calls me to her desk so I can explain the simplest damn things to her. Why? Well, I'm not sure, but she does have a business to run, and seems to want to run her adult children's lives as much as possible, so she just doesn't have the time or patience to figure out how to create a swatch in Illustrator if there isn't a color already selected (you can't). 

Of course, she's wonderfully nice about it, which is why I adore her, and if these ancient accountants would observe the social rules of engagement more closely I think you'd be more happily disposed toward them, but meh, you know? I mean, fuck them, but don't blame it on their age.

The software came on floppies, and there were a LOT, something like 16. It was tedious and you had to babysit it while it installed, and if you messed up the disk order it was a pain, so you had to have two stacks of disks.

Following the principle of making an image of a hard drive, I loaded and dragged each floppy to a folder on the desktop, then dragged those images into a burning program and burned them to a disk.

cybervegan,"Back in the olde days (late 1980's), keyboards were *REALLY* expensive. I worked as a temp for a big US-based tech company, in one of their UK locations, and my *JOB* was cleaning and repairing PC/AT and 911 terminal keyboards that used to come in from all over Europe for refurbishment.

I used to stip them down to the bare board (they used to have a printed circuit board with mechanical switches soldered on) by removing the casing , lead and keytops. I would then put the parts into an industrial dishwasher. They would then stand in a rack for 24 hours before being tested, fixed, and re-constructed.

Apart from the foreign characters and different layouts, you could tell where a keyboard had come from by the particular type of grime encrusting it; the ones from Italy usually had a thick layer of compacted crumbs under the keytops and ones from the UK railway offices were grey with diesel fumes.

These days the cost of a keybaord is so low that it is totally economically un-viable to repair one - any techie's hourly rate would be more than the cost of a new keybaord, and it takes several hours to fully clean and refurbish a keyboard... hence most IT departments have a box of duffers in a dusty corner that will eventually end up going to recycling.",null,2,ccpx5zo,1o7p7d,TalesFromTechsupport,new,11

Now I'm also a tech so as an attempt to help myself down the road I give them step by step instructions on how to back that sheet up. Including saying about twenty times if they don't we can't magically get those photos etc back

So about two months after one of these classes a face from one of them pops up. Dropped her thingy into the pool. Screw rice, that was no good (and no we didn't tell you that would fix it so yeah you are paying). I get her replacement and she pops off some comment about how we need to transfer everything for her. 

Not possible due to 
1. State privacy laws mean our computers won't read the data off devices since it would make a copy into our system in the process
2. Source phone doesn't power on anyway

I tell her she just needs to restore her backup. To find out that after I voluntarily gave up half my lunch hour to show her exactly how to do it to her laptop because she's too paranoid to do the Internet backup she hadn't done it since that day, six months ago. 

I made sure to note that cx verified I had instructed her in detail about backing up and she failed to do it so when she calls managers trying to demand they cover costs of data recovery and new retail device they will know to say no cause it was user laziness etc

(For those wondering attempting data recovery means taking the whole device down to parts and no one is authorized to do this by the company so it's considered a tampered device and thus you can't get service anymore, and as a contracted device she's in for a lot of money cause she's not even a year in.

Managers were informed, shipping lists checked, corporate called. Turns out ours wasn't the only store to get hit by iTarts. I think two other stores found them as well. Had it been only us we'd have been in a lot of trouble but thankfully it was something that originated in-transit. The amazing part of it was that when you weighed the box with the pop-tarts it was the EXACT weight of the box with the computer. And it was factory sealed too! Someone out there's an evil genius.

Even shitty Hyper-V allows this. If they're using Citrix or VMware, then this is cake, not to mention the fact that any hosting company worth their salt has at *least* one DR site.

And DR sites aren't 100% real time replication... even Google can't get real time replication, it's usually delayed (on average) by about 1-4 hours. (In Google's case, around 15-30 minutes somehow with their magical proprietary BigTable filesystem). 

Worst case scenario, if they didn't have a backup or snapshot... They could have easily copied your VMDK files from their SAN(s) across the WAN. Sure, might have taken an hour or so (not including email datastores)... but it'd be better than nothing.

If they don't have a DR sites, an automated backup/replication/snapshotting policy, etc... it's time to find a new host.

 * You and your staff spend some time yelling at each other.  I don't know how much dysfunction one school can take, but you seem to be examining the question.
 * You installed Deepfreeze?  What kind of a jackass installs such an insidious program and admits to it?
 * You hate Bob?  Who cares.  The problem lies with your administration's enabling of this character.
 * You spend far too much time worrying about keys.  That's not a question; it's an observation.
 * Bob the teacher ripped and tore his way through a tech closet with no consequences?  That's either bullshit or you work for an incredibly stupid school.  Did you report this egregious behavior?
 * Holy shit.  Bob sent home a laptop with a kid for repair?  Children die from such stupidity.  No consequences?  Did you report this horror?

At current place_of_employ, people *love* their printing. they print, read, shred, make ONE fucking change, print, read, shred, make one MORE fucking change.

Lather, rinse, repeat.

Manglement refuses to spend more than is budgeted on printer consumables. If we run out, stiff shit.

Printer is of the type that, if it runs short of consumables, *refuses* to print. Game over - I 'aint doing *anything* until you replace my empty toner (regardless of colour), or change the fuser, or whatever.

Cue one Sunday afternoon when printer runs out of toner (one of the colours - magenta, from memory) and just stops.

We have no replacement - we've run out - company logo is primarily red, and it uses magenta *way* faster than any of the other colours or black toner.

Mass panic occurs as people realise there is no printing, and many outraged calls are made to the on-call phone (because, you know, NOT PRINTING is worth waking someone up at 3 am in the fucking morning!)

Monday morning arrives, and we do Jack Schitt. People complain. We tell them ""Sorry, it's offline until the next supply run in about 6 weeks."" (we but consumables quarterly, so were only about half way through the supply period).

Brown smells stuff, meet rotating air distribution blades.

I point out numerous requests which advise of additional printing being done, and requesting additional budget to buy consumables which were refused point-blank by various levels of Manglement.

Question is asked ""Can't we just pull it out, shake it, and fool the printer into working again?"".

I gave hearty approval and went back to my real job.

From memory, it took two days before manglement approved additional supplies - and another week before the right parts were found and sent to us.

I phoned NEC and they sent someone out to repair it.  He replaced the CD drive and the issue persisted.  Must be the disc.

We tried the disc in another computer; no issue.  Must be the hardware.

He started replacing cables and circuit boards - at least that's what I remember - but it always came out the same.  My computer just couldn't run this game.

Valriete,"This is sort of related, and since it's an end-user story, I've been waiting for the right opportunity.

The house's Compost cable internet went out for a couple of hours last week. We get our land line through 'em as well, and with no dial tone, the options were quickly narrowed down.

After an hour or so and a modem reboot, my landlady wakes up (this was ~0530) and gives 'em a call.

^(Now, so you don't wonder too much: I rent a room in this house for $CHEAP, since I can't currently afford not to. Her daughter's eternally unmarried live-in fiancé - we'll call him 'Ash', for lack of a better unisex name, since his gender is a bit vague - is a friend from school, so I get some financial slack. Which means, yes, I encounter most of the shit that happens around here.)

Anyway, the landlady (henceforth 'Hamplanet') is apparently connected with a tech. It's been a few minutes, and I'm in an adjacent room, when I hear the squawking start.

""WHY DO I HAVE TO GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION AGAIN? I ALREADY TOLD YOU ONCE."" At which time she huffily recites her name and address for, as far as I know, the first time to the tech she's connected to. 

For better or worse, Ash and I are both largely nocturnal, so he's awake as well. I mention to him, not-so-subtly, that I'm gaining a greater understanding of why posters in the tech-support subreddit to which I subscribe tend to have a history of alcohol abuse.

""Well,"" he says, ""she already told him once.""

""Maybe so, but was it even the same guy? If it was, is it his problem or is it Comcast's policy? Still...""

He shrugs. I position myself between Hamplanet, who at this point has the poor bastard on speakerphone, and the cable modem, in case anything remotely technical has to be done. The tech does a signal reset, and makes the mistake of telling her it'll be at least a minute, but might take five or so ^(or whatever the exact figure was, I was half-asleep at the time). Hamplanet is noticeably flustered by receiving multiple possible figures, so I stand there, waiting, rubbing my temple.

The tech asks her to reset the modem, I go to do just that.

The circus arrives in town.

""NO,"" says Hamplanet, in her usual indignant voice. ""It's the white one.""

My response: ""That's the router. It won't -""

HP: ""NO, that's the modem. See, it says Comcast on it.""

Me: ""They both say Comcast. It was a package deal.""

HP: ""It gets the signal from the wall...""

Me: ""No. No it does not. It gets the signal from *the modem*, which is this black box which has a coax cable attached to the back of it.""

HP: ""Yes it does!""

Me, *glad I'm unarmed*: ""Well, I'm sorry, but I -""

Ash, *who should damn well know better*: ""That's what they've had us reset in the past when this has happened.""

Me, *knowing Ash knows what different cables are*: ""All right. You knew I was dealing with the modem, not the router, earlier. Show me the cable and phone cords coming from the back of the white box."" (Which, for those listening at home, is still the Netgear wireless router, not a cable modem. The cable modem is black, it's larger, and it doesn't have an antenna.)

At this point, Ash goes ahead and unplugs the router, then plugs it back in, presumably to appease Hamplanet. The modem remains untouched since the call was initiated. The tech tells us to go ahead and try it.

I am hoping the signal reset has done the trick.

It has.

Outlook is a very disk I/O intensive application, with many reads and writes to the same physical areas of the hard drive. I've had countless situations where the OST/PST is on a spot that has developed a bad sector, causing the hard drive to waste time reading and rereading to get that data. Thus it will hang and do all kinds of other unpredictable stuff. Sure you can recreate the OST, but all you're doing is putting it on another physical spot on the drive that doesn't have a bad sector....yet. So you've given yourself the illusion that you've ""fixed"" the problem.

fishchunks,"Ah, I was a minecraft server owner for 3 years (I had about 4 servers.) and the god damn fan base. Some times I would have to close the server for a day for maintenance and everyone would go crazy. I'd tell them a good week in advance that the server will be shut on X day at X time for X amount of hours and that the server would be whitelisted during said time and people would go insane. They can't seem to understand that a server can't run perfectly fine constantly. When I had to make a change to a certain area of the map which is high-traffic I'd often whitelist the server and kick everyone out, towards the end however I used to just bedrock the outside and set their spawn there. People would go crazy if they couldn't access the marketplace for half an hour.

My favourite argument was the ""But my friend's server doesn't restart!"", well no shit, your friend runs their server on their computer for 2-3 hours at a time. If you want a server which 5000 hours of uptime than do it to your own.

Thank god for a decent Minecraft server host (Big up beastnode.com) they were freaking fabulous. One time some kid hacked into my account because I'm a moron and used the same password for my account as I did my email and Minecraft account which wasn't even a tough password (Think 6 letters. I know, stupid.) and wiped all my data off. I contact the host, they got his IP address, blocked it and restored an off-site backup. All for free. They also told me his IP so I could monitor my logs and find out who it was, he was promptly banned.

The worst experience however was this 8-year-old. His older brother (Who himself was only 12 but he was mature, kept to himself and done his job well.) was an admin and he thought that meant he had free-reign of the server, griefing, stealing and breaking all 12 rules of my server. He somehow lasted two years before I just had enough and wanted to murder him so he was banned and no matter how much he would yell at me (He got his mum on skype to me...

ReverendSaintJay,"My first day on the job in corporate IT (prior job was field service/break-fix work) I'm assigned to ride shotgun with one of the more senior teams on campus, we'll call them Bob and Jan.  Now, Bob was around 30 years my senior, had worked for the company for 25 of those years, and no one would ever mistake me for being in charge when the two of us walked the floors.

And then there were my trips with Jan.  I should mention that she was better than I was in almost every respect.  The only area where I held even the slimmest of margins was in our ability to write our names in the snow with nothing more than a full bladder, and I'm sure that if she were inclined to do just that she could come up with a solution to her nonexistent problem.

At any rate, Bob had me in the morning, introducing me around and letting the key people in the building know who I was.  In the afternoon it was Jan's turn, and she was going to show me how things were done in the office.  We get to one of the ""executive's"" offices and she starts up the spiel.  ""Hi, I'm Jan and this is Rev, we're from IT, can you tell us a little bit about your issue?""  He immediately begins telling *me* what's wrong.

Uh-oh.

I don't know what to do, I'm the FNG, she's the senior partner in this equation.  I'm clever enough to pick up on the issue he's having, but I have no idea what the standard protocols or procedures there are for fixing this type of issue in this environment.  About 3 minutes in, Jan is clearly unhappy with the situation and possibly getting ready to blame me for everything, when I raise my hand and said the following.

""Excuse me Sir, but I think that there's a misunderstanding here that needs to be cleared up.  I am more than happy to help you with your issue, but as this is my first day on the job, Jan here is the only thing keeping me from yanking the guts out of your machine in an attempt to 'fix' it.

This changes your ""location"" in the company's email system (for various bureaucratic and payroll related reasons) to be that training center in California.

I think you know where this is going, but there's a mailing list that accidentally gets used maybe once or twice a year that sends an email to all technicians who trained in the California location about things that are only relevant if you're still physically there. 250+ locations for this company, with at least 4 or 5 techs in each store receive an email from a corporate-level employee and I'll be damned if at least one person in each store doesn't respond with ""please remove me from this list"" or ""DO NOT REPLY ALL"" or some variant of ""let the reply-all flow through you"" and ""here we go again!""

shovelDriver,"Just can't resist throwing this into the conversation:

You said:  "". . .where her Internet Explorer (yes, she used it) . . ."".

So you think the problem is IE?  That's funny!  I run IE.  I've also beta-tested every single A-V and A-Malware fixer on this planet, as well as every single browser there is and ever was.

I use IE, and I use MSSCE and Windows Defender exclusively on my personal Windows machines.  (Other type O/S systems use other things.)  I grew tired of the issues caused by the other programs on the myriad of systems I support.  (Yes, including MAC/Apple, Linux and its' many variations, and even Chrome.)  Yet I have never had a virus, worm, or Trojan slip through the cracks on my systems, even though I've been doing this sort of work, including virus offense/defense testing, since the early 1980's.  I like to think that is because I'm smart, but realistically, it's more likely because I use the recommended settings and procedures.

Funny thing is, most of my clients usually call me only once a year or so for tune-ups.  After their first exposure to an infection, they don't often get infected again.

I am my own worst enemy, in that I take time to actually teach them what not to do.  They always say ""But other techs don't explain it the way you do.""

So perhaps people who hate IE are part of the problem?  Maybe you just don't comprehend what you're doing wrong?

Or perhaps we could lay off the childish ""my computer's better than yours, and my Dad can beat up your dad"" B.S.

DudeosaurusRex,"Place I used to work had a desktop backup solution in place that was set to run every day, by policy. It grabbed the profile and a few other essentials, but that was it. Because all software was either site licenses or packaged and tied to the user account, all we had to do if they wanted a reimage was wipe it and give it back. It was then their responsibility to restore from the previous backup and reinstall software. They could call the helpdesk, but the helpdesk guys were really good in regards to pointing someone in the right direction rather than leading them by the hand. For most people, this worked fine. 

Of course, we'd occasionally have someone, just a little too smart for their own good, who'd decided that the desktop or documents folders just weren't secure places to keep data. Instead, they would store it in the root of the C drive, in a temp folder, or (once) in the recycle bin. I wish I was lying about that last one. Three places that our software didn't back up by default.

One time, I actually got to hear a grown man cry before hanging up on me after I cheerfully told him that there was no possible way of recovering the directory he had created in the root of C, which contained several years of work, and then pointing him to the detailed backup policy documentation that states exactly what is and isn't backed up.

When I worked near to a printer I had to constantly chase down people who kept trying to 'reclaim' the stapler **I bought** and return it to the workplace.

After realising that I could never have enough staples to supply everyone, I chained the stapler to my workbench so that I could load 3-10 staples at a time from my remaining cache.  Eventually people became afraid of being caught using the ""last staple"" by others queing up to use it and started handing me boxes of staples to hold for them (win!) or had that precious sliver of hope of theirs dashed by the empty ka-click too many times to consider approaching it.

It worked well until the hammer in the stapler broke off from being loaded with the wrong sized staples too frequently, and wedging the hammer back 'on' wasn't a convincing enough deception.   Interestingly personal staplers actually did became a bit of a status item for a few people after mine went. But I think they got fed up with running out of staples for other people because they quietly hid them afterwards only talking about them in hused tones to trade remaining caches of irregular sized staples to matching staplers for reciprical stapling privledges.

A few moments after that the smell got stronger, I looked up and there was a thick billow of smoke coming from the closed off section. The store was on fire. I calmly told the people around me the store was on fire and that we should leave, then began to head towards the exit. Just then the fire alarm goes off.

So, thick smoke, strong smell of fire and now a fire alarm. According to TV, everyone should be panicking, running and screaming for the exists. Right?

Nope, most of the people just went ""fire shmirey"" and just kept on shopping.

Then one of the employees got on the intercom and told everyone the store was on fire and they needed to evacuate. Surely everyone obeyed, right?

Nope, they kept shopping.


There was another time, I was working at Wal-Mart and suddenly a whole bunch of firefighters come waltzing in wearing full gear. It's not uncommon for firefighters to come shop at Wal-Mart on my shift. It is uncommon during the middle of my shift around 2am and never in full gear. 

So I got suspicious and asked someone what was going on. 

It was just a little fire and everything was under control and that's why there wasn't an evacuation, right? Nope, it was a gas leak.",null,1,cd37rku,1pj6hq,TalesFromTechsupport,new,19

explorerbear,"I used to work tech support for a cable/ISP company. Though there was very little that could happen in terms of danger with our equipment, I did have some of the weirdest calls for troubleshooting during a dangerous situation.

A woman called me and was trying to troubleshoot her cable box, all the while with a very loud beeping/screeching noise in the background. You get used to that stuff so I sort of ignored it. After a few minutes I heard a loud knocking, yelling, and she spoke to someone in the background. She then told me that the firefighters were ""making"" her take her kids outside because the apartment building was on fire. The loud noise was the fire alarm and she had refused to evacuate because she wanted her cable to work.

Also had 2 different customers call in to troubleshoot cable boxes with semi-significant injuries. The first thing we usually asked was ""do you see the time displayed on the front of the box. One of the customers beat around the bush, not answering the question, but just complaining. Eventually I asked him 1 time too many, and he said ""I don't KNOW what the box looks like, I fell into my bathtub and I haven't been able to get out of it yet."" 

The other customer was a woman who, similarly, got tired of my repeated questions and screamed at me ""I CAN'T ANSWER THAT OK? I'm laying at the bottom of my apartment stairs, and I'm pretty sure my ankle is broken, so I can't walk back up there right now."" Apparently waiting for the ambulance is the perfect time to troubleshoot why your service is acting up. Derrrrrp.

Many many years ago, my then wife and I were going up the coastal highway (I-5 being closed due to a huge winter storm) and we came upon a scene. The **high tension** wires had been knocked down by the storm and were laying across the highway. Everyone came to a halt. I pulled over and got a length of PVC tubing out of my trunk (to this day I have no idea whatsoever why it was there) and started using that to haul the wires off the highway. Well, this guy decided I wasn't going to be the only hero in them parts and got out of his car, picked up a *wet* branch and proceeded to try to clear one of the other wires.

The branch got literally blown out of his hand and he was thrown a few feet through the air.

He got back in his car.

After I cleared the last line, all the cars started moving again. Moving so well that they wouldn't let me back onto the highway.

FlusteredByBoobs,"A modern day Braxton Bragg!

---

Ulysses S. Grant recalled in his memoirs a story about Bragg that seemed to suggest an essential need for proper procedure that bordered on mental instability. Once Bragg had been both a company commander as well as company quartermaster (the officer in charge of approving the disbursement of provisions). As company commander he made a request upon the company quartermaster--himself--for something he wanted. As quartermaster he denied the request and gave an official reason for doing so in writing. As company commander he argued back that he was justly entitled to what he requested. As quartermaster he stubbornly continued to persist in denying himself what he needed. Bragg requested the intervention of the post commander (perhaps to diffuse the impasse before it came to blows). His commander was incredulous and he declared, ""My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarreled with every officer in the army, and now you are quarreling with yourself.""

Apparently, the design group thought that it was necessary to bundle the all the power outlets together, the network drops together and the telephone together in each 2 or 3 person room. So we had Telephone drops beside the door; Power drops in the opposite corner, and Network drops in between. Naturally, these were all but covered up by the Large desks and attached cupboards ans shelving units. It took 2 weeks to dismantle the all-together-assembled units, drill holes and create conduit. After that it was still a nightmare as Each room had 2 network drops, 3 telephone cables and 2 duplex power outlets... So, there were switches and Powerbars galore; none of which FIT the conduits thoughtlessly put in after the fact. For 2 YEARS, ugly wire and cables were taped to the floor and walls. It wasn't that bad as there were only 9 office rooms.  They later had to renovate again when the Exec's and VIPs were forced to use these rooms for meetings. The horror at the huge expenditure to modernize  the rooms only to have it look like the IT departments office was palpable.  Needless to say, IT was involved in the new designs and Every employee that had to use the offices were very happy.

There will always be some incidentals that get missed on a large project, but I've seen jobs of half a million dollars where they made more on the this-and-that details than they did on the panels and desks.

Also, if you want to play dirty, approach an independent company and get them to put in all the work and come in low because they want that foot in the door.

So I get the reset password but still I don't have the access to the applications I need to do my work, I call back, go through the process again, we get to the ""have you rebooted and/or logged out"". I say I'll do both now and actually do them. After this doesn't fix the issue the guy stays on the line and logs into my system remotely.

First thing he does is go ""did you really reboot?"" I laugh and say ""Yes, don't you believe me?"". He mutters something and carries on, then I see him open up the process manager, glance at the uptime and I go ""Look, I used to work in sysadmin, I know how often users will lie about rebooting and trying what you suggest but I haven't""

He laughs then realising I'm not just another user who's lying about whats happening and we fix my issue (we never did work out why it said someone else had logged into my account but as I was new there was nothing they could of done on the system anyway so it was forgotten.)

They then realized they didn't have their briefcase, so they stopped, drove back up their driveway, rolling over the briefcase a second time.

Poor Powerbook was mangled. Customer was livid when I told him that the repair wasn't covered by AppleCare (which didn't cover accidental damage).

No, but IP (the layer below ICMP) does have a fragment-offset field, which would allow reassembly of out-of-sequence frags.  The problem with fragmentation is that losing one frag means you have to retransmit all the frags.

Camera zooms out slowly, showing a hand pick up the Aperture Science mug from its cradle. CU shot of tuxedo_jack taking a sip as the camera slowly zooms out, revealing a deserted office.Narrator (preferably Morgan Freeman) speaks.

Scene in - a blissful Thursday afternoon, with me in my corner office, the boss out of the office thanks to his kid being newly born, the juices from the Keurig flowing... yes, truly a day worth of Elysium. However, an urgent call to the project manager changed all that, and he came storming into my office as though he were possessed.

Cue  Incompetent Tech running into tuxedo_jack's office.

Incompetent tech (Breathless)

Jack! I need you to go to $CLIENT_NAME.

Tuxedo_jack continues to look down at his coffee. His eyes slowly follow the rising steam until he looks straight into Incompetent Tech's eyes.

Pray tell why? You are aware $BOSS_NAME ordered me not to leave the office if I could avoid it, and you're to send bitch-boy, yes?

Low angle shot from Tuxedo_jack's desk towards Incompetent Tech. Initial focus on Incompetent Tech wringing his hands, then slowly shift focus to Tuxedo_jack's monitor, which displays a battle in Sins of a Solar empire. We hear thunderously loud, bored clicking.Incompetent tech swallows hard.

Tuxedo_jack's eyes narrow. Hard lines appear on his face.

I do not suffer fools lightly, Isaac!

Incompetent Tech winces at the last word. Grimacing, Tuxedo_jack picks up his toolbox and stands up. He glares at Incompetent Tech's eyes and roughly pushes him aside. Camera turns to reveal Tuxedo_jack walking between cubicles into a bright light.

int. developer firm

A car pulls up to a dirty, crumbling building. Tuxedo_jack exits the car and looks up. Camera follows him, stopping a couple of times to note the varying states of decay adorning the building. Camera cuts to Tuxedo_jack entering a room. In the middle sits a frantic looking Head of IT, and beside him, a young Developer with a shit-eating grin on his face.

TUXEDO_JACK

Humor me.

Head of IT shakily points his finger at the blank screens on the desk. With a smirk, Tuxedo_jack reaches down and depresses a button. Instantly, the screens light up. From under the table, Tuxedo_jack notices the widening smile on Developer's face. However, the grin slacks off, and noticing the change in expression, Tuxedo_jack returns to his position in from of the screen, nudging Head of IT away.

TUXEDO_JACK

Oh, a BIOS password. Well. It's not as if I haven't seen these since I was in high school.

darkknights,"For years something like this happening has always bothered me...

So I strive to do things differently:

1) Multiple backups eg Amazon cloud, Crashplan, Local Backups, FTP, off site and hard copies to safe deposit box, all using different backup engines... Must have 5 different backup plans.

2) Bootable Images from acronis backup converted to VM every night (we keep 5 days) so that I can boot the VM up and have it running on my desktop if needed. This is stored locally to a networked workstation (must have gigabit network not 100mbps)

2) Two Man Rule, two other men (people) are given the passwords and backup plans... (incase I get hit by a bus) Also password and kept on a usb pen drive and printed in the safety deposit boxes, we screen the random password from lastpass password generator to make sure that they can be read if printed. eg I vs L vs 1

3) Written Documentation... This must be complete and updated anytime there is a change.

4) Never Ever Reuse Hard Drives on a server or important work station, I always buy new drives for formats, If there is ever an issue I just boot the old drives.  Drives being cheap(ist)...

5) Monthly test of all backup plans.

6) A good antivirus on all systems, gateway antivirus, easeus images of every computer 30 days after deployment. This way you can make sure the system is how the user likes it, then backup with roaming profiles (or folder redirection) and a backup agent on the local desktop. I always backup the entire user profile so c:\user\active user\ (eg c:\users\%username%\) and depending on the nature of the user (important vs not) backups run every 30 mins, 180 mins, or 24 hours. I like to ftp them to a ""backup"" server normally with 10+ tb of storage in a raid 10 then from there backup as listed in 1.

7) Backup times, I have some running every 30 mins and some once a day... Only go as long as you would be comfortable restoring to.

8) All servers have Raid 10, RAID IS NOT A BACKUP OF ANY KIND!

Always have insurance both the money kinda and the cya kind

2. partition recovery utility. if the data was on a dedicated drive and the dipshit just wiped the data. it can still be recovered. I just dealt with the same nightmare.

Mostly because that tech decided to blame US for the data loss and took credit for the recovery (we were subcontractors) I forget the name of the tool we used, but it's extremely effective. we got 99% recovery back, give or take a few corrupted files we were able to get from an older onsite backup. edit: [found it.](http://diydatarecovery.nl/) buy the license for irecover. It's been pretty accurate so far. Again, we recovered a financial firm with this after their tech specified their company data drive as a backup volume.

Grzld,"Don't get me started on our district. According to the heads if you connect a Mac to the network the entire thing will crash and take down everything for everyone. Our video and graphic design programs use them but are never allowed on the network for updates or school work related things.

 They even went as far as putting silicone glue into the ports at other schools to make sure teachers didn't try to bypass the rules as we've circumvented them before and they never knew until an unfortunate walk through. 

The entire irony of it is at the district offices every person there has an ipad for themselves, and those ipads are all on the network. Our video tech teacher gathered some letters from apple saying that ipads function the same as macs on the network level and forwarded them on to the district. I never heard the outcome but boy did he rustle some feathers with that one. 

We also switched our network filter this year from an allow everything block a few system to a block everything allow a few. They still haven't figured out how to configure it so its not blocking hotmail and yahoo, and wikipedia, and other government websites. The first 6 results on google are always blocked for research papers. I feel bad for the students who have to use school resources for such.

There whole reasons for the filter is so kids don't waste time (valid) and don't stumble into things that could scar them for life (porn/gore/ect). Now at a highschool level, kids arn't just going to stumble into porn, they know what they are getting into. I could understand at an elementary level that being valid (we have different filters for grade level), but really. Let the teachers discipline students and revoke computer access if its abused. Even the teachers can't get to certain things as its blocked for them which screwed up so many FUN lesson plans. Shouldn't the teachers know what they should and shouldn't be in. 

This all comes from the same people who had a ban on flash drives up until 6 years ago. Kids were still using floppy disks and had to split projects in half and save them on separate disks, when they were too big. Like long powerpoints with lots of images ect.

Are they saying that downloading software updates for your device is *not* one of the acceptable uses for the school's network?

Are they also going to block Windows' update servers as well, and the package servers for Linux distributions, and all the many servers that third-party apps might use to update themselves, whenever people want to update their software?

Because, if not, then what the flying goat cheese are they doing blocking one of the *intended and authorized* uses for the network?!

1. They will disable the virus scanner once it finds a virus and gets in their way for 10 seconds.
2. Of those 15 toolbars, they actually use 5 of them, and just for the google search part of the bar. They will call you yelling that google is gone
3. Internet Explorer = Fine. Install chrome/firefox/opera = you broke my computer it can't do internets now
4. Clients always burn dvd's/cd's with win7's built in burning capability. They never use a dedicated program, even when it is for crucial backups
5. Make sure no drivers/dvd's/discs are left anywhere near the client. One day when the printer is out of ink, they will find the driver disk and proceed to reinstall everything to fix it
6. File..Print. Nothing happens? Do it 10 more times, so when the queue unlocks it will print 400 pages.
7. Fax machine is not working, all the pages are blank!!!! the page is upside down.
8. 'I'm sick of typing my password every time I do this!' Check the fucking 'remember password' checkbox
9. KISS = Keep It Simple and Stupid, and my addition AAUIAM = Always Assume User is a Moron
10. Have automated secret backups everywhere, if I had a dollar for everytime someone tried to get me fired because they deleted something off of a server somewhere and were shocked that I couldn't just undelete it
11. Make system images of functionally complete systems for when user destroys it for no reason
12. Don't use proper legal software, use shareware versions of abandonware programs that havn't been updated in 2 years, that crash and use a proprietary file format that is now useless since said program is abandonware
13. GRRR Where is my email? I'm not getting any new mail!!! Sort by 'date recieved'
14. I don't know what your talking about! Are you accusing me of looking at porn? How dare you!! they dont seem to realize that I not only have access to the logs, but also the security cameras in every office..
15. Pretend to know absolutely nothing about tablets/laptops. Cause all you'll get are people bringing in their home shit for you to configure and fix
16. Speed = irrelevant. Got into a lengthy debate with a client on why if they are printing 400 page SVG documents with tonnes of objects that a USB2/3 hub would be required. Insisted that the USB1 hub is fine, and said I was impatient when I was annoyed at waiting 18 minutes for a document to spool. Was told 3 months later that he was angry at how slow it was, bought a $6000 HP printer, and gave up trying to make it faster when the new printer was just as slow.
17. The Desktop = A free black hole. Trying to explain that the icons and files on a desktop exist on a drive letter and are not a 'free storage area from microsoft online for having bought windows' (yes, an entire office of morons were all believing that)
18. VPN? No. Had a client who appeared to not be moron. Allowed him to tunnel to work from home. Get a call from a exec in the company that he came in the morning to find 30+ pages of porn in the printer tray. The guy who I gave the tunnel sent me a tech request saying that when he's connected to the VPN, he can't print. lols
19. Internet Radio = No. Its all fine and dandy when a couple odd people in the office tower are listening to internet radio. I get a call from a admin, telling me that the building's internet was slow as shit. I come in, find over 70mb/sec of extra shit coming in. Confirmed that a employee upstairs discovered internet radio, and emailed everyone on the URL to go to. That's how you kill a slower network.
20. Packet filter torrent/p2p shit. Nothing is more annoying than getting a DCMA complaint, and then the executive in the company yells at you for it having arrived, like having a paid technician means the technician should make illegal downloading 'a non issue' (as he said it)

We prevent problems and keep our users happy by doing three things - 1) Keeping IT responsive, 2) having functional and useful remote support by IT, and 3), having an account with temporary admin rights for emergencies so that staff with Admin rights never have to share their account information.  With a responsive IT department and remote support, end users are not stuck waiting on someone to come and address a UAC prompt, or install necessary software (Bomgar FTW).  It helps keep the staff happier and less aware of the reduced number of access rights they have.  The temp account also keeps upper management happy on the rare occasion that IT is not immediately available to assist because IT can enable the account and set a unique password on it for them, and then immediately disable it afterwards or schedule it to be disabled in AD.  This makes upper management feel like they have more access rights than everyone else and keeps them happy, and allows IT to never divulge the actual administrator password or be put in a position where they have to share their own account information under duress.",null,1,cd845b5,1pyhqu,TalesFromTechsupport,new,3

It's not a shock that you got called in dismissing him like that. At least pretend to be working on it.

PaintDrinkingPete,"I was waiting for the second part of this story to be that he had tried to jam a toner cartridge for the old printer into it, since it was bigger and obviously better.

Had something like this happened to me once...a user was working late, and the printer in his office ran out of toner (let's say it was yellow).  Since no one in IT would be available to replace it until the next morning, and getting up out of his chair to use one of the public office printers was apparently out of the question, he figured he'd just swap toners with the printer in the office next door.  

The first problem was that these printers were not the same model, but that aside what happened next still baffles me to this day... The user managed to open his printer and pull out the black cartridge (which was not the empty one anyway), then go to his neighbor's office, and swapped his cart out for the magenta cartridge in that printer. (I guess the color coded labels meant nothing to him).  When he gets back to his office, he notices that the cartridge won't fit in his printer, at which point he begins to suspect he's done something wrong...he attempts to undo what he's done, but when he jammed his cartridge into the other printer, it got stuck in there because it wasn't supposed to go there in the first place.

The next morning we come in to several emails about how he needed this fixed urgently because he was working on a very important project (Did I mention that he had access to a number of other office-wide printers?).  So we go over there and he's playing dumb...

""I see the yellow cart needs to be replaced, but where's the black cartridge?"" 

""I don't know, it must have been thrown out""  

Thown out?!?  OK, whatever, I go and get both a yellow and black cart and replace for him and everything seems fine.  It took a few hours before we got the call from the guy next door having printer problems and I was able to piece everything together.  The first user finally admitted to it, but of course had to comment, ""Well, if you guys made sure our printers worked, it wouldn't have been a problem!""

I cautiously open the door and see that the repeater, which was mounted near the bottom of a radio rack, is now about 2 feet under water. Needless to say, there were some really unhappy people that day.

One incident that comes to my mind was a franchise running multiple database instances on one server. When it was time for our software upgrade for them, not only did the upgrade fail (I can't recall why exactly but I remember it being very trivial and easy), the individual at the helm of this operation uninstalled one of the database instances, and...*and*...removed the MSSQL folder containing the databases after the initial uninstall due to him thinking ""they caused conflicts"". 

Pretty much blowhard blew away half of a franchise's data. 

When I asked him about it, not only did he fail to tell me that he uninstalled the instance (as he CLEARLY understood how to do that since it was just an instance gone, not the shared components for the other instances) but he began to blame us for his issue, to the point of demanding compensation. Once I figured out what had happened, and saw he lied to me, I told my supervisor letting him know this guy may ask us for compensation. He laughed at the idea, but knew he had to end up talking to him. 

Once I wrote up my notes, and cased the issue, the franchise's management got a hold of them per their request. They've called back since this issue, and we worked with another guy who was friendly, and was pretty sharp. Needless to say I don't think that other guy works there anymore.

Turns out, we fired the tech in charge of that office (and I took over managing 2 offices, wooo). We found he had just put a link to the .exe on the users shortcuts and was telling them to run that. That means, everytime they'd run it, he'd literally run over and type in his password (he like the hands on approach and avoided remoting in if he could) and we only got word when a user had to call the support line.

I had to cry a little, but he stuck with me to the very end. When I finally told him it worked, I asked him what he needed me to do next. He told me to start the program. I made some clicking noises, and said, ""ummm... is it supposed to turn my computer off?""

And finally, I drop the bomb on him. I tell him that ,my computer is windows 95. Turns out the program is not compatible with anything older than XP. There is nothing he can do. He spent four hours trying to sell me something that I clearly want to buy, but it turns out he can't sell it to me because he can't connect. He can't sell me, and he knows it.

We also have an app like this, uglyfied by too many textboxs added.

What disturbs me is that when you capture the main client RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes, it's like the Social security number, but was designed originally just to pay taxes in Mexico), it validates the format (4 letters, 8 numbers for the birthday, yymmdd, and some have three more chars to avoid duplicates).

But when you capture the people that shares control over the contract, the field is not validated.

Basically, the problem now, is that we are changing our DB to separate the part of clients from the contract (right now, if a client owns more than one constract, he must know each of one, check position in each of one and refer to them separatedly), so we can have a clients DB and contracts DB.

Well, right now we are behind the schedule because all the mess that the legal department created for not writing the correct value (and sometimes, they only entered '.     ' for that field, and other abominations) just because the field was not validating the format.

Currently, I live in another state, and can't go to visit my parents often.

Before moving, I bought a bluray player for my parents, and installed it in the living room tv for them, alongside their DVD player (the DVD player is multiregion, and the bluray not). When bluray was connected trough HDM, and DVD trough composite (old DVD).

My mother calls me one day asking for help, as they disconnected everything in order to clean the furniture of the haouse, but where unable to connect it again. There was image in the DVD player, but not audio, and bluray had video and audio.

I suspected the issue, and told her to check the composite cables to be plugged in the same line in the back of the TV (LG model). She told me my father said everything was connected ok.

Fast forward a couple of months later, I go to their house for a couple of days, and first thing when I arrive is check this (as I travel mainly in bus, I arrive at my parent's home around 6 am, traveling 7 hrs, all night.

When I look at the back of the tv, the issue was as I suspected.

Composite video cables in composite conectors, but the audio ones for composite went from the DVD player to the TV, only in the normal A/V conection. Tested changing the tv to A/V mode and just as expected, audio but no video.

corrected the conections and told my father to take note of how this was connected for the next time. His response: ""But the bluray really only uses one cable? When I used the Beta (player) it has to be at least three!!!"". I procced to explain the HDMI cable sending both audio and video.

* Make sure you purchase slightly more bitcoins than the required payment amount. If they want 10 BTC, make sure to buy 10.05 from an exchange.

It's obvious from the Bitcoin blockchain that some people have purchased from an exchange the exact amount of BTC asked for, and then sent just a bit too little BTC to the ransom address when the transaction fee was taken out. Who knows how picky the cryptolocker authors are.

This guys livelihood isn't affected by whatever amount she was paying him to help out on the side, that's why he can just split. You can bet her livelihood is directly attached to that data loss. There's a lot of different statistics out there, but [this one](http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/gartner-only-6-percent-companies-survive-longer-two-years-after-losing-data) says only 6% of businesses survive after a data loss. You get what you pay for.

It's a hodge-podge of crap and you will be unappreciated, plus the hours are long, but it's an interesting challenge, mostly because managing a heterogeneous environment held together with duct-tape and the tears of the frustrated can be pretty fun.

arnathor,"I've seen this before! Except on a business level scale. I used to work for an accountancy firm in Manchester here in the UK. We were dual site, the other office was in Liverpool (this s ssemi-relevant).

We had one tech guy, a great guy called Steve. He had a day off booked - I think it was his son's 2nd birthday or something. He lived in Liverpool. In the Manchester office, we're trying to log on to our systems but EVERYTHING is grinding to an absolute halt. We have no external connectivity, there seemed to be a ton of data being transferred but nobody could do anything, each laptop (we had individual laptops that we just plugged in on a daily basis - half the time we were out on site auditting anyway) was almost unusable, assuming that you were able to log in. Desktop stations used by the partners and managers were just dying on their feet. This was back in the XP days, around late 2006, early 2007.

Now, we were running the latest Windows Server, and we had server blades at both offices, looking at unified hard drives - both servers kept a copy of the hard drive and in the event one hard drive set up fails, the other site was supposed to seamlessly take over and resume (at least that's how it was explained to me).

Steve was called in from his day off - a good hour's drive from where he lived. He had tried to remote desktop in but at that time his broadband was flaky and couldn't logon. Since the problem was only affecting the Manchester office he decided to come on site. It's a credit to him that he survived a partner having a massive go at him for the ""network problems"" while turning up in his civvies and not even having had a chance to look at the network yet.

All the activity lights seemed to be locked on full, and the servers were running extra hot, fans sounding like they were running at full RPM.

Steve was unfazed apparently, although he did get worried when he was unable to actually log in and see what the issue was on the terminal in the server cupboard (it didn't really seem big enough to call a room).

So he ran around the office telling everyone (who were all pretty much unable to do their work anyway as they had no access to current working copied of the accounting job databases) to shut down their machines.

Everything was shutdown and there was still massive activity. He ended up restarting the server. When is came back up, massive activity again. By now, Steve is panicking.

And then... one of the tax girls had been at an appointment in the morning and came in late, didn't seem to realise that everybody was simultaneously flapping around and also doing nothing, sat down at her desk, took out her laptop and then wondered out loud why she couldn't find the end of the ethernet cable to plug into it.

Problem solved - the cable had obviously fallen back through the hole the previous night and a well-meaning cleaner, not realising what it was and obviously thinking that they had knocked it out, had plugged it back in to the spare socket on the dual ethernet plate in the wall.

Steve ceremonially unplugged the offending cable and ta-da! The network was almost instantly back to normal.

Cyfun06,"I was so excited to move into my dorm cause I'd never had proper broadband before.  I mostly gamed a lot, the occasional torrent.  One day, my internet just slowed to a crawl.  Like worse than dialup speeds. I complained to the student in charge of tech, he said he'd look into it, I never hear back. Check my friends' computers, they're fine.

I go through all the settings I can think of on my PC, don't see anything that could cause this.  One day, I'm messing around and happen to change my NIC's MAC address.

Bam! Speeds are fine again!  I'm happy. I go back to gaming and whatnot. A week later, it slows down again. So I change my MAC again, problem solved.

This goes on for like a month.  I've complained to the dorm tech several times but he never has an answer.  One day, I get called in to the IT department.  A lady starts chewing me out for using up 90% of the ENTIRE CAMPUS'S internet, and hacking their network to bypass bandwidth restrictions.

I respond excitedly, ""Oh cool! I've been having problems for weeks and didn't know who to talk to!  My connection keeps slowing down and nobody could tell me why, but I noticed that if I change my MAC the problem goes away!""

Once they realized I wasn't purposefully trying to cause problems, they calmed down a bit, but told me I have to not overuse my connection. I asked what qualifies as ""over-use."" They couldn't give me an answer. I pointed out that nowhere in the form I signed for the campus internet did it say there were any bandwidth restrictions or data caps. I even offered to pay out of pocket for more bandwidth, but they said they had no way to do that, and kept telling me to only use a reasonable amount.

So I told them the average DSL is around 100 k/s, so I'll just use that much if they can't give me an answer. They just scowled at me. I pointed out that they're essentially giving me a speeding ticket without posting and speed limit signs. Pretty good analogy imo, but they still wouldn't clarify anything.

FuckingAppleOfDoom,"this sounds exactly like my husband. he did desktop support for a call center [he doesn't have a degree but does absolutely insane, amazing things with computers, so this job was his foot in the door for the industry]. 

*every* purchase in the company, no matter if it was a $2 extension cord, had to be approved by the CEO. agents and staff running severely outdated computers/OSes, anyone and everyone could [and did] download whatever shit they felt like. piracy was rampant, and they were reported to the BSA at least once that i know of [by a disgruntled former phone drone]. they didn't even keep their backup generators maintained [which kind of defeats the purpose of having them]. desktop support pulled regular overnighters just to keep the place running.

husband worked there for 4 years at $24k before finally convincing them to let him go into development - for the same pay. he proceeded to save their asses multiple times [including when they promised a client something they had no idea how to deliver in order to get a contract]. they had no interest in giving raises or rewarding hard work. husband GTFOed and got offered a job by a software shop that specializes in oil &amp; gas [fuck yeah texas], never looked back. he's still in awe of how well this company treats their employees; he's kind of like an abused puppy.

best part? former company tried to keep him after he got the new job, but wouldn't match the offer, and now other people in the department have started to understand that there are better places to be. they've been having an IT exodus for about a year; almost everyone in the entire IT department has left.

f03nix,"&gt; I tried to connect through LAN on my laptop, but for some reason the router was connected to our campus internet, so it wasn't able to use the default IP. Since I liked my job too much to get into anything more grey-hat, I shot the ME an email asking for help on this endeavor

For future instances - You didn't need to do anything other than setting up manual IP (Hit and trial ? ... or listen to the packets on the interface to see the IP of the router). Not being able to use the default IP means DHCP failiure .... either your router was supposed to be on the same campus network with disabled DHCP, or it was supposed to use a different network entirely with DHCP setup for its own network and the two networks would connect to each other via the router.

&gt; DMZ (Apparently this is because he wouldn't be able to use the internet on his phone while connected to the WRT54G - a fair complaint, even though switching networks on my Nexus 4 takes about a second, although I don't know how long it takes on an iPhone.)

Umm, well if the router isn't setting up its own network (I assume it is there only to allow wireless connection to the campus n/w), DMZ is actually useless - since the router isn't technically doing any routing. Also, the soundboard is connected to the campus network so yes ... it's probably a bad idea that you're going about this way - the second approach is better IMO.

ufmace,"This reminds me of one time I actually found a good use of torrents within a company. One of our major pieces of internal software was meant to be installed with system images - installing it would format the hard drive and restore a standardized image with properly-configured Windows and the program with all required dependencies. Yes, this was a good idea and necessary for the situation.

The main downside to this is that the install is over 6GB, and thus a headache to copy over the network. Even worse, the department creating them was located in China, while my department was in the US. That means copying 6GB or so of files over a flaky overseas network link.

Getting it done at all pretty much required leaving an auto-resuming FTP client running on it overnight. Corruption seemed to be pretty common too, and since we were installing Windows and everything, it often resulted in the installed system being unusable. The only way around that was to checksum the files, and recopy them if they didn't match. That gets really annoying when it happens 2-3 times in a row.

It occurred to me that an internal torrent would be the perfect way to distribute these files. We would get automatic resuming, hashing and retransmission of small pieces of the file, and automatic local serving to anyone in our geographical area who needed their own copy.

Naturally, torrents were forbidden on our networks, for the usual reasons. I tried to persuade IT to allow it in our case - internal distribution of company files - but they were having none of it. Gave up and kept doing it the old way.",null,6,cdai4ia,1q8xr2,TalesFromTechsupport,new,32

Scheckschy,"This is partly a fault of the OP. I'm a trainer and support person and have been for many years.

Sometimes you have to take an extra minute to help them conceptualize the situation.

Here's what should have happened:

OP: Good afternoon, IT Service Desk...
Lady: Hello, yes, the wifi doesn't work on my laptop and this is very inconvenient.
OP: OK, which one are you connecting to?
Lady: What do you mean?
OP: What's the name of the network you're connecting to?
Lady: NameOfCompany. But it doesn't work. Sometimes it works after five but never during the day.
OP: Right. So it only works in the evenings?
Lady: Yes, after five, before that it doesn't work.
OP: I understand that you have a problem, but I want to take some time to make sure that we are on the same page. Now, we have three WiFis here at work. Imagine that those are bathrooms. Typically you will use one bathroom at work; the one that is generally closest to your desk.

OP: Now when you go home, you will use your home bathroom, not a bathroom at work, because they're too far away.

OP: It's very possible that, at work, the bathroom that you typically use may be 'Out of Order'. You can't use it. When you go home though, your home bathroom stills works fine.

OP: I think that what's happening is that your computer is seeing the nearest WiFi as being 'Out-of-Order' and can't connect to it. But when you go home, your computer works fine on your network (the closest bathroom). We have to look at your computer to figure out why it's not seeing that there is a WiFi node (bathroom) here at work that it can use. When you're hard-wired into the network, that's like putting a bathroom at your desk, so your only issue is the wireless.

Users have to open a ticket because they don't know what's going on. It's not their job to know what's going on, they just want to work. They probably have more knowledge and are more dexterous about HR, Quality, Production, Payroll or whatever realm it is they dwell in, and they know more about that niche than you do. Chances are that you depend on what they do, to an extent.

As tech support, it's sometimes hard to find gratification in what you do. However, you can make the difference. You can have something simple where you RDT into someone's system and change a check box. But many times, you there is something more difficult.

'Teach a man to fish', and four things will generally happen:

  * The user will appreciate the fact that you took time to explain a situation and give them a modicum of understanding.

  * They will impart that understanding to others in their group, thereby decreasing the amount of HELP Desk tickets.

  * They will personalize to you as an individual that doesn't just fix a problem, but makes a difference.

  * Your name will come up many times in a positive aspect within the company.

Anyone can shuffle a ticket into obscurity. It takes someone a bit different to impart knowledge.",null,97,cdaszou,1q9ziv,TalesFromTechsupport,new,37

FarmClicklots,"Okay, the formatting is a little messed up, but the header means the private key is encrypted with [triple-DES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES) in [cipher block chaining mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29), using the [IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector) given at the top (228F etc). The keyspace for breaking the cipher directly is 168 bits -- EDE3 here means they use different 56-bit keys for each round of DES. DES alone has a few minor weaknesses that cut the keyspace down by a couple bits, but triple-DES mode makes those less useful. Breaking it directly isn't going to work.

The base64 data below that presumably contains the RSA private exponent; maybe the (public) modulus too, or just the factorization of the modulus since you can derive everything from that. It's a little less than 5000 bits long, so there's probably a checksum or something to verify that the password decrypted it properly, and some extra padding or formatting or something. I bet it's a 2048-bit RSA key (the other likely possibility is 4096), so again breaking that directly is out of the question.

Breaking this starting from nothing will probably mean looking at OpenSSH source code to figure the format out first, but there's probably a utility out there already that can handle the format.

halftomato,"For what it's worth, it looks like the Carbonite backup tool is either hashing or padding the Encryption Key Password (the password you type in the Carbonite GUI when you choose to manage your own key) before it is used to encrypt the RSA private key.  

You can verify this yourself if you have OpenSSL installed:

Install Carbonite on a test machine, choose to manage your own key and specify an Encryption Key Password (eg 1234567890) and save the file when prompted

Now try and decrypt the RSA key using the Encryption Key Password you just specified. It bombs out as if you typed it wrong:

    # openssl rsa -passin pass:1234567890 -in carbonite-encryption-key_passwordis1234567890.pem -out /dev/null

Interestingly, even if you don't enter a password at install time the RSA key still appears to be 3DES encrypted. (You *have* tried following Carbonite's restore procedure as if the IT guy never entered a password, right?)

All this means that a dictionary attack based on what the IT guy might have typed into the Carbonite GUI is unlikely to yield results unless we know how to convert our password guesses (eg L33Tpassw0rd123) into the actual passphrase that the Carbonite tool would have used to encrypt the private key if that password had been entered.

If someone had access to an LSF cluster with upwards of 15000 cores, what would the process be for something like this and what sort of time frame would we be talking about for brute forcing the key?

I'm a sys admin for a large data centre, although I look after storage rather than HPC.

Again, the chances of me being able to grab cluster time for this are pretty much zero.  I certainly do not want to be getting anyones hopes up with my post, just interested to know more.",null,2,cdb7gnx,1qb7xk,TalesFromTechsupport,new,8

Those owners are also directly responsible for paying you; you piss them off, and your revenue is directly affected. You will not succeed as a vet without people skills and patience. Oh, and if you're in the US, vet school is harder to get into that medical school, and since your undergrad degree (you have one, right?) likely didn't include the pre-req's for it, it's gonna take 4-6 years to complete. I know many former vet students who went to medical school because it was easier. Not trying to ruin your dreams, but most people who want to be vets because they ""like animals"" need a reality check.

THE_ANGRY_CATHOLIC,"I feel where you're coming from. I was an IT for a med sized business that was **hung up** on old software. We still used WindowsXP, Office 2003 and IE7. We did all this because the owner prohibited the IT dept from updating anything that wasn't absolutely necessary (he hated making adjustments and assumed that once something was in place, updated wouldn't ever be necessary with proper maintenance.  Fast forward to earlier this year, I'm debugging some part of our website and trying to wrangle it to make the damn thing work with IE7 when I get a phone call from the owner. He just bought a new dell and wanted it downgraded from Windows 8 to Windows XP. Upon telling me his wishes I told him I would attempt a downgrade but promised nothing. Ofcouse you see where this is going, the downgrade didn't go well, XP (surprisingly) wouldn't even boot (and even if it could I doubt it would be usable without drivers). Restore Windows 8 on the laptop and return it to the owner. 

I then proceed to be chewed out for being an incompetent IT and told that my pay would be cut because I obviously didn't know how to do my job. 

I quit on the spot. 

No working as a swim coach making less than I did at my previous job but much happier. I intend to go back into the tech industry but doubt I will go back to systems administration, probably web design. 

Me and my former co-workers still email back and forth, me sharing my non-eventful job as a coach and them sharing their frustrations with dealing with the network. Last we talked the boss intended to stick with Windows XP even after it went out of support. 

And to put the icing on the cake. The IT department ran an audit and found that all their internal applications ran perfectly with Windows 7/8 and IE 9/10.

I will point out however that if you are in a situation like this YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.  As an IT Director for a medical company, I have worked every rung of the ladder on my way to the top.  Sure, IT can be stressful, and some companies don't give a damn about their employees, but an intelligent person will simply avoid those situations and look elsewhere.  

In the end, IT is completely what you make of it.  Some people go into consulting, some run their own IT business, others work for corporations, some do contracts, sometimes there are teams, sometimes it is just one IT guy flying solo - there is an astounding amount of variety.  Not only that, but the barrier to entry is low, and the compensation is well above the US national average.

You need to follow your dreams of course, but be warned that your dislike of this field may have less to do with the field itself, and more to do with how you approach and handle situations.  You may very well face the same, or similar challenges once you are a vet, and find that everything that you disliked has come back for you to face again.

itssilvernotgray,"Here are a few incidents I remember from the sugar glider woman:

A client that had just left had dropped a HUMAN TOOTH in a plastic bag in the floor.  I found it just as the CL walked in.  She immediately claimed that it was from an elderly black woman that had lived in the house (back when I worked from home) before and that her name was Maude or something and she liked me and was watching over me and that I should protect the tooth to show Maude respect.

She called me and asked if I knew how to take a house speaker apart because her sugar glider had went inside and wouldn't come out.

She gave another client of mine a checkup like you would give a horse.  She looked in his mouth, smelled his breath, felt his butt, checked his ear and nose hair - wound up with his phone number he told me.  I found out later that she followed him all the way to his car and kissed him.

EVERY SINGLE TIME she comes in she pulls up her shirt and shows me her stomach and back, asking my opinion if she has a good figure for a woman 54 years old.  She has partially disrobed several times to show me surgery scars, and physical deformities from a detached bladder.

She routinely carries around sugar gliders in her bra, and will put their feet in her mouth.  She sucked on ones foot once and it made an angry growling sound and burrowed back in her shirt.

Her boyfriend beat her with a cat once and threw the cat in a dumpster.

The ghost of her father pushed her down the stairs.

Her daughter has run away about a million times.  I can't figure out why.

She got fired from walmart as a cashier for sexually assaulting fellow employees.  She was set up, she says.

She told me I was 'dateable'.  I reminded her that I was married.

I was at the tattoo shop once, getting my 11th one and the guy there (a client of mine) showed me a horrid tattoo someone had drawn that he refused to do because it was so bad.  A few weeks later she comes in my shop showing me THAT EXACT tattoo saying that the first guy she went to was an ass &amp; wouldn't do it.

I bought a fully functioning laptop from her for $5.00 so she could get some gas money to go get a piercing.

She traded me a $400 video camera for fixing her laptop, the bill would have been ~40.00

I can see everything being transmitted between your database site and the customer (assuming the customer doesn't use other measures).

just_commenting,"I've actually repaired power jacks with superglue before, under certain circumstances.  If it's a normal barrel plug, then frequently the jack housing will be broken rather than the jack's electrical connections to the motherboard.  Since the jack housing typically forces a contact against the outside of the barrel plug, a broken housing results in poor or no contact.  If the housing is mostly intact, you can press it back into place and superglue it back together.  You definitely don't need much glue, though, and if you're using enough that it slops onto the circuit board, you should probably just replace the entire jack.

If you need to remove superglue (normal cyanoacrylate superglue, not specialty epoxies), acetone usually works pretty well.  Be careful and use it with a swab, though, as acetone may remove labels / stencils from the circuit components.  I'd use rubbing alcohol afterwards to remove the acetone residue.",null,0,cddnk7q,1qjb3b,TalesFromTechsupport,new,1

area88guy,"Second piece of evidence is the aforementioned document that HR requests, but does not require, dating coworkers to sign. I pointed out that it was signed voluntarily by both myself and Heavylegs. It shows the steps we went through to make sure that the proper people knew of the relationship. Again, this was signed and dated by myself and Heavylegs, our bosses, and the Director of HR signed approval.

Third and final piece of evidence was the logs from the morning's file issues, including several dozen requests by the UID of Anna, from the PC she used, linked and timestamped alongside camera stills of when she arrived and went into her department.

As I finish outlining this last piece, the door opens. It is Awesome Boss, and he is absolutely furious. A cup of Starbucks is thrust at me, which I hand to Heavylegs. My rage is met with satisfaction when I see the person standing behind AB.

The CEO of FirstAid at this time was a fellow named Nick. Nick was about five foot tall, maybe 110 pounds in a downpour, but he must have taken a few levels in Antipaladin, because he could put up an Aura of *Fuck You* at the drop of a hat. Everyone rose when Nick came into the room, and I turned to dab at Heavylegs with my handkerchief when he nodded and winked at me.

**Heavylegs**: 88, what did you do?

**88**: No one fucks with my lady.

This whispered bit was then overshadowed by Nick's voice. He demanded to know why so many protocols had been overridden and subverted, why all of the necessary documentation had been ignored, and why someone had reached several critical levels of the file system unchecked. I pushed forward my documentation, pointed out that L3 had done a bit of sabotage that was now completely repaired, and indicated that Anna had made these ""intuitive"" leaps herself at the tail end of our repairs.

**Nick**: I see. 88, Heavylegs, I apologize for your time being wasted on this. Heavylegs, please take the rest of the day off as compensation for being placed in this situation. 88, please see her to her car, and then we'll talk in AB's office.

**88**: With pleasure, sir.

I took her to her car, helped her calm down more, and (REDACTED). When I returned, AB flagged me down and took me to his office, where Nick sat. I took a seat and we discussed the matter. I was then given a substantial gift card as an apology from the company, and asked if I wanted to see any corrective action taken against Anna or DHR for the morning's drama.

**88**: Nick, it occurs to me that we have a list for just such an occasion! When someone abuses our good graces. I think this qualifies. I can't speak for what should happen to DHR, that's your field, but if Anna isn't being fired, I formally request that she be blacklisted.

**Nick**: Done. Take the rest of the day, 88, and accept my apologies on behalf of FirstAid. Maybe see to that lady of yours, she seems like quite a catch.

**88**: She is, Nick. But... I can work today. If I didn't have a thick skin, I wouldn't be in IT. 

**AB**: 88, it's alright. Matcha is helping us with cleaning up, and I'm heading out myself. Take the day. We both need it after the evening.

Hands were shaken and I departed, following Heavylegs home. This would, sadly, not be the end of things, as I had now managed to piss off the Director of HR as well as a department head. GP even sent me an audio log of Anna being read the riot act, as well as being blacklisted personally by Nick.

There really needs to be a discussion with IT management about confirming with other hospital management when an issue, *even one with an electronic piece of equipment*, is the local department's responsibility and not the IT department's. It's not even the IT department's job to train users; it's up to their own bosses to make sure they know how to use the equipment they've been issued. The most the IT department should be getting involved is to store and supply (and *possibly* create, as a once-off) training documentation/manuals for the use of said bosses (and any training department).

Learning how to change/replace consumables periodically is part of learning how to use standard hospital equipment as supplied by the employer. It is not the function of the IT service department, which is (generally) limited to repairing broken equipment and performing once-off reconfigurations on working equipment.

Users who don't know how to use their equipment, or who deliberately fail to provide sufficient information, should not have their equipment 'fixed' by IT *even if an IT person goes out and troubleshoots it*, but be referred to their boss. The boss (*not* the user) can then contact IT management if they feel the user had a valid complaint.

At the core of it, it's not so much a user problem as an expectations problem. There's got to be a communications channel which identifies that a user has the wrong idea of what is their responsibility and what isn't, and acts quickly to fix that before the idea spreads to other users.",null,7,cddtiok,1qkf2s,TalesFromTechsupport,new,36

SrPepeSilvia,"""I did something on the server"" is such a powerful line.  No one can have any follow up questions because ""server"" might as well be ""magic, rocket science box"" to most people.  I use this line all the time when I know the user is 1) indignant and 2) definitely doing something wrong.  There is one problem with it though.  When I invariably find out what THEY are doing wrong, its awkward to point it out because I've already said ""I did something on the server"".  So now it's like ""Hey, wait a minute, it looks like xyz is not working because you are entering the wrong dates"" and then I am at this cringe worthy point where I try to bridge the server lie with the ""you're a idiot"" truth. ""We'll, maybe the changes I made on the back end modified the dates, so that's why you were entering them in like a moron"".  It never makes any sense, but the user won't tell you that it doesn't make any sense because 1) it may make ""perfect sense"" to them or 2) they know they fucked up and they don't want to let you know that they know in case you actually believe the nonsense that was just said.

Pavix,"This is not TFTS related, but it's related to your story. I moved into the house I'm currently living at back in January. The guy who owns the house has owned it for probably 5-7 years at least. In that time he has never replaced batteries in any of the smoke detectors, or so he says. 


As guys, we cook(read: overcook) things and cause smoke which annoys the smoke alarm and it starts blaring. We do the typical caveman guy thing and pull down the smoke alarm and pull the battery and go back to our meal. About 3-4 months ago we started to hear a chirp. It's infrequent but constant. We ignored it for several weeks until it was too annoying. At first we thought that it was one of the other roommates playing with an annoy-a-tron. But we all pleaded innocent under fear of being tar and feathered, then evicted. 


So we set about finding it to make the chirping stop. We tried replacing the batteries in our digital thermostat and even went so far as to pull the batteries for 24 hours. But the chirp persisted. Since I work third shift I went into my roommates rooms and searched their ceilings and closets for any rogue smoke alarms. I found 1 that had no electrical wiring to the house and no batteries...no matter, this was war and not a time for common sense so I pulled it down.


I checked the basement....AHA! There's a relatively new smoke alarm. So I pull it down, pull out the batteries. As it's sitting on the kitchen counter and I'm walking to my bedroom it mocked me, the chirp was still happening. So defeated I returned the new smoke detector back to the basement and scour the rest of the basement...No joy.


Now here's where it's strange, the chirping has lasted at least 4 months, maybe longer. From what I've read the chirping should stop after a month or 2 tops. Alas, the only place it can be that we havent checked is the attic. The owner of the house is afraid of Kabuki monsters, my other roommate is afraid of going up there and seeing severed corpses of racoons and squirrels with a big knife sticking out of a 2x4, and me? I just don't like spiders. 


It's still happening....*chirp*",null,26,cde585y,1qm11a,TalesFromTechsupport,new,120

So I send a field tech out. Sure enough, 10:35, it starts beeping. Tech can't find the source. So, I go out the next day to see what's up. 10:35am hits, beeping starts, and I instantly recognize it as the alarm on cheap digital watches. I ask the user if there's a watch or stopwatch or something similar on her desk, which is a disaster area. She says no.

A little background: My school managed it's own system, and had fair independence form the main institute it belonged (In Mexico), the IPN (Instituto Politecnico Nacional). But eround my second year, the main institute wanted to retire that independence, and obligued the school to use the main system. This had an ""import"" option from excel.

The school changed the system, and they said they imported all the grade data. But many students had changed grades (in Mexico, we use the 0 to 10 grades, instead the alphabetic ones). Then the school told the students to go and find their grades and go to the students office and tell them to change the correct ones.

Many students didn't remembered their grades (grades for 2 years before, 1 year before). I went telling them I had 8 in algebra.

User: You already know what went gronw with the software?

I: I can tell you the software did what you told it to do, as designed

It is therefore unforgivable that a ridiculously common interface standard such as Flash (regardless of its utility or its grim future) is not embedded in a modern OS and updated/patched automatically. This poor dummy of a customer fell prey to bad boardroom decision-making. His Windows PC should ship with Flash plug-in's. Ity should ship with a media player that supports MP4 and FLV. It doesn't. Why? Licensing fees and competitive bullshit.

Smith6612,"DSL user here. I absolutely hate those automated line checks that can also mess with your provisioning automatically. My ISP uses a very similar system, and although your speed won't be turned down if your modem is not actually on, your speed can get turned down for no reason at all, or because the provider won't fix their lines properly (or just run Fiber and get it all over with &gt;.&gt; ). The automated line ""optimization"" system will set speeds as low as 300kbps/60kbps, which by definition isn't even broadband in this country.

In the case of my circuit, I had the automated line checks disabled and blocked from my circuit as they were breaking many things with my connection. I have a 15Mbps/1Mbps DSL circuit on a solid line, and I can get a little more than that day and night thanks to over-provisioning. The automated line checks kept trying to apply an Interleaved profile to my circuit (it sets this on all lines by default. No non-Interleaved for anyone!), which takes latency to the ISP BRAS from 4ms to something between 20-40ms. Second, each time it would run, it'd find something wrong with my line, and it would go ahead and botch up my provisioning. The way the provisioning broke, can be best described as what happens when you create a duplex mismatch between a 10Mbps Ethernet link and a 100Mbps Ethernet link, and you add bursting from the 100Mbps circuit to the 10Mbps circuit, using UDP data, and your 10Mbps link happens to be on an extremely old Ethernet hub with other duplex mismatches. In my case, it is a very old ADSL2+ DSLAM that needs special love to work.

I'll let this picture do the rest of the talking. 15Mbps trying to do a download with a provisioning mess-up on a very, very good day... http://imgur.com/cQAo3dl .

So yeah, in short, I had to backdoor my way into getting support from someone deep in network operations (no customer should have to dig their way into support) because no one in the ISP's chain of support could figure out how to fix the problem, even though I told them what the problem was and how to fix it :). The awesome guy in network operations not only blocked those automated line tests for good, but ensured my provisioning was fixed permanently. He admitted too, that there were less problems back when provisioning was done manually. ",null,0,cdg4u8e,1qonc9,TalesFromTechsupport,new,1

the_real_mentaloid,"CAT6 cable does come in 25 pair form (6x4=24, leaving one spare pair). I use it all the time between risers or between racks. It works great, and I've ever had an issue. This of course is assuming they used CAT6, not the more common CAT3 that telco's generally use. 

Of course they still should have checked and verified requirements before making changes! 

I have to wonder at the choice of switches however, SMC has never been a good performer IMHO. The back plane gets saturated fairly quickly in these devices, but they work adequately under average loads I suppose. A single SG200-50 would do the work of both switches and give you trunk/vlan support.

 It is hard to tell from this photo.

dwitman,"Came here to rage that a cat 6 25 pair cable would do the trick, but as that's covered...

- Never expect a telco to preform like a structured cabling shop. They simply do not know what they are doing when it comes to inside wire, and they also have an institutional culture of lazy techs...which grew out of being the only game in town for so long. 

- Make sure your patch panels are rated for cat 6 as well. I can't tell by looking at the picture what they are rated for, but I do not recognize them, so they are probably some off brand. 

- When you do have a real cable house come and fix this they should be able to provide a lifetime warranty. If they can't, or are taken back by the question I would look elsewhere. Any cable house worth it's salt has vendor trained techs with certs who follow good practices, stick to proper product lines, and can provide a lifetime warranty. (If inside wiring is done right once it should never have to be done again baring some huge unexpected change in technology or a new tenant.)

- They should also give test results for each port on the panel from a Fluke DTX 1800. This is what allows for the warranty. 

I've been in structured cable since 1999 or so, and the number of shops with lazy and or incompetent techs is pretty staggering...but the phone company going with the cheapest solution possible really is not. Analog phone, especially once you are inside the building, just needs copper pairs, and that is all they are used to dealing with. No twists, no heavy gauge copper, no real bend radius concerns...Conversely, any 2nd year structured tech worth a damn would have told you to go with at least a cat 5e 25 pair and patch panels to match.

We tried a couple times, put in a different OS installation disc before, after, even opened it up to see if there were any damages to cables,but nothing worked. Now of course we had looked at the back to check the plugs etc. and in one of the expansion slots there was (what turned out to be) an extra VGA port, but it had a red cap on it, so I ignored it. After an hour or so trying everything we could come up with and some options in the instructions, I tried the extra port anyway, and it worked!

willhughes,"The first computer I built from scratch was based on a Cyrix 6x86 PR 133+. I think 8MB ram. 

Spoke with a friend who'd built tons of computers about how to do it all, studied my existing PC (store bought Acer 486 DX/4 100), and consulted magazines on all the best bits of hardware.  Then with my saved up money, put the order in. A week or so later, everything arrives and I set about carefully assembling everything. 

The soundcard and video card don't sit quite so securely, but oh well - it was a cheap case. Plug the last lot of cables in, re-check everything twice. Plug in the power, press the power button.... nothing. Hm.  Re-check the cables, yep, all seated.  
Call my friend up, he says check a bunch of things, take out things, etc.  Still no go.  So, he asks me to bring it around, which involves an hour or so drive (I was too young to have a licence back then, so Mum was roped in). 

Friend opens it up, can't see anything obvious, applies power... nope, still nothing.  Calls his dad over to have a look... looks in, and starts pissing himself laughing.  

So, when I studied and disassembled my old PC one important thing the store-bought PC didn't have was a metal case. This is important because it also meant they didn't have stand-offs. So when I screwed the motherboard into the case, I just screwed it directly in. No stand-offs. This explained the ill-fitting sound/graphics cards, and why nothing would power on - everything on the board was shorting out, luckily the power supply protected itself and the motherboard. 

He also pointed out that I should've installed the back-plate mask for the motherboard into the case... which would've given me more of a clue that something was wrong. ",null,1,cdfmwe2,1qpexq,TalesFromTechsupport,new,3

2: Set up a documentation system!
 Integrating it with a ""customer database"" is great, but even if the two are separate systems, it's better than nothing.

3: Do something for ""systems documentation""

I'm partial to the free product ""RackTables,"" because I can type in an ip, label, asset tag or whatever, and get a page with info about the system, a diagram of where it is in a rack, los of changes made to out, a photo, and any notes.


I wish I had done all three of these when I first started. Oh well!

If you spill liquids on your laptop then fucking scramble as fast as humanly possible to get the battery out. Don't bother trying to do an orderly shutdown, just rip that mofo out of the laptop as fast as you can. Then, put the thing next to a fan or something (in college I had an AC unit that blew up so I just put the laptop face-down over that during my liquid spill situation) and don't try to boot the computer for ~three days. With luck, you will get away with just shorting out the keyboard backlight if your laptop has that. This was my experience--the keyboard backlight never worked properly again but all things considered I was pretty fucking lucky considering I spilled pretty much an entire bottle of stout (beer) all over my (summer 2006 model) Macbook Pro keyboard.

thagrandcow,"Back when I was in the military, one of the systems the comms guys used went down with some pretty important info on the drive.  It was a small unit and nobody had ever set up any kinds of backups.  He tried everything he could think of but couldn't get the drive working again.  On a whim I told him about the freezer trick and after he stopped thinking I was just messing with him, he pulled the drive and stuck it in a ziplock in the freezer.

Obviously, the freezer trick is a last resort, don't do it ever unless you're convinced the drive is seriously dead and you're not going to spend the big $$$ getting it to a data recovery shop.

The HD spent all night in the freezer, and the next morning was ready to be booted.  The only downside was the unit commander was the first one into the freezer that morning and saw the drive sitting there.  He was not happy to have people sticking electronics randomly in places where they shouldn't be.  Pretty sure even after explaining it to him, he still didn't believe the comms guy, but he also didn't toss the drive.  

20 minutes later, the drive is in a different computer hooked up as a slave, the computer boots, and like magic, the drive is readable (for a few minutes).  After pulling the data, the comms guy drove to my house to thank me personally, since I was just a reservist and had finished my drill weekend the day before.

Still when one went down just as Tuesday's blizzard was just getting started, she called that company in a tizzy and they actually sent a guy out.  Then, as he's fixing her spare-toilet, his van's getting snowed in in the middle of the street.  

He finishes, gets outside, and realizes that his van is stuck in the middle of a snow-drift.  She won't give him a shovel, and he doesn't have one in his van.  He's trying to get the snow off with his hands, which is totally ineffective.  My next door neighbor sees what's going on, and he rounds up a couple of folks to go out and see if they can get this guy out of there. The woman who started it all isn't one of them.

Eventually, they convince him to call a friend because the roads are shutting down, and he needs to get going.  He hands over the keys to his van and books it to the main road on foot so he can meet that friend.

The next day, we're all out trying to shovel the street (we didn't see a plow for a week and a half), and this woman walks by and is all ""I can't believe that plumber left his van here.  What a dick!"" before heading into her house.

I -- who had been asleep during the van-rescue but had heard the whole story from my sister the next morning -- turn to the rest of the group and go, ""Actually, the dick move was to call some poor bastard out in the middle of a snowstorm to begin with.  Who was that, anyway?""

His laptop wouldn't boot and needed to be re-imaged, but first I booted with a Live Linux CD and backed up all the personal files on it to a USB drive (because that's the kind of top-level service I provide!).  

So a few hours later he comes back to the office asking if his laptop is ready, and explain that I just finished setting it up and I was restoring his data, but that it may take a while because there seemed to be a lot.  He was watching over my shoulder as I was browsing through the directories and copy/pasting them over, and he says, ""Oh, no...that's OK, I can just take it as is..."" (strange, I thought, most people flip out at the idea of losing their files), but then I went to the ""My Pictures"" folder and wow, do I wish I hadn't been on thumbnail view.  I quickly backed out of the folder, but it was too late to unsee what I had seen.  Luckily the guy had had stepped away for a second and didn't know that I had found his stash of selfies.  I just told him it would be a few more minutes and I'd bring his computer over to him.

I expect you to be able to READ, LOOK, CLICK, TALK, and most importantly LISTEN TO ME because if you ""knew computers"" you wouldn't be calling me to walk you through how to save a word doc. Instead, I'm having to use you as a remote console to be able to decide for you what action needs to be taken because you are incapable of thinking independently.

It'd be different if a user would call the IT desk and say ""I need help with my Internet connection. I can't connect to any websites and I've checked my connection. My IP is blah.blah and I'm using ManufacturerName router"" as opposed to ""I can't connect to the Internet WAAHHH!!!  This is all your fault! WAAHHHH!!!""....

Instead, I've learned that ""I'm bad at computers"" means ""I don't give a fuck about fixing it, I want it done for me all the time because you are my bitch"".

And we then buy a $189 SOHO printer for the printing needs of 40-50 people.  That SOHO printer then requires an HP JetDirect Card to become networked.  So the bargain $200 printer, just shot to $300+.  The printer is then asked to receive a print volume WAY WAY beyond its specs.  So it breaks frequently, and the lost worker production hours and techs fixing it easily exceeds 100 hours per year.

But this never changes because those hours don't show up on the books.  This is just one of the many examples of large enterprise waste...",null,6,cdiwzu8,1r22gy,TalesFromTechsupport,new,31

EvilTech5150,"lol. I remember years ago, they had an AS/400 dbase system at this tech company that went back to the 80s. In general it wasn't much of a problem, but since it was ancient, it had no idea what a ""local"" printer was due to layers of emulation. 

So I'm in a satellite office 20 miles away from the main office, and if you hit the shift-meta key combo instead of the ctrl-metakey combo, it would error out, and lock your terminal window. 

As it turned out, 20 miles away it was cranking out this customer's entire history, every interaction with the company, and dumping it in some random geek's paper tray, and wasting up to 40-50 pages. 

So, the AS/400 guy doesn't know what's going on, but he can change the printer so it spits out in the satellite office. Problem solved, sort of, 
a few more random errors, more head scratching as, in theory, my access level doesn't allow me to do any of these functions. 

Eventually, I'm doing something, and it locks up again, so I point it out 
to the supervisor, and he's like, ""Oh, that's weird, do that again!"". Three more times, and some geek clomps into our section and asks why is his printer spitting out all this info.

By the way, how long ago was this? Nowadays NMR instruments are shielded so that the magnetic field does not extend more than a half-inch past the sample chamber. This should only have occurred if the shielding failed. (One of my friends who does all her research on NMR broke her ankle and had to get steel plates. She checked very, very carefully that all the instruments she would be working with were shielded). 

Although now my boyfriend informs me that the shield may not be up during the installation process, so maybe that's what happened.

That said, one of the biggest fears is that something would cause the NMR to quench, especially since the one I used in undergrad was stuffed into a closet. Rapidly filling a small space with a bunch of helium and nitrogen (a shell of liquid nitrogen is used to help keep cool the helium that is used to cool the coils, how cool is that?) is not advised.

Now I'm going to be pedantic.

Called the serial number into the police department and nothing came up, but how many people actually take the time to record their serial numbers? The situation was still bothering me and a local officer dropped by to talk to me about it. While there, I was trying to figure out how to get into the PC without removing the password-looking back, I don't know why I just didn't wipe it out and make things easier. I think I ended up booting some Linux distro, probably PuppyLinux and browsing the documents to find anything with identifiable information. I found something labeled resume, but couldn't open it in Linux. I don't remember exactly how I proceeded, but I think just to make things go quicker, I copied the resume to a flash drive and opened it on my Window's PC. Ended up finding the contact information that local officer called and verified that it was stolen from a town about 30 minutes away. The officer had me contact the girl and have her come in to pick it up and delay when she got there while he showed up. Not sure what the girl and boyfriend (who was the one who supposedly bought the laptop) was charged with, but I never heard anything else about it after the officer left with the laptop and girl in cuffs.

What gets me the most was the officer that came out also did some computer repair on the side and was amazed that I could get past a Windows password in the first place or get files off without knowing the password.

place, except there were no outlets.  It was one of those apartment
buildings that used to be a large house from the early 1900s and was
carved into a bunch of apartments.  The landlord had helpfully run
ungrounded extension cables along the baseboard and attached power
strips (with the 3-prong ungrounded adapter attached) to the baseboard
in each room.  In most cases, the power strip and extension cable had
each had a couple layers of paint on them. 

It was a beautiful apartment, I wish I could have taken it, but I just
didn't trust the cabling.  The landlord couldn't understand why I

johnska7,"I feel your pain, but don't feel bad about exploding. I worked technology in a school district for a number of years and every meeting we had with our high school staff wound up with one of us techs (usually me) arguing with one of our ""business and technology"" teachers (usually the same one) and it was very similar to your story. 

They always either needed something brand new every time we talked to them, ostensibly because the last thing they had to have (last month) that would solve all of their problems, didn't. And they never gave us enough time to try and work through the problems. 

One time they decided to skirt our buying procedure and purchase video cameras for a business class... why does a business class need cameras, you ask? Silly question! How else are they supposed to make presentations? They don't present in person in the business world, they make videos and show them! So they went and purchased some Sony cameras that only wrote to DVD. And then yelled at us when they couldn't just grab the footage onto their PCs and edit the videos. You had to write it to the DVD and then rip it, then edit, which (at the time) would take a few hours. But if they had talked to us first and let us do the research, we could have avoided that. This is one of the many things that ended in a shouting match.

The bottom line is always the same, though. Techs are hired for their knowledge and experience, but because someone read something online somewhere, they are immediately more qualified to make purchasing and setup decisions. They practically goad us into exploding because of the lack of respect... of course, it's not all of them, but the ones who do it are always the loudest. I always wondered how some of the teachers I had to deal with would react if I jumped into one of their department meetings and said something like ""We need to switch to the Crackenstein method of teaching! Just stop teaching the lesson plans you've worked on crafting for all of these years and just start doing this new thing in mid-stream.... and next week I'll have even better ideas for you to implement on the turn of a dime!""

In the end, I found the issue, and told my boss. We both went to see the user and give him the answer:

He changed the default limit of max buy price from 1% to a custom 2.5%. He then tried to defend itself that the order was sent with the price +2.5%, and never wasn't stoped, trying to go balistic again. I stoped him telling that the actual variation he sent was along the 2.48 (5 or 6 decimals) and that the app didn't know about rounding the numbers as he did (as the prices of the stocks can change, we cant determine a ""safe"" decimal rounding, and my boss's boss told us to not round the variation for validations).

He then switched over to a newer plan, with TV, phone and a wireless modem-router, pays more, which should include a wireless modem-router. He, not knowing what WiFi actually was even, called to check up on his modem. I don't know how he worded it but they said everything was fine and even gave him credentials for the service to connect to other peoples modems with his own account. Mind you, this shouldn't even be possible without the owner having no WiFi modem for other people to connect to. So he called me for help, I tried teamviewering into the router, finding no configuration page at all. Then I told him to check up on his router and read the model number. Turned out he still had the old router and despite his complains about no WiFi, the tech kept ignoring that fact. I told him to keep calling. Not to be racist, but apparently he had gotten a 'foreign' techsupport who wasn't very integrated into society who was an ass the entire time.

When you suscribe to a french ISP, you usually suscribe to ADSL with phone and TV. Then you get a TV box, and a router. The router usually has 4-5 ethernet port, WiFi and a RJ11 where you plug your phone. Then you have a tv box to watch TV and Upnp stuff and blue ray. It also come with an integrated HDD and is connected either by wifi or by PLC.

In France we have a great law made stupid because of copyright holders. The law allow me to duplicate Tape/CD/Vinyl/Movies/video games/whatever that i own as long as the copy is for my personal use. Copyright holders where not happy from that law (come from music tape/VHS in the 80's i think), so they managed to have a tax on blank media. When you buy a blank CD or a DVD or SPECIFIC TYPE OF HDD you have to pay a tax for private copy. This tax is then payed to copyright holders.

Taxed HDD include HDD sold in a TV box, but not HDD inside a router. So Mr FreeISP decided to put the HDD for the TV.... inside the router! =&gt; no private copy tax!, and you can still record TV on the HDD.

The educational organization that I work for had just started a 1 to 1 laptop initiative for it's students. Basically they all got iBooks (MacBooks hadn't yet come about). One day, one of the students brings in her iBook and it is smashed to Hell. The screen is literally hanging on by one *maybe two* wires. I ask what happened and she said that she had her laptop open in the passenger seat listening to iTunes and that some lady hit her head on. I don't doubt the story but I've always suspected that perhaps the head on occurred because she was fumbling with iTunes and not paying attention to her driving. So, I set about getting her up and running on a loaner laptop using Target Disk Mode (awesome feature that I wish PCs had) and amazingly enough, it still works. No bad sectors on the drive (thanks to the accelerometer stopping the HD before it collided with the glove box/dashboard on impact). Only damage was the screen, hinge and some cosmetic scrapes to the main body. iBooks were fecking tough.

Long story short I decided that this had gone on long enough and I was sick of losing shit.

So I installed linux on an old Smell Optiplex I had had lying around for a while and setup SAMBA, LDAP, Kerberos etc. Come home from college one day to find that nobody can login. Check the server logs - nothing seeming particularly amiss(WTF?). Check the server config files and they all seem fine as do the clients (Okay, seriously WTF?!). 

Turns out what had happened was that the tiny CMOS battery had run down and the server clock had reverted to some time in 2001 when it was started up that evening, because of [the way Kerberos works](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742516.aspx) the client clocks were MASSSIVELY ahead of the server's causing the authentication to fail.

You need at least 3 NTP sources to avoid problems like this - odd number being a key.  So if you have one NTP server appliance locally, if it won't let you add two more NTP sources from the internet (public servers), put a linux box in, and have the linux box act as the NTP server for your clients.

This way, if your GPS clock goes bonkers, the NTP daemon will see a serious mismatch and mark it as bad/unreliable, and go to using the other two public sources.

a $LocalTelco was even worse.  I do a mess of SCADA sites, little low bandwidth metering sets basically. 8 years ago, we ran a couple dozen of them off a 300bps party-line analog radio.  I upgraded _that_ to a 256k ethernet data radio.  My service area is expanding outside of the reach of these sets, and I can't get budgeted for new master sites, so... 

Cellular.  Works great for low priority sites, and $OtherLocalTelco set us up a custom APN - we're encrypted from the tower to our fiber interface with them, and not internet facing.  Boo yah.

$LocalTelco, though..   they wanted to provision these sites, these sites that were perfectly happy sharing 300bps amongst a dozen of them...   

with 3mb symmetric DSL and LTE cellular backup.  To the tune of $700/month/site.

Yay so I call up our AT&amp;T rep and ask if we can get service as we already have their fiber in the building.  90 business days.

What?  but just send a tech out it cant possibly...90 Business Days.  So then I jump through some hoops asking anyone and everyone if they can send someone out to do a survey and see that there are zero construction costs and they just have to flip a switch. 90 Business Days.  But we are moving in in a few months, we need internet in the interim!

We can install Ethernet over Copper in about a month, running about 10 mbps

Ok...(not nearly enough bandwidth for us, but I'll bite)  How much per month?

$4k/month

Oh hell no, highway robbery!

End up going with comcast contracted out, said they would install in 30 days and they would have if not for our property manager getting in the way...and in the interim going with a wireless internet provider, basically an antena that draws from the building next door's roof, 40 mbps for about $1500/mo.

Had to be able to scan and copy as well as print. Had to be a laser. She couldn't explain why to the owner or me, but she just had to have it. Eventually he got tired of her whining and told me to get her one. Fine, it's not my money.

I went over her requirements with her, selected a unit, made certain she was OK with it, picked one up and installed it. Printed out a test page and used that page to test the scanner. Left the test page on the scanner plate and put a few blank pages in the tray. This was over a year ago.

Walked by her desk a couple of weeks ago and noticed that the printer had a clock radio sitting on top of it. It was covered in dust.

Okay sir, let's check the mail app first. No your an idiot I don't use the mail app, oh so how do you normally check emails, I open safari and go to yahoo.com (webmail).

After face planting the desk....hard I then try to explain that the iMac cannot be the problem since he isn't using the mail app and is using webmail, nope I don't know what I'm talking about, I send him an email to prove it, which he receives, nope still don't believe you must be this damn iMac

Then proceeded to call said friend and put him on speaker, said friend insists I'm a liar and just don't want to help and that he 'knows all about computers'. At this point I'm thinking since you know all about computers why don't you just sort it out since you think I'm incapable of doing my job?

Every time we ran it in the computer lab the teacher would sneakily peer over our shoulders, find out what the game was called and then blacklist it. We'd counter by recompiling and bringing it back the next day.

This back and forth happened for a week roughly until my friend renamed his game ""Microsoft Word"". The teacher silently creeped behind us, peered between shoulders and immediately sighed defeat. ""Guys, you have to stop this, its against the rules"". Being good students we were caught and had to quit. Thankfully he knew it was actually something we programmed so he was never going to send us to get in trouble or remove computer rights.

I proposed an alternate approach that was adopted and worked perfectly. The students' parents were fined for their behavior. First offense was $100. Each offense after that doubled the previous fine. No exceptions, period. No pay - no grades released, no transcripts, nothing. The money raised was put into a special fund for need based scholarships, so no one could bitch that the school was getting rich off of it. Each student and parent had to sign a form accepting the fine as a condition of using computers at the school.

One kid racked up 4 fines in 4 days. His dad was beyond pissed at having to pay $1500 but he forked it over.

Others, were given ""dirt cheap"" machines that were not only slow, but had unlicensed Windows XP on them as well installed by the system builder, or did not have a COA attached to their system (not attaching these is against the Microsoft Software Agreement). For the COA bit, I'd always ask for these and the user very rarely was able to produce one, much less any documentation provided with the machine proving it should have a copy of Windows XP installed.

Whenever I came across an unlicensed copy of Windows, I gave the person two choices: 1: Either buy a license for Windows XP, or 2: I give the machine back with Linux installed. Considering people were not playing games or doing much besides check e-mail and browse the web on these horribly slow machines, they all for the most part, received a copy of Ubunbu with all of their files and essential programs to read those files installed. I'd also give them full blown lessons for the price of a pizza. Months later when these individuals have a quick question for me, they always tell me they're amazed at how fast the computer has been, and the lack of ""games"" in the browsers. Every once in a while I'll receive a call asking for help to install specialized software, and I'll gladly remote into the machine and walk them through installing the software.

She suspected that her then-16 year old daughter was using the family computer to post pictures of herself on the internet (And to be honest, the girl in question was very attractive and quite stacked).  She asked if I would come over to help see if there were any hidden pictures of her somewhere in the computer since she (the mother) was completely computer-illiterate.  

But there was a catch -- she wanted me to do it blindfolded.  I was to do all the work and she would look over my shoulder.  When I tried my best to explain how absurd her request was, she replied ""Well then I'll just take it to Best Buy.  At least they'll be professionals about it.""

Yep.....she wouldn't trust me doing the work in her house, under her supervision, for free.  But blindly handing over her PC to a bunch of 19 year olds at best buy where they can take it into a back room and do whatever the hell they want, and spending $150 for the privilege?  No problem!

It took them *several days* to fix an access violation of that magnitude? Oy oy, our coffee cannot repel that.

Sounds about the time when you document everything, go to the principal and tell him either the AD goes or you stop fixing anything related to it. Also, since this sounds like something that *will* blow up at some point, why not start documenting the security problems, possible problems and hours spent on it, with a weekly mail to your boss/principal.

What confuses me about this story is, how could you ever give someone ACCIDENTAL domain admin access? It is VERY clear cut on what each access group does.

One point of interest though: If your sister is serious about her photo editing then it actually does make sense for her to have an i7. Image rendering is very intensive on RAM and CPU resources, so the more power you can get along those lines the better off you are. Then again, if all she's doing is taking out red eye and brightening up dark shots then you may have a point.

I agree with you that the 1TB hard drive is unneccesary though. If she was editing VIDEOS then 1TB would make sense, but not if she's just diddling around with photos.

IsilZha," hah, this is quite familiar to me.  I worked at an office where most of the company did a majority of their work in our own, in house software (IT had a development team of 10 plus our boss, help and me.)

 Before I was the systems administrator I was the help desk, and occasionally took calls if they were overwhelmed or out.   Anyway, our proprietary software had its own user database with various permission sets, groups, and even extremely granular permission control, down to specific menu items/ buttons/etc.

 Well users always needed to have their manager grant any additional permissions, either in our software, additional internet access ( internet was very locked down),  certain network resources, etc. Sometimes it was easy and i would get a call or email from the manger stating an employee should get x  permissions ( I'd have them email me as well if it was a call so I had a tangible record.)   On a bit of a side note,I found an actual use for OneNote, and copied the emails into it and organized my authorizatios with it.

 Most of the time users just send me or help desk that they ""need y 
  permission.. Half the time Id get the manager email later... or nothing.   I started getting annoyed when users would send a new message later to either someone else on help desk, or even to me again asking the same question, so at some point, every request that came sans manager approval, I forwarded the message on to their manager, CCing them, asking if it was approved.  I got quite a few no's back that way, and I'm sure those users got flack for it (which was definitely part of my plan so those types of users would quit wastng our time.)  Anyway, that aside, I got one user that would constantly ""approve"" himself for broad, high level access to various things, even after I had been forwarding his emails off to his manager, constantly complaining that he required these permissions immediately.

In the end he was bad all around.  He was fired after only being there for 3 weeks as he had started spending a majority of his time job hunting during his work hours.
