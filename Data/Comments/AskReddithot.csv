GateKeeperKeyMaster,"I called 911 on my parents and it was the best decision for our family that I ever made. 

My parents would often fight. My dad had a terrible temper and my mom was an alcoholic. Nothing physical ever happened but the verbal abuse between these two was insane. My mom would drink, become incredibly irrational, which would trigger my dad's temper and the yelling would start. When I was about 15 I had enough. It was almost midnight and they were screaming at each other through the hallways. I asked them to stop, and they would, for a few minutes, and then my mom would slur something at my dad and the fighting would escalate again. Well, I decided if they weren't going to listen to me, then I would call someone who would, and I dialed 911. The police arrived, made sure I was okay, then pulled my parents aside. The officer that spoke with them was incredible. He asked them if they knew what kind of impact this was having on me that I was willing to call the police. My parents broke down in tears and apologized profusely. The officer calmed them down, spoke with them a bit more, made sure I was okay and then left. They came into my room, hugged me and apologized. My mom stopped drinking any form of hard liquor from then on. She absolutely refuses to have the stuff in the house. My dad has since learned to better control his temper, but he does let it get to the best of him from time to time. Instead of blowing up, he leaves the situation, calms down, and returns in a better frame of mind. My parents used to talk about divorce quite often when I was that age, but the topic has never been brought up since that night. We're closer than ever and I am incredibly glad I did what I did.

brocolicookies,"Not my favorite thing to talk about but here it goes...

June 4th 2012 I got a call from my girlfriend at about midnight, I was asleep at the time but my dogs had woken me up to go outside at about 12:30, I see a missed call from her and a voice mail.  I checked it and all she said was ""you should come over, you should come over"".  I called her back, it was weird because it was her work phone and not her personal number.  After a few failed attempts I finally got ahold of her.  She was a mess, emotionally floored.  The only things I remember her saying was, ""i'm tired and I just can't do it anymore, i'm too tired"".  Finally, the conversation came to a point where I had to ask if she was going to hurt herself or someone else, between screams, and heavy breathing, she refused to answer it.  I finally gave her an ultimatum and said, ""I have to call the police if you don't answer me"".  She then said the last things I would ever hear from her, ""I'm sorry brocolicookies, I love you more than anything, but I just can't do this anymore"".  She then hung up and never answered again.  I knew she had some issues with suicide in her past but she had not had any episodes for quite a long time.  I then called 911, and here's where the story went from sad to excruciating.  I live in a town that's a bit behind the times... I talked to the 911 operator and told them everything and that police needed to be there asap, I told them she owned a gun(She was a small woman and the town was known for assaults).  They then began to tell me that they couldn't find the address, well actually, they couldn't find the street on their map.  They then began to tell me that she lived in another town and they were sending the state police out there.  I begged and pleaded with them to meet me somewhere and I could show them where she lived.  The operator refuted what I said and hung up.  I then called the state police, because they said that they sent state troopers out there.  I finally got through to someone and had to explain where the street was.  After about 3 hours after my initial call to 911 the police finally figured out where the street was.  I ended up having to be on the phone with the trooper and explain to him how to get there.  You'd think that it ends here.... but no.  I finally hung up and paced back and forth, sat at my computer and ended up falling asleep on my desk for about 3 hours.  The officer went in the house and found her cut up and barely breathing in her bath tub. *note* I did inform the officer that she owned a gun.  He went outside of the house to call for an ambulance.  After he goes back in, she had the gun to her chest.  After about 4 hours of negotiation, she chose to end her life on the morning of june 4th, 2012.  I ended up driving over there at about 6 because I couldn't get ahold of anybody.  I was then pulled aside for questioning and finally heard the words... ""We were unable to help her"".  The whole ordeal was one of the most painful things I have had to go through, and I feel like I handled it poorly.  Not a day goes by wishing that I just went over, not a single day.  

-tl;dr:  Girlfriend was suicidal, called 911 and they couldn't find the street she lived on, 3 hours later they found her barely alive but forgot there was a gun in the house.  Went outside to call for an ambulance.  She grabbed the gun when they called.  She ended up dying later after negotiations failed.

Studentem,"This happened in the Netherlands.

On a cold January night I was waiting at the buss stop and saw a very drunk old man making his way along the canal walking next to his bike. It looked funny until all of a sudden the man was gone. Next thing I saw was a nearby guy dropping his bag and running down the bank, so I made my way over there fearing the man was lying in the water (This was late at night in early January, which meant he wouldn't last long). Turned out he rolled down the bank and had fallen into the water. He was too drunk to swim or even properly notice what was going on and just moving his arms around a bit. His clothes were completely soaked and he was also quite fat, all of which pulled him down and his drunk movements only caused the top of his bald head to pop above the water every now and then. By now there were 4 of us, and one guy managed to grab a hold of the old man. With all our might we tried pulling him out of the water along the steep bank of the canal (old fat men in soaked winter clothes weigh quite a bit). After me slipping, which almost caused the five of us to fall into the canal, we managed to drag him all the way up back to the road. At this point I figured it'd be best if this guy went to the hospital, though he was determined to go home, though fortunately too drunk for that. So, that's when I called 112 (which is the Dutch equivalent of 911) and the guy was picked up by an ambulance after being laughed at by the police who also showed up (they were clearly bored and happy to have something to do on their nightly patrol).

Arrabiata,"Story time!
This actually happened two days go. I live in a house with four other people. About a month ago we got a new housemate called Joaquin. For three weeks he was completely normal.

Then last week things started to get a bit weird. He would put really dark sunglasses on and stare at himself in the mirror for up to 20 minutes at a time. He would laugh to himself and ignore any questions we asked him. At around midnight he took his dinner and went to the bottom of the garden, still wearing his sunglasses. He also started taking knives from the kitchen and walking around the house with them and was in love with his pen knife.

A few days later he came in to my room and wouldn't leave, insisting that i had invited him in. After that I locked my door at all times.

The next morning I unlocked my door to go to the toilet for a maximum of thirty seconds. When I returned he was in my bed. I told him to get the fuck out of my room and he just said ""sorry, is it a problem?"". I told him obviously it was and repeated to get the fuck out of my room. (Yes, I have a foul mouth).

That evening my housemate Gabi and I were locked in my room when my other housemate Beth knocked on the door. When I went to open it Joaquin came sprinting up the stairs and shoved his foot between the door and the door frame. Again he refused to leave and if we said anything he would make eye contact for like thirty seconds. Fucking creepy! We kept trying to physically push him out but with his foot in the door we couldn't close it so I swung the door open and shoved him hard so he went reeling backwards.

That night he came outside my door and started saying ""Girls...you can't stay there forever, get out! Who do you think you are?! Jesus Christ? Well I killed him and I'll kill you too"".

I don't know why I didn't call the police there and then, I think we just didn't know what to do. We're young girls and hadn't really been in such a weird situation before.

We called the landlord and told him we wanted to speak about something so he told us to come over at 7PM. Except Joaquin came home at ten to seven and went straight to my room. Just laughing really loudly and being generally freaky. I called the landlord to pick us up and as soon as he came upstairs Joaquin went in to his room.

The landlord took us to the police station where they told us that they couldn't do anything unless we rang them when it was actually happening. (The police that attended us later told us that was complete bullshit and they could have arrested him).

So we went home to wait in my room like bait. Sure enough after half an hour he started slamming his body against my door trying to gain access. I rang the police and they came after fifteen minutes. In that time he was laughing manically, moaning behind the door and exhaling smoke from his joint through my key hole.

They arrested him and I've gone to stay with my parents for a while. The creepiest bit is that after they arrested him I came out of my room and he'd set up camp with multiple pillows, slippers, an ashtray and those weird ass sunglasses. Creepy as fuck.",null,42,cdpm6rh,1rport,AskReddit,hot,244
judicium,"It was 1 am.  I was back home for the weekend from college sitting on the living room couch playing starcraft with adult swim on in the background.  The doorbell rings.  

I'm not expecting anyone at this time and everyone in my family was already asleep.  I turn on the porchlight to check who it was.  It was a lady of maybe 30 that I've never seen before. 

 She's ringing the doorbell excitedly.  She's clearly distraught.  I ask her who she is and what is going on.  She tells me that her boyfriend was drunk and abused her.  She's babbling through tears about how her boyfriend is after her and pleads for me to let her in because my house was the only one with lights on. 

 I cautiously open the door and let her in.  I call 911 and explain the situation.  As I'm talking to the dispatcher, she sits on my couch crying.  The dispatcher informs me that she's sending a patrol car over.  I casually chat with the woman on the couch as we wait for the cops to come.  She asks me about the game I'm playing.  So I try to explain starcraft to her.  She doesn't understand, but at least she stopped crying.  

A policeman knocks on the door shortly after.  I explain to him what happened and let him talk to the woman.  She points out the house she lives in and where her boyfriend was.

punkwalrus,"First time, 1987: discovered my mother's body after her suicide.  They were very nice, and I was surprised the ambulance arrived in 3-4 minutes.  It was pretty obvious she was dead, and the EMTs were kind but obviously awkward I was the only person in the house, and a teenager.  Police were called, and I had top handle the whole investigation because my dad was away on business and the only people who knew where he was staying was his work (closed because it was a weekend), and my mom who was dead.  That was a circus and a half, and part of the police duty was keeping neighbors from just wandering into the house to see what the deal was.  One of my worst memories of my life.

Second time, 1989: customer in my store ran up to me and said there was an unconscious woman in front of my romance section.  Assumed it was a figurative joke for about 10 seconds before the customer became agitated that he was being literal and not making it up.  I went up into my ""tower"" (my store had a place in it where I could see most of the store from above), saw an unconscious woman with a few customers around her, and called.  Despite taking maybe 3 minutes, she came to before the EMTs got there, and refused treatment to them when they tried to get her to get on the stretcher, saying she just had the flu or something.

Third time, 2001: My wife fell down a flight of concrete stairs in front of our house while packing the car for a road trip.

We called OnStar (which I am not sure is 911), and reported him.

SO...

I live in row houses (town houses) or whatever you want to call them.  I'm the second unit from the end.  My neighbour on the end and I are great friends.

I had some buddies visiting from out of town, and my neighbour had his cousin and her boyfriend over (with their young baby - so young they didn't identify age by years??).

Anyways, long short for y'all.  We were consuming enough alcohol to tranquilize a baby hippo, when all of a sudden, one of my buddies and the cousin (girl) end up in a hot tub next door, and we're stuck with a buffoon (the guy) at my place talking about how TELUS doesn't own the world (he for some reason thought they did).  So after convincing him to go find his baby momma and his baby, things took a unique turn.  the guy was in my neighbours back yard. He ended up dropping his beer bottle and stepped on the glass cutting his Achilles tendon.  He pranced around the house squirting blood everywhere, only to have his baby momma start to fasten the child into the car seat of their Crapalier.  This was at about 3 am, and no one was in any condition to drive, let alone walk.

So I ended up drunkenly called 911 to get the guy out of the vehicle, and more importantly the baby out of the situation.  

Fortunately the cops understood our concern, forced the guy into the ambulance, and ensured the baby momma and baby stayed at the neighbours house until they left.

Im_a_TARDIS_AMA,"I used to work at a gas station on closing shift. One night we got a death threat over the phone. Called the cops, they came and stayed with us for the last half hour or so and walked us to our cars. Nothing ever came of it, so it was probably a prank call, but it scared the bejeesus out of us.

Also had to call 911 once while leaving after closing. My coworker at the time didn't have a driver's license so she rode a little underpowered electric scooter to and from work. Some drunk asshole ran her off the road and she did a nosedive over the handlebars. I was right behind her so I saw it happen and stopped. She didn't want me to call 911, but she started getting woozy and her pupils didn't look right, so I convinced her to let me. She passed out pretty much right after the cops arrived and started talking to her. Paramedics came, took her away, she was out of work for a week with a concussion and a cut knee. It was a pretty cold night, and they said if I hadn't been there she might've been lying unconscious out there for a while before anybody found her, so I might possibly have saved her life.",null,4,cdpmco5,1rport,AskReddit,hot,45
kailman,"yup.

a couple years ago, i was home alone watching south park (the one when one of the character held up a restaurant and shot someone in the dick, i think). i was resting on a couch in the living room. i thought i saw a shadowy figure to my right through the window in the door, but i shrugged it off. then i see another figure outside through the window behind me. now i'm kinda suspicious, but i was lazy, so i thought it was whatever. then i hear BANG BANG BANG BANG on the door to the basement. then for a quick second i thought ""wow is someone ACTUALLY trying to break into my house?"" then it hit me. SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BREAK IN TO MY HOUSE. i jumped up and didn't know what to do. i opened the window in my bathroom to make my alarm system go off and i called 911. my heart was beating at unhealthy rates. i ran into my room, shut the door, and threw everything i had at it, including my mattress. i talked with the woman on the phone and she told me to calm down. then, the police arrived and by then the dude was gone. 

the cops were these two fat dudes. they walked in and i quickly explained everything. they went to the basement, walked back up, and left with very little dialogue. i guess everything was all good. i walked back in, cleaned up my room, and resumed south park.

and the weird thing is that the shadowy figure i saw through the door couldn't have been real. there is no way to get in or out of the corridor without making a lot of noise. but the second figure, obviously turned out to be real. ",null,5,cdpmbsx,1rport,AskReddit,hot,43

MrManicMarty,"I like the story told in Fallout: New Vegas. It's the story of a land, two conqueres on either side with different flags, different motives but still the same end goal. But there is one who would fight against them, to make his plans fall into place and provide a new future, but to do this he needs you. But *you* decide who wins, who falls, and it could be you that wins in the end because your tasked with uniting Vegas, the Khans, The Boomers, The Kings all these tribes and people and problems you decide what happens to them, who they support and who dies for who. Because in the end war is about who has enough friends to make a difference, and war... war never changes.

Dead Money - A tale of letting go, many people all with different burdens that weight them down yet they cling to them in frustration and greed. You have to work together with these people to get the end and put an end to the greed, you've got to make them let go.

Honest Hearts - A great people destroyed and scattered, a man who seeks redemption for his countless sins - but does God decide what happens to us, or do we make our own destiny. Do we save what we can, or destroy what we can.

Old World Blues - A phrase that means to look at the past and feel blue because it isn't the same as it was. Things change, and science is the greatest catalyst of change. But the desire of knowledge knows no bounds, we always seek to analyse, to dissect, to disseminate - to see what makes the world works. But sometimes we can know too much and sacrifice too much for knowledge, so we must stop great minds from causing great catasphroe.

Lonesome Road - Two couriers, each bearing his (or her) own flag. We see how even the most insignificant action by the most insignificant people can cause the most significant change. Here it is where we settle things, where we lay down our flags and fight for what we want to prove but we do so alone, because the world is lonesome yet many fight on it.

nashamanga,"[Day of the Tentacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle)



There are two tentacles – Purple, who is evil, and Green, who is good. A mad scientist pollutes a river with some crazy chemicals, and Purple tentacle drinks from the river, causing him to grow arms. He then sets off for world domination.


The scientist finds three kids/teenagers who are willing to stop Purple tentacle, by travelling back in time to the previous day and preventing the river from ever getting polluted, using a time machine (with three capsules) the scientist built in his basement. The time machine breaks, because the scientist didn't use a real diamond, and the kids get stuck in different time zones: 


- Hoagie, who’s this huge roadie guy with long hair, gets stuck 200 years in the past, with Washington, Jefferson, Ben Franklin and the like.


- Bernard, a skinny geeky guy, stays in the present.


- Laverne, a crazy blond chick, is stuck 200 years in the *future* where, since no one stopped Purple tentacle’s evil plans, tentacles rule the world and humans are enslaved.


The kids can still communicate and send objects to each other via their time capsules. You have to fix the capsules (which is kind of tricky, since Hoagie is stuck 200 years ago with no electricity), bring the kids back and then stop Purple tentacle from taking over the world.

Mythrowawaywheee,"Halo 4. Stay with me, let me explain. 


Now the first 3 Halo games were great. The flood reveal in 1, the cliffhanger ending in 3, they were a really brilliant trilogy. 



Reach was also incredible. It showed war in a brutal light. You'd get attached to these characters and build up this pseudo-relationship with them and then BANG — they're gone. And that ending — heroism at its finest, sacrificing yourself to save the human race. 



But 4 was different. Throughout the original trilogy we saw Chief and Cortana as a team. A well-oiled machine. And that's all we saw. The machine. There was barely any connection. They were tools for the greater good. And then 4 came around. Cortana is lonely, dying, and lost. We start to see the human side of Cortana. Then suddenly, they're thrust back into battle, Chief and Cortana, like back in the old days. But as we progress, we start to see that something has gone wrong with the machine, something is malfunctioning. Cortana is dying. Falling apart, and trying to hide it from Chief. Why? Because she genuinely cares about him. And this feeling is reciprocated. All his life, Chief has been trained to be emotionless, a human weapon. Now, we start to see less Chief, and more John. He is scared. He has to get Cortana back to Halsey, must save her. And they both know it's a futile cause, but Chief will not accept it. Throughout the game, we see the emotional side of both protagonists. Cortana displays absolute terror and anger, and we see that she's tearing herself apart, and she knows it. Chief is scared — for the first time, truly scared, because he can't fix the problem. Everything he knows is falling apart, and the man is separating from the machine. 



SPOILERS:


Now it's endgame. The Didact has reached Earth, and although Chief and Cortana are so close to home, it's being destroyed. The player completes the objectives, and victory seems clear when suddenly everything stops. 



Chief is confused. He doesn't know what's happening. Cortana, life size, walks up to him. 

""It worked, you did it! Just like you always do..""
""I'm not coming with you this time...most of me is down there. I held only enough back to get you off the ship.""



John is terrified. He can't lose Cortana. His partner. His second half. But he must, and he is absolutely powerless. 



Then she's gone. The AI we've been rooting for, praying that she'll survive, assuming that because she's a protagonist that she must live, is dead. 



Halo 4 made the player empathize with it's characters. We always assume that the heroes will win in the end, but that's just now how life works. They're cruely ripped away from us, mere inches away from salvation. They become our friends, even projections of ourselves, and then suddenly, they're gone.

ChesterHiggenbothum,"I met my first love in college.  She went to a different school in a different state, but we made it work.  We would visit each other, call each other, and talk online as much as possible.  On breaks, one of us would drive down and spend the break with the other person.  We did that for three and a half years.   It was the best relationship I ever had.  We talked so much, it felt like we knew everything about each other.

During the summer before my senior year, while I was spending the summer with her, I proposed.  She said yes, which made me very happy obviously.  We spent senior year planning our future together.  I was going to go to law school in California, she already had a job loned up writing for a magazine.  We were planning the wedding.  It was going to be an amazing life.

My birthday is in April, a month before graduation.  I wanted her to visit me, because... Well, it was my birthday.  She said she was busy, it was a long drive, she wouldn't be able to stay long.  Driving from North Carolina to Ohio is tough, but she knew it was important to me so it was pretty easy to convince her. 

She got into a car accident and died.  It was late at night, so I'm not sure what happened.  She might have fallen asleep or hit a wet patch.  She was alone in the car and didn't hit anybody else, but two people died that night.  For all intents and purposes, my life ended with hers.

I've been kinda drifting ever since it happened.  Working part time jobs, not really forming any relationships, moving around a lot.  I never went to law school.  I've been working on short stories and a novel.  She wanted to be a writer, so I guess I feel it's my responsibility to write the stuff she never had a chance to write.  I doubt I do her justice.

I would do anything to have her back.  I haven't met anybody else that even compares, even after a few years.  People tell me that I need to get out there and meet new people, that there are plenty of fish in the sea.  But the ocean is empty without her.  

I would give up everything else for a life with her.  No matter where I am or what I'm doing, or who I'm with, or what I have, I'd pick her.  

  TL;DR - This is the one story that I won't summarize.

Xmas456,"This actually happened to me.

Dated her in high school and college and we broke up. We tried to stay friends but college life and then careers took over.

I just severed ties with her at that point.  

8 years later...  We crossed paths completely unhappy with our lives. We were married to people that didn't appreciate us.  We were on the outs with our SO's and the reconnection with each other sped the process up.

I jumped ship on my ex and moved out near her.

It started up again with a face to face.  Dinner...  Second date.. Introducing each other's kids.

A year later, basically living together... We had our own daughter on the way.  Then I bought a house for us and our kids.

We got married last weekend after 5 years back together.  Could not be happier...

EDIT:  

Thanks for the Gold kind stranger!

Some of you have asked why the ... at the end.   I don't know if there is an answer to why/how this all happened.  This is a 22 plus year old relationship.  I still believe that the best is yet to come after the smoke clears.  We officially got married last Saturday.  I am still awe of it.

I broke him. I never meant to. And every day I'm sorry for my actions and hope that he has found true love and happiness. 

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice and for sharing your own stories. To give a bit more information: 

This was nearly 15 years ago. We were 18 at the time, I was messed up and intent on throwing myself at a wall while he was a hard worker, studious and serious. I loved him and knew that one day I wanted to settle down with him but I also knew that I had to walk a long path of painful self discovery before I was ready for what he was offering. I could have stayed with him, but by doing so would have done more hurt in the long run. It took me years to understand the level of damage I caused but there are three major things stopping me from contacting him to apologise: 

1. He doesn't want to know me. He has blocked me on Facebook and has seen me on the street and changed directions to avoid me.

2. His name is very, very common and therefore impossible to Google-stalk so I can't even post a letter to him.

3. While I don't believe in carrying unnecessary pain, I fear that my desire to apologise is only to assuage my own guilt. If I knew absolutely that he wanted or needed to hear it I would do everything I could to say it. But for all I know he could be ok now and I'd merely open old wounds. 

I've thought about this for a long time and I would give ten years of my life to see him, to explain, to tell him that I've never found his equal, that my love for him has never diminished. But I am reconciled to living with this heaviness in my soul. This burden is my own creation and I will continue to carry it for as long as I have to.",null,216,cdpinkf,1rpdk1,AskReddit,hot,1000

My only grandparent I knew died when I was 6 from lung cancer. That day when my mother picked me up from my babysitters, she turns to me to let me know that nana passed away. I just put my head down to show I was sad, but on the inside I didn't really care. I just wanted to get home and watch tv. I loved my grandmother of course but I didn't really understand what had happened, but one day, I did. I was laying in bed, trying to go to sleep at around 8-9 years old. Our house is next to some train tracks, so you can always hear when one goes by. It's about 11:00, I'm laying there, and a train goes by. Not much out of the ordinary, so I just ignore it. Trains go by all the time. 

But there was something about this one time. Was it the darkness? The silence? The fact that my mind was empty and had room to wander? Whatever the case, a thought manifested. A simple thought.

What if that train just derailed and crashed into our house, killing me?

It didn't have a huge impact at first, but as the minutes went by, I thought more and more about it. If that train derailed right now, and crashed into this house, I'd die. I wouldn't come back. Everything would go black and I wouldn't exist anymore. The next 20 minutes consisted of laying in my bed on the verge of tears until I couldn't take it anymore. I got up and went to my parents room. They were still up, watching TV. I stood in the doorway, with my blanket, tears streaming down my face. My mother asked my what was wrong and I just broke down. I ran over to her and jumped in her arms and cried. **Hard**. She my mother asked what was wrong. I just looked up at her, sobbing harder than I ever had up to that point, and said ""I know I'm going to have to die someday, and there is nothing I can do about it."" She realized what had just happened, told my father, and I just laid there, sobbing for a good 20 more minutes. By the end, I had calmed down, I got up, and my mother tucked me back into bed.

From that day on, I was a different person.

Nothing is scarier than waking up one morning and realizing that you may never be able to move again. The fear sets in slowly as you start thinking about how long it will take before someone finds you. You become your own worst enemy with the constant stream of thoughts.

""Will I die of dehydration before someone finds me?""

""Will I ever be able to move again?""

I fought with my body trying to force myself to move for about two hours before I was able to move my arms. It was another couple of hours before I could roll myself off my bed and I started inching towards my bedroom door.

She informed me that her room mate was acting oddly and that she needed her medications but did not want to go home alone. I went with her.

My sister was pregnant with her second child at the time. My sister is now a widow with 2 children.

Trevastation,"June 21, 2011

I went to a day camp that occasionally went on field trips, and for the first week, we went to the beach. It was after the 7th grade, and I was struggling to make friends (only some years later til I learn I have Aspergers). For one reason or another, I had been in the sand, and someone shaped it to be like I was a turtle. Details hazy. Over above me, there was a girl taking pictures. She had the most beautiful body and golden blonde hair, with eyes as grey as a valiant knight's armor. She also has the most adorable laugh and smile that would make your heart melt. I asked her for her name. I had never asked a girl for her name before (still haven't after her). Her name was Ally, short for Allyson. I swear I heard that name for the first time that day, even though it was the name of my neighbor's cat. He hung out that day, and many days after that during the summer. I spent some of the best days of my life that summer, and the summer after that. We never had time during school because she went to a private school and I went to a public school. For the first time, I felt like some girl understood me, was weird like me, yet wanted to be my friend. Never in my life had I had a female friend. She became my best friend and one of my only friends. But, I started to fall in love with her...

I ruined our friendship and maybe a possible relationship. She's dating a girl and I never felt so alone in my life (especially with me mom, who really understood me, just died of Ovarian Cancer). I fucked it all up and she won't even talk to me (her GF doesn't want her talking to me either). I wish so much to just have a second chance. Just fix all the mistakes I made. She was different from all the other girls. I didn't look at her with lust to take her to bed. I saw beauty and magnificence in her. I saw a future. I saw a chance of not being afraid anymore. I remember that day because that day I met a girl. A girl who rocked my world, and I'll always treasure her.

Since the age of 8 I've been dealing with horrible depression. It runs pretty heavily in my genes so I just so happen to inherit it (yay for me). Anyways I have been on and off medication my whole life (I'm 21 now, female btw) and in about grade 9 it got to it's absolute worst. I couldn't get out of bed in the mornings, I basically stopped going to school. I had started self harming very young (10) and it just continued to get worse and worse.  

 I was hanging out with the wrong crowd and I basically didn't give a shit about anything and thought I was invincible. Anyways I happen to get in a fight at school with another girl when I was in grade 10 (I still cringe thinking about it) and her mother pressed charges against me. I should tell you that I come from a pretty good family but this little incident was too much for them to take. 
 
My siblings pretty much stopped talking to me all together, I was facing assault charges and I was failing in school and I had stopped all contact with my friends. I was in pretty rough shape, and I pretty much knew that I wouldn't be around much longer as suicide seemed like the only escape. 

If it weren't for my parents unconditional love and support I wouldn't have made it. I figured I was at a fork in the road and I could continue down the path of destruction or I can make a change. Thank God I decided to change. I found an antidepressant that worked for me (finally) and that pretty much kick started my brand new awesome life! I'm currently in uni and have an A average, my relationship with my siblings is wonderful and I am as happy as a clam! It still blows my mind to think that five years ago I was pretty much ready to leave this earth, and I didn't even know how beautiful life can be. 

That single fight changed the course of my life, and I am so thankful for that.

Her and I had our little spats, but I never thought I would become one of those people she chased out of her life and repeatedly tried to reel back in.

Recently there was a moment when I realized that she was chasing me out of her life, just as she'd done to those other people, and I suddenly began to understand why everyone ignored her threats and slanderous texts.

eodiv,"I've had several but the most recent happened just two days ago.  
  
I was married but ended up separating from my wife due to my own substance abuse issues (mainly alcohol). At one point during the separation, we didn't talk at all for a good 2 months.  During that time, I landed a great job, was able to buy a brand new car and was really turning things around.  Then one day, she called me and said she wanted to meet up.  So we met at an iHOP for breakfast.  It was August and she was wearing a hoodie, which I found odd.  After we sat down, she proceeded to tell me that she wanted to tell me about what she had been doing.  It turns out she had started using and became addicted to heroin.  One night, she overdosed and was found by a neighbor unconscious on the floor.  They called 911.  An ambulance and police came and the police searched her apartment, finding heroin and paraphernalia. After she was released from the hospital, she was taken to jail and charged.  Her parents, who were extremely well off, got her a good attorney and she pled out, getting only probation and an order to attend outpatient rehab.  
  
Needless to say, I was upset and disappointed about all of this.  We had done other substances together in the past but we had an agreement that cocaine and heroin were the two things we would never do because of how dangerous they are.  
  
About two months into her probation and rehab, she was tested randomly at rehab (I've been, they pick one person at random each session - which occur every other day, three times a week - and test them) and she pissed dirty for heroin.  She was taken back to jail, bonded out and went back to court.  Her lawyer negotiated a deal to keep her out of jail but requiring her to attend a 30 day inpatient rehab facility.  
 
During all of this, she (pressured by her parents) decided our marriage was irreparable, and we got divorced in January of 2012.  We still kept in touch though.  The rehab seemed to do her good at first but once she really got clean, about half way through it, she turned into a huge asshole.  She would call me or text me and say degrading things.  Eventually, she stopped and then I never heard from her again.  
  
Due to the divorce and my own mental health issues, I was struggling worse than ever with substance abuse.  I was drinking heavily every day and abusing Adderall and Klonopin.  Last June, under the influence of a lot of alcohol and Klonopin, I lost my balance and fell through a plate glass topped coffee table.  The glass shattered and a large piece lodged itself near my shoulder and, as I learned at the hospital, nicked my caroted artery.  I had to call 911 and was rushed to the hospital where I received 46 stitches and was told that if the glass had gone in a half an inch further up, I possibly would have bled to death.  Just the next month last July,  I was hospitalized after I began hearing things due to being up for 3 days straight on Adderall (amphetamine psychosis, basically) and probated for 9 days.  I had to attend a court hearing and basically convince a judge that I was capable of taking care of myself and living on my own.  I bullshitted my way through it and was released from the hospital, got on medication for bipolar disorder and began seeing a social worker/counselor twice a month.  I stayed clean for awhile and would text my ex to let her know how I was doing but never got any response.  It pissed me off.  
  
A few months ago I began drinking again, as well as abusing Adderall and Klonopin and smoking weed and I could see myself sinking fast.  A couple of weeks ago, after talking to my parents, I decided I needed help and checked myself into the emergency room, attempting to be admitted to the psych ward or referred to a rehab facility.  They refused to do either because I was drunk as hell and released me instead after keeping me for about 4 hours and giving me IV fluids to re-hydrate me.  When I got home, I texted my ex and told her that I was planning on checking myself into a rehab facility. Again, no response. I figured she would have been proud of me for doing the right thing.  
  
Two nights ago, I found out why she hadn't been responding.  
  
I looked her up on Facebook, as I knew she had an account but nothing came up for her name.  I found that strange.  So I Googled her name and the first result was an obituary. She died from a heroin overdose in her parents basement in October of last year.  Even though we were divorced, I never stopped loving her so I pretty much lost it and began crying.  
  
After regaining my composure, it hit me.  While I may not be doing heroin, the Adderall and Klonopin abuse could be just as dangerous.  I could take too many of one or a lethal combination of the two and die and since I live alone, no one would find me for days.  As much as I abuse them, I have been extremely lucky up until this point even though I've been put on a 72 hour hold in the hospital twice (the one I mentioned previously and prior to that in 2005) for overdosing on Adderall and flipping out.  
  
So I took both pill bottles into the bathroom and flushed the contents of them down the toilet.  Today, I called my doctor who has been prescribing them to me and admitted what I have been doing and asked him to stop prescribing them to me.  I have resolved to never drink or smoke weed ever again and I'm researching Narcotics Anonymous meetings that are close to my house and I will start attending them at least once a week.  
  
I'm absolutely heartbroken over my ex wife's death.  She was only 30 years old, had moved back in with her family and seemed like she was on a good road to recovery.  Part of me is mad that noone called and told me that she passed.  It would've been fine if they didn't want me at the funeral but a phone call would've been nice.  Yes, we were divorced but we were together for almost 11 years.  We started dating when she was 19.  I was a huge part of her life.  When I told my parents about this yesterday, they were shocked that noone called me.  Another part of me is upset because she had told me, when we met up for breakfast after she OD'ed, that she started doing heroin because I was doing so well at the time and she ""felt like she deserved to feel good too.""  In a roundabout way, blaming me.  I'm sure she shared that with her parents, who never liked me to begin with, so I wonder if they hold even more of a grudge against me in light of her death.  I thought for an hour straight earlier today about calling them but after talking to my dad, I have decided against it.  I'm not going to get anything out of it and it's only going to upset them and open up the wound I'm sure they have and probably still are working extremely hard to heal. I do know where she is buried though and this weekend I am going to go buy some flowers and place them on her grave with a little note so that anyone who comes to visit her will know I was there. 
  
I don't know what I'm going to do to cope with her death but I do know that I will never use drugs or alcohol again.  If she couldn't overcome her addiction and died as a result of it, I could just as easily suffer the same fate.  I realize this is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.  I'm going to need support and I may slip up but  I don't want to die.  Despite my drug and alcohol abuse, life has been going really well for me lately.  The medication I take for Bipolar disorder is working well and it's basically in remission.  I don't get hyper manic like I used to.  I don't always think people are talking bad about me and I'm not constantly paranoid.  I've turned into a pretty friendly, outgoing, normal person.  On the surface, at least.  After being unemployed for over a year, I've landed a great new job that pays well and I enjoy and have started dating a cool, intelligent and beautiful girl.  In addition to not wanting to die, I don't want to risk losing any or all of those things just so I can get high.  
  
Drugs and alcohol have cost me a $50,000 a year job, my aforementioned new car, almost all of my friends, my marriage and have landed me in the hospital numerous times.  Yet I basically flipped fate a big ol' middle finger and kept at it.  Now that I know drugs have taken the person that I was closer to than anyone ever in my life, my eyes have finally been opened. I'm **done**.  I wish I would've known sooner and had this eye opening experience a year ago but, despite the sadness I'm feeling right now, I'm filled with the hope of having a happy, healthy and substance free future.

Customer says there's a ""wooshing"" noise everytime she steps on the gas pedal.  Wooshing noise was caused by throttle plate opening and air going into the intake. 

Customer says at 3,000rpm his 911 turbo sounds completely different than his Ferrari at 3,000rpm so clearly there is something wrong with his 911 Turbo. 

Cayenne owner says the the car pulls. On the test the drive I find the car doesn't pull but the steering wheel is 90 degrees off. I raise the car up and see a bent tie rod.  Then the customer bitches us out about how is should be warranty and that he never hit anything.

Post on the right rear caught the door and bent it forward till it was flush with the passengers front door. Little old lady driving it didnt seem too upset about it. We of course ended up paying for it to be repaired. 

Had another co-worker who removed all the lug-nuts off the wheel before lifting the vehicle off the ground. He hadnt even set the hoist up, just started removing nuts. Called me over because he was confused as to why he couldnt get the wheel off.

I my self have had butthole puckering moments where the lock on one of the posts of a 4 post lift stays locked, but the rest of the lift keeps lowering. In essence the vehicle starts tipping towards one direction and will keep doing so unless you lift it back up off the lock.  Did this with a BMW 5 series that rolled until the tire chucks stopped it because I wasnt paying attention. 
 
I've got more if anyone cares.

*EDIT TO ADD*

I had a coworker who forgot to take the expensive alignment head reflectors off the passenger's side of the vehicle after aligning it. Drove it around the block and somehow they managed to stay on. Luckily as they are atleast $600 a piece.

I had a service manager have one of the techs remove an air pressure regulator off our tire machine because it was too slow to fill up tires. Service manager later had his drag racing buddy bring in pure aluminum rims so they could mount some tires for him. Machine ended up completely warping the rims beyond use because there was nothing to stop it from continuously putting force on the rim. Shop ended up paying out $1300 for a new rim.

Sooo many double gaskets. So many. 

I had a 60 year old alcoholic coworker, while he was welding exhaust, accidentally weld a hole into a metal gas tank on a 1970s something-or-another(it was while ago so I cant remember what kind of vehicle. Maybe a Maverick?) Seriously starts dripping gasoline out right next to his arc. Only moments away from horrible firey disaster.

I watched the owner of the previous shop I worked for spray brake cleaner all over the underside while it was in the air, to clean up some oil. Which is no big deal its what we all do. But he did it moments before the tech working on it came back and did not tell him so. The tech was going to get the acetylene torch to cut off some exhaust shielding. It was too late to tell him before the underside of the car started on fire with a ""poof"". Luckily the tech had a water hose in front the the car to spray it down with.

Something driver related: Had a 92 Acura Integra brought in for a clunking noise. While I was lifting up the vehicle, the upper ball joint fell out of its socket. Like just fell out so the knuckle was hanging by the lower control arm and the tie rod. We tell the driver she cant drive it like this its 100% going to cause a crash. She says she will call a tow truck to come tow it away. I set the ball joint back in the socket while im lowering it so that we can atleast roll it out of the shop. While we weren't paying attention the driver grabbed her keys off of the hang up hook and drove the vehicle away never to be seen again. Thats is as dangerous as you can get.

We nicknamed a previous coworker chicken sandwich. He had just gotten lunch at Wendys and had a unwrapped chicken sandwich in his hand. Other coworker comes up behind him with a lighter and brake clean. Proceeds to light it and spray said sandwich eating coworker, which then lights sandwich eating coworkers ass on fire. Takes his sandwich and pats out the flames, then proceeds to continue eating it like nothing happened.

That made his rims bounce around on the studs a bit, and was the reason. We checked the balance, none were out.

Second one happened a few days ago. This lady had ran her tire while it was flat and the sidewall got cut in half. Tire fell off. So she had a spare on (her husband did all that). She bought 4 new because AWD, and it turns out she destroyed her rim while driving on it with no tire.

If I had two wishes that I could wish for this holiday season, the first would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing in the spirit of harmony and peace.. and the second would be for $30 million a month to be given to me, tax-free in a Swiss bank account.

You know, if I had three wishes that I could make this holiday season, first, of course, would be for all the children to get together and sing.. the second would be for the $30 million every month to me.. and the third would be for all encompassing power over every living being thing in the entire universe.

And if I had four wishes that I could make this holiday season, first would be the crap about the kids.. second would be for the $30 million.. the third would be for all the power.. and the fourth would be to set aside one month each year for an extended 31-day orgasm, to be brought about slowly by Rosanna Arquette and that model Paulina somebody, I can't think of her name, of course my lovely wife could come, too. She's behind me 100% on this, I guarantee you.

Wait a minute, maybe that sex thing should be the first wish! So, if I made that the first wish, because, you know, it could all go boom tomorrow, and then what have you got? No, no.. the kids singing would be great, that would be nice. No, no, who am I kidding! I mean, theyu're not gonna be able to get all those kids together! I mean, the logistics of the thing is impossible! It's mroe trouble than it's worth! So, we reorganize: here we go. First, the sex - we go with that; second, the money. No! We go with the power second, then the money, and then the kids. Oh, wait, oh geez! I forgot about revenge against my enemies! Okay.. revenge against all my enemies, they should die like pigs in Hell! That would be the fourth wish! And of course, my fifth wish would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing in the spirit of peace and harmony. Thank you, everybody.

SirMixesAlot,"I strive to add value to my life. I want to spend my time on enriching myself with things that interest me.  I  believe in self improvement.  I realized that facebook did none of these things. 

It became a boring time sink which glorified narcissism and banality. I genuinely do not care what you had for dinner with strangers. I'm not interested in how many parties you went to on Halloween.  I prefer not to know how warm your winter coat is. Glorifying the minutia of mediocrity washes the real mysteries of life away in a deluge of unoriginality.  I do not want to witness the broadcast of your weakness. 

I found that facebook made me dumber. It dulled my senses and awareness of the present. It made me dislike people I found tolerable to be around in real life, due to their soapbox of mental diarrhea.  It just reinforced my belief that we are losing our humanity and ability to behave amiably in the presence of others.  How long has it been since you were in a room full of people who actually were present in spirit, and not with their eyes glued to some device? 

So there are times in life when you should ask yourself if you are going to be part of a problem or part of it's solution.

MilesGayvis,"* The main features of Facebook are impersonal.

Things like wallposts, pictures, etc are shared en masse between tons of people. The fact that it's public leaves it very impersonal to me. The only other feature left is the chat function, which I have on my phone and computer in a lot of different ways. If someone wants to talk to me, they'll talk to me. The rest is noise.


* I already talk to my friends regularly. The rest are acquaintances.

I'm not interested in maintaining surface-level relationships with people. That feels really shallow and gross.

* I felt uncomfortable talking about myself in front of an invisible audience. 

It felt gross, conceited, and ultimately kind of empty. I wasn't adding anything to the conversation other than how my day went or what I was up to. That's something that even *I* struggle to care about.


* Ultimately, I was giving ad revenue to a company that provided a service I rarely used and didn't like that much. 

That, plus their privacy policy made me quit.

TeapotYo,"This is less about game mechanics or specifics across games, but more how games helped my reaction time, problem solving, and awareness improve.

As a kid I had started off with what seemed like difficult games to me. Wolfenstein had no saves. E.T on Atari was just so terrible that it was hard, and then I was exposed to the side scrolling games of Super NES such as Earthworm Jim, Donkey Kong, and the various Marios.

Those early games had taught me that it wasn't all about finishing as fast as you can, but trying to beat games 100%. There were so many hidden areas or secrets within those games it was nuts. I'd go too far without seeing a secret and have to back track, or I'd just see a suspicious looking ""mound"" in Donkey Kong and I just knew a barrel would open it.

So you pick up on patterns like that, but I think the peak of my awareness and decision making care throughout the years of Halo 2. I've played other FPS at the time but this one put such an emphasis on team shooting. The level of awareness required was high and there were just so many variables. Even if it seemed like a blatantly obvious easy kill, it wouldn't always be best to finish that player of chase him.


I personally miss the days where I actually thought during games. I'll most likely get portal 2 for that, since portal 1 was the last time a game really demanded some brain power. It's why I still play shadowrun.",null,0,cdpvs2j,1rq9w7,AskReddit,hot,1

Bitch I'm a Jedi, now I'm a wizard. I'm a knight with a claymore, trudging through the blizzard.

Now I'm back to being a magician. Now I'm gettin' bored, gone fuckin' fishin'.

Now it's a scepter, of a king quite fuckin' rich. Now it's a broom, and I'm cruisin' like a witch.

End that streak like Kiki, and deliver you some mail. Now it's a spear, I just parried your flail.

Whip that shit around, stab you in the liver, got to get away, it will help me cross the river.

On the other side I'm dry, I swing in total glee. But now cry: ""FUCKIN' WHYYYYYYY!?!?"" as it breaks against a tree.

I feel so damn stupid, like those bimbo blondes. But I quickly do recover, I've got akimbo wands.

ThatsSoDorian,"I was a cook at a Sonic Drive-In in small town Iowa. I mean, I hated it, but there were also some fun stories that I took away from it. 

1) There was a guy--Luke--who was a redneck slacker. You'd ask him to do something, he would make you explain it six times until you get up and did it yourself then later brag about how he got out of work. I hated working with him, and so did everyone else. 

Fall rolls around and school was starting again. We were open until 11. Despite being 16 at the time, I was closing 4 or 5 nights a week. I liked the money, but pulling 37 hour weeks while in high school and living at home is a tad extreme. What made it infuriating to me was that they never announced the closers. Managers just told cooks to go home at random intervals until there were two left. It was like a gameshow from hell. But somehow, it was always me and Luke and Luke always got out of it saying he had a big test tomorrow or he'd close next time. It was bullshit that I had to close until midnight four days a week because he had other things to do. One night, the manager told him at the start of the shift ""Luke, you're closing tonight. Thatssodorian has closed for the last three."" His response: ""I can't. My mom won't let me close."" Spat ensues with the manager, and she lets him go around 9:30 under the stipulation that his mother calls and explains to her why her son can't close. 

Once he leaves, about 20 minutes goes by, and the phone rings. Manager answers, a few ""uh-huh""s later, the conversation ends. ""That was Luke's mom."" pause ""There was no way that girl was over 16."" So she got out Luke's application, and called his home number to speak to his real mom. She made no such rule. In fact, he doesn't come home until 1 am claiming that he was closing every night. So yeah, I closed that night (for the 4th time in a row), but I closed with a plainly visible justice boner. 

2) I had a coworker quit by changing his voicemail to ""Fuck you. I quit."" and not coming into work.

3) One of the cooks, we'll call him Jeff, was a self-described fuck up. Military background but left after a tour (I think--he was vague on the details), currently working as a cook, dreamed of opening a car stereo shop in my town. Nice guy, if a little coarse. 

When I worked with him, he'd always say things like ""Yeah, I'm good at this because I've been doing it so long. I don't like it, but I'm okay with it. Every now and again, we hire kids and they're really fucking smart, you know. If I can scare one of those smart kids to doing something better with their life, like my life as an example, like you don't want to end up like me, man. Like, thatssodorian, you're pretty fuckin' smart, you know. There's nothing glamorous or rewarding about this job, and you gotta go do something better when you grow up.""

This story has a little less of a plot, I guess. I just still remember Jeff, and his ""Don't fuck up your life like I did"" speeches. I don't know if he ever opened a shop. I occasionally Google his name and find nothing. I doubt he'd even remember me. But as a 16 year old kid in Iowa, I remember him pretty vividly. 

It wasn't a glamorous job at all. I worked shit hours and got paid $5.25/hour, but I had some laughs, some fights, and eventually rage-quit for a better job that didn't involve fry oil.",null,1,cdppvqf,1rq58k,AskReddit,hot,9

sunnybreezylife,"I was with the opening crew of Disney's California Adventure. The park served alcohol, so at 16 the only job I could really take was either food prep or bussing. I bussed tables, took it seriously and was promoted to shift lead at 17.25 an hour at 17. All my high school friends pretty much got taxied around and smoked weed on my tab. I kept it through freshman year of college at a seasonal level.

Working for Disney for my first job really set me up with great service training and gave me high expectations of how I should be treated as an employee. Also taught me that keeping my head down and working hard would get me noticed and promoted.

thornae,"This was one of the first films I ever saw in the cinema, and definitely the first I saw in the big city^^1.

I was under 10 at the time, and didn't actually know that much about the previous film. The thing I remember most clearly was being confused as to why people were laughing whenever Chewbacca spoke - it made sense to me he'd speak like that, he was an alien. In hindsight, it's possible that I was missing the jokes.


I don't think the reveal made much more of an impression on me than the rest of the film - it was a big, fantastic story, and all of it was incredibly cool and amazing and wonderful, and the bit where the bad guy was the hero's father just fit right into all that as a perfect part of the awesome climax...  
and then the film just kinda stopped with a ""to be continued"" feel. But I didn't really mind, and it was an awesome experience.

toxlab,"My first real date was seeing Empire.
I saw the original Star Wars as a kid at a drive in theater. I sat on the roof of the car with a blanket, and there was a meteor shower happening as the movie swung into gear. To say this captured my imagination in a big bad way is an understatement. Star Wars had my heart. And nearly every cent of my whopping two dollar a week allowance.

When they started promoting Empire, I lost my shit. I was going to the first show on opening day, no question. A girl who lived in my apartment complex seemed interested in going, as well. I knew nothing about girls, and most of them seemed kinda prissy, and not interested in cool stuff like Godzilla, Star Wars, and Marvel comics (my holy trilogy). This girl would play action figures with me, and we would have wild adventures in the tall grass behind the building. And she never argued with me about rule number one: I am always Boba Fett. 

So we're cruising Darth and Boba around the parking lot, drowning Chewie in a puddle, and discussing what we thought was going to happen. She seemed sad. I asked her if she was going to see the movie. She explained that she didn't have the money. I thought maybe I could sweet talk my mom into giving me enough for her ticket, and told her so. We didn't have much, but my mom was an easy touch and always went the extra mile to make us happy. I told her to hold onto Chewie, put Darth and Boba in my pocket, and rocketed home.

My mother and her mother were sitting in the kitchen of our apartment, drinking tea and chatting. I ran over, all vim and energy, and explained in my breathless manner that the fate of not only our world, but the entire galaxy, depended on my friend joining me in a galaxy far far away. 

Mom was sympathetic, but unswayed. I had already gotten an advance on my weekly allowance, and she just couldn't afford to give me more. 

My grandma was captivated. ""Do you like this girl?"" She asked. 
""Uh huh. She can ride bikes real fast, and she plays Star Wars with me, and she will play Chewie even though nobody likes Chewie. She's rad!""
""Well,"" Grandma said. ""You should ask her out on a date. You can take her to the movies, and then go out for dinner. And if she likes you, she might give you a kiss.""

My mom objected. Grandma was always, like myself, a creature of fancy. She was an artist, and a flutterbye, settling on one new thing after another. My mom had to be much more grounded in reality. There was no way we could afford this ""date."" 

Grandma took this as a challenge. She would pay, drop us off at the theater, pick us up afterwards, and then take us to a pizza place, and chaperone. I thought this sounded awesome. Grandma explained how to politely ask for a date, and what a gentleman on a date did. Hold doors, defer to your date's choice of pizza topping, make sure you brushed your teeth so you didn't have stinky breath, etc.

My heart was glad. I could take my friend to what I was sure was going to be the best film ever made. I couldn't find it in me to run and tell her, because I had all this new information swimming around in my head. I had to be a gentleman. Would she still like this new me?

I found her in the parking lot, grinding Chewie's head against the asphalt. (We had decided that Chewie would be cooler if he was ""pointy"".) I told her that my grandma was going to take us. Her face lit up. I explained that we would go out on a date. Immediately, she seemed crestfallen. I panicked and went into full sales mode. We would go see the movie, then grandma would come get us, and we'd go get pizza! Two  	
unbelievable treats in one! How could you lose? 

She seemed shaken. She handed me Chewie back, and said she had to go home. I told her that the movie started at four, and we'd have to get going soon. She didn't answer. I didn't know what to think.

A little while later, there was a knock on my door. My friend's older sister was there. At thirteen, she seemed as grown up to me as any adult. While my friend was kind of a tomboy, her older sister was the super sassy ultra girly girl, and I pretty much avoided her because my stomach felt weird if I looked at her too long. 

She asked about the date, and I explained my intentions. Movie, pizza, ride home with grandma. At that age, I hadn't really learned yet how to be disingenuous. Older sister explained that younger sister didn't really understand what a date was. I told her that I was a Gentleman, and knew how to treat a lady. (Thanks, grandma.) She thought this was adorable. She said her sister would be ready at three. 

I was in the living room watching TV when a story about Empire came on. The newsreader was standing in front of our local theater, and behind her was a line that stretched around the building! Still a few tickets left, she said. Oh no! I hollered for my grandmother and told her we had to go NOW! She said to get my date, and meet her at the car.

I rang her bell. I was half an hour early, and was bouncing up and down in anticipation. She answered the door...in a dress. I had never seen her in a dress before. ""We gotta go!"" I cried. I grabbed her hand and we ran to the car. 

As we sat in the back seat of grandma's LTD, I realized that she was wearing her sister's perfume. A lot of her sister's perfume. ""Huh."" I said. ""You smell nice. Never seen you in a dress before."" She looked embarrassed. ""It was my sisters idea. Stupid, I know."" ""No."" I said. ""You look nice.""

We got to the theater, and grandma pulled up to the end of the line. She gave us money for tickets and popcorn, and told us where to meet her after the film. As we settled in for the hour plus wait, the capricious Pacific Northwest weather suddenly changed. What had been a crisp day suddenly became a massive storm of huge fat snowflakes. Neither one of us had a coat. After a few minutes of big wind gusts, and snow sticking to our skin, we were both miserable. But dammit, Star Wars! We huddled together at the corner of the building, waiting for the line to move.

When the doors opened, a great cheer went up. I flexed my stinging hands, trying to work the money out of my pocket. 

The movie began, and we saw AT-ATs for the first time. I was entranced. When Luke's snow speeder entangles the legs of the great machine, I was mesmerized. I leaned forward, trying to absorb this movie into my pores. I set my hand to the hand rest, and realized I had put it on top of hers! What should I do? Do I yank it away? Would that hurt her feelings?

Suddenly, she shifted her arm so that her hand was holding mine. She locked her grip in mine. This was perhaps the most amazing thing that had ever happened to me. Not quite as amazing as Star Wars, but still...

As the film went on, I was no longer chilly, but suddenly quite warm. Sweaty, in fact. My gaze was locked on the screen, but I had a tingling where our hands met, and this was an entirely alien sensation.

Then came that great reveal. ""He told me you killed my father!"" 
""I am your father!""

I gasped, and looked over. She was already looking at me. She smiled. The chemicals in my brain were doing backflips. I had a sense of intoxication I had never known before.

The rest of the date went swimmingly, but I told you this long ass story in answer to your simple question because seeing that film in those circumstances left an indelible mark on my soul. So yeah, you could say it was pretty remarkable.

TL;DR: 9 year old me loved the shit outta Star Wars.

EDIT: wow, this gained traction in a big way. Thank you for your kind responses. I realize now that Boba Fett wasn't an action figure yet, and I've addressed that within the thread. I also posted how the date ended up.

EDIT 2: Holy moley. I answered as many posts as I could before going to bed at 2 am. Woke up this morning to a message avalanche like I'd been accepted into Hogwart's. Story submitted to r/defaultgems, Reddit gold, and hundreds of kudos. I'm stunned. This is by far my most successful post in over a year of Redditing. Thanks, guys. Glad you enjoyed.

Either way, my mistake doesn't change the story much; my love for Fett just clouded my mind like a jedi mind trick.
As for the girl: I also posted how the date ended up- scroll down/user name again. A lot of people want to know if we got married or some such.

The_Horse_Yeller,"I had heard rumors that there was a big plot twist, but no one knew the specifics. This was before the days of Twitter, Facebook, and the rest, so they could actually get away with keeping in under wraps. I had my own theories. I thought that maybe Han Solo was a double agent. Maybe the Death Star they blew up was actually a decoy, and there was some Super Death Star lurking in the midst. 

On a cold, dark night in 1980, I drove to the theater with my fiance. We were all dressed up in our finest Star Wars attire- I went as Luke, my fiance went as Leia. We had a bit of a scuffle with the ticket taker because I thought the ticket price was too high. I refused to give it to him. My fiancé told me I should just give in and pay it, but I stood my ground. So we snuck in through the back.

I could immediately tell that it was better than the first one. The acting, the pacing, the dialogue- all were so much better. When Lando Calrissian betrayed Han Solo, I thought that was the big twist everyone was talking about- but boy, was I wrong. 

I remember watching that fateful scene on the edge of my seat. I was trying to stay focused on the movie, but some asshole sitting behind me kept poking me. I turned around and politely whispered that he stop.

""I know who you are, asshole!"" he said. ""You're the guy who wouldn't pay the ticket price! You snuck in! That's it, I'm getting the usher! You're busted, pal!""

He raced off for the exit. My blood began to boil- Luke and Vader were having an epic lightsaber battle, and I knew that something big was going to happen. One of the theater attendants, who had just been informed of the situation, approached me and asked me to show him my ticket. I fumbled through my pockets for a while. After obviously not finding it, I told him I must have lost it. 

""You're not fooling anyone, sir,"" he said. ""Let's go.""

As my fiance and I were being escorted out of the theater, I heard those fateful words come out of Darth Vader's mouth. So *that* was the twist, I thought...I never would have guessed it. 

After making our way towards the entrance, we were confronted by the ticket taker. ""You snuck in, asshole! You better pay up now or you're banned from this theater forever. C'mon man, it isn't that expensive. I need about tree fiddy."" Well, I wasn't gonna give that asshole no tree giddy, so me and my fiance made a run for it. Since my movie watching experience had been so ruined, I felt like ruining it for everyone waiting in line for next show. I screamed at the top of my lungs that Darth Vader was really a fifty foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

ChipCrumbMassacre,"This story is depressing I would suppose more than weird but...

I did some on the job sit-ins with 911 dispatchers because that's what I thought I wanted to do when I finished high school and college.

One time I was just listening in and we get a call from an older woman, very older woman. She was crying and saying her husband was hitting her and that she was afraid he was going to kill her.

The dispatcher that was my guide for the day got a sad look on her face and went on to ask general questions. Where she was, was she hurt, what did he do, where is he?

The older woman just kept repeating that she was scared and that her husband was going to hurt her. After reassuring the woman she would be okay she transferred the older woman to another line.

The whole time I was shocked beyond belief and wondered why my guide acted the way she did and why she didn't seem to take this call seriously.

It turns out the older woman that called had dementia and her husband had been dead for some years. She still got delusions that he was alive and out to harm her. She called 911 often and there wasn't much anyone could do. We would send officers over to check on her but she was never really in any harm.

It's just weird because it's a very real thing to her and she felt real danger even if there was nothing wrong. That's got to be a huge thing for 911 dispatchers and that's why I decided I didn't want to go into that.

Back when I first started, I had a lawyer who was stuck in a public storage elevator call in. I ask my questions, and I'm just about to hang up and begin calling for help when she starts ranting about how she's a big fancy lawyer and is going to sue public storage and my company if she's not freed from the elevator in the next five minutes. I had to try hard not to laugh at the absurdity of threatening the only people who can help you. I believe she ended up staying in the elevator for another thirty minutes or so. Which is actually pretty quick as far as elevator entrapments go. 

Another time we got trolled hard by this one guy. Now, being a little fucker and misusing the phones isn't uncommon, but it usually amounts to some asshole kid calling, yelling, ""DICK"" into the phone and running off. This time was different. At the time, we were acting as the answering service for an elevator company. The only thing about that that's relevant is that when someone called in on that line, it wouldn't pull up the exact location of the caller. So this highly irate gentleman calls in yelling about how's he's stuck in the elevator. I'm unable to get a location message to play, and all the guy will say when asked is a nonexistent address in Manhattan. Then he starts calling me a cunt, among other colorful things. Now the elevator company I was answering for was based in Colorado, not New York. When i pointed that out, he'd just repeat the address in Manhattan he listed earlier, then rattle off the same string of insults. After about five minutes of arguing with him and becoming more and more irritated, it dawned on me that everytime he said something, he'd say it in the exact same tone and rythm. Yep. It was one of those Soundboard things. I wasn't even mad. I'd been duped by a machine. I transferred it to my supervisor and told her my Soundboard theory. The best part is that she proceeded to argue with it for another five minutes even though I told her it was a machine. There's probably a recording on YouTube somewhere.

I've got a few more, but I'm on my phone and this took forever. Also I'm actually at work right now. I'll post more later. Maybe. ",null,0,cdpullf,1rpzgf,AskReddit,hot,1

Protosega,"I'm writing this from my phone, so apologizing in advance for any spelling or grammar errors.



It was about 2 in the afternoon and I get a call from a frantic lady calling in saying her baby is not breathing. I get her address and *BOOM*, EMS is haulin ass code red. I ask her if she knows CPR and she says no, I convince her to let me walk her through it while we wait for EMS to get to her. I start with standard CPR for babies and when I tell her to put him on her leg, she says he is way to heavy for him to be lifted. 

At this point I was little thrown off....so I go with standard CPR. Three minuets go by and she says she can hear the ambulance outside. She can see the Paramedic running to her house so I let her go at this point so she can be with EMS.

Anyway, about 20 or so minuets later I get a call from EMS. I figured it was just them calling to give me and update so I can notate what happened for records...nope.

EMS called in and here is what they say ""The women who called in for her ""baby"" not responding was giving CPR to a plant.""

copiestopresponse,"I was a 911 dispatcher for a short time. You get a lot of really stupid calls, usually people who don't get the concept that 911 is for emergencies, but it's not a big deal to me unless they use an unusual amount of resources (calling a lot, faking information to get higher priority, using ambulance as a taxi, etc.)

One guy called FRANTICALLY saying that he saw the dead body of a young woman, early 20s, wearing nothing but shorts. He gave a detailed description, hair color, skin color, body position, the whole bit and said she was by the side of the interstate (in the middle of an affluent suburban area at rush hour) so we figured this had to be a really fresh crime scene. We started scrambling together officers to get there ASAP, a big hassle considering it's rush hour and they're all dealing with accidents and stuff like that. On top of that, we can't say what the issue is on the radio is because we have too many busibodies who monitor police radio, then call us to try to get juicy details, or othewise meddle. So we have to get these officers to their cars to read the computer, leaving other issues, etc. And these are suburban cops in the Midwest, a murder is a damn big deal.

The guy calls back a few minutes later. ""Uh, I checked again, it's a dead deer.""

Peeved, I announce on the radio that the trip is cancelled, ""it was a deer"". An officer sarcastically calls back: ""With shorts on?"" ",null,44,cdppsdv,1rpzgf,AskReddit,hot,38

It tells me that 1) You don't care for my safety, and 2) You are so glad to be rid of me you can't wait to get away. *Edit: Sorry, I sound a little rash here, I know not everyone was raised the same so I don't automatically assume the person who drove off is a dick, I usually make a mental note to ask them to wait the next time. 

And the safety issue might not be something like a murderer hiding in the bushes, I know those are slim chances but maybe I forgot my key, or notice my door has been messed with and shouldn't go in the house. If they are waiting I'd turn around and talk to them about the situation but if they sped off I'm by myself.  

99.9% of the time there would be no real reason to wait, but if that .1% does happen, then the 30 extra seconds I spent watching them walk to their door will always be worth it.

I'm from Germany and in summer 2013 I was in England for two weeks. It was kind of a language course and there were about 60 other students in my age. Two weeks passed and I had a lot of fun meeting people, living at a host family and doing stuff with my frined who had come with me.
On our last evening, when there was almost no time to meet the others, because early in the morning we had to return, the whole group ate pizza at a restaurant. I sat there with my friend and all of the sudden a girl I haven't seen before sat down on the other side of the table.
We had one of the most magical and enthusiastic conversations EVER. It was amazing. I've never before felt such a deep and strong connection to anyone. We were definitely meant for each other.
Unfortunately we were seperated, because when we had to go back to Germany, I got to know she lives in the south and I rather in the north. 
I'm so glad I asked her for her number, usually I am not the guy to make such a optimistic move when getting someone to know.
We chatted since then everyday on Whatsapp and it is still amazing, because she felt the same way I did in that restaurant: our conversation was absolutely fantastic and we soon fell in love with each other. There are like 500km between us and we didn't have the chance to meet each other yet, but we will.

OlivesRose,"I started talking to this guy on facebook, he was blunt, opinionated, and from what I could tell a genius. He intrigued the fuck out of me on an intellectual level and we started talking. Mostly joking and insulting eachother. Eventually I got comfortable with him and I'd vent to him, even though I was sure it only bothered him. It didn't. 

One particularly bad day, I wasn't really in the mood to talk to anyone, and I made it known. He told me that he didn't count when I didn't want to talk to anyone, and he ended up giving me his phone number so I could text him about it. I did. I stayed up all night texting him. He kind of became the only person I went to to talk about things, but at that point we weren't interested in eachother romantically. He was pursuing a different girl kind of quietly but I ended up catching on after a couple months.

Now I have to take a second to say, we were totally opposite people. He smoked, drank, partied, and generally didn't give a single fuck. And I went to church every Sunday, got straight A's, and had never gotten drunk. It sort of bothered me that he was into those things, but I'm also not the type of person that will tell you how to live. And like I said, he intrigued the fuck out of me.

One night, he called me. I thought it was on accident because it was late at night and well, he'd never called me before. I answered hesitantly and sure enough he called on purpose. We talked for about 5 hours that night. He was so interesting to me, and from then on we talked on the phone quite a bit, often for hours at a time.

Anyway, the girl he had been pursuing ended up changing her mind. It broke his heart, and I remember him telling me that I was the only girl he didn't hate now. At the time I didn't know what he meant. By this time, I cared about him more than he knew. This is where it get's scary. I almost lost him before anything began. He almost ran away, he stole a truck and made it to the border of our state and then decided to turn back. He later told me, he came back because of me. He didn't tell me this even happened until a while after it did. I remember a little while after he told me, he went camping in a part of our state that is essentially wilderness. There was no cell service and he didn't answer me for 4 days. By the 4th day, I thought he left. It scared the shit out of me. We weren't even dating at that point.

Fast forward a little and we started actually hanging out. It was kind of an unsaid date the first time we hung out. He walked all the way across town to meet me and we hung out at a park. He'd comment on how small my hands were just so he could compare hand sizes and almost hold my hands. I think he thought I was oblivious. I wasn't. 

We continued hanging out and everytime he would walk all the way across town. He'd say sweet things to me and we both knew where it was going. One day, we were sitting on a hill overlooking a feild at just about dusk and he put his arm around me. It was the time of year where your not quite used to the colder fall air. He was warm, and I was shivering. Half because of excitement, the other half cold. I remember it like it was yesterday. 

Then he officially ask me out. It was all so perfect. He'd call me every night before I fell asleep to say goodnight. Actually, he still does only now sometimes I'm asleep first. We'd write eachother letters, and he made me music. We'd lay on a blanket outside and look at stars, and we even danced under the moon. He'd sing Frank Sinatra to me when we go on walks. One time we met at the beach and it started pouring rain, I wanted to wait it out under a gazebo but he insisted we just walk back to his house. So we did. It was summer and the rain was warm enough to comfortably get soaked. We ran the couple blocks back, kicking water at eachother and laughing. I only wish I would have kissed him to make it more cliche. Nonethless, that day was wonderful. We've been together a little over a year now and I feel like my life is a romance novel. We of course have our fights, not everything is perfect. But I am incredibly greatful for the memories I have shared with this man. He means the world to me.

Gettin_Hooked,"Time for another addition of ""Super Gay^^*literally* Story Time"":


I fell in love with my female best friend when I was 14 years old. It was confusing and given the fact that she was extremely religious, conservative and by all noticeable signs straight it was pretty much a bummer. I never told her I was gay let alone in love with her and it strained our relationship throughout the years. 

As most 15 year old girls are, she become pretty much awful throughout high school. Obsessed with social climbing and doing whatever was the status quo. We drifted apart and I had to painfully watch her date d bag after d bag for a few years. Eventually I came out and had a few relationships, in the long attempt to move on and forget about her. 

Toward the end of high school we rekindled our friendship and she apologized for letting peer pressure get the best of her. Right before graduation we got drunk and hooked up. It was about as amazing as I ever thought it could be. But afterward she freaked out and insisted we should talk or see each other especially next year(we ended up at the same college).

As much as it hurt I respected her decision and figured it would stick since she was going Greek which is essentially the college version of high school cliques. I had accepted this end until she called me one day a few months into freshman year saying she had to see me.

We met up and she instantly started sobbing, saying she couldn't do this anymore. That she'd always been in love with me and had tried so hard to just ignore it. She had no idea what this meant for her life or sexuality, but she knew she couldn't fight it any more.

It was a long long journey and it hasn't ever been easy but we're now out to friends and my family. Going strong for over a year now. I still can't believe it when I wake up next to the love of my life who I thought would never be mine. There were a thousand times when all reason and sense told me to give up on it forever, but sometimes the heart knows best.

AlysDutton,"In the first few weeks of my current relationship I wrote Boyfriend a letter from Mars--I was bored in class and constructed this alternate life we were living as a long-distance relationship while I researched on Mars in a colony of scientists. I threw up some touches that I thought would amuse him (like, ""How was Better Call Saul season 6? The finale was such a cliffhanger!"") and he was delighted. Anyway, two weeks later he presented me with a copy of The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury. Inside was a return letter and the whole book was annotated with his thoughts and expressions of affection (for me and for Bradbury). 

I hadn't told him just how important Bradbury was to me (I'd mentioned him in passing but not expressed that he was my favorite author) and had never brought up my love of personally marked books.

CatchingRays,Met my SO on a POF ice cream date.  One of the first things I said was that I only do ethical non monogamy.  She liked the idea.  We have been together for 2 years with nearly zero anxiety.  It's so nice to be honest and not have to hide feelings.  Things are going great.  We go to the swing clubs.  We date other people sometimes.  We still do most things together.  ,null,0,cdpon6w,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,8
Flubbing,"My girlfriend of 8 months (still a baby relationship, but still counts) started off as good friends. When we met, we were both freshman at a new college and both had semi serious long term relationships. We first met when I caught a closing elevator with my hand, and slithered in through the cracks of the doors. My first words were, ""Have you ever had that fear of being crushed by the elevator doors?"" Suave, I know, but she smiled and that was the last I saw her for the day. 

Over the next couple months, we built a friendship in a group among other friends. As a commuter to the college, I had a car with which I started giving her rides back home everyday. Overtime, we grew away from the group of friends and became close friends to one another. 

Separately, both of our relationships to our other significant others kind of  deteriorated from issues of distance, miscommunication, and differences that were no longer able to be abridged. Meanwhile, she and I became closer than ever and over time closer than our previous relationships. ",null,0,cdponan,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,6
freedomsong85,"You want a love story? Um... Okay. Let's see. Oh yeah! Okay, so um.. yeah, here we go..

Met my husband back in high school. We were friends. He married one of my best friends. We had a series of party houses with semi-regular room mates. Basically, lived together (including his wife/my bff? and others)off and on for years. She cheats. They have a crappy divorce. I was right there for him. I am still best friends with him at the end of it. 

We continue living together with friends for a couple of years. One day I am just sitting around looking at him and realize I have a HUGE crush on him. (I'm talking one of those scramble to the journal and freak out moments.) Since we were best friends, I decided that going for it was a terrible idea that would end our friendship and destroy the house dynamics. My world is crumbling. So, I set him up with a girl I know. Logical solution? (IDK) Obviously that doesn't work out. 

Then, the worst luck ever has to strike. He and I wind up going after the same girl. (Crazy confusing, I know.) That doesn't work out for either of us. So, I start dating a guy and we hit it off.
 
Future hubby finds out and his world comes crashing down now too. 
He starts going after me HARD. I soon find myself in a bad break up. Presto! 

Future hubby and I start talking about our feelings. I was VERY resistant to the idea. (To the extent that we sat down and had several very long talks about it.) I never saw myself with someone like him, I didn't think he could handle the kind of relationship I needed, and I couldn't see our relationship change going well. Basically, my answer was a cautiously stern NO!

Little did I know that he was a man who had finely crafted the 'Wear them down' approach to love and war. Through a series wide of romantic gestures, like ninja kisses, he slowly won me over. It was a week or two before I realized we had already transitioned from best friends to boy/girlfriend. Surprisingly it worked. VERY well.

I have never been good with relationships. Honestly, the fact that we were friends for a decade before anything happened was probably the only reason we lasted the first year. 

We dated for a year, were engaged for another year, and have been married for four years now. We were inseparable as friends. (As in if someone either of us dated wouldn't deal with our close friendship and constant presence in each others lives, the relationship was over. In hindsight, that was probably a BIG clue.) I can't imagine my life without him.

I always had a rule that I would never date my best friend. Friendship is important, and lasting friendships are more precious then you realize when you are younger. If it weren't for the series of insane events that brought us closer and closer together, we^never would have gotten married. 

Today, I would highly advise anyone considering letting a possible happy relationship pass them by *due to friendship* alone to feel it out and give it a try. 

It is not a 'normal' love story I suppose. It was chaos from the start. It was exactly what we needed. Finally saying YES to him was by far the best decision I have ever made. I am happy and we have an amazing child together. This really could not have turned out any better for us. ",null,1,cdpq94r,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,5
gobabygo11,"I'm sorry. :( My SO and I have been together nearly 7 years. We met in high school, but it wasn't until after he graduated (he's a year older) that I put it together that he was interested in me. 

In class, he would draw me silly cartoons of pirates, make me gifts and we would share cosmic brownies. He ate the icing, while I ate the brownie and the little sprinkles on top. We hung out outside of school a few times with friends, where he showed me that he learned how to play my favorite Christmas Song on the guitar and he borrowed a friends Nintendo Wii because he knew I wanted to play it when it first came out.

What did I do? I tried to find him a date for prom, talked him into going with this crazy exchange student and I was completely ignorant of his feelings for me while I was dating a guy that was manipulative, mean and controlling. 

After about a year of him trying to show me that he had feelings for me, it finally hit me. It gave me the strength to break up with my mean boyfriend and I showed up at my current SO's house on Valentine's Day with an origami rose.

mantarey5500,"We meet at at a gender-bending party.  I think, ""damn, that dude looks good in a dress!""  So I go over and over to him.  Turns out he is a really cool geeky person like me!

Fast-forward a couple weeks.  We've been talking every day, and we get along really well.  We go to Quizno's for our first date, and he's wearing socks and mandals.  I take this as a sign that he's a comfortable, casual person, and I like him a lot for it.

Our second date is at my place.  We stay up talking long enough for my roomie to go to a party, come back, get high, and eat two bags of oatmeal cookies.  At 3 AM he leaves without kissing me.  I get a text later that says ""Sorry I didn't kiss you.  I'm always really nervous the first time.""  This is coming from a 23-year-old man.  I decide that he's the most adorable man I've ever met.

Our third date is at his place, and we watch ""The Thing"".  We kiss for the first time, and I find out that he's a damn good kisser too!

Fast-forward a month or two.  I stay over at his apartment for the first time.  My friend attempted suicide that morning, and I've been having an awful time.  We snuggle all night.

Fast-forward another few months.  We've been staying over at one another's places for a while, but no sex.  We're not abstaining for any reason, we just haven't felt like it I guess.  One morning I wake up and see his face caught in the sunlight that's slanting through the curtains and think ""This is the most beautiful person I have ever met"" followed promptly by ""Oh shit"" because I realize that I have feelings for him, even though we're supposed to be just casually dating.  I proceed to squash down those feelings.

Fast-forward another few weeks.  We split up over the winter holiday because we'll be long distance and supposedly neither of us is invested in the relationship.

Fast-forward another two months.  I go over to his apartment to play games and hang out.  A couple hours later, we go into his bedroom and sit down on the bed.  I tell him that I want to start dating again.  He gets all flustered and says he doesn't know if that's a good idea.  I convince him that there's no harm because I think he's awesome and I liked when we were dating casually.  He finally agrees.

Fast-forward to the next morning.  I find out why he thought it wasn't a good idea.  He wakes up, looks me right in the eyes and says in the cutest, happiest voice ever ""mantarey5500, I love you, and I don't want to just be casual anymore.""

Angry_Jester,"Im going to share something that is not entirely a love story. Well I want to share it with you anyway cause it might get you in a better mood.

Ive never loved anyone. I never did, I do not love now, and i dont think im capable of this kind of feeling. I had some deeper affection towards certain women in my life. But i was always declined. ALWAYS. 

Yet now i share my time with certain girl, and while i am not sure what i feel, i know one thing: I feel good and warm when she smiles and laughts. I feel good when she hides in my arms. I dont think its love. I think she gives me purpose, she gave me the meanin behind being a human being and a man at that. And it feels just right. 

this wont last long i fear. This will colapse or spiral down as we do not use similiar values to describe reality. But i dont care. Shes a good girl, Im obidient calm man. 

We have some good times. If I just loved her, it would be perfect. And it would be perfect if she would give me more of her time. Cause she works all the time, and we cannot see eachother that much. When we do - its ok. 

And being just ok, is good. After being alone for so long, i find myself in \ok\ position and im happy. im good. Im satisfied. 



... somewhere deep inside my soul wants to die. Wants to rip my heart from chest with bare hands. just because i dont love. But i keep demons inside as long as it is ok. 

so keep it cool. Keep it under control. Find something that gives you control. Sence of puprose - like my girl that gives me that feeling of being involved and important for someone.

cakesarelies,"I used to help her out in school with Maths and stuff, we'd sit together in the library, every time our arms touched, I swore I'd get a boner. One day I told her how I felt, she told me she felt the same way, we started dating.

I used to dream about dating her and sweeping her off her feet like in the movies. I've always wanted to be a film critic so I used to watch all these rom-coms and stuff, and had this idealistic view of love.

It took me two weeks to realize that she needed help with EVERYTHING in life (not just Maths), her parents were ultra-conservative, there were at least three guys into her apart from me who made it their personal mission to ruin my life.

When I finally did end it with her, I came out of it jaded. I used to think that the moment I saw her, I was in love with her, but as it turns out, it was just my hormones.

I've been in love once more, but that one is not that interesting, this one taught me that there is no such thing as love at first sight, to fall in love with someone is to know them as completely as you can know them, its not something ideal or cliched you see in the movies, its much more organic in real life, and if you're hanging on to the glorified vision of love, just let go.

As for the OP, I'm sorry it ended for you, what you need is not love stories from other people, you need to go make your own new one, and keeping making new ones till you find one that lasts till you die. I wish you all the best.

TL;DR: Don't idealize love. Love is more 'Annie Hall' and less 'When Harry Met Sally'

chatttheleaper,"I'm not doing this to get advice, I'm doing it because you asked. 
I met her 3 years ago. Actually, we have varying opinions on where we first met. She says we sat together at one point, and I talked to her briefly. I say we met staffing a Halloween carnival. (She's entirely right about where we first met, but she likes to mock me with what I said, so I tend to ""forget"".) At the class where I first met her, I thought she was kind of strange. Cute, but not somebody I thought I'd have any interest in. Looking back, it seems funny that someone who's come to matter so much to me, initially seemed like somebody I had no interest in as a friend. So, later at the carnival, I was stuck working a booth with her. So, I made some small talk, and we wound up hitting it off pretty well. And then, at the end of the night, she introduced me to the girl I had sat with at the class. Confused? So was I. Turns out, the girl I was working with was the identical twin of the girl from the class. So, we talked for a bit more before I left. At the classes after that, we'd hang out, and times were good. I started to fall in love with both of them, since they were both great friends, and I enjoyed hanging out with both of them. As we started to hang out more, I only loved them more. However, our schedules caused us to see each other infrequently. After about a year, we saw each other less, and most of our communication was electronic. This worked fine at first, but even that slowly stagnated. But then, this year, we started attending the same school. They were new to the area, and didn't have many friends, so they spent a lot of time with me. It was around this point I figured out which one of them I wanted to be with. However, they started to make new friends as well. I became obsessive, and started to worry every time they talked to a guy who wasn't me. I saw them flirting where they weren't, and I started to become more closed off.

I was severely depressed, and trying to get over an emotionally abusive guy I had been around for over a year.

scoatney_hall,"Typical beginning. I dated a whole lot of jerks and was verging on desperation and/or spinsterhood. My best friend was having a lot of luck on a dating site and convinced me to join. It seemed like a failure at first. Then one night, I was watching a movie about a character from a certain part of the UK and thought the accent was cool. Randomly searched for guys from that area on the dating site and checked a few profiles out, but didn't initiate contact because I figured no one would want to start something with a girl in America.

A few minutes later, I got a message from one of the guys whose profile  I looked at. We wound up talking for hours and kept in contact. Long story short, I planned a trip to meet him but my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I scrapped the idea for a while. He got a girlfriend in the meantime, though I was too overwhelmed with my mom's health issues to think about it. Once she got better, I went to Scotland with a friend who insisted that we meet if I was going to be in the UK anyway. Turns out, he and the girlfriend had broken up a few weeks before I got there. We meet in his home city. After a lot of initial awkwardness due to my social anxieties, we hit it off immensely and I left the UK with a long-distance romance.

We went back and forth between America and England for three years. It was expensive, it was exhausting, but it was also incredibly beautiful at the same time. We had ten airport reunions. The last airport reunion was when he came in two weeks before our wedding. We cut the visa process close, but we got it by the skin of our teeth. 10 days later, we were picking up his mom and friends at the same airport. That was a year and a half ago and this has been the best year and a half of my life.

Everyone always thinks that how we met was the fairy tale, but the fairy tale has been everything that came after. We've had a lot of obstacles in our way, but at the end of the day, I married my best friend who I somehow managed to meet from thousand of miles away. He's the funniest, most intelligent person I have ever met. We're usually laughing within the first 5 minutes we're awake and in the 5 minutes before one of us (usually me) falls asleep. I've never felt comfort with anyone like I have with him. I could go on and on, but I'll just sum up by saying I didn't know this was possible. And it's all because a friend had to push me into starting a dating site profile. Fun fact: She also met her husband on a dating site and we're all best friends now. Thank you, internet.

LiveLoveDance,"Last year, I felt so unlucky in love. I'm a college student, and I was desperately hoping to meet some new people. This new girl in one of my classes (who is now one of my best friends) took me out to a frat party on campus and introduced me to this guy. I can't explain that moment, other than to say sparks flew. There was literally magic between us, I was so caught up in the moment, that it wasn't until after I went home that night that I realized I forgot to get his number. Luckily my friend saw how into this guy I was, and was able to contact him again. 
It took a while for me to get up the guts to go on a date with him. For some reason I was scared that those sparks wouldn't be there anymore, and I would be devastated. But you know what? Sometimes you just gotta get up and do it. and I did. That was about a year ago, and we are still joined at the hip. I can't believe how lucky I got.

suicidal_reverie,"Well, uh... This has a sad ending but I like it. :) Here goes:

Freshman year of high school, I was kind of a hopeless loner. Didnt have any friends since I'd switched school districts; ended up spending most days in total silence. One day I finally talked to that cute girl named Natalie in art class, and she smiled and actually *talked back* (No one ever talked to me when I talked to them, so this was a pleasant surprise), and we had a nice conversation during class change.

Next couple days, we break the ice some more and become semi good friends. One day, I get a random text message. It's from her; she'd found my page on Facebook just to get my number. I'm normally stupid about this kinda thing, but I got the hint this time; it was obvious she was at least a *little* interested.

We ended up becoming amazing friends through text messages. She became my sole confedant, and I hers. Well, three weeks after I first talked to her, I asked her out. It was New Year's Eve, and I'd already worked the entire date out with her parents (how she'd get there and all). She said yes!

An hour later my brother drives me to her house and her parents drive us to a nearby theme park (we were both freshman, not old enough to drive), then let us stay there til the next morning since the park was open and monitored the whole night due to it being New Year's Eve.

We rode some rides for a few hours and then ate at one of the ""fancy"" (it was disgusting and overpriced) restaurants in the park. Then we got in the ridiculously long line for the ferris wheel, but we were lucky: we managed to get on at the perfect time to be at the very top the minute the ball dropped.

It was possibly the most clichéd moment ever, our first kiss. Top of the ferris wheel on New Year's Eve with fireworks going off in the background... It was *magical.*

Fast forward a year and we're still dating; I'm convinced I'm going to marry this girl. Her brother, a complete and total stoner, is supposed to drive her home; she has no clue he's high. He runs a light and gets t-boned by a semi. She dies instantly, he gets a few scratches.

gummybaerchen,"**TL;DR: We met. Tried not to fall in love. Fell. Had to go back to my country. He drove 3 days to meet me and almost died. Together since.**

We met in a bar, the day we both were supposed to meet other people but they didn't show up. Coincidence.
I was planning on leaving the country three months later (I was working there for a year and wanted to go back to my country because my work contract was not going to be renovated), we kept hanging out together but we tried not to get too atached because we knew we would separate short after and there was nothing we could do against, and we also didn't wanted a long distance relationship.

Well, we did get attached, and two weeks after I took the plane to go back to my country, he decided to drive for 3 DAYS straight to see me. He drove trought 4 countries. I freaked out and took a plane as soon as he told me he was driving, to meet him somewhere in the middle of the way. The day we were supposed to meet, he would not respond. I waited for hours. I arrived there at 7.00, and waited until around 14.00... I thought he just said that as a cruel joke that i took too serious and never took his car, or if he ever took it, he died in a crash and that's why he would not respond his phone or call me.

Well... he finally calls me. I was already crying, because I didnt bring money with me to go back home since I thought I could drive with him, and I didnt tell anyone I was there. He told me where he is, not far away from where I was, and run there. He got mugged, and they broke his car window. He was calling me from an internet shop. He had to beg for gasoline and sold something just to get where I was.

We spent 3 days more in the road with no money, no food and drinking water from service stations... until we finally got to my place. The thing is, we realized we were in love with each other when we had no food, no bed, we were both smelly and tired... but happy, because we were together.

and so are we since that moment :) we have been together trought poverty (like right now...haha), and also trought good times... but we don't care we have nothing at all, as long as we have each other. ",null,0,cdptgae,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1
Dinosarah,"I'm making a website for this exact thing, so here's a rundown of this. 

We met in 2009 in Marching Band.  We both had friends who were somewhat popular who we tended to cling to.  Our friends became friends and everyday we were sitting next to eachother not really participating in the conversation.  I remember the first day we met, he said something and no one believed him.  He got really annoyed with us and made a pouty face for the rest of the meal.  Looking back, I find this really cute to think about.  One day he said something rude to me like, ""why are you here and not with the other girls?"" I was in colorguard and he was in band, but I never really was close to all of them as much as I was to my other friend, A. A was the one who was friends with my boyfriend, Ryan's, friend.  So I just told him that and we didn't really talk for the rest of the year in marching band, to be honest.  Eventually, the schoolyear began officially and we had a class together. 

In Spanish class I found him annoying, he would be the one to ask the teacher dumb questions like, ""Are we supposed to answer the questions in Spanish?"" and she would say, ""No. Mandarin Chinese.""  My friend Tiffany was convinced that he was super hot, though, even though I couldn't see it at the time.  I had my eyes set on different guys, one in specific I dated. 

Oddly enough, dating this guy was what made me see the great things about Ryan.  The year passed uneventfully, except that my ex and my current boyfriend talked sometimes, this caused tensions later on, but I will get there when I get there.  We all would spend anime club together and take pictures and laugh together.  

The next band season we took our yearly trip to cedar point.  On the bus I sat next to A, Ryan sat in front of us by himself.  During the ride he fell asleep, but we still took pictures of us around him and messing with him.  When he woke up I asked him who he was going to be with, he said no one. I am a huge follower of the buddy system, so I told him to join my group.  He agreed. 

My friends eventually dispersed to do their own things, leaving me alone with Ryan.  I was upset to have been left alone by people I cared so much about, so I forgot to drink water. In 90 degree weather.  I obviously got dehydrated and began barfing everywhere.  My mom didn't know what was wrong with me, but Ryan did.  He took care of me when I was sick and basically forced water down my throat and comforted me about it.  This was one of the first times I started to see that Ryan was a great person and this meant a lot to me.  

Sophomore year went by with very little movement afterward, but I did like you as a person and we talked a little bit more that year, which was great.  A big deal in the progress, however, was that my relationship with the other guy was getting worse and worse.  He made me feel bad about everything about myself and was weirdly controlling and I just was completely unhappy.  

By the summer, I hated everything about him.

That summer was my junior year and third band camp, this was the first year that I started to get sick everyday.  I threw up a few times and spent a lot of time with Ryan. We ate lunch together everyday and I was so happy with him, and we got closer everyday.

Meanwhile, in my other relationship, I hit a breaking point.  I ended it leading to months of stalking and depress.  Ryan would talk to me and his role never changed.  He always made me happy, even through the horrible things.  He got a lot of shit from my ex for talking to me and all of that, even into our relationship for almost the entire first year, my ex still texts me to tell me he's an asshole, but that doesn't bother me. 

In December that year I realized how strong my feelings were and I Realized I would explode if I didn't let him know.  I knit him a scarf and gave it to him and gave him a letter to show him how important he was.  We didn't start dating until 6 months after my last relationship ended.  In that week was his birthday and we began being inseperable.  We didn't kiss for 6 months, we were always together. And we've been dating for 2 years since.

In that time I've shown him all of baggage and I gained a little brother through an affair my parents had and everything got better through time for me.  I'm completely happy and Ryan still makes me ecstatic.

charlie2292,"My story is pathetic. I'm pathetic. I met her when I was young, even before high school. I was relatively new to this school but I already knew most people by that time, apart from her. Some friends were talking about her and I didn't know who she was, so they pointed her out and my god, it was like I had seen an angel... It may sound cliché but I really have never experienced something like that again. I've had a few crushes before, this was very different.

I was still pretty social back then so I didn't really have any trouble introducing myself and I learned she lived nearby. From then on I just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. When I was playing on the streets I would always check if she was out aswell or when we were at school I'd try to be around her as much as possible.
We've had some good times together, some are definitely highlights of my life. Most likely not as meaningful to her as they are to me however.
 I honestly didn't try having a relationship with her. If she wanted it, heck yeah, but I didn't want to force it in that way. I just enjoyed being with her, I was happy. 

But then of course the clouds got darker. See, my brother was also in love with her but he didn't approach it in the same way. He told her pretty much right away and he got rejected. He didn't give up though and made several other desperate attempts to confess his love to her. Eventually she got fed up with it I think (can't blame her) and she insulted him by calling him a fatass. We've always been larger than most kids, not obese or anything, just bulkier. I've always been pretty insecure about my body and this certainly didn't help, since I was a few kilos heavier than my brother. It didn't change the way I feel about her though. I simply realised she doesn't feel the same way about me, or atleast my chances would be very low. 

Then my parents split up and we had to move and change schools. We lost touch. The whole family situation (stepmom mainly) had quite an impact on me. To put it short: became very insecure, got addicted to computer games which made me lose pretty much all my friends, and my social skills are zero. Got fatter on top of that. Still didn't get back in touch with her.

This went on until my last year of high school.  I started thinking about what's gonna happen after high school. I had zero ambition. I started looking at some possible educations and decided studying IT would be my safest bet. Then I looked at what colleges/unis would be possible and I noticed she went to the one that stood out the most. Some other good stuff happened aswell, which made me realise it isn't all that bad and some changes made me lose my MMORPG addiction. I started going to the gym which made me lose quite some weight. Life was starting to get better.

Skip to my first year in college. I wanted to see her so badly but I'm so fucking shy and socially awkward. My appearance improved a lot but I'm still fucking insecure. I checked when and where she would have class and I'd try to 'accidently' meet her. This went on for a few weeks but I never saw her for some reason. Until one day it finally happened. There she was, so beautiful... I got so nervous I could barely walk and I definitely didn't have the courage to go talk to her. I walked past her and hoped she wouldn't notice me. This went on for the rest of my first year. I saw her a few times but never had the guts to go talk to her. 

Now I'm in my second year. I lost some more weight but still very insecure, shy and socially awkward. I already saw her a few times in the first period but again I always chickened out. Until one time I just thought ""fuck it"" and I finally said hi. It was fucking awkward... She was so nice to me but I just didn't know what to say. It turned into some awkward smalltalk. I wanted to know so much about her but I just didn't get to it. Now I'm still trying to 'accidently' meet her on the subway and have a second chance...

Even after all these years she means so much to me, eventhough nothing ""serious"" ever happened, and she probably couldn't care less about me. She's what has kept me going for the last 3 years. Without her, or atleast the idea of her, I would have ended up much worse. I just want her to be a real part of my life again. I don't want to be just a stranger from the past... I'm pathetic.",null,0,cdpu3uq,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1

lil-praying-mantis,"When I was in high school I had a douchey football player as my ""first boyfriend.""  He was a terrible person to me, I don't know why he even wanted me in the first place. I was never popular, just a plain wallflower. All he wanted was sexual favors and never got it, and when I found out he was asking out my cousins (who told me right away) he beat me for trying to leave him. Punched me in the face. Got away with it completely.

After him I had instant love at first sight with a boy in the hallway, our eyes locked and I was sold. I'd take shortcuts in the hallway to pass by him every day, i'd rush to my class in hopes that he was slow putting his books away... and I could've sworn he smiled at me. I found out he was an 11th grader who was a very nice boy; had this reputation of being friendly to everyone. He was perfect, but then I found out he football player and tried to force him out of my mind. How could I date another guy, let alone a football player again? 

I graduated high school miserable, especially because I never told him how I felt. He probably didn't even knew I existed. I met guys in college who I just couldn't get past being friends, nobody compared to this guy I never spoke to. I gave up and found him on facebook, flat out confessing my creepy love to him. It turns out he felt the same way the entire time, he creeped on me too and DID give me that cute smile. He wasn't a jerky football player, just a sweet guy who liked the sport enough to join the team.

We instantly became best friends and dated shortly after. Since he was a year younger I went to his prom and graduation, everything I wanted to do with him when I was a senior. Now I had my second chance. He's my absolute best friend, I go everywhere with him. He's exactly my other half who I've always wanted in a boyfriend, such a charming guy. He wants to marry me within the next few years and I'm looking forward to spending my entire life with him. Nobody in the world is better than him.

**TL;DR:** Got in an abusive relationship with a football player in H.S, fell for another guy who ended up being a football player too. I tried to force him out of my mind to prevent pain again, but caved in years later and confessed my love to him. Turns out he felt the same way, we lived happily ever after, and I love him to pieces.",null,0,cdpu4wm,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1

toridoubleyew,"At the time, I was in high school and living in the Middle East. This was back when FB still had proper groups I was a part of one, along with a about a hundred or so others. We made/shared old school memes, awful, scum of the internet type stuff. It started off being a way to pass the time during the summer, but soon I was hooked. It wasn't long until I started contributing and started online friendships. Since it was probably 2008/2009, MSN Messenger was still alive and kickin'. One day, out of pure boredom I started a conversation with him about what he would name his first child. She'd be called Mia. That started a friendship between him in Brazil (where he was for school) and myself in Kuwait. A year, exchanged pictures, and hours of late night chatting later my family moved back home to Seattle, Wa, USA. He'd been back home in Ontario, Canada. In January 2010 we admitted to each other that there were definitely feelings. In August 2010 we met for the first time at SeaTac Airport.

Fast foward to Novemeber 2013- we've been together ever since. I've had two trips to Canada, he's had three to WA. Unfortunately still living apart to to immigration/costs. Engaged since Decemeber 2012. I haven't seen him in person since August. I tell him I'll come for a visit in May but what he doesn't know is that I've planned to surprise him for Valentine's Day.

NowWithMoreChocolate,"Winter of 2008. I was 13 and had just joined the girls basketball team at school in order to impress my ex because I still liked him. On the way to the game, we passed by a performing arts school. The girl I was sitting next to on the bus, Olivia, commented that she went there and we got into a huge discussion about it, resulting in me deciding to join. 

Fast forward a few weeks to that day. Our first lesson was Dance and as I walked into the dance studio, I saw a guy of my age sitting on the windowsill on his own while everyone else was standing around the room, talking to their friends. I asked Olivia who he was and she said his name and said that he didn't really talk to anyone in the group.

Now, I suffer from slight social anxiety. To this day I still hate the thought of having to talk to someone I don't know unless they speak to me first. But something about this guy just drew me to him and before I knew it, I was standing it front of him, introducing myself and getting into a conversation about Doctor Who.

I liked him as more than a friend within 6 weeks of knowing him. He took about a year before having an epiphany into realizing that he liked me back. However we both only realized that the other one liked us back after 5 months of his epiphany when, in a game of truth or dare, he got asked whether or not he would date me if I asked him out.

We dated for a month. We broke up and I ended up dating his friend for almost 3 months. Broke up with him because I realised I still loved my SO. Got back together with him, dated for a year, broke up again. Got back together for a week, broke up again. It then took us 6 months to finally get back together, including a period of friends-with-benefits. We've now been together almost 2 years and I couldn't be happier.

The break ups were all my responsibility, me doubting my emotions and breaking up with him because I was scared. I am so thankful that he has always taken me back. He loves me more than I can comprehend at times and sometimes I can't believe how lucky I am to have found someone that has that much love for me. He looks at me as if I'm the universe itself. He'll do whatever it takes to make me laugh or to cheer me up even if he ends up looking like an idiot. He takes care of me when I'm sick and makes the best grilled cheese and ham sandwiches IN THE WORLD.

I'm now about to turn 19. I can't see a future where I don't end up marrying this guy and I wouldn't change that for the world.

ahohako,"Forenote to the story: my partner and I (of 2 1/2 yrs now) lived in the same state during our childhoods, of course, never knew.

Met on a relatively obscure ('urban') gay social networking site. Neither of us frequented it much and were both at the stage of being content single. My wife lived in the midwest and I on the east coast. We were never too far from each other, it seems.

Gwenji,"Get ready for a rock and roll love story to rule the others....

I lived in a big house when my roommates were moving out and I needed to find new ones. I searched for months to no avail when my roommates said they found 2 guys to take over. They were friends of theirs and music majors at the local university, which was perfect for me and I knew we would get along. The first time I met them they visited me at work and I fell in love quick and hard. 

His name was [DT], he looked like Jim Morrison, dressed like 80s Keith Richards and acted like axl rose. A few nights after we met, I came home and found DT on the porch, drinking whiskey, smoking a cigarette, van halen blasting through the window. He was wearing more jewelry than me, nose ring, vest but no shirt, tight white jeans and shit kicker boots with his feet propped up on the ledge around the porch. From that moment on, he's never left my mind.

We started hooking up immediately. We were young and ripe to party, and every weekend it was another Kurt and Courtney type escapade. We would make out on tables in bars, in our yard, no concern as to who saw what because we were in love. I'd go to his gigs and he'd make me feel like I was the only person he was playing for.

Come Christmas we had been officially dating about a month and I was late. Sure enough, I was pregnant, and we weren't ready at all. We decided we were going to give our son up for adoption pretty quickly, and that meant our lives had to change. No more parties, no more recklessness, and we crossed our fingers hoping there was more to our relationship than that. We got lucky, because there was most definitely more to us. Through the entire pregnancy and post adoption fog, DT was there. I became a part of his family, which was something I had never had before, and through their love and his I became a better person.

We eventually broke up, but it wasn't for lack of love. The adoption had changed us both and to be the best versions of ourselves we could be, we needed different things. We are still good friends, his family and I still speak and we will forever be a big part of each other's lives.",null,0,cdpud6g,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1

We ended up staying at the third pub because the lines were getting long. This guy super drunk walks past knocks into me and spills green beer on me, while trying to talk but he was to drunk to talk. His friend came over and apologized to me and sent his drunk friend home (the drunk friend lived in an apartment on top of the bar so it wasn't far), I ended up getting pretty drunk and making out with the friend. My friends wanted to leave and I wanted to go with them, so we said goodbye and I never expected to see him again. 

Two weeks later I was getting a coffee in ANOTHER CITY and here was this guy again, we exchanged numbers and he called a week later for dinner. We went to dinner but I was leaving to go to see my parents in Australia so I said I'd call him when I got back. He found out from my roommate my flight details and picked me up at the airport with flowers and a nice frosty bottle of water, I was pretty shocked and to honest a tiny bit concerned that he was a stalker. 

We spent a great summer together, we just had fun with each other ""hey I am going to teach you to fish this weekend"", ""We should really hold rifest in your backyard for weekend"", ""So I saw a deal to buy a kayak at the local pawn shop, wanna get it?"" (we sank the kayak as we packed too much food and wine, we are not smart people). 

Then one day after 6 months he said ""I think I should meet your parents"" I sort of said ""Well they are in Aus, it is kinda far"". We both had good paying jobs so we found tickets and made plans to go, snag was I hadn't told my parents about him so basically it was like ""Um Mum and Dad I have a boyfriend and we are coming to see you in three weeks p.s Can he stay at our house?"" That did not go down so great but after my parents met him they loved him. We came back to Canada and talked about if I was going to stay in Canada as I had an option to take another year contract so I did. From then on we have just been a stable couple, dated a couple of years, got married, move from one side of Canada to the other, then China then Chile. We just fit each other. We have made sacrifices for each other, career and family wise but we (fingers firmly crossed that we continue to do so) just completely ""get"" each other, we talk our options though, I think the success of our relationship  boils down to the fact that we each want the absolute best for each other.

I met my current boyfriend last September through mutual friends. I thought he was really attractive but didn't do anything about it until he started talking to me more. Soon he had asked for my phone number, and I was still convinced that there was no way this guy could have feelings for me. After that, we hung out on campus between classes, just silently doing homework beside each other because I was too afraid of messing it up (which feels so silly to say now!) and one day he finally asked me out on a date. Even then I was still not 100% convinced that he was into me. We had an awesome first few dates, and then just before Halloween he asked me to see The Shining with him at the student movie theatre on campus. That night, for some reason, is my favourite date of all. We went for pizza, then we went to the beach and held hands for the first time, and we made out under the park at the beach for an hour when it was raining. This was a big deal because I had a lot of insecurities about being intimate with him from previous relationships going bad, but that night was just perfect.

JohnScolaro,"I'm currently in one. But it's kind of sad and happy at the same time.

So there is this Canadian girl I met 2 years ago at a science camp here in Australia. And I didn't just love her instantly at the time, I just thought of her as an extremely interesting girl, and loved spending time with her. After our short two weeks together, we were both crying when she had to leave, and I gave her a kiss on the forehead.

Another 6 months later, she came back to Australia and stayed a week between my friends house, and my house, and then flew to Sydney with us all, and stayed for another week! During this first week, my friend and myself all slept together on the same bed. So me and my awesome Canadian (let's just call her Felicity) got some great cuddle time over the next few days. We spent all day together every day, and I just loved being with her, and around her every second of the day. I suppose it was around here I fell in love with her.

Since then she has came back a few times, and I could run you through everything we did on each of these time, because they are all so clear in my memory. I really really love this girl. She is actually incredible. The most enthusiastic, amazing girl I've ever met, and it's really hard to go 6 month periods without seeing her.

We have sent each other one really long message before bed, EVERY single day for the last 1.5 years.

And in another 6 months, I'm flying to Canada to stay for another half a year :)

My dad did nothing but bitch and moan, then exploded at me the next morning since he was kept up past his bed time, and proceeded to throw a tantrum that made my mom refuse to come to thanksgiving lunch. My dad drove by himself, my brother and I brought the gifts my mom and I got the night before on the way home, and everyone enjoyed themselves.  My dad left a short while after the meal instead of staying as long as everyone else, my brother and I were still around and being family, and that was that.

**tl;dr** - Dad's an asshole, everyone's pissed at him for his bad attitude, the rest of the family gets closer since he opted out of it.

The TV was broken and his head was bleeding profusely. The baby was okay, but the noise scared him and he cried all night.

Of course, that same year New Year's Eve was spent at our ranch with the extended family. Same uncle decided to pop some fireworks...near the hay bales. It might have been fine had it been the smaller fireworks, But no. This man had to tie multiple medium sized fireworks together and lighted them with a Sparkler.

And once, On another side of my family(I have a stepdad. real dad died when I was about 5) We gathered at this church(I think) And ate together. Usually, we are the only people there, so the gym is empty. One year, though, there was a volleyball game going on. I went in the gym and-get ready for it- Started shagging out of bounds balls. Yep.

The man: My Cousin (34, M, sporting a beer gut and a t-shirt declaring it to be the 'fuel tank for a sex machine') Frank

The woman: his niece Sam (16, F, incredibly well endowed)

The encounter: Sam was going to leave, and she was saying her goodbyes. A hug for grandad, a handshake for the other adults, kisses for us little'uns, and *nothing* for leery Uncle Frank. Well, Uncle Frank, four gins in, decides this was nothing more than a temporary oversight, charges her, and gives her the biggest, creepiest hug my four-year-old self had ever seen.

After leaving her visibly shaken, he turns around to the rest of us, raises his arms and declares:

Laugh_With_Me,"I had just moved out. I was renting a furnished room from a lady my mother had found for me. What I did not know was that although I was paying for the room, my mother had her own key and was in constant communication with the homeowner. The homeowner had seen fit not to tell me, either.

I was invited back for Thanksgiving, but arrived to find my bed destroyed. I don't mean packed away or sold or something. My sister had thrown my mattress into a pool so I ""could never return."" So I was not in the best of moods when I had to go to sleep the night before Thanksgiving on the floor. I was in a worse mood when I woke up in an empty house to a ringing phone.

My mother proceeded to yell at me about the state of my apartment and the dustbunnies she'd found while moving my stuff. I asked her why she was at my apartment and also why she was moving my things.

She was moving me back in. The homeowner had decided to sell the house and move literally days after I'd moved in, but had never bothered to tell me.  I looked around for my car keys in the hopes of intervening, but she snapped at me that she'd had my sister take it so they could carry all my things back in one trip with the two cars. While I was trying to wrap my head around what was happening, she proceeded to yell at me for not being there to help move my things.

That's right. She'd intentionally hidden from me that the owner of the room I was renting was about to move away, tricked me into ""visiting"" with no intention of letting me leave, taken my car while I slept, had snuck out to move all my things back in without my knowledge, and was now screaming at me for not being there to help.

mrchososo,"From family experience of a coma post accident, not medically induced, my understanding that the idea of a coma as most of us think of it is wrong.  It is not like it is binary i.e. you are in a coma or not.  Rather there is a continuum that people are on and that can vary whilst they are in the coma ie get deeper or shallower.

This is best reflected by the [Glasgow Coma Scale](https://www.headway.org.uk/glasgow-coma-scale.aspx).

The other thing to consider about a patient gaining consciousness - and mentioned in some comments here - is the amount of drugs in the patient, their other injuries which may make them incapacitated and simply being in ITU.  ITU is a scary place if you're waking up confused, in pain and can't move.  There are a lot of machines making odd noises, you've almost certainly got wires and tubes going into and coming out of you.  And for a while your field of vision will be limited to what is immediately above your head, or perhaps a bit more of the ceiling if you can move your neck.  Your nurses may well be wearing masks and almost certainly everyone is wearing scrubs and aprons.  I heard a story that one patient had a phobia of bananas after a time in ICU.  Turned out it was because all they could see were the yellow aprons and they weren't able to process what they were - their brain decided that it was walking bananas.  Sounds amusing, but indicative of real mental strain of ICU.

My family member had very slim chances of survival (let alone coming out of the coma) but thank goodness they did.  I'm convinced that constant family presence, talking to him and simply holding his hand helped. I wish you all the best.",null,2,cdpjzgp,1rowy0,AskReddit,hot,12

Upon waking, I genuinely didn't believe my friends that it had been a week until my parents told me. My body was unbelievably uncomfortable. Not really in pain but I just felt extremely restless and stifled. I felt like I needed to pop/crack every joint in my body. But for the most part, it felt like falling asleep and waking up.

If we gave it over we had nothing to worry about and the party wouldn't get busted.

One day he was stopped on that bridge before the toll for excessive speed. The police officer asked for his driver's license. He gave him this cover with the license. The police removed the license from the cover and proceeded giving my uncle a lecture on how excessive speed was dangerous, bla bla bla. But the officer never issued a ticked and let my uncle go.

DRDeMello,"King Philip's War.

People are generally familiar with the meeting of the Wampanoag nation and the separatist  Pilgrims from England that culminated with the ""first Thanksgiving"" in 1621.

A half century later, in 1675, after Plymouth Colony had grown exponentially, and southern New England had seem the formation and growth of Massachusetts Bay Colony, Connecticut Colony, and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantation, the Wampanoag went to war against Plymouth.  

This turned into an all-out war of cultures, with the European colonies all siding together (notable because everyone outside of Rhode Island hated Roger Williams) and most of the tribes of the region fighting together (the Wampanoag and their traditional enemies, the Narragansett, along with the Nipmuc and Nauset tribes).  

Interestingly, several ""Praying Indians"" gave their loyalty to the colonies, and played pivotal roles over the course of the war.  Also, the Mohegan tribe aligned itself with the United Colonies (PC, MBC, CT) and Rhode Island.

The events of the war were incredible.  

The fighting was done in raids rather than battles, the colonists got whipped in the beginning, the tide turned in the winter with a massive preemptive strike against the Narragansett (who had been neutral, but were not trusted), there was an attempted alliance with the Mohawk of the Iroquois nation that could have swung the balance of war, Plymouth was attacked, Providence was burned, western Massachusetts was retaken, until eventually the outnumbered and outsupplied native coalition ran out of steam.  

The war ended Metacom/King Philip returned from Iroquois territory to his home at Mount Hope in Pokanoket (modern Bristol, RI) and was shot through the heart by the brother of one of his own men.  Amazingly, the remaining Wampanoag escaped the raid on Mount Hope by their octogenarian missinge (war chief) named Anawan.  Anawan had known Metacom's father, Ousamequin (better known as Massasoit, which was his title), and would have presumably have been alive through the plagues of 1616-1619, the landing of the pilgrims, the souring of the relationship between the two cultures, and the war itself.  Anawan was later captured out in a swamp with the last remaining warriors trying to take back their ancestral lands. 

King Philip/Metacom's body was drawn and quartered, and his body parts were hung from a tree.  The Praying Indian who shot him got his hand and head as a souvenir; he sold his head to Plymouth, where it stayed on a pike for over 20 years, until--the legend goes--a Wampanoag climbed up and took it back. Anawan was promised safe passage by Benjamin Church, the commander of the men he surrendered to, but upon his return to Plymouth he was executed.

The war was incredible for the historical impact it had.

The war devastated the nations that had inhabited this land.  Their cultural influence in the region would not recover.  The survivors of the war were either executed or killed.

Not having a written language, much of the native history in the region is now lost--and that which we have is filtered through the pen of a colonist.

It essentially won southern New England for the European colonists, who in a mere 50 years had arrived and taken complete control of the region.

The modern United States Army Rangers originated during this war.  Church organized them amongst the United Colonies, and they received training from natives friendly to the colonists.  There is a direct lineage to the rangers Church organized to the modern rangers.

The fighting was brutal.  This was total war that surpassed even William Tecumseh Sherman's march through the south.  Every man, woman, and child was fair game, and were frequently killed.  Towns and cities were targeted, fields were plundered and burned, and livestock were stolen or slaughtered.  It was a war of cultures, not a war of armies.

The war galvanized the colonies and their citizens together in a way that was new and unique.  Notably absent in the war were the British--it was American colonists that fought and died together.

The new spirit of togetherness and self-sufficiency, combined with the guerrilla tactics learned through this experience would be revived by the colonists in another major conflict that originated in Massachusetts.

In terms of casualties, there are some experts who rank this war as the bloodiest that we know of to ever be fought in North America.  That is to say, as a percentage of population, this war possibly killed a bigger portion of the two sides fighting than any other conflict.

For such an important and dramatic event, I'm really surprised nobody has taken on the war in a major audiovisual production.  The biggest restraint would be time--to tell the scope of the war (the causes, the fighting, the political ties, the long weary terrifying year that it was for both sides, the effects, etc) in a typical two hour film format would be nearly impossible.  My own opinion is that you'd have to go for a trilogy format (which would be an expensive gamble) or go with a TV miniseries (which, until Game of Thrones changed things, I would've said could never work).

There are many moments in this conflict that would translate beautifully to the silver screen though:

The prelude showing the treaty and Thanksgiving feast as the cultures met and bonded in 1621

The arrest and death of Massasoit Wamsutta at the hands of Plymouth (didn't even touch on that, this is getting long, look it up; one of the soldiers that arrest him, Josiah Winslow, later became governor of Plymouth during the war)

The meeting at Mount Wachusett where the Wampanoag and Nipmuc decide to make war. 

The violence and brutality of the raids, and their emotional impact.

The raid on the Narragansett winter fort in the ""Great Swamp Fight.""

The plea of Metacom to their enemies of the Iroquois Confederacy.

The elderly Roger Williams (who was a true friend and ally of the natives) watching his city of Providence burn to the ground, while the warriors around him spared his life.  (In a film, he'd catch glances with a warrior and share a knowing look.)

The death of Metacom, shot through the heart on Mount Hope, by a ""Praying Indian.""  (You can't make this up--in Hollywood they'd call you a sap for overdoing it on the symbolism, but this is exactly what happened.)

The desecration of native bodies, living and dead after the war.  Surviving natives bound in chains. Metacom's proud body being torn apart, a heroic figure who deserved so much better.  Then, after the credits roll, a silhouetted figure climbs the pole to take back Metacom's skull from the pike on which it has been stuck.",null,0,cdpv168,1rqg4n,AskReddit,hot,1

hotcamaro22,"Such an awesome thing to think about. I am trying to stay away from it in my mind but I just keep going back to it.. 
The year is 2009 and its February 20th. I know it because its 5 days before Ash Wednesday. I am in my mothers home town in Mexico visiting for Carnaval. I have taken my non spanish speaking boyfriend with me. He is visiting Mexico for his first time. We get settled in my small house on the out skirts of town. Make the bed with fresh sheets, take advantage of the freshly made bed by getting into them and experiencing the all time ""take your breath away"" moments of all time. Only the first of many to come in that day. Get cleaned up head out on the ranch. Grab some horses and heard the family cows out to graze and drink water. He had never been on a horse before. I can still remember him attempting to mount and failing.. We road the horses out for miles. Green pasture in every direction as far as the eye could see.. A few hours later we came back home and messed up the sheets again.. Cleaned up and headed out in my suburban, got that thing stuck in the mud... we piled lots of dead branches in the rear tires to give it traction.. I reved it up and spraid mud all over his face.. I got out the truck and laughed so hard in this face.. he hugged me and got mud all over me... we fell and rolled around in the mud till an old man walked by and asked if we needed help.. after some pushing and reving and more sticks we got the thing un stuck... 
Covered in mud we head back in the house.. Showered cleaned up and messed up those sheets once more for the road.. by than we are famished... headed into to town we grabbed some amazing shrimp cocktails at the mercado. We had a few beers with some friends .. roamed around the town, sang with the mariachi, laughed, enjoyed the day... lots of little moments that are engrained in my memory forever... 
than we headed out to the plaza de toros to watch a bull fight. Ate lots of yummy food, drank lots of great tequila.... 
hugged, kissed, held each other like we couldn't possibly let go.. So we didn't... The day was amazing.... 
I would gladly re live it over and over.... 
and having the full conscious of it I can always alter small details throughout the day.... But really that day was perfect.... 
Not a care in the world, just living the moment and enjoying each other.....

PDaviss,"I've actually thought about this exact question too many times.BBack in may of this year was my favorite day not because everything went right but because it's one of the few days where I felt proud of myself.  Here we go:
It was the last friday for senior, I was one at the time, so all my classes were slacking. My friend's parents were in chicago and gone for the weekend, so the only logical thing to do is have a reefer party at his house. In our group of friends was this girl who I had been crushing on for two years. I'm shy as fuck, but somehow i got enough courage to ask her if she wanted to chill after school. She said yeah. The end. 
Nah, just joking, anyway she wanted to get a piece so we went to our local sketchy gas station/headshop. On the way there we talked and laughed and shit, and we ended up planning on going to the party together. 
At like 8, we head over to the house. She told on the way over that i couldnt cuddle her because her prom date was coming and she didnt want him to find out us. She said wait until he left. Trill. 
It was a normal reefer party, lot of smoking and food. At one point the girl says we should watch Spaceballs, which is my favorite movie. 
At midnight, everyone left her and i. Literally within 2 minutes of her date leaving we were cuddling. Yes. We're all super frosty and somehow we ended up watching public access television. Jamaican and old people dancing has never been so amazing. Anyway we fall asleep still cuddling. The next morning I drop her and felt like King Shit.

But I think my connections with old friends back home would have continued and they would have continued to be my main social group. One hs girlfriend had a different social group so I imagine I would have gotten to know them as well; the other pretty much hung with the same groups I did back then so if it was her then I'd still be in those social groups.

He was really nice at first, a little bit rowdy and energetic. He wasn't the brightest either but I enjoyed being with him. But then things got serious. He told me he was going to commit suicide twice and I stopped him both those times with false promises. He had family problems with his parents and little brother. And he would cry a lot. So the first year ended and then things between us went kind of downhill. He wasn't doing good in school - like D's and C's. I'm an A student so I didn't really like that. But I tried to help him study and stuff but he just didn't want it. He committed himself to being a firefighter because he ""wouldn't have to go through as much school"" through a program. And then he started looking down on me and saying really hurtful things that punctured my already low self esteem. We began to constantly fight and he became very possessive over me which I hated SO MUCH. So, we eventually broke up. He cried. A lot. I didn't. Because I'm still in high school I do see him quite a bit because of our mutual friends (that he said were his friends and not mine). So, if we actually got married that would have been not the best.

I would be across the country, still pursuing my same dreams of being a firefighter and a paramedic, participating in rowing at the college that I had applied to, and probably in a very cold and distant relationship with someone who had no time for my antics and spent her life traveling and doing politics. But instead, I'm still in the same side of the country with someone who cares deeply about me. I can still chase my dreams just as effectively here. I suppose I'd have been happy there too, a bit more independent surely (definitely colder), but there's always a chance that perhaps I would wonder about what would have happened if I had stayed, if I ever would have had someone that was coming home every night overjoyed to see me every day, someone who loved me in the same way.

But my friends take one look at them and just see the big ridiculous SPESS MAREEN covers and just crack jokes about lame and silly and over the top they must be.

There was another instance where I picked up a book that had a female protagonist on the cover, and she looks over and my friend says ""wait, that's not a big refrigerator man, that actually looks like a real character.""

It just grinds my nerves because yeah, I know it's a universe based on a tabletop game, but it's actually a really rich lore and I enjoy it. But whenever I try to explain its not just over-the-top silliness they just kinda blow me off as a fanboy.

Phallic,"OK, so, there are three possibilities in our future.

1) We can never make a computer as powerful, versatile and individual as a human brain.  It just defies our comprehension and technology until some disaster or disasters cause our extinction, and when we disappear the human brain is still the most powerful computation unit we have.

2)  We can only ever make a computer *just as powerful*, versatile and unique as the human brain. We essentially discover a way to duplicate human brains in an artificial form (or even using original organic materials so we just make clones of brains).

3)  We find a way to create computers that are more intelligent than human beings.

Now, let's think more about option 3.  What happens then?  Well, for starters, a single human is suddenly no longer the most effective thinking and creating machine we have.  Suddenly, this computer is better.

So it makes sense that we should, at the very least, collaborate with this machine and *take its advice over our own understanding*.  We should actually defer to this machine given that it is a better thinker.

So when that machine helps design and build the *next* generation of machines, what then? Well, we could still have an input, but the best thinking will happen when the first generation machines and the second generation machines collaborate, or when second generation machines collaborate with each other.

So what happens then? Well, humans become increasingly (and very quickly) obsolete when it comes to being at the forefront of science and technology.

Suddenly, these machines are ""standing on the shoulders"" of machines before them that *already* vastly outstrip the human power of intellect, and now the rapidly expanding vanguard of knowledge and technology is no longer in the hands of evolved biological machines, and instead is being performed by intentionally built thinking machines.

What then, for the role of humanity?  It's no longer about us at this point.  We're a point in history, a direct ancestor, and certainly an incredible turning point in the history of consciousness in that we represent the transitional point between evolved and engineered intellects, but we're still basically obsolete.

So what will we be?  Adored pets?  Doted upon ancestors?  Ignored biological trash?  

We have no way of knowing, but if we indeed get to the point where we develop superhuman AIs then our entire meaning, purpose and place in the universe will be challenged in ways that they have never been challenged before.

It's fascinating, I'm totally happy to talk about it.

Somewhere in the distance they see a big farm with lights burning. Full with hope they use their last bit of strength to walk there. They knock on a huge wooden door. The door opens and an ugly fat repulsive woman asks them what they want. ""Just some food.. We are starving!"" one of them said. The woman takes a look and says: ""Sure, you can eat whatever you want but you have to have sex with me afterwards."" One of the guys takes another look at the stinking sweaty woman and decides he rather dies outside than have sex with her. The other one takes his chance and follows her inside. There's a big table with a lot of food: Turkey, chicken, fruit, swine and lots more. He starts eating like a maniac while the woman looks at him. ""Your eating is making me horny"" she said. The guy gags a little but manages to keep eating. Once he finishes the fat woman grabs his hand and says: ""I want you to fuck me in the barn"". As she pulls him along he manages to grab a big corncob. She undresses and lies down. Her belly is in the way, so without her noticing the guy manages to use the corncob to make the woman squeel and have an orgasm. The guy leaves but not before he manages to steal a big turkeyleg for his friend who's probably starving outside. He starts looking for him and he finds him with a big grin on his face. ""I brought you some food, thought you might be hungry"" he says. ""No need"" says the other one.

Raiders takes place in 1936.  For the second movie, Spielberg did not want to have Indy go after Nazis again, but that would not make sense with the timeline.  By 1937 and after the rise of the Third Reich was a huge fucking deal.  So very quietly at the start of Temple of Doom, the date appears as 1935--the year before Raiders.

Anyway, Raiders--the sequel--is much better than Temple of Doom.

I'm starting to research the CARs (Canadian Air Regulations) on what is, and isn't allowed when dropping items from an aircraft. If I can do it legally, I think I'm going to drop some stuff. I know a guy who's family owns an open pit mine for concrete. When the trucks return, they dump their remaining concrete into the old pits. It's super thick concrete that is junk. Could drop stuff from 1000' onto it!

What should I drop? Watermellon and Ice for sure...

[I've volunteered to do golf ball drops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6trHS-lSvcE) before for charity tournaments. It's always a challenge to get close to the pin from 500' or higher. 

EDIT for ideas on things to drop:

 - Giant bag of flour?
 - Watermellon
 - Block or ice balloons
 - CRT TV

EDIT #2: 

Okay... [This... is happening](http://imgur.com/a/FTNLQ) I have no idea what is in it, or what the combo is, but it's just been give to me by the guy I rent office space from... 

Also being dropped

 - The bass
 - 2 watermelons. 1 frozen, 1 not
 - Balloons of paint
 - Balloons of Glitter
 - an old porcelain toilet
 - a small building (Lego maybe?)
 - 2 litter soda bottles
 - 5 gallon water jug
 - as many bouncy balls as I can buy for cheap.
 - a abnormally large banana with a picture of a regular sized banana for scale

Items on the maybe list

 - I really want to figure out how to fill a blowup doll with vegetable soup like was suggested

 - Kayne West if available

Well over the months, these water bottles kept building up in his room. There were probably fifteen or so of them at any given time. Eventually, his roommate INSISTED he get rid of them. 

After unsuccessfully begging people to take them, the two of us lugged them all up to the unlocked dorm roof. If I recall correctly, the dorm was five stories. Knowing what we were doing was extremely stupid, we turned to one another and then launched them off the roof.

The resulting noise was AMAZING. It sounded like a rapid set of explosions had gone off. Everywhere within five hundred feet of the dorm was SOAKED. The guys who lived on the bottom floor were rightfully pissed. It was so worth it. ",null,93,cdp6rws,1rnv9o,AskReddit,hot,464

One day, two golfers were sharing a day together on a golf course. The first golfer was a preacher, and the second was his non-Christian friend. They played the game for a while, and the scores were evenly matched, until the second man missed the hole.

""God dammit, I missed!"" He said. The preacher looked at him and said, ""Don't say that, or the Lord will strike you down."" They moved onto the next hole, and the man repeated his earlier exclamation after missing it a second time.

""God dammit, I missed!""

""Don't say that, or the Lord WILL strike you down,"" the preacher reenforced.

Finally, the men got to the last hole, and the preacher swung his club and perfectly landed the golf ball in the hole. His friend, however, missed once again, and recited ""God dammit, I missed!""

Suddenly, a thunder bolt came from the sky and struck the preacher. A few seconds later, a deep booming voice from the sky said ""God dammit, I missed!""

Moses tees off first and, due to a sudden gust of wind, hits the ball straight into the lake. Moses walks up to the lake, parts the water, walks to his ball and hits it onto the green. He then sinks the ball for a par.

Jesus goes second, he has a great shot, but another gust of wind sends his ball into the lake. Jesus walks across the lake, spots his ball and reaches down with his club, hitting the ball onto the green, where it rolls straight into the hole for a birdie.

The old man slowly makes his way to the tee and makes a terrible first shot, landing just in the lake at the waters edge. Suddenly, a frog swims out of the lake and picks up the ball in its mouth. A large bird spots the frog and swoops down, catching it with its talons. The bird carries the frog away, passing the green below.

Lisaland,"I broke up with my boyfriend of nine months after his girlfriend informed me she had been with him the last three years, and they were still together.  Swore to me he wouldn't see her.  Showed up unannounced and she was there, on the couch, next to him.  Broke up again.  Refused to talk to him.  Over the course of the next six weeks, he broke into my house, poured water down the back of my 52"" plasma tv, stole items of emotional value, stalked me, keyed my car that I had bought six months ago and reported to my boss I was selling drugs out of her office.  (Not true). Endless texts and phone messages at all hours.  Finally got a Stalking Protective Order when he left a voicemail message that said ""I'm going to kill you bitch"". 

He spent 30 days in jail and got out after pleading to a class A Felony.   No previous felonies or jail time.

Left me alone for four months.  Then texts and messages started arriving from unknown and blocked numbers.  Begging me to meet him so he could say he was sorry and return my stuff.  Three weeks of this.  In retrospect I should have reported him for violating SPO, which carries a mandatory minimum.  But I didn't.  Foolishly enough, I met him with the hope of getting my stuff back and that he would then leave me alone.

Ended up dating him again for about three weeks, then realized he was still the same pathetic loser I could never be happy with.  When he showed up to take me out last Saturday night as prearranged, I just couldn't do it.  I just didn't want to be with him.  Not even for dancing and drinking.  He hung out two hours hours while I did other stuff, and finally said he was going hone, he was tired.  Great.  Finally.  I then left for some pool at my favorite bar.

Ran into, what I thought was, his ex.  Nope.  We started talking and sharing texts and pics only to discover he had never broken up with her!  He literally was either with her or me, leaving my house for hers and vice versa!  While chatting she receives a text from him inviting her over for movies.  I said of course he did, I cancelled on him!  We decide to set him up.  She replies she'll be right there.  Then I text him saying I changed my mind and decided to come over.  He then texts her and says something came up, gotta cancel.

We arrive at his home arm in arm, a united front, both deciding neither of us want to be with the lying, cheating, idiot.  We also commit to supporting each other as friends.  

While all three of us are standing there, and she is civilly laying it out, I start looking around and thinking about all he hurt I've allowed him to cause me, and I started loosing it.  I did something I've never done before.  In an act of pure freedom, hurt, anger, and self loathing, I threw my arm out in a wide sweep, taking out a lamp, tv, and Bose speaker system, that all crashed to he ground, complete with the sound of breaking glass.  He threw me on the ground.  He pinned me.  We exchanged punches.  He is screaming at his adult niece, who lives with me to call he cops.  His ex and niece are screaming back that if she does he will go to jail because of the SPO.   They repeatedly order him to let me go. I manage a few feet every so often towards the front door until he rep ins me.  Finally I break free and we are out of there!

So me and his other girlfriend go to my place and stay up talking until 4 am.  Real life plot twist:  she's been MARRIED for the last ten years!

Sunday afternoon the sheriffs office calls.  Apparently he demanded we both be arrested and jailed for assault, burglary, and that I pay restitution!  We talked a very long time, and he also called the other chic he was seeing, that I was with.

Monday morning he was arrested on SPO violation, and he remains in jail.  The cop I spoke to sounded more than amused when I shared my part of the event, and assured me none of the females involved were going to jail.

I am 51, in fact, all three of us are.  I own my own home and have worked in the lea gal field for over 30 years.  I'm a Notary Public for Gods sakes!

This was my first relationship in 8 years.  Being single the rest of my life doesn't sound so bad .

leak_proof,"I was about 10 years old. Father died suddenly  a few years before, which was a trigger for an older brother's schizophrenia. One day, our mother was working, he had a troubling episode. He decided to to kill us. Me with his hands, and then him with a knife. I struggled to to get away. He kept swinging with his hands, then the knife. Fuck, the soulless anger in his eyes is what will be forever burned into my mind. I finally get a bit of an upper hand when I started to swing a bat. I was able to get him out of the house until the cops could show up.  After they nearly kill him in the struggle they take him away. I remember a chaotic scene that felt like it took an eternity to play out, but was more startled by hoe quickly all that chaos descended into silence, then into me crying in the kitchen, alone, for while. After are bit I realized, well I don't remember what I realized. I stopped crying and just got up. Cleaned the house up a little. Then walked over to a friend's house. We played some video games (atari 2600 and pitfall for those in r/gaming) and I listened to him complain about the KD his mom made not being cheesy enough.  I lost faith that day. Faith in a lot of things.

EDIT: Grammar and spelling.

EDIT 2: AFTERMATH: My mother never really knew what went on that day, as I never really told her. She did well, and despite all that crap raised the rest of us, got us through university and one to our lives. My brother in the story ended up institutionalized after this and bounced in and out of hospitals, switched between his meds and heroin, he finally lost his battle with addiction either accidental or intentional a few years ago when they found him OD'd. I lost one brother to suicide a few years after the death of my father because he couldn't handle the switch from our great family life one day to schizophrenia fueled chaos the next. 

That day changed me but I seemed to have turn out relativity fine.  Finished university, found and married a great woman and have a chain of successful small business that keep me busy. No kids, too afraid to pass along the crazy gene but have a noisy house full of animals. I work hard, have someone that loves and am I wake up day a little happier than the last.

I got to have the Spirit and was baptized at eight, other kids didn't get my blessings.  I once mentioned this to my mom: that I seemed unfairly advantaged.

Managed to convince myself that none of it bothered me, until one summer it all came to the surface and I couldn't push it down anymore. I knew nothing about my father, and suddenly I wanted nothing more than to find out who he was and why he wasn't with me. I had this picture of him in my head as this really great guy who was just waiting for me to reach out to him. After a lot of fighting and months of begging for information, my mom finally told me the truth: that he walked out on her before I was born, got married, moved out of state and told her to never let me contact him because I was just a mistake that he wanted to forget. I was crushed. I decided to try and contact my father figure, who I hadn't seen in 8 years. Found out he had turned into a wife beating son of a bitch who I was better off without. After that, I tried to reach out to the people around me for some source of comfort, but no one cared. My friends were all too selfish and immature to even try to help, and my mom was emotionally unavailable and actually became very verbally abusive during that time. I remember sitting on a curb near my house at 3 am one summer night, realizing I had no one who really loved me and everyone had walked out on me even though I had done nothing to deserve it.

hqvlbw,"My family is in the Chinese restaurant business.

We always encourage our customers to go back and eat more, because we want our customers to be satisfied. It's extremely difficult to make a profit in the restaurant business, and with a buffet, it's pretty much impossible. Where we make money is not from restricting the total amount of food any one person eats, but by **getting more customers in the door.** Part of that is making sure our customers are happy so they will come back again and again, and bring their friends.

The average human stomach can only hold a certain amount of food. A box, purse, or table, however, can hold MUCH more food. We don't mind people filling their stomachs with food. We do have a problem with people stealing food by trying to eat their fill and taking additional food home without paying for it or wasting food by piling their plates high and then leaving mounds of uneaten or partially-eaten food on the table. The deal is you pay one price to fill your stomach and that's it. You do not get to take extra food home or waste food by leaving it on the table. There isn't very much we can do about people who are disgusting pigs, however.

A bigger problem than the total amount of food is the high value items like shrimp and other seafood and meat. Some people who are very greedy and selfish like to pick out all the shrimp and other expensive ingredients. We lose money on people like that. They also tend to give us a hard time by complaining a lot.

There are a lot of nice loyal customers, but there are also a lot of assholes in this world. Working in a restaurant, you learn a lot about how greedy and selfish people are on the inside, no matter how fancy they might be dressed or what kind of car they drive.

------

Edit: There are a lot of people being defensive about picking through a buffet for choice morsels. Is that your prerogative as the customer? Yes, please feel free to choose and eat what you like. The point of a buffet is choice. But there is such a thing as common courtesy and not being a greedy asshole who ruins everyone else's meal and deliberately tries to take advantage of a family business that works very hard just to get by.

Many people have a very selfish, spoiled, and entitled attitude when it comes to food. I wish people just took a moment to think about how much effort went into their meal. Plants and animals all over the world are harvested and slaughtered, cleaned, processed, frozen, refrigerated, and put on planes, barges, and trucks. They travel thousands of miles to get to the restaurant, where hours and hours of manual labor are required to turn those ingredients into food. When that food is put on a buffet, it immediately starts to dry out and/or turn cold. Within a matter of minutes, it's less than ideal and people don't want it anymore, even when it's perfectly edible. Customers complain that the food is old and start verbally abusing the restaurant workers, demanding they bring out fresh food. An insane amount of food is wasted every day because of people's greed. Operating a buffet is a gamble. You put all your chips on the table and hope that you get something back.

Oh, and happy Thanksgiving! If you had to cook a bunch of food on a deadline for a big demanding crowd today, I hope you think about the people who have to do it every day.",null,843,cdp6xyc,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,2597

They were 12 inch pies so its a decent ammount of food, about 3 pounds of food (give or take).  We also has salad and wings and stuff, but not a lot of people went for those so he never really talked about it.  HOWEVER, drinks are where we made the most money.  To buy a drink there was $1.95.  On average you have 2 glasses of pop Which costs us a little less then $0.05.  You would have to drink 80+ glasses of pop in order to break even.

The cashier/hostess always gives him an odd look when they see how heavy the container is. We cook our own rice at home and just get the good stuff from the restaurant. By doing that, then for about $7, we can feed 7 people (a family of four and then 3 more meals for whomever the next day).

*Edit: wow, some people got really worked up about this. People take huge piles of food when dining in at a buffet, stuff themselves into a coma, and then waste what they can't eat off their plate. Or as some people have mentioned, they go just to eat only crab legs. If a family wants to gorge on a huge meal with multiple trips into the line (minus items like crab legs or steak), then 7 bucks a person makes sense, and the restaurant has already accounted for that. Yet they can still get as much of the crab and steak that they want. The square takeout container, filled up but still easily shut, could hold about as much of the typical fare (lo mein, sesame chicken, mixed veggies, 2 eggrolls) that two adults dining in might get. Not including the cup of beef and broccoli which was maybe another $3 I think. No crab, steak, or desserts for us.

Lots of good answers here but it's really a function of what you eat not necessarily amount because food costs vary. 1 lb of king crabs legs obviously costing a lot more than a pound of white rice. 

A great strategy from a previous place of employment that I've seen that works wonders in terms of making the buffet a lot of money is to have a high end signature item like snow crab but also make and emphasize really, really good/homemade high margin items like mashed potatoes, soups, salads, and even fried chicken. 

People get enamored (and full) with the homemade stuff so don't eat as much of the signature (i.e., expensive) item.

In that buffet we would average 1.5 pounds of snow crab per head where the average among our competitors was in the 3-4 pound range which is obviously very meaningful when snow crab runs $3-4/pound.

Basically this is an uneven comparison. The better method would be to compare a buffet with another restaurant of comparable class and style to the buffet. Ie. high end buffet with comparably high end restaurant, or vice-versa.

ArcadeNational,"I work in management for CiCi's Pizza and have for about 2.5 years. I've worked with the company for 5.5 years. Now the buffet in Columbus, OH costs $4.99 ($5.34 with tax) just for the buffet w/o a drink, which includes, pizza, pasta, salad, bread sticks &amp; dessert. As a manager we look at a rack of 15 pizzas as $100 in sales. It divides out to $6.66 dollars per entire pizza in sales of customers coming in. So each slice is .66. If you just use simple arithmetic, you come up with the number of 8.09 slices you'll need to make it worth your while. In an ideal situation, the patron would get a small/medium salad, 3 or 4 slices of pizza and maybe 1 or 3 pieces of dessert, depending on the size of the salad they chose. That ideal patron would be eating a proper serving sized meal and would easily make their money's worth by just eating the proper serving size since the higher cost of the desserts and the salad would equate out not having those other slices of pizza. This unfortunately, is NOT what people tend to do. The vast majority of patrons who enter the restaurant tend to eat far more than what a proper serving size would suggest and easily get their money's worth in their first run through the buffet.

As others are mentioning, we don't have a primary focus on making sure people minimize their food consumption while in the restaurant, we make our bulk from the sheer amount of patrons that enter the restaurant and pay for a buffet and a drink. The drink costs $1.99 so that's where we make some of the money also. I would actually say it's a *horrible* idea to tell somebody they cannot eat a certain amount of one or any food at an all-you-can-eat buffet, which *all buffets are* unless you pay for *only* certain portions of the buffet (e.g. only buying a salad for $2.99 instead of the entire buffet and even then you can have as much as you can eat of the salad but only the salad bc that's what you paid for).

Buffets are actually great for value if you find the right ones. Since I happen to be in the buffet business, I get to see many other buffets and I realize that they are all *drastically* different from one another. For instance, Chinese or Asian buffets are great if they keep their food properly timed and replace/throw away the old food regardless of whether or not the food is running low. There is a time limit for how long you should keep up crab legs and many places are lackadaisical in their upkeep with this time limit which can lead to stiff, hard, mushy, soft crab meat depending on what their parameters were set to and how well they cooked it to begin with. Restaurants that take pride in keeping their businesses clean, stocked and fresh are the places to look out for because you'll easily get your money's worth by eating there. CiCi's for instance, you can feed a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids [ages 4-10]) for $19.21 which is a bargain since the food isn't of bad quality (no Micheal's Stake House quality but it's better than pizza hut's frozen dough [Source: used to work at pizza hut] and it's better than McDonald's pink goo chicken nuggets), you can eat as much of it as you want and if you want you can eat a healthier portioned serving size. This value isn't just for CiCi's Pizza. There are other buffet's out there that are pretty great, you just have to find the right ones.

I hope this has been some help.",null,19,cdpa2v2,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,67
N1trobunny,"Finally, something relevant to me! I manage at a locally owned buffet in Winnipeg, Manitoba and am in frequent contact with the financial aspects of the food. I'm by no means the accountant, but I see the sales:""/ food cost/ etc.

When an average customer comes in to the restaurant i work at, they pay ~$20 for dinner. Of this, about 40% goes to food cost.
What is food cost? Food cost is not only the money spent on food eaten, but also the money spent on food that has been burnt/expired, or wasted when customers come in and take more than they eat. 

The question you ask is a hard one to answer, because i'm not sure if you want the amount necessary to eat your money's worth of bulk food, or if you want to eat enough for us to not make a profit. 

Out main item is roast beef, which is about 2.59/lb. if you want your money's worth of roast, you're looking at 7.7 pounds of raw meat (or about 4.5 cooked)

At this rate, it seems like you're set to lose money, until you consider the other costs involved. Labour cost on a slow day can be above 30% due to the high cost involved in running and operating this style of business. Our home-made soups and menu have our cooks there 5 hours before we even start serving. 

With the cost of cleaning, maintenance, Water, rent, etc. it quickly becomes clear how little we actually make per person.

I'm going to ballpark it here, but i'd estimate we make around 2-4% profit out of the cost charged to each person. 

That being said, you can get your money's worth by simply eating 45% worth of food, or  2 pounds of cooked roast beef. It all depends on how you look at it.


Sorry if I fail at grammar, I'm really tired today, but i thought i'd try and fully answer you.

And by the way people, going straight for the meat may end up filling you with more expensive food, but is your money's worth really considered by how much you cost us, or how good your dining experience is? Many of my favorite dishes at our buffet are low on meat or vegetarian even! You don't need to hurt the business you're dining at to get your money's worth.


Tl;dr ask for a 7.5 pound hunk of raw meat and you should be good.",null,8,cdp25df,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,50
hotelerotica,"I own a small restaurant which obviously isn't a buffet but I have an idea of how much food costs, If your looking purely at trying to get ""your moneys worth"" as far as food goes. I glanced at my food providers list and i can get a steak for 3.5 a pound so if your buffet 12 dollars you'd need to eat about 4 pounds, however in all honesty even if you eat 2 pounds your probably eating more then they assume your going too and are effecting there profit, for everything on my menu my food cost is anywhere between 20-30% so my 8 dollar burger 2.66 is for the food itself, 2.66 for payroll, 2.66 for everything else and hopefully some profit",null,15,cdp1m3n,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,53
Asdyc,"If we think about the economic concept of sunk costs, it really doesn't make sense to stuff yourself to the point of feeling sick of throwing up. Once you paid for the buffet, that's money is gone. They are not going to give you the money back if you eat 50 pounds of food. The money we spent on the buffet is a sunk cost and can't be recovered. Really, just eat as much as you want. It doesn't make sense stuffing yourself until you feel sick or throw up. I rather just eat what I can and be satisfied. It's isn't worth it to stuff yourself, throw up, and gain more pounds. It isn't healthy. ",null,17,cdp6ali,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,50

Spartacus777,"So, as ruler of the world... what sort of world do I inherit?  Is it like every government of the world suddenly ceded all power to me?  Or is it more like the United Nations, where I would be the central figure over different heads of states (Only with some sort of power over the other nations)?  If the world is unified, does that mean internal conflicts between all countries have ended?  Is there a centralized military, or is that up to me to dismantle previous national militias and create a (scaled down) World Police force?  

Regardless of those issues:
Generate incentive based funding for Energy, Science (Including Space exploration), Transportation, Environmental remediation, Medical exploration, and Global nutrition/Clean water.  (Similar to the Gates Foundation model)

Begin cultural campaign to diminish importance of collecting material wealth while promoting the benefits and status of people who help their neighbors.
Aaaaand...since all countries are all unified, the now unified world bank means tax havens and loopholes are much easier to close.  

Massive reforms to copyright legislation.

Education reform, in that standardized curriculum is pared way down.  Teachers and Professors are in charge of determining their curriculum, best teaching methods for their classes.  Curriculum is encouraged to teach practical life skills expanded to encourage appreciation of nature and manual labor (home-ec, Shop, gardening, basic animal husbandry).  

Drug reform.  Legalized, quality controlled, heavily taxed, provide safe places to use and dispose.  Black market sales of tainted quality risk life in prison or execution.

Correctional institute reform.  It needs to reform prisoners.  Teach useful life skills.  After following a curriculum of basic life skills the capstone to their learning, is to develop a life plan for once they leave the prison.  Allow them to work while incarcerated (auto repair, farming, computer programming, etc) and apply that money toward their life-plan, such that they can more easily transition between release and regular life.

Healthcare.  Eeeeesh, what a cluster.  Unhealthy lifestyle choices are taxed heavier (cigarettes, alcohol, junk food, sugars / desserts).  Procedures for people unwilling to make lifestyle changes will have their treatment priorities diminished and/or their co-pay will be increased.     

Tax Reform.  Taxes are flat, and based on consumption, not earnings.  Luxury items and items that require more natural resources are taxed heavier.

Prostitution is legalized.  Men/Women must be of consenting age, tested every few weeks.  Taxation offsets clinical costs of test/treatment.  Pimps for underage children are given life sentences or executed.  

Zero tolerance for religions that preach or practice violence.  Anyone who kills others for religious reasons will be executed and have their remains publicly desecrated, according to their religion (pigs blood, excommunication, whatever).

Francis_S_Key,"Horrible food and diet. 

I used to be 280 lbs. Over the past year and a half I have dropped 95lbs. 

I used to have 3 full meals a day, 10-15 alcoholic drinks, and a late night McShittles run (like full on meal). This lasted for 5 years. I hated myself and thought about suicide daily (I was also underemployed college grad in the middle of the recession) 

So basically I completely reorganized my life and broke so many bad eating habits.  

I exercise regularly, eat healthy and low calorie during the week, and pig out on the weekend.  It has been amazing. Girls like, you know, actually give me attention now. 

Learn from my mistakes reddit! don't let yourself get super huge. Also it is never too late to change your wicked ways. I never in a million years thought I'd be wearing the clothes I wore in high school again. Persevere my friends! It is remarkably achievable to lose the weight!  

My biggest pieces of advice are to incorporate exercise in your everyday life, change your diet dramatically, and count your calories religiously. If you have a high calorie day, have two very low calorie days, or fast, for a day. This works wonders for me allows me to binge eat for a period as long as I use my powers of self control for a longer period following the binge. As far as exercise goes, walking and biking everywhere (I do live in the city though) and also I have a physically active job which was CRUCIAL to losing the weight. I would make my job more active than it needed to be (take the long way, take the stairs, carry heavy boxes instead of using carts, or hand trucks etc) Eventually I got a stationary bike and some 25 lbs weights and do cardio, curls, and also sit ups, pushups, and bicycles/flutter kicks. The human body is amazing and can transform itself completely in a relatively short period of time.  YOU CAN DO IT!! It's totally achievable.  

I've also been experimenting with fasting and it works wonders. I fasted for 72 hours before thanksgiving and lost 10lbs. I weighed myself this morning and was up 6 lbs haha, but that usually goes down fast with exercise and low calorie days.

I'd be voraciously eating up anything new that caught my eye, and if I latched on to an anime I'd go crazy looking for info - and trust me, there's no shortage of stuff to dig up and read. Official interviews, online and offline. Every single forum thread and blog post on the show. Even subtle comments on animators' blogs picked up from an unrelated 2ch thread. It got to the point that I was structuring my life around real-time broadcasts so that as soon as it finished, I could furiously refresh nicovideo to grab the latest unnamed LQ stream and load it in the minutes before it would get removed.

I did get some good things out of it; I got a lot better at reading *and* writing Japanese (communicating with other fans), I learned a lot more about online culture in that time than I ever have since, and I got a lot better at digital art, too. I had so much energy.

But eventually life moved on and shit happened, and I found myself wanting to run away from it all for a while, so I latched on to some other interest. Watched less and less anime, eventually sticking only to ones I really absolutely wanted to watch, until even they started to seem a bit silly. 

The turning point was when I didn't visit my main forum haunt for a whole month as I had moved to another country. The desire just never came back, and when I moved into a house that had a low bandwidth cap, I just stopped altogether. On the other hand, it ended up being a symptom of depression (anhedonia), so it was a bit shitty... still, even after getting better, I've never regained the interest.

I'm kind of glad I did that because now it's even easier to get completely caught up - staff twitter feeds, legal streaming, more direct marketing to Western audiences... It's not like anime is bad per se, far from it. But I had been taking it too far and really blinkered myself.",null,0,cdpiq3h,1rp8su,AskReddit,hot,10

I left a trail of psychologically damaged women, and I'll never be able to reverse the damage I inflicted upon them. Seeing what I've caused showed me how destructive my personality was. I thought about never dating again, and in recent months committing suicide. But I choose instead to change, and be proactive. I've done some heavy introspective detective work, and I've also been practicing exercises that allow me to put myself in the shoes of others, and to realize and reverse the error of my ways before or as they happen instead of in retrospect.

It's an uphill battle, even to this day, but I feel like my approach to women is much more healthy. I still wish I could reverse the emotional damage I've caused other people to have to live with, though. It's unfair that I've burdened people with trust issues, etc. and possibly prevented them from having unhealthy experiences when my experiences with them inspired me to improve. I still think about suicide when I think of that. Is it fair for me to live in a world I've made significantly more awful for others? But I wouldn't do it.

Also, feminism played a big role in my recovery, but I don't feel right calling myself a feminist after how I've treated women.

In reality, although the extra money is nice and I have been able to afford several things I've been wanting to buy for years, as someone who used to smoke everyday for at least 4 years, it's been a bit of a struggle. 

Unfortunately, my depression has reared it's ugly head for the first time in 5 years since I first started smoking trees. I've cut down fairly big (for example, it's Friday and the last time I remember smoking was Monday night) from everyday to just mainly weekends/days off. But my depression has hit me like a ton of bricks over the last month. I started smoking weed every day in order to keep myself regular. It basically saved my life. Without it, I would have killed myself years ago. 

It's cool have a little bit of extra money each week but I should consider going back to smoking every day.

Puffsdangerfield,"The whole idea of ""Black Friday"" is now a farce. Rarely does anyone save any real money. There is quite a few reasons why:

1. If you have camped out for longer than 24 hours, You have probably spent more money in preparation and expenses than you would have saved in the difference between actual and markdown price. 

2. Quite a number of items sold on Black Friday are cheap versions. Some TVs will be made in a cheaper version just for this special purpose. 

3. If you took any amount of time off to shop on Black Friday, you have lost pay. If you used paid vacation or paid leave, you have still lost, since that is time you earn. 

4. All items sold on Black Friday will be sold at a much smaller price in the off season. Look at the cost of shorts in the fall and coats in the spring. You also have deals like this for electronics in low buying seasons or when the newest models of anything are about to be rolled out. (And everyone knows if it is a gaming console, you are gambling on the quality of product for the first few months of its roll out. Look up the problems with both the XBox One and PS4.  Same thing as the Windows hype back in the 90s.)

5. If you spent money on any object, you didn't save anything. A TV marked down from 200 to 150 didn't save you 50 dollars, you spent 150 dollars. 

There is also other things like the mob mentality that takes over. People are scary in that mode and I avoid it like the plague. Besides, most of that crap is not needed, especially as far as gifts go. It's great if you have the money, but most don't, who the hell needs a waffle maker for Christmas that bad? Most of the time it will get used once or twice and then chucked in that place where kitchen gadgets go to die.

camu2012,"there was a really horrible bully at my small, private, christian school (he was the vice principal's son) who could get away with anything.  I could write quite a long essay about all the fucked up shit this kid did to other kids, especially me, but i'll just hit a couple memorable highlights.

one time he got the idea to stick long thumb tacks between his fingers, point side down, and walk up to other kids, me in particular, and ""pat"" us HARD on the back, leaving tons of tiny stab wounds.  the teachers favored this fuckwad so much that when he did it and we would shout out in pain, we would get in trouble for disrupting class.  one time he even attached one to the end of a yard stick and was tapping kids on their head from a distance while they sat at their desks.  really fucked up if you ask me.  Once he slammed a really long tack into my leg and left it there, sticking out of my leg.

another occasion that comes to mind is when, on picture day, right before I got my picture taken, he came up to me for no reason and punched me extremely hard in the balls.  while I was leaning over in pain about to vomit, his friend and co-conspirator came up and punched me in the balls again but this time harder.  I saw red and almost did something but I was surrounded by other kids and teachers, and knowing full well that nothing this kid did would get him expelled or even so much as in trouble, I feared what would happen to me as a repurcussion.

I check this guys facebook page about once a year hoping that he is like.... miserable or something.  Nope, he has a really hot girlfriend, a great job and he makes enough money to own a bunch  of horses and ride them whenever he wants.  Hope he gets in a horrific boating accident one day.

Edit: posted this before my 20 hour shift at the mall for black friday.  Just now seeing how much it blew up while on my break.  Turns out this is by far my top rated comment.  Thanks for that :)  Just so you know, I really have moved on and I live a very happy life now free from bullies haha.  Also: no, I will not give out his name, number, address, or facebook.

I'd say the worst thing that the bullying ringleader did was having almost every boy in my grade (catholic school so it was small) write me a love letter.

Finally the bully challenged Mike to a fight after school when a lot of kids were outside waiting for their rides home. Mike was obviously scared but handled it really well. He just said ""look I don't want to fight, why can't we just be friends?"" - And it actually worked.

That boy is in my grade, so a little bit older. And he is super popular, and a total dick. He finds happiness in other people's distress. He's on my bus, and he's done some pretty fucked up shit to me. Anyway, he said yes to her. She was super, super happy, of course, but he's doing it as a joke.

But, since she doesn't understand that he doesn't really like her, she's had the best week of her entire life. Being a slightly special needs student, she was very excited that a popular guy accepted her.

Whenever I went onto the pool deck, they would moo at me. Before practice, before races, whenever the coaches weren't there, they mooed. It got to the point where they were doing things in school too. I couldn't go anywhere in that building without having a mini-panic attack.

I graduated 2 years ago. Recently my high school had their football states game at my university. One of the younger ones went and they saw me. I got the fuck out of there before I beat the shit out of him.

Who the fuck moos at someone who is obviously trying to lose weight? Needless to say, my self esteem is destroyed and I have massive trust issues as well as a fear of my high school.",null,18,cdp8ija,1rnzzb,AskReddit,hot,80
onichris,"I posted this in another thread:

Sort of a weird one but most of the kids I rode the school bus with in middle school really didn't like this one girl for whatever reason. We had assigned seats and noone was assigned to sit with her, everyone around her just made fun of her. For awhile she had been complaining about the bus stinking and everyone chalked it up to her being a bitch. To make things more interesting, the bus ""barn"" or wherever belonged to one of the kids moms and our bus was always just parked at her house. Turns out, her kid and his friends had been pissing on her seat everyday at home and letting it dry. We all found out the day he decided to announce it to her when she woke up from sleeping w her face against the seat.",null,10,cdp5pj2,1rnzzb,AskReddit,hot,72

He was pointing out to the bully some trick he messed up or something like that. The bully was standing over him and didn't want any insults, naturally, so a swift key to the head was the obvious proportionate form of retaliation towards something this important. The kid tried to laugh it off as every head in the room turned to the kid after his head created a dent in the locker. It was kind of fucked up.

Throwaway15728481838,"Changing after gym class in 7th grade. I was the harmless, nice, quiet and shy kid, and a bit of a loner. I was in front of my locker about to put on jeans, and this guy comes and pulls a knife on me. Big fucking knife, mind you. The blade itself was at least 8 inches. He says ""dance monkey"" and forces me to start jacking off in front of him. He's holding the tip of the knife to my throat, so I have no choice. I reluctantly start as he continues to threaten me. 

As if things aren't bad enough, he pulls out his phone and starts recording this. At this point I am on he brink of crying out of fear and humiliation. He showed the recording to his cronies and I became the laughing stock of most of the school for being ""gay"". That was the start of a long and hard rest of middle school. 

However, that ended when my family moved and I went to a different high school than the rest of my class. Went into some good sports where I had a fresh start with nice people, and still am today (junior in HS).

On several occasions during those two years, I would stand alone in my house, parents away, and hold a knife to my throat, or my dad's home-defense pistol in my hand. I has to force myself to think of the good side of life and be optimistic to stop myself from doing it. Honestly, a middle schooler shouldn't be debating suicide...

Last I checked, these bullies and their leader were in trouble with the law. I believe their ringleader was in jail for rape or drug charges.

Never could talk to anyone about it though, always felt ashamed, embarrassed, and if word ever got out I feared he would come for me.

Youresopleasant,In high school on the bus home there was a girl who was very socially awkward. Basically copped shit from everyone in the year.

Ana_jp,"This happened to my mother. Her father had just passed away from lung cancer, she was 17 when he died and started university a month later. A few of the mean girls from her old high school created a plan to have a guy ask her out and then stand her up. To take her down a peg because she was apparently stuck up, when really she was depressed and in the early stages of grief. My mom went and waited, then went home to her empty house and attempted suicide. 

Years of eating disorders, depression, and medication, plus an abusive husband and divorce, she was finally feeling better in her 30's. 

The effects of long term, vicious bullying can follow a person forever. I suffered through 10 agonizing years of it myself. From hair pulling to getting my fingers slammed in doors, all my friends turned against me, being tripped, punched, purposely hit with sports balls. Boys fake flirting and asking me out. Homework and projects and artwork destroyed. It was awful. But I made it out the other side. I'm stronger and more confident in myself because of it. It also made me kinder to others, and more likely to stand up for myself when I feel I'm being threatened. 

My mother says her bullies haven't changed, decades later. And mine certainly haven't. They're stuck in high school mean girl mode forever. I pity them. ",null,12,cdp75um,1rnzzb,AskReddit,hot,51

cavalier_hat,"When I first started high school, I chose to go to the same school as my primary school friends. After starting though, they decided that I wasn't cool anymore although I was still allowed to hang out with them. I was mostly just teased and pushed around for the first few months but I didn't do anything about it because I was going through an insecure period where I believed everything they said about me. 

Anyway, a couple of months in we started hanging out with older 'druggie' kids, the ones that took meth and were always completely fucked out of their minds. They scared me although I tried to 'stay cool'. The teasing continued, mainly because I was getting good grades and getting along with my teaches. Also teased for being ugly frequently, which really sucked coming from older guys. 

The clincher came when one of the druggies set off a few flares in the woods encircling our school. They all thought it was hilarious, but were immedietly busted by the Principal and a few of them got hauled in for questioning. I'm still not exactly sure how it started, but someone got it into their head that I must've told, even though I had been with them the whole time. This guy kept shouting that I was a grass, and soon everyone was screaming at me. Then the shoving started, and they cornered me into a doorway. I was being thrown around and punched, my hair yanked at, my glasses were taken away. Random people started to join in, and I ended up being mobbed by about 30 people. I managed to get away and I ran to the nearest teachers office. My English teacher was in there with 2 others, and they pulled me in and locked me inside the building. What scared the shit out of me though was that the building had glass doors, so I could see everyone still screaming at the door, trying to batter through it. The teachers were just as scared as me, and they had to call the police to calm everyone down.

After that the core mob got a 'talking to' whilst I got sent to the school therapist and told to just avoid them. Right, because that's easy. I had to catch a bus with most of them every day. I was so depressed at this point and constantly being harassed everywhere I went that my parents pulled me out of school and I transferred to another one. Luckily things went well for me there. I learnt to defend myself and took it upon myself to stand up for anyone I saw being bullied. I developed a bit of an anger problem and got into a lot of fights with random people being mean to younger kids but I made a lot of friends and it all settled down. It still scares me though, having had that many people attack me all at once for no real reason.",null,8,cdp96f9,1rnzzb,AskReddit,hot,41

vest816,"The hashtag fad.

FUN TRIVIA TIME!

The hashtag is not new. It was used decades ago in the old usenet days as a manner to bookmark topics and follow discussions in chatroom logs. So if I had a hardware problem with installing an OS, I would ask a chatroom the question followed by #OSInstall

It made a ton of sense. I could go back to the chat log, and do a 'Find' for #OSInstall to find all answers to the question while sorting through any other inquiries in the chat.

However, the combination of easily accessible social media sites and dumb people resulted in the hashtag no longer being a bookmark of conversation, but just a general whatever thing. Advertising has latched onto this, and now putting hashtags in front of words is some zippy adspeak that shows how trendy and hip our retailers are with customers.

Anybody with a lick of oldschool tech sense knows this is stupid. The hashtag in conversations makes a ton of sense, I don't want to see the hashtag itself go away. I do, however, want the hashtag *fad* to eat shit and fall of the planet. It doesn't make an advertisement look hip, edgy, or on the pulse. It's the complete opposite. It makes them look like bandwagoning dolts who claim to love something without any worldly idea why.",null,11,cdpdjxc,1rofg5,AskReddit,hot,29

AlsoTheyReallyDo,"In college, my neighbor lived with his girlfriend and they were pretty wild party people. One day there was a really cute blonde over there and I was invited over to hang out and all. It was pretty cool. That Friday the girl was over again and I was invited to go out to the club with them. Afterwards, we all took a taxi home and were drunkenly hanging out in their living room. The guy and his girlfriend disappeared and soonafter we heard loud sex noises, moaning, headboard slamming against wall, etc. The blonde and I laughed about it and she put her hand on my leg and said ""They sound like they're having fun...I'm jealous"".

I nervously took her hand off my leg and said yea it was weird and I should probably get to bed, anyway.

So, I live literally right next door but she gets up and asks if she can walk me home and I was like ""sure"" and then she follows me in and is sitting on my bed undressing while I brush my teeth, etc. She is in her bra and panties laying on my bed -- it's a twin-size (small) bed so I climb over her and squish myself against the wall and fall asleep.

Even drunk, I don't know what the fuck I was or wasn't thinking. Could I have been THAT drunk, tired, and oblivious? The thing is that the girl was pretty damn cute AND hot but I wasn't dating her and she was a friend so I somehow didn't process all of the obvious signals. I remember having a pretty bad hangover the next morning and driving her back to her place and as she was getting out she sorta grabbed my head and pulled me in for a kiss on the cheek and told me I was a nice guy.

I did find out later that she was quite promiscuous so she was probably just hoping for another notch on her headboard but goddamn did I miss out. I tell myself she probably had an STD to make it seem like I dodged a bullet instead of just a wild night of hot sex.

LovetoGoRound,"TL;DR Was in a long distance relationship and convinced myself that when he came back/sex would make magic would happen. I noped the hell out of there at the last possible moment. 




A few months before he came back he started to stop communicating with me. Our Skype's were him playing video games and answering my conversations attempts with one word answers or nods...""So it's okay"" I thought, ""when we see each other, it will be great."" 


Then it started to weigh on me. I was sending him care packages, letters, doing strip/shower teases, texting/calling/Skyping him first, no effort on his side. I talked to him and asked if he could send me a letter. He said no. He didn't have the money. I thought that was werid...he was living with his aunt a few states away... ""It's all good."" I thought, ""I suppose I understand,""


A little bit more times goes by and I talk to him about it again. I told him I wasn't happy. He wasn't doing anything for me, no texts no calls, no letters, wouldn't let me get to know his aunt or cousins. ( By now I had given up on our Skype conversations, it was now just two hours of silence everyday.) and I was feeling like I was single and showing affection to a stranger. He told me I was being selfish, that I knew how he felt. ""No problem."" I thought, ""I am being selfish. Just wait.""


About a month before he came back I was at my wits end. I was so done I had his stuff already packed. I told him I wasn't happy again. I was sorry, but wanted it to end. He yelled at me through text and Skype for hours. He told me if I had a problem, I should've talked to him about it. That I was just 'giving up' on our relationship/not trying hard enough. That I didn't love him. He asked who the other guy was, he said he 'knew' I was cheating. ""I'm overreacting,"" I thought. ""I wasn't trying enough. When he comes up it will be magical"" We agreed to go on a break until he came back.


During that month, I felt so relaxed. I thought it was just because I was working myself up. When he came back...I felt nothing.At all. I thought, ""It would come back. Just wait."" Then when I was on my back, naked, I looked up at him. He wasn't even wearing a condom. He had said he didn't want it the first time and that it didn't matter, we were going to be together forever. 


Then it snapped into place in my mind. That he wasn't wearing a condom. That I didn't want to risk having a kid with him. That he wasn't showing any affection until he got to touch me physically. That he wouldn't listen to me. That I wasn't in love with him anymore, etc..... All the common sense I should have had before was overwhelming.

Later learned that everyone around told her how stupid she was and asked her why she would want to fuck an ugly piece of shit loser like me.

Two opportunities in 30 years is not great, but it could possibly be worse.  The real problem is that ugly people do not like other ugly people.

MangusKhan,"I am the youngest by far in my family and I only have older sisters. My dad's brother was a very successful, and wealthy, lawyer. He got into heavy drug use and basically over the course of two years he was kicked out of the house and became insane. He would call my dad on his birthday to tell him how much of a shitty brother he was, my dad is an amazing man and this really hurt him. Eventually he threatened the entire family. I remember going to visit my grandma ""when something scary had happened the day before"", when we got there I could see that somebody had tried to ax their way into her house. I'm not sure why he didn't make it all the way into her house, maybe she called the cops and he ran? Either way, she was okay. My parents tried to soften the story a little bit for me because I was so young, but I knew that my uncle was out there and wanted to kill us. 

Skip to when I was 12, my dad got a corporate consulting job and was always leaving town for a week at a time on business trips. He had a lot of guns, and taught me how to use them, clean them, respect them, etc. I did a lot of shooting, which was awesome. He kept a couple of guns in my room, he said it was because ""he didn't have room for them all in his closet"". He told me not to tell anybody they were there, so I kept quiet about it. I didn't think much of it. He would talk a lot about if somebody came to the house and I thought I had to use a gun, that I should worry about protecting the girls and not worry about getting into trouble, not to hesitate while threatening while letting somebody get close, etc.

Eventually my uncle had killed himself. The next day my dad took the guns out of my room. That's when I realized he had them there for me to protect the family, at 12 years old. This isn't something to talk about to the rest of the family. 

EDIT:   Thank you all for all of the replies. I actually had no idea my post would get this much attention. Honestly at the time it didn't seem like that big of a deal, having guns in my room. I grew up with them. I've always respected them and knew we had them mostly for play (we would go to the range a lot), but I also knew they were for protection. My dad never specifically told me that I had a couple of them in my room because of my uncle. And to answer some of your questions: I do not know why he didn't get them to one of my sisters. I honestly don't. Perhaps it's because I was never one to react in a fucked up situation. I watched man jump off of the Golden Gate bridge when I was even younger than this (we were walking across on a field trip with about 60 kids, my mother was with us), and instead of crying or freaking out like the other kids we were with, I watched the man's body float in the water and I just remember thinking to myself and wondering ""what makes somebody want to kill themselves?"". My mom didn't try to make me look away, her and I eventually started doing our best to make my friends and the other kids feel better. A short while later at home my dad pulled me aside and asked me about it, and honestly I was never shaken up over it.

Binary_Omlet,"One of my distant cousins (age late 40s) was heavy into cocaine in the early 80s. On one of his binges he extracted his eyes and ate them. He said it was so he would stop looking at children and finding them attractive. While no one ever talks about it, my dad told me when I was younger and asked who the blind man was at the family reunion. That was his first time being with the family in around 20 years.

Edit:

Since this story has caused some confusion, I wanted to clarify some things. Due to the power of Thanksgiving, I also asked around and found some more information, as well as startled reactions by some family members about me knowing.

* He was in his EARLY 40s IN the LATE 80s (badly written on my part, sorry)
* A combination of HIGHLY religious, Mental health,feelings for his own daughter and others, drove him to the snowy hills.
* His wife walked in on him when she came home early from work, stopping himself from further harm.
* When I saw him, he was pushing his wife in her wheelchair (lost leg to diabetus), so he was her motor and she was his eyes.

He is apparently still alive, wife is not. I haven't seen him in close to 10 years.

When I was told his story as a kid, my dad told me what had happened to him very slowly and seriously. Dad has a moist sense of humor, so I knew he wasn't joking, and not to take it lightly.",null,2093,cdoycpw,1rnbkc,AskReddit,hot,4388

I had a problem with my boyfriend watching porn for years because I felt women were being used and objectified. It was so bad at one point, I felt I was being cheated on if he watched porn.11 years of therapy made me hate therapists and didnt help me much. I got through it with family and friends, even though only 3 people on the planet outside therapists and family know about it.

We all lived there. Anyway, I remember one day my uncle came bashing into the house around 2 in the morning. I heard my dad and mom screaming at him. I remember hearing my uncle say that he had done ""something terrible,"" over and over. He was crying and sobbing. I went to the living room, trying to hide from my parents of course. I seen my uncle covered in blood. He told my parents he had raped and killed someone. At that point my face turned white. I ran to my room. The whole scene reminded me of the old horror shows I used to watch with my mom. My dad told my mom that he was going to go with my uncle to ""clean up this whole situation."" I fell asleep before they came back. The next morning was odd. My uncle had slept over and he was eating breakfast at the table. He tried to cheerfully talk to me, but I was a bit stunned from all that had happened. It was really weird. 

Fast forward about 2 months. I was over at my grandparents house, it was about 8 o'clock pm. My grandpa got a call from my dad saying that my uncle had been murdered. The phone was dropped. My grandpa ran to the back room, grabbed a 12 gauge and ran out the door. My grandma was crying and yelling at him, but it didn't matter. I ran out after my grandpa, he told me to come along. He gave me some speech about how he was going to ""murder some mother fuckers like he did in Vietnam."" 12 year old me was scared shitless. We arrived at this convenient store down the road. My uncle's corpse laid there, rotting in the streets. My dad was freaking the hell out on these copse. There were about 7 policemen including the sheriff. They were laughing and drinking coffee. My grandpa threatened to rip their hearts out or something like that, he was really angry. 

When I was older, I learned that my uncle had raped and killed the sheriff's daughter. However, they didn't have any solid proof it was him. There was some small police call at the store, I think my uncle stole a candy bar or something, and when the cops found out who it was, they took advantage of the situation. They beat him to death with their clubs. Even shot him once in the chest from close range. The whole situation was terrible. I remember seeing that bloody corpse in the street.

My dad killed his dad

His father raised them harshly. Used to beat them and shit. They lived on a dairy farm, him and his 5 siblings. When my dad was 16 or 17 he got sick of it and took a gun and hid it in the barn. In the morning he went out like normal with his father to start milking the cows. No one else was awake. His story went that his dad attacked him with a pitchfork, so in self defense, shot him.

He then throws his body on the tractor, drives him into the woods, and buries him. Still, no one else knows. He finishes the milking, and heads back to the house. His sister asks where their dad is. He just tells her ""he's never coming back.""

Eventually, cops are called and they find the body. He's a minor, claims self defense. The details, as given to me, are sketchy. He spent time in a juvenile facility til 18, then continued with his life

What bothers me most about this, is my father then grew up, had a bunch of kids, and then beat the shit outta us. He raised us on a farm too. When I was 7 he got angry BC I did my chores (feeding our pigs) poorly. He made me get into a 5 feet wide, 6 inches deep trough of manure, and made me do pushups. I had to go low enough to get my face into it

He did shit like that all the time, in addition to just run of the mill beatings. By his logic, would I have been justified in killing him?

I never confronted him with that. I don't speak to my father anymore. He pretends he's some Christian saint, but he's a monster

Halysites,"There are several, but this may be the worst:

My cousin has a mail order bride. My cousin (I'll call him Jack), is a real piece of shit, couldn't get a girl in real life because he's a misogynist. So Jack goes online to get a girl from the Philippines. Poor girl eventually gets to move to our country to live with Jack, in his mothers basement. They stayed there for a few years but he eventually had to move away for work. His wife still lives in his mom's basement, but occasional goes to visit Jack to clean his place/have sex with him. We all know that Jack is verbally and emotionally (and most likely physically) abusive to this girl. Jack may have other mental issues, he acts like a legitimate sociopath sometimes. No one talks about it though, except my mother and I discuss it in private. We hope the poor girl leaves Jack soon.

Edit: This girl was not forced into the country or brought her illegally. She came of her own volition. She got married and had to wait for citizenship (about a year or two) before legally entering the country. She wanted to leave the Philippines. There are a variety of websites that allow North American men to meet women from the Philippines (and other countries too) that they can potentially marry. It's not illegal, although there are illegal ways of getting a mail order bride, Jack choose the completely legal route.

Edit 2: This started several years ago when I was too young to fully understand all the complex problems in their relationship. And my relatives didn't tell me about all the problems going on because you don't tell kids that kind of crap. Last time I spoke with my mom I told her that if Jack does anything to his wife in front of me that even borders on abuse I'll call the cops. This girl wouldn't charge him even if the cops were called for his past actions, and she continues to choose to be married to him even though everyone in the family is telling her to get a divorce. The abuse is over now since they no longer live together and rarely see each other, I believe it really only occurred for a brief period of time when they lived together in their own house.

Edit 3: Everyone tells her to get a divorce but we can't force her to get one. She's a grown woman making her own decisions and choices. With Jack far away and most of the time saying he wants to break up with her, and her not even liking him, no one can figure out why she remains married. She is very Catholic, which may be part of it. Her family in the Philippines put a lot of pressure on her to stay married.

heynowhatsup,"My family has a public image that is a pretty big sham. Everyone thinks we're a big, happy family, and everyone acts like it in a public sense. In a certain corner of the internet my family is pretty well known, so it's a pretty public thing.


In reality, my childhood was pretty fucked up. My Dad was verbally/emotionally abusive and had severe anger issues. He once whipped my brother with a belt because he was peeing too loud at night, I would always get yelled at because I was typing too loud when I used the computer, stuff like that. He told my brother when he was 10 (and me when I was 13) that he was too old for hugs. I cannot remember the last time that my father told me that he loved me. When I was 16 I was being sexually harassed at work. My parents grounded me for 2 years. The only thing they mentioned about my being sexually harassed was a snide comment from my mother implying that I was asking for it. For those two years, the slightest thing that happened was my fault in my father's eyes. And I got yelled at for it. And honestly, he's done that to every one of my siblings, and the only time it was presented as an issue was when he did it to my mother. He would accuse her of doing trivial things to mess with him (Say, leaving a door open) and get really mad about it. She would talk to em about it for hours every day and not saying anything to him about it, and would say things like ""I'm just hoping someone notices and says something to him about it."" This was all normal growing up. My parents never expressed any other emotion, other than my mother being submissive to whatever my father wanted, and my father being angry. 


A close family friend told me a story once about how admirable it was that my parents waited to get married instead of just getting married when my mom got pregnant with my brother, and about the religious small village they lived in. My brother was born when my mother was 17, and my parents met when she was 18. My mother lived in a city and my Dad lived in a village about an hour away.


I found out when I was 13 that my brother and I have different birth fathers. How I found out was my mother mentioned that her and my father had met 15 years ago, and I stated ""But my brother is 16."" She laughed in my face and said ""You didn't know?"" (No, because NO ONE HAD EVER MENTIONED IT.)


My mother now complains that none of her children talk to her when something is wrong. I said to her that it's because they do not feel like they can talk to her, because she is very dismissive (My appendix ruptured a few years ago. It got to the point that I blacked out for 6 hours because I was in so much pain from eating a half of a banana. I told her I was going to go to the hospital and her response was ""If that's what you feel like you need to do.""), and you can't mention anything even remotely involving feelings to my father because he will totally shut the conversation down. Her response? ""I thought our family was normal :("". My mother constantly (and this was much worse when I was growing up) complains about my younger sister to me, because she will not actually ask my younger sister if something is wrong, or talk to her about any issues she has. She does this because she know I'll get pissed off enough to actually say something to my sister. I told her that if she wanted to repair the relationship she has with my sister (which is severely damaged) she would have to start talking to her about her feelings. Her response was ""But that's hard :(""


My parents both did not have good home lives growing up, so they view mine and my siblings lives as ""Well you had it far better than we did growing up!"" It hurts because I do know my parents love me and all my siblings, but how we were raised was not normal. Talking about feelings is now so difficult for me that I cannot do so without bursting into tears because it is that stressful for me. I also have a very difficult time even putting my emotions into words because it was not something I was taught to do growing up (I was taught that I am only allowed to feel the way my parents want me to.)


And honestly, everyone just sees us a great, happy family. Everyone has a pretty good sense of humour so we're always joking, my Mom's super fun and everyone thinks she's great. Not that she isn't, but emotionally it isn't a good time. If you say to her ""You haven't called me in a year"" her response will be ""Well you didn't call me either!"" every time. If you point out something that needs to change, she will always shift the blame.


Everyone things the family is picture perfect, normal, this and that... But it's really not. I keep encouraging my parents to go to therapy because they really need it, but they keep putting it off because they see no immediate issue. 

Everyone comments about how well behaved, smart, funny, great, etc etc etc myself and my siblings are but like.. emotions are important.

Edit: And if my parents read this, they would send me a stern email stating that I should talk to them directly instead of posting passive aggressive comments about them to the internet. If I tried to tell them all of this, they would dismiss me, and tell me that I had a far better life growing up than I did... Well two wrongs don't make a right.

Aside from that, the boy cousin was found to be distributing kiddie porn and was sent away. A few years later he showed up to the family Christmas Eve party and didn't remember anyone. I'm not sure what happened to him. 

There was another Christmas Eve party in which we were all joking about how my little brother was going to be the only person to carry on the family name.

FlyingPurpleUnicorn,"One of the biggest secrets is my younger brother. Even early in his life, my mom knew something was wrong with him. He showed no remorse when he did something wrong, and he only cared about himself. When he turned about nine maybe, he started abusing me and my mom. It started with terrible emotional abuse that would cause everyone in the house to be miserable. It got worse as he got older, and he started becoming physically abusive. We had dogs, and one dog in particular I absolutely adored. He would torture the dogs, especially the one I loved. He choked my dog in front of my face until I had to kick him so he let him go, which broke my toe. He would destroy any possession of mine I showed affection toward. He would even hit or kick my mom and I in public. He preferred kicking in the shins or punching in the stomach, mostly because it's easy to hide bruises in those places. 

The abuse got so bad that I had to move into my aunt's house for a while. During that time, my mom had him Baker Acted. The absurd thing is he was able to manipulate them (he was very good at that) into think there was nothing wrong with him except a case of depression. I was absolutely furious that these people couldn't see past the lies of a fourteen year old. He was released and came home, and I had to move back in to the house because of ridiculous shit, despite not wanting to AT ALL. 

Things went downhill from there, and after a few months my mom was able to get him into a camp for troubled boys in a different state, which I was overjoyed about. After only three months there (he had promised to stay a year as long as they payed him. yes, paid him.) he began getting violent and the camp said he couldn't stay there anymore (this was a camp for troubled boys, and yet they couldn't handle a troubled boy). I told my mom I would not live with him anymore, and if he came back I would move to Ohio to live with my other aunt. My mom didn't want to live with him anymore either, even if he was her son, and told the camp he could not come home. She had to stop taking their calls eventually because they were harassing her at work. She got a message that they had put him into the foster care system. She still e-mails with him sometimes. All he does is ask her for money. We've talked to mental health professionals, and they've said he sounds like a narcissist with sociopathic tendencies. He's sixteen now, and it's a constant fear of mine that when he ages out of the system, he's going to come and kill me and my mom.

My family refuses to talk about this. When he was younger and we went to family gatherings, he would act so bad he would make my mom cry. No one would say anything except to make a comment to my mother about how terribly behaved he was, which was obviously enormously helpful. As he got older, and I would have to run to my aunt's house crying, still no one would talk about it. He even tried to kill me once, holding me up against a wall and strangling me, and would regularly threaten me with knives and his BB gun. I asked if I should call the police and everyone said no, it wasn't necessary, it would be too ""dramatic."" 

When I moved into my aunt's house, I was severely depressed, had generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, PTSD, and a fear of men, and was self-harming. I was also seeing a therapist that believed she could see ghosts and was weening me off of my antidepressants without consulting my psychiatrist. My aunt and uncle's solution to this was that I needed to ""power through it"" and after a week of staying there told me I needed to get a job or I couldn't live there. I was obviously not mentally stable enough to have a job, so I was forced to move back into the house where I was being abused. I have still not been able to forgive them for that. When my mother decided that my brother couldn't come home, EVERYONE in the family called my mom and asked her if that was really necessary and the right thing to do.  The only people who were really helpful during that time were my aunt and uncle in Ohio, who would talk with my mom on the phone about him and who offered me a place to stay when I needed it, even if it was 6 or 7 states away.

Now that he's gone, everyone still talks about him like he's fine. They ask, ""how's Tyler?"" even though it makes me visibly upset. I think I'll always resent them for this, and it makes me really sad.",null,92,cdp141d,1rnbkc,AskReddit,hot,339
DisGuyAndHisApples,"Not so much a secret or fucked up for these two but:

1) My grandfather died when I was about 10 / 11 years old. I barely knew him and it didn't really phase me. My dad didn't like his father and he seemed fine as well. My dad had two brothers, one younger, one older. He was really good mates with his younger brother and suddenly, 6 weeks after my grandfather's death, he drops dead after a fight with his wife. I feel so bad for my dad because he thinks his wife killed him, despite there being no explanation given for his death.


2) I had three cousins. This cousin was the middle child and a year older than me and she was really fond of our grandfather. His death hit her particularly hard, and then on top of that, her father dies 6 weeks later. Can you imagine, having two of the most important people in your life taken away from you within 6 weeks of each other. 

Last year, on St. David's day, the middle cousin killed herself by jumping off a bridge after a fight with her ex boyfriend. I hardly knew her, which is probably what I regret the most. But the part I really hate and find fucked up is that that family has lost their grandfather, father and sister. Being Welsh, St. David's day will never be the same again for that family and it is absolutely tragic. 


Now for a secret and a bit of a fucked up one at that:

My uncle on my mother's side has been married to my aunt for about 20 / 21 years. He is a big-shot banker who earns what I would consider, a large amount of money. For 19 years of that marriage, he has been paying for sex from prostitutes. Not only that, but he also contracted HIV from one of them and has been on medication for years. He is also Catholic.

Because they have kids who are under the ages of 19, they had to get them tested for HIV because it may have been passed on during pregnancy.

**TL;DR** - Death on one side, HIV on the other.

homopopsicle,"I had to come out twice. The first time I came out to my parents at 15 as bi. I literally told them ""I think I'm bi."" Their response was basically, ""oh thats nice dear,"" as if I was doing it to get attention or be cute. Don't get me wrong, they were accepting, but I also didn't think they took me that seriously. They seemed to have no problem with it when I started dating another girl. 

The second time I came out at 19 as transgender. Their reaction was similar, but it wasn't until I actually physically started transitioning from female to male until my mom went apeshit. She told me I looked like an ""ugly lesbian with chin hairs"" and that nobody would want to be in a relationship with me. My father took it very well. I think he was actually excited to have a son in his life. My relationship with my mother has been very strained while my father and I have bonded very well. It wasn't until a couple months ago that my mother started using male pronouns (even though I've been passing for years now--ugh, the public humiliation she put me through--Imagine overhearing a mother ask her bearded son how his gynecological exam went in the middle of a crowded Costco. Yeah, it was bad). 

I think I've actually had it pretty easy as I've never been kicked out or told I'm going to hell by any of my family, but my mom still admits that she hasn't ""accepted"" the fact that I'm a dude now. She rarely looks at my in the eye and doesn't like talking to me on the phone (I don't think she likes hearing my deep voice).

My advice is that if your parents are assholes, give them time. A lot of them turn around. If you are under 18 and dependent on your parents, tread carefully. If they are manipulative and homophobic, they could make your life a living hell.

KristenWave,"I came out as transgender when I was 18 because I could no longer bear having to hide what I was. I initially told my dad through an email because I had the breakdown at 3am while I was away at college. My dad called me right away the next day and they took me to a psychologist the next day to have me officially diagnosed with GID. The only problems I really ran into came when the doctor said that without a doubt that I was transsexual. They wanted me to ""just be gay"" more than anything. However after 7 months of frequent arguing they came around. I will agree with homopopsicle. If you're still dependent on your parents be careful. However, if you're beginning to feel suicidal in anyway it may be best to come out or at least find yourself a medical professional to talk to. Since I came out my parents have been very accepting and helpful.

We dated in secret for a while because his parents are homophobic to the extreme (they'd disown him if they found out he was trans or gay), and I thought my parents were. Mom just kinda figured it out when I kept asking to spend so much time with him because I still can't drive on my own because I'm too lazy to go out and get my permit. Eventually we were openly dating, at my house at least, and my dad was eventually told as well. He doesn't like it, but doesn't stop me.

Its not a question so much as an observation when someone is in a position where they are interacting with someone in a customer service position or similar, be it a waiter, coffee counter staff, or something where the default nature of the relationship creates a temporary social difference in the ""power"" between two people.

It's a trivial level of difference, but it's also an excellent window on how people treat others, if you treat a server or staff poorly, unless you are just having an absolutely shitty day I tend to get a sense of how someone is in reality.

My family had a housekeeper from the islands who made these *amazing* dumplings, and she called 7 year old me downstairs because she had them for me as a surprise birthday present.

I bolted downstairs and ran right into the corner of a glass table hard enough to slash myself on it.

I was at work and making a cardboard bale.  One of the wires wouldn't feed through so we were using a pole to try and bust through anything that might have been blocking it.  Well the pole wouldn't go through either so someone grabbed the sledge hammer.  After a few unsuccessful attempts he stopped trying and handed it to me.  I hit a couple of times and still nothing.  So I decided to try a little harder so I, stupidly, choked up and swung harder.  I missed the pole and crushed my finger between the pole and the handle of the hammer.

FarahKh,"The tepid water and my wrinkled finger tips mark the end of my bubble bath. Mommy just checked on me, but my patience has doubled since then. I call for her to help me out of the tub, but she does not respond. I try twice more but I hear no returning calls. I decide that I do not really need her help; I am five and a big girl. The slippery acrylic tub and my misplaced feet results in my arm roughly slicing on the sharp faucet. A metallic and unknown smell engulfs me. All I see is red, just like candy apples. So much red falling from my arm and coloring the bathwater. Unexplainable fear and pain overcomes me. I start to cry and within seconds, mommy is standing at the door. 

She has always been beautiful, but the flour smeared on her face and the stress lines present on her face does not do much for her. The sheer horror on her expression scares me further and transforms my cries into screams. She appears white as a sheet as we stare at each other, motionless. The tub water is noticeably darker when I start to feel a painful sensation shooting down my arm. In a flash, daddy is carrying me while wrapping a soft towel around my arm. Suddenly, I am dressed and inside a speeding car. I look over, still screaming, and see my father dripping in his wetsuit. He looks concerned but is oddly working more on comforting mommy than I. Mommy is wearing her special apron and is holding me tightly with a frightening look on her face. 

The vehicle comes to an abrupt stop and I am being quickly carried out into a building. It takes me very little time to realize I am in a hospital. The pungent sterile stench and cold of the room does not calm me. The waiting room is filled with all kinds of people, so busy looking. I am still crying as daddy carries me into one of the rooms, with two doctors trailing behind him. There was no warning given before one of the doctors started putting a needle and thread through my skin. It reminds me of sewing a dress together. I can only feel a light tugging, but it does not quiet my cries. She finally cuts the thread after what feels like forever. She has a grin on her face that makes he seem less callous while she wraps my arm up tight. The sight of the second doctor taking out a colorful basket quiets me completely. Stickers! So many stickers! I want them all. The first doctor comes around with a jar of lollipops. Oh, how I love the hospital. They are both decorating me with pretty stickers as I enjoy the sweet blue raspberry goodness of my sucker. This room no longer feels so cold. I am taken by the hand and walked out to the reception area when something purple catches my eye. There is the prettiest, fluffiest stuffed bunny I have ever seen. Before I know it, the bunny is in my arms. I give my new friend a big hug and a sticker. As I leave the hospital, beaming, the only thought in my head is: I should slip more often.

2007zeke,"Back in the 7th grade I thought I was the shit. In gym class I would always run and jump to smack the backboard and stuff.  One day I decided to find my inner black person and go for gold. The net.   Mussed horrifically and wasn't even close.  My great idea before gym started was to have my strong friend butterfly jump me so i could grab it.  Sounded pretty cool and I needed to impress the 7th grade bitches so I complied with it.  With a running start I ran and the kid pushed me up after I jumped. Right off the bat I knew something was wrong, I over shot the bitch.   My face and chest were above the rim and in the last effort I tried to grab the flimsy metal hoop to slow me down, bad bad bad idea.  Rim started to bend and glass cracked. I let go for the sake of the poor backboard.  This dismount was not clean and i fall hard as a motherfucker.  Got up fine and everyone was dead silent. My head hurt a bit so I walked it off and then I looked at my arm.  It was not good. I'd say a good 30 degrees out of place and was flopping like a limp dick.  At this point I was fucked and my parents were going to shit bricks. No teacher was there at this point and all of the little kids were yelling so my friend screams ""EVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP AND YOU MOTHER FUCKERS DIDNT SEE ANYTHING"" this foul language was not normal around our little semi-innocent minds so this hit home.  So no one was going to snitch cause my friend was hella intimidating.   
   The next thing I needed was an excuse and fast.  The teachers came out and blew the whistle for the warm up jog. I didn't have an excuse yet so I had to run. My arm was flopping and I swear I was about to pass out. My friend says to fake a fall and use that as an excuse. I had no other option so the next lap i face planted like no other right in front of the teacher. Then I showed them my arm.  I was sent home and whent to the hospital right away.  My plan went will so far.
   At the hospital I didn't leave made up plot.  ""I fell and it was twisted"" was my excuse and they could tell I was lying but didn't say anything.  The next thing they needed to was place my bones back into place. It was terrible it hurt sooooo bad.   The doctor afterwords goes ""You wernt dunking or anything were you?"" On my way out.  If reeked out and got hella scared but nothing happened and I laughed it off. My arm still isn't right and my parents still don't know what really happend.

1. Attended a local church one Sunday morning, when people started asking normal questions (Where are you from? Any Kids? Etc.) She freaks out and starts ranting about working for ""Stalker Magazine"".

2. Calls my grandparents who live near her and complains about their granddaughter Missy who ""Tried to run her off the road in her Jeep on 2pm Tuesday"" Missy does drive a white jeep, but was out of town at the time. My grandparents are freaked out that this lady knows Missy is their granddaughter even though she doesn't live nearby, has never talked to the woman and doesn't share the same last name.  Three days later an envelope with a picture of Missy's state champion softball team is put in their mailbox. Crazylady had circled the face of the wrong girl (although Missy was in the picture) claims to God above  that she knows this was the girl who almost ran he  off the road and gives advice that they should look into her ""drug problem"". I repeat Missy was nowhere near the area on the Tuesday Crazylady claims this happened, and neither is the girl who's face she circled (that she mistook for Missy). Missy has also never done drugs.
My grandfather scared her off and called her insane when she tried to harass them about it again over the phone.

4. She's been kicked out of all the local parks for sicking her dog on people.

5. She accused her neighbor (Who drove down the road to her  parents house because her elderly father had fallen)  of ""trying to spy on her naked body"". She proceeded to follow the neighbor and harass her. It was 3 o'clock in the morning.

As far as branch I have served with them all over seas and each one has its ups and downs. So really look in to every thing figure out what you want and go for it. Know one can say any one it's better then the other. They just have different things. Also if you are graduating with a bachelor's degree make sure you get everything you can for it.

Rainstorme,"Army officer who commissioned from college here, I'd highly recommend going the officer route. You kind of set yourself behind the power curve on that path by not going through ROTC but it should be possible to still do it through OCS (or whatever the other branches call it). Recruiters have been able to stop misleading people now that recruitment goals have been dropped drastically but don't trust anything they say that isn't in your contract (which means actually read the contract). If you have an ROTC program at your school I'd go talk to them there, they'll definitely help you out and will probably give you advice before you even go to a recruiter. If you do try to become an officer, make sure you are physically fit because OCS slots are sought after and PT score is usually a major part in deciding who goes.

As for branch, if you want to do something related to your degree you have to go Air Force or Navy because the Army and Marines will just put you where they need you without regard to what you majored in (outside specialized fields like law and medicine). It is a lot harder to get into the Navy and Air Force, though. People tend to get in and not get out like they do in the Army so there isn't as big of a demand for recruits.

If you want to enlist, don't expect to do much that would be meaningful work experience in your field but you will have the ability to pick what you do to a larger extent. You'll also have to put up with a lot more of the bullshit stuff like cleaning latrines and buffing floors. Hopefully an Airman or Sailor will drop by to go over that because I don't really know what their busywork tends to be.

datayoo,"Miloff, I'm currently in tech school for geospatial intelligence for the air force. You should definitely join af Intel.  Getting that top secret clearance will benefit you greatly in the civilian world. With current sequestration other jobs seems to be hurting from it. However, intel seems to keep growing. With your background, geospatial/ imagery intel or 9S would probably in your best interest.  9S is a new job and many people don't know what exactly they do, but from what it sounds like, they deal with detecting nuclear  activity around the world...your background may benefit some jobs but is irrelevant when getting into a job as you will get trained in that particular field anyways (I graduated with a degree in biomedical sciences)...if you have any questions, let me know!!

FAFTW,"Prior Navy here. Go officer like the others said. It is a smart move considering you have a degree. The downside is that If you go enlisted and your first tour is on a ship you could be out to sea for 6 months or more. On top of that you will be doing at least 2 tours in a 4 year rotation. Also there are a lot of 2-3 week training exercises for qualifications before deployment.

I hate to say it but some form of harassment is possible being enlisted. Being an officer can at least curb it.

LifeGoesOnDude,"My first ever throw-away account! Never told this to anyone, including my Dad and brother....

Twelve days after I graduated from college, I was taking a shower in my childhood home. When I shut off the water, I could hear my Mom's voice on the other side of the wall, speaking softly on the phone. Instantly 60% sure she was cheating on my Dad, hard to explain how. She'd been acting more distant and dressing better lately.

Next day (asshole me) went through her texts on her phone. Saw a guy's name a couple times, but nothing definitive. Up to 75% or so. Two days later went through her email in the middle of the night, which she always left open on our family's shared computer(!). The 100%-sure moment is the one that sticks... I cried, drank myself into a stupor, confronted her then next morning. 

My Dad and brother are 'oblivious' types, but wanting to possibly save them from the pain I was in, I coached her how to cover her tracks better for a few weeks. Still caught her and scolded her multiple times.

She faked her way through marriage counseling until the inevitable divorce a year or so later, two-ish years ago. She was definitely the favorite parent, so life sucked for awhile. Getting back to normal-ish now, she moved to a more tropical locale with her new boyfriend, visited for the first time last week. Life goes on!

Be prepared for an emotional rollercoaster.  Not all divorces are bitter struggles, but don't rule by exception.  You may lose friends.  You may lose family.  You may lose material things that are important to you.  You may lose money - a lot of money - depending on your situation.   

I guess what it really comes down to is making sure that you'll look at your divorce without regret.  So before you commit, reflect and make sure that you truly feel as though your life will be better without being attached to your SO.  You must be prepared to permanently separate no matter what the cost.  ",null,0,cdpqx7l,1rq848,AskReddit,hot,3

At some point in our lives, related to out marriages or not, we all have to realize that we cannot control other people. We cannot make people do something we want them to, regardless. Giving up that desperate struggle for power and control is the first day of the rest of your life. It will positively influence every interpersonal relationship from then on.

And regarding a suicidal SO, when I left, I called my dad to come help me leave and I called his brother to come and stay with him after I left. He downed a ton of pills anyways but it just made him sick. We both realized that night we couldn't control each other anymore. I couldn't keep him from trying and he couldn't keep me emotionally trapped in the relationship. We both married other people and he seems to be happy now. I am too- i learned so much about myself.

noxwei,"From another post.  

There are more options for bigger range of audiences.  For those who has childish fun, they can try the mainstream r/funny or r/aww, and they are still pretty damn good. If a person wants to go to ""deep"" conversation reddit, they can go find it. Depthhub still exist, true(philosophy, gaming, etc) exist. Doctor who fans can go to r/doctor who for memes, which represents culture and those who are genuinely  interested in discussion can go to r/gellifry. Discussion especially on a site that is as popular as reddit still exist in large quantities, impressive I might add on how this site isn't sold out yet with this many user base.  

This website is a great one for autodidactics, I want to learn how to draw for example I can go to 10 different communities on here to show and critique my drawing. If I have programming. Questions, there's an entire
army willing to help out. 

So sure, reddit isn't want it use to be (back then I was at Digg), but it's still a place where I can gather information, and know what's going on hours before anywhere else.

You know the one, with ""unfriendable,"" ""taste of awesome,"" ""first world problems,"" ""random meme shit that I don't remember."" I was happy, secure in my warm and cozy world of shitty reposts. 


Then I found 9gag. ""Like, OH EM GEE,"" I could be heard squealing. ""Le 9gags is teh GEM of the internet."" I was a cool kid. But soon I tired of 9gag, and its limited content. I found Reddit.


At first, Reddit was too confusing. All those links, all those things called ""subreddits,"" that weird thing called ""karma."" I shied away from the front page and the defaults. I found comfort in f7u12, the diarrhea of everything reddit has to offer. Yet I loved le rage comics, sympathizing with forever alone guy, asking my mother ""Y U NO cook dinner?"" It was a dark time.


But as I grew more comfortable with Reddit, I crept into the default subs. First r/funny, then r/pics. AskReddit soon became my go-to sub. I even experienced a world beyond default. I saw r/mildly interesting and r/foodporn. It was a love affair, but abusive. I tried to leave Reddit in search of a better future. But Reddit kept calling me back, keeping me up at night, refusing to let me work. A few days ago, Reddit finally held me down and forced me to make an account.


Help me. I'm in an abusive relationship with no way out... I fear the end is near. Tell... tell the internet I love it. Goodbye :'(

YellowOrbitz,"Edit: I just remembered another one! Also I apologize for my bad writing I'm on my phone. I was with my boyfriend and his older brother in the basement when my boyfriend got a boner. However, we were under a blanket (not including his brother) when it happened so it wasn't a big deal. Well, my boyfriend pulled his pants down to free his boner under the blanket and forgot about it. So he's talking with his brother and they get into some playful argument when his brother rips the blanket off my boyfriend. My immediate reflex was to hide his junk so I immediately grab it. His brother was laughing his ass off and it took my boyfriend a second to remember he pulled his pants down a little. It was so weird staring into his brothers eye while holding my boyfriends boner. 

Also: 

Well, one day I was crying and talking with my boyfriend when he got a boner. We had sex and I actually felt better. 

Another time we were at the mall and I had gotten a new dress. We had already had sex so I thought it would be okay to change into the new dress I had gotten. Nope, instant boner (I'll admit I felt very complimented). We couldn't leave because we were going to see the movie at the mall and it was too far from the house to get there and back. We had sex in the car. We missed the movie. 

I don't think it was awkward for me as much as him because he didn't know how I'd react. I mean I've never turned down sex from him but I guess he thought I'd say no? It was really cute too because he'd give me the guilty face like he did something wrong. 

Oh, and every time we were with his family and he got a boner. I know that was definitely weird. ",null,2,cdpt6k6,1rqgeh,AskReddit,hot,2

Which, by the way, is what I suggest you do.  Don't fuck her behind his back, because it *will* get out &amp; then he *will* be pissed.  By being up front with him, there's at least a chance he'll be able to get over the initial shock &amp; hurt, if there even is any.

 Personally, and this is just me, but the entire winter holiday thing is supposed to be about togetherness, appreciating what you have, and helping others. The only of those three main tenets that is touched upon in this Black Friday garbage is togetherness, and even then only in the sense of ""TOGETHER WE CAN DEMOLISH THIS BARRICADE AND GET TO THE TASTY DEALS WITHIN"" And you better believe that as soon as that barricade raises or comes down, all semblance of cohesion is lost as everyone starts running around, grabbing, shoving, and fighting like fucking retards. 

What it comes down to is that this behavior speaks ill of Americans as a whole. A casual observer may believe that we are incapable of acting in a manner resembling civility. Having worked in 3 different types of store over the course of 5 holiday seasons, I am inclined to agree. You always roll the dice with customer interaction, it comes with the territory. But in my experience, Black Friday dice are weighted to roll snake eyes. The ability to get a TV at half price or what have you seems to bring out the worst in people. Not just in their wanton destruction of whatever retail environment they may currently inhabit, but their treatment of other people as well. I'd never heard someone actually call a person a cunt with intent to insult until Black Friday. (Granted, I swear like a sailor, and jokingly throw that word around like it's ""and"" but here you will find that it is the baddest of words, for some reason.) I have seen groups of people break out swinging when told we are out of stock on a high demand item. Stealing shit out of other peoples carts. No civilized person should be acting this way.

Granted, not everyone acts this way, even among those who are habitual Black Friday shoppers. I met quite a lot who were just out, didn't like the packed stores or long lines but couldn't afford high price gifts if they didn't get them at a Black Friday sale, and really wanted to get them. These folks were more often than not courteous and understanding, and the ones that weren't didn't force it too terribly. These folks are exempt from my rant. They may go and do whatever they must today with no ill will from me. 

There's a lot more to my hatred of Black Friday than listed above, but those are the main points. It's not all bad as an idea, but(**TL;DR**) it attracts all the wrong kinds of people and causes them to behave in a way that I find fucking reprehensible. ",null,0,cdpshrq,1rq6vq,AskReddit,hot,1

dachloe,"The thing is... men measure ""league"" in terms of looks alone. Women measure it by looks, and ""status"" which is hard to define and differs in each social circle. Women have a lot more factors than men!
Men who are not physically attractive can still end up with women ""out of their league"" by just have one ore more of the following: money, status/fame, power.
I've personally seen several cases where guys end up with girls way out if their league and it's always been an odd pairing in some way. I knew a quite and rather blah guy who dated the hottest cheerleader in school for a short time. It turns out spent time together and bonded as camp counsellors over the summer. But as the school year went on she was pressured to date a ""better"" guy and eventually ended up with a jock football player. From that time on her life was like a soap opera; she had lots of guys cheat on her, a couple beat her, steal from her, and she was used a lot in college. She never got past freshman year of college because of ""guy trauma."" She got fat and lost her looks and ended up dating a must more average guy who works for minimum wages in retail. They have two kids.
The guy, dumped in high school, when on to date a drama geek in high school, a couple of ""quirky"" girls in college and then married a girl he works with at the office. He changed a bit in college. He got more confident and better able to relate to people; he's still a nerdy guy, but now since he's in IT he fits in better with the world outside high school.
I also knew a guy who dated a ""super model"" for a few months. They met at a party and she was very drunk. She was very flaky and flighty and never really was anything close to normal. Guys were always after her. But this normal regular guy got her just for the fact that he wasn't trying to ""get"" her. It didn't last long. She moved on to some other kind of guy and moved away to a more adventurous life style.

There were these huge juts of rock coming up out of the ground occasionally. And I was running. 

Why was I running? The wolves and the ravens were after me. Chasing me endlessly across this expanse. Any time I thought I was gaining ground, a new rock monolith would rise up out of the ground in front of me and I'd have to change direction. Losing momentum and letting the pursuers cut the corner to gain on me further. 

I had this dream night after night after night for most of my childhood years. Very much a bad one. Well it was this one and two other nightmares I would shuffle through.

I lied, not the most terrifying. The most terrifying was extremely short and simple. I was walking around to get to the door of a blue truck.

Amadeus3698,"To preempt some criticism (which I welcome; my goal is to foster discussion) I will state that I am American and have been since birth and my family has a long history in the US.  This discussion was prompted by discussions last night with my family.  My discussion here will focus on the US however, but I am sure people from other countries will agree that things are similar in their own countries.  I encourage people to add to what I have or rebut my points.  After all, I can be wrong too, but please keep it civil.  You can still disagree without being profane or attacking me personally. 

The things that I think need improvement in the US:

1.	A culture of consumerism – one of the huge reasons why businesses have grown so large and influential is that we have let them do so.  One example is the existence of “Black Friday” and its encroachment into Thanksgiving.  Every year people rush to stores to save a few hundred dollars on Christmas gifts; I find the idea of fighting someone for the bare-bones model of a plasma TV and waiting in line for an hour to buy it to be asinine.  No one needs something that badly and all the deaths and serious injuries each year are senseless.  I feel sorry for the unfortunate souls that have to work these stores over night and deal with insane customers the next day instead of enjoying the company of their families for Thanksgiving.
2.	Failure to perform one’s civic duty – the social contract that all Americans have with their government is that the power of the government is derived from them not the other way around.  A government that does not serve its people is not a legitimate government.  Many Americans fail to stay informed about what is going on.  I am not saying that you need to follow all the happenings of the world but you should know what your local and state governments are doing in a general sense.  Also, investigating candidates before voting for them and not just voting along party lines is also your duty
3.	Lack of accountability and oversight of government – do you know who your state and federal representatives are in your state’s legislature and in Congress?  Do you know what this person does/did before becoming a politician?  Probably not.  A majority of politician are probably “good” in that that they aren’t embezzling or conveniently awarding contracts to a relative’s company or their own, but this happens sometimes.  A politician can construct the law so that they and/or their family comes out on top.  It’s hard to do anything after the fact because it’s “legal”.  The recent fiasco of the healthcare law should be lesson that someone needs to be watching and guiding this process.
4.	Lobbying – this the most deleterious and the result of the previous three points.  They are inherently self-interested.  Groups like the NRA, AARP, Cassidy and Associates, and many other have undue influence over governmental affairs.  Lobbying has its place, but its power has grown unchecked and much of what goes on is obscured so that the laity cannot understand what is going on.  People should be allowed to form groups to request their representatives help with an issue, but the representative should not be pressured because those groups might not support them in the next election or actively undermine them later.
5.	Elections/gerrymandering – in this technologically advanced country, elections should all be by popular vote; the Electoral College is archaic and is no longer needed.  In this way the person who is truly favored by the people is the one in office and not the one who’s good a playing the system.  The same is true for gerrymandering; carving out safe districts so that the same people continually get elected leads to stagnation in the government.  Campaign finance needs to be reformed.  There is no need to spend tens of millions of dollars on a campaign; election campaigns should be funded from taxes and private donations should be banned.  The defense that contributing to elections is freedom of speech is weak; your First Amendment rights end where someone else’s begins and downing out other voices because you can write a bigger check is not respecting other’s rights.
6.	Blindly following – just because your pastor, parent, church, political party, news channel, or other “authority” says something does not make it true.  You must think for yourself and not let others tell you how to vote.  It is your right and no one else’s; any arguments to the contrary are inherently false.  I have had friends in college tell me she votes in line with her parents because they support her financially and her father knows which candidate is best so that he won’t hurt financially.  This again shows lack of civic duty on her part; she should investigate for herself.  In the end, she may decide to vote the same way her parents do, but at least she decided to do it.  Another good example is the war in Iraq.  At its beginning, if you did not support the war, you were viewed as un-American.  The Dixie Chicks are a good illustration of how an essentially brainwashed fan base ended their music career (granted the girls should have known, but still).  I doubt many of the people that hated them knew anything about what was going on in Iraq and to this day still probably don’t understand what went on.
7.	Lack of foresight – years of borrowing has left the federal government in disarray and threatens to destabilize the economy.  Never should the government been allowed to borrow so much money.  Government services should be paid for through taxes; if you don’t want more taxes then you get fewer services.  Borrowing money to pay for these is poor financial planning on the part of politicians; they should not be advocating for plans that they then don’t want to fund by increasing taxes.  As a nation, we must choose, lots of services and higher taxes or fewer services and lower taxes; the balance must be found.
8.	Being distracted by hot button issues – gay marriage, abortion, entitlement programs, and others are all important topics that need to be settled, but for any of them to be the constant focus of discussion or a deciding factor in who you vote for is foolish.  “The gays” aren’t going to destroy America by getting married.
9.	Policing the world – it is not the job of the US to fix every problem in the world and we should stop trying to because it is bankrupting the nation.  That is not to say that I don’t care about the people of Syria, Libya, Haiti, or whatever other country seems to be on the brink of collapse, but we should be encouraging the UN and other nations to facilitate this.
10.	Arm-twisting – no other country exerts as must influence unilaterally as the US.  Economics is how the US manipulates weaker countries into forming partnerships that are mostly in favor of US business.  Also, subversive actions by American intelligence has played a large part.  Go to Wikipedia and look at the numerous things that the CIA has done in Latin America.  The people of these countries know this and American arm-twisting is a major reason for a lot of disdain abroad.

BunsofthePatriots,"Every Saturday a mutual friend of mine and my girlfriend's comes over my house and we watch Breaking Bad and have a few drinks and wait for my girlfriend to get out of work so she can join. Last Saturday I wanted to try Bacardi 151, so I bought a bottle, made dinner and set up so we could just get to watching when she showed up. 

She showed up but looked like she had been crying, so I asked what was wrong and she told me she just had a horrible week and would rather just let it go and have fun tonight. So we did, we drank...and drank...and drank...and kept drinking until neither one of us knew which was was up. She ended up crying again and told me about her work day, so I put my hand in her back and told her everything would be okay, she told me I was sweet. Then she reached for the bottle and even though I was drunk I had a feeling that more alcohol would make things worse so I took the bottle from her and and we locked eyes and kissed.

It was one of those passionate drunk kisses that feel great. Midway through it, my logical side spoke up and told me to stop because what I was doing was wrong, so I did. Immediately after, I had forgotten it happened and was confused as to why she was holding my hand. I figured she was just drunk and it gave her comfort. 

I woke up with a hangover the next day to texts from the friend saying she was sorry and how upset she was and how big of a piece of shit she felt like. I had no idea what it meant until it clicked...holy shit did we have sex? I started to panic and flat out asked her, she said no and told me that we kissed. I was kind of relieved but not fully. I had to see my girlfriend, so I set out on a drive to her house. When I got there she had told me the friend called her and confessed everything. She blamed the whole thing on herself to keep my relationship from ending. I confessed to my girlfriend and apologized profusely and told her it was a drunken mistake. Pretty sure I ended up crying like a pussy but understand that I truely felt terrible for that. 

She forgave me, and our relationship is fine. I'm still upset though, the friend came to the conclusion that she had begun to develop feelings for me after spending so much time together and decided she was gonna lay low for a while and hope the feelings go away.

rhythmforest,"**I believe quite a bit of it has to do with ego.**

They want to soften the situation or avoid the discomfort because it's not just an uncomfortable situation - it's also a miniature pandora's box of self-doubt and questioning for some people. 

If someone knows and has to own up to being responsible for something negative, they may have to face the fact that they don't always have all of the answers. They may smart to question whether or not they are smart, brave, responsible, etc.

It's natural to want to protect your self-esteem.

As for facing a situation - again discomfort. We are creatures of comfort and habit. We enjoy happiness and positive sensations. Just as the majority of people have an aversion to physical pain and will go great lengths to avoid it, some people have aversions to social pain and avoid situations that they may see as potentially painful. (Situations involving rejection and/or the questioning of their abilities, decisions, etc. and therefore who they are as a person.)

Of course, often if people would just face the situation or answer the question concisely, they would probably suffer less, but they don't consider the consequences in the future. With the people who do it to me, I've noticed it's somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction for them as a means to try and avoid what they don't realize is ultimately inevitable.

Something I am doing this year is definitely my research. Depending on what you are looking to buy, I would check online for prices first. Check Amazon and eBay - sometimes you can find great stuff for cheap. I'm not sure how you feel about used items, but my boyfriend has been hinting at this cookbook he wish he could have. It's a $40 cookbook, but I bought it for $5 ""used"" on Amazon, and it's in absolute perfect condition. Sometimes you can find gems like this, but you have to look closely.

You can always check craigslist too... sometimes I've found brand new things on there for cheap.

Also, homemade gifts are great! I'll probably be baking a lot this year. It's slightly embarrassing that I can't afford to buy the gifts I really want, but the thought it was matters (yes it's cliche, but it's the truth!).

youre_funny,"When I was 15, my family decided to go to a lake in our new car. So we ate lunch and then decide we wanted desert. I said there was this bakery I saw on a TV show that was pretty good, but it was three hours away. NBD. 
We end up in some weirdo bakery in some sketchy town, but the food wasn't too bad. Turns out the bakery we were supposed to go to was another 30 minutes away. So we went and got some cornbread and kolaches. 
Then we remembered this other bakery we went to on another trip, but this was about 2 more hours away. We went there an didn't even get anything.
On our way back, my mom remembered a place her friend told her about. This was on our way back home so we drove four of the five hours back and had some amazing crepes and waffles.
We didn't go to the lake.

TLDR: Planned to go to a lake, ended up 5 hours away from home. Crepes and waffles are good. ",null,0,cdppy9c,1rptd8,AskReddit,hot,2

loved it. 

One day, I decided to smite a particularly large ant hilll in the middle of our yard. We lived out in the country, so I had no qualms with whipping it out as soon as I spotted any ant mound arrogant enough to be in our nice, green lawn. I saw this one and immediately decided it had to be peed on. 

If you have much experience with ant hills, you know there are ants beyond where you see the dirt that makes up the mound. Halfway through peeing, I realize I felt stinging on my legs and ants moving up rather quickly. 

I run across the yard in a panic and don't start tearing off clothes until I get in the house. By this time, I had a World War Z level swarm on my thighs and groin. 

My aunts were in the living room with Mom. I run past with an arthropod speed and holding a beautiful soprano note into the bathroom where I took the saddest bath of my life. 

It is my legacy.

ThisGuySal,"When I was partying in college, I befriended a guy training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ).  While he was a nice guy, he was pretty young and his fighting skills in conjunction with his ego occasionally made him act like a cock-sure ass.  He was a drinking buddy and I had to put up with listening to what a badass he thought he was.  I mean, I'm sure he was *but*...

One day he missed class but came in to the cafeteria at the college and said he wanted to talk.  He looked like he'd been throwing up.  Long story short, the night before he'd been drinking at a bar downtown and walked up to a random guy and his hot girlfriend and literally said ""What's to keep me from smacking you to the ground like a bitch and just *taking* your woman?""  He actually used to boast about using this line to me prior to the incident which was one of the reasons drinking with him was so annoying.  I never thought he actually did or would do it.

Anyway, the boyfriend invites him outside to settle their differences.  My friend was drunkenly thinking he'd get to show off his fighting skills but, instead, once he and the boyfriend are outside, the boyfriend pulls a pistol out along with some kind of badge and says he could shoot my friend dead right then and there and nobody would think twice about it.  He invited my friend to never, *ever* be in downtown (our city) again.  Which was very bad for my friend because his BJJ dojo was smack in the middle of our (fairly small) town.

Didn't hang out with him much after that.

""SMELL MY CHEESE YOU MOTHER!""

Well, one guy clearly doesn't like it, this bald guy, mid 30's walking with a mean look on his face, my friend leans out the window and asks where he can buy such a good head polish, this guy flips and starts running after us, naturally we drive away all laughing.

10 seconds down the road we hit a traffic jam and we start to panic as this guy is booking it down the road towards our car, my friend panics and puts his gears into reverse and tries to 3 point turn it the other way, we start to drive in the opposite direction as he makes it to the car and puts his fist through the back window of the car.

mrs2208,"Bradley has stage 4 high risk neuroblastoma which started in his adrenal gland above his left kidney. The tumour is so big it puts pressure on major organs and arteries which at one point made it very dangerous. The cancer has spread to his chest, lungs, lymph nodes, bone and bone marrow. 

Bradley is already onto his 5th lot of chemo in which he is coping extremely well with. We have been told that Brad has a long way to go and it's going to be a rough ride but my baby is a fighter so the least I can do is fight it with him no matter how much I'm hurting.

High risk neuroblastoma has up to 80% relapse rate if cured the first time and the UK don't have no relapse treatment, this would mean having to take Brad abroad to pay for treatment therefor any fundraising you can do no matter how little or how big would be appreciated. If Brad doesn't need the money it would then go to someone who does. 

Please help my baby get through this horrible disease xx




This is copied from his appeal website. He is a local boy who was diognosed in january this year. He is now on his 6th lot of chemo. A few weeks ago his body couldnt take no more and he ended up in intensive care after having his lungs drained. He has only just been taken off his ventorlater and tonight he has be allowed back to his normal ward. He is awake and eating icepops while watching santa films. He is still seriously ill amd dying yet our own country wont help him if he relapses. If that happens they need £500,000 to take him to the USA just to stand a chance of living.

absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're seventh in literacy, twenty-seventh in math, twenty-second in science, forty-ninth in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, number four in labor force, and number four in exports. We lead the world in only three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next twenty-six countries combined, twenty-five of whom are allies. None of this is the fault of a 20-year-old college student, but you, nonetheless, are without a doubt, a member of the WORST-period-GENERATION-period-EVER-period, so when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about?! Yosemite?!!!
We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right! We fought for moral reasons, we passed and struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, and we acted like men. We aspired to intelligence; we didn't belittle it; it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election, and we didn't scare so easy. And we were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed.

JJKeys,"**Black Mirror - White Bear (series 2, episode 2)**  
  
For those of you who aren't aware of this show, Black Mirror is a dark satirical drama written by ex-Guardian journalist Charlie Brooker. It's a very dark program but this episode about mob justice is by far the most haunting.  
  
It's about a child abuser who filmed herself and her boyfriend torturing, killing and dumping the body of a child; she gets publicly shamed when she gets captured 'killing' someone when she was on the run from being hunted and almost raped after she wakes up in her house with no memory of her life and the heinous crime she committed. Of course, these events are played backwards from my description for dramatic effect...  
  
The most chilling part is, at the end, the leader of the mob takes her back to her house, drugs her, and resets the entire set that the episode took place in - and crosses another day off the calendar. Him, the mob and a troupe of actors act out the same scarring manhunt every. single. day. just to torture this woman for her entire life. It's terrifying. ",null,7,cdp4m1g,1rnwig,AskReddit,hot,60

Two episodes of that show freaked me out. One being the remake of Hook-Hand, the cops bust into the guy who they think is Hook-Hand and all they find is a fridge full of Brains the guy was eating.

The second episode being a remake of People can lick fingers too where there's a thunderstorm but this kid never gets scared because his dog hides under the bed and licks his fingers to reassure him that he's there with him for protection. However, in the middle of the night the kid goes to the bathroom and his dog is dead hanging by it's leash in the shower he freaks out and runs back to his room because he remembers his dog had JUST been licking his fingers. He enters the room to find the window open with a man running away into the night and on the wall it says ""PEOPLE CAN LICK FINGERS TOO"" or something like that.

MEAT_FIST,"Depends on how you mean 'business'. Like, management? It is definitely useless. Your training is exclusively about getting other people to do their jobs. Does this really take a degree? Fuck no. I have a theory that in by getting a MBA, you're agreeing to hire x number of other MBAs at any job you get, so MBAs can continue getting jobs and doing nothing. There's absolutely no reason to have an MBA.

Business in the financial sense? Definitely not useless (although it is boring). Financial companies run on the backs of those that understand finances, not those who can tell you how to show up to work on time.

emberspark,"For me, it was the Thor films (and I suppose Avengers). I think Loki is a fascinating character, and I think he plays on a lot of people's insecurities. He essentially turns into a villain because he finds out that not only was he adopted, but stolen from Odin's enemies in an effort to one day unite the two opposing groups. He finds himself without a true family, without a path to the throne that he so desperately wanted, and saddled with the knowledge that he only had the family he did because of the possibility that he might be of use to them politically in the future. I think there's a lot to his character that people can relate to - feeling out of place, having something taken away that you feel you deserve, feeling the weight of expectations on you at all times, and especially living in the shadow of your sibling's triumphs. He's a very relatable character on a lot of levels I think, because the things that really push him into being a villain are very human and widespread.

Lots of villains are like this but Thor is just the last movie I saw so it's the first thing that came to mind.",null,0,cdpsyfg,1rqfxd,AskReddit,hot,1

Mescacakanisnapesis,"""I managed to muscle in on a fishing day with my Dad and is buddy, Ted. The day started off well, I was volunteered to drive, put the boat in, pull up to the dock and park the truck while my impatient mentors sat in the boat. Once we were on the water, I was more than ready to wet a hook. We pulled across the channel to a rock wall, a favorite spot of the two old anglers. They gladly pointed me to the ""choice spot"" to fish from, the drivers seat of the boat. Strategically placing their casts, they forced me to the other side of the boat, and open water. I took advantage of my Dad when he was ""buzzed"" by a bird the size of the boat. Dad hit the deck, I checked to make sure he was OK, then snuck in a few casts on the ""prime"" side before he gathered himself. On the second cast, ""it"" hit. Out of the water jumped the biggest largemouth I had ever hooked. I reeled and kept tension like a pro as this fish exited the water another time, showing us its size and beauty. I told Dad to grab the net. He took too long reaching, fumbling, and kicking for the net. By the time he had a firm grip on the net, the fish I had worked so hard to get in the boat had freed himself from my line. Disappointed by the lost battle, Dad apologized with the biggest ""I'm so sorry"" I had ever heard. The spirit of fishing was not with us the rest of the day, as we didn't get anything else. The only thing we talked about on the way home was the ""dive bombing"" bird. My Dad passed away a few years later and at the funeral several stories were told, but one story had new light. Ted brought up our fishing trip, and what he told me brought tears of joy and sorrow. He said there were forces beyond my control keeping me from landing the ""bragging rights"" fish that day. He then told me that when Dad was reaching for the net, he paused to look at Ted and winked-this fish wasn't going to make it in the boat. Tears rolled and as I walked over to his casket, I remembered that award winning line, ""I'm so sorry"". But now, I knew he meant, ""I gotcha""!",null,0,cdpoxm1,1rq25j,AskReddit,hot,3

Ash_ash,"I met him this summer at a concert. Got his number but wasn't too interested. Was kind of hung up in my ex who moved to Europe. He would text me a bit for the whole month of June and I would answer for a bit and then stop. Just thought it of it as nothing. Then I had someone close to me pass and I mentioned it to him in a text one day. For a stranger, he said so much that actually helped me through this rough time, more than any of my close friends had said. So I decided to give it a shot and go out to dinner with him. Our first date lasted 7 hours. I had never met someone who I just instantly clicked with. Felt like I finally understood what people meant by that stupid love at first sight thing. We spent the entire date just talking non stop. We spent the next 3 weeks hanging out everyday, met his family, met his friends. Then summer was over and I had to move 3 hours back to school for my final year. He was 25 and had a full time job so we couldn't see each other too much. He visited me twice and we talked everyday for 3 months. Then he slowly stopped answering. Our plans fell apart. Then one day he just sent me a message saying he was done, and he was sorry. That's it. Haven't seen or heard from him since.

(I won't say what it is because maybe he reads this o_O.)  I didn't really realize that he felt I was embarrassing him infront of his friends when I said ""hi (insert nickname).""  So me being hurt and immature I publicly ignored him because I felt he's response was so cold, blunt, and harsh.

In reality he was communicating in a healthy, mature, and correct manner for a kid.  Years later his mom said he gets so embarrassed when she uses his nickname in public.  (I wish I had told him as he sat by me that when his mom teases him or affectionately calls out to him, it just shows how much he's loved.)

He got away because he really was super sweet, confident, smart, and a nice guy.  And extremely handsome!  I met him years later and I just got dumb shy and didn't really speak.  Guys huh, can be so sensitive. ",null,0,cdprhaw,1rq25j,AskReddit,hot,1

jaynus,"I'll give a serious and current answer (still ongoing):

I'm 27 years old, married (no kids), and had a drinking problem the past 4 years (when my mother passed away). Things finally fell apart for me 3 months ago. I lost my job, was evicted, my wife moved back in with her father. I've been constantly employed since I was 17, never without a job. Plus, I've always made good money (6 figures since I was 21. My new job, I am over 200k a year)

There I was, 27, homeless, jobless and completely broke. Due to my drinking, I always was broke and overspent. I was never close to my father - but he is a 30 year recovered alcoholic. 

I cried for help, and despite our animosity and disagreements, he has been here supporting me since then. A month later, I found a new (great) job - practically my dream job. I have been living at my office sleeping in a conference room or commuting 6 hours a day to work on the bus (lost my license, also due to drinking) from couches I could sleep for a night across town, for the past month. He paid and supported me through all of this - having lunch once a week on Sunday when I wasn't exhausted. I just got my first paycheck last week. over $20,000. I'm finally saved.

If he had not come to my rescue, who knows where I would be today. Probably dead somewhere in a gutter. I owe my recovery and frankly, my life today to him.

red112358,"Late to the party, but I'd still like to share. It's Thanksgiving after all. :)

We were in deep financial trouble when I was in middle school. My parents had bought a restaurant without having any knowledge of the restaurant business a few years prior, and that endeavor quickly went down in flames. We had also moved into a new house when my parents got into the restaurant business. All very poor decisions, and they were about to hurt A LOT.

I had no idea any of this was happening until my brother and I found a notice that our house was foreclosed. Shit quickly went down after that. My dad closed down the restaurant and we moved out of a nice big house into a dinky 2 bedroom apartment for the 5 of us.

We had no source of income. The emergency fund was all drained, and there was a standing job offer in Korea that my dad had to take.

My 2 brothers and I had lived in the US for all of our lives. We were pretty white washed. Our Korean was poor, and we were too old to move back and readjust to life there. There was no way we could get up to speed to all the other Korean students, and East Asian schooling in general is BRUTAL.

So what did my dad do? He left to Korea on his own, leaving all of us here so we would be able to continue our schooling in the US. We're a very close knit family, and this was ROUGH. My mom spoke no English; my dad basically took care of everything.

He now lives alone in a one bedroom studio apartment on the other side of the world. My parents miss each other very much, but they will continue to do this until my youngest brother is finished with high school and heads off to college.

I'm currently attending MIT. The first brother is attending Notre Dame. I tried hard to make the sacrifice ""worth"" it to my parents, but I know there were a lot of sleepless nights and loneliness that both went through to get us to this point. And I will forever be grateful. I love my family.

And if either of you fuckers YJ or K are reading this, you'd better feel the need to call dad ASAP. Happy Thanksgiving y'all. ",null,0,cdoyty8,1rnazp,AskReddit,hot,10

Aqpwod,"When I was still 9 years of age, I watched a lot of news on the TV. I grew up without a lot of cartoons, so I turned to the news whenever I got bored. At least once every month, however, the local news would broadcast a story about a recent murder, sometimes going into detail into how the victim was killed, and sometimes showing sketches of the murderer. That seriously scared me.
Anyway, this idea of murder practically shattered my innocence and comfort. We lived in a pretty safe, neighborhood, so there wasn't much reason to be scared. But still, the idea of a stranger coming in through the safety of the door shocked me. I didn't know what hid around the corner, and I was scared of anything in the dark.
I became increasingly paranoid. Every night, I would try to keep the light on for as long as my parents were willing to let me keep it on. I refused to sleep without a nightlight, and I surrounded myself with stuffed animals to keep me company. Every noise that the house made would drive me close to tears. Eventually, I started praying, to God that He would help ensure the safety of both my family and myself.
Finally, I told my mother of my situation. I told her how I was scared that bad guys would come into our house, and possibly kill us. She told me that the bad guys lived on another planet, and that any news story that was broadcast would come from that planet. We didn't have to worry because on Earth, where we lived, everybody lives in peace and love, and as such, they didn't exist. Being 9 years old and still quite naive, I took it in and instantly believed it to be true. The dark, for some reason, was no longer a threat to me, and every evil which I knew was now banished to that planet.
I'm almost 18 now, and I still want to think that any evil that is in this world is on some distant planet far far away.

Real music is released in its finished form as an album. Not individual songs. Unless its pretend music pushed out JBs flacid sphincter.

I blame pop. Popculture was pushed on us, eventually most budged and started loving it just because the flood of pop flushed out real music. We had no time to wade trough the shit any more. The fact remains it is scientifically designed to be smooth and easy on our ear canals. Do we want oat meal, or chilli stir fry? 

Rant over thanks for not agreeing.


Please listen to the albums by the artists who defined musical categories. Whatever your preffered category is.


I listen mostly to melodical swedish metal, death and trash, power and polyrhytmics such as djent.

Made in Sweden(c) tells you its genuine and thought out in a fashion you wont find anywhere else in the world.
An experienced metalist will be able to tell whitin seconds where the band is from. Especially if its american (just btb). (not that american music sucks, its often really good). 

In Flames defined death metal in the early days, and continued to pave the way into melodical death metal. Any of the early albums, take your pick. 

At the Gates defined the thrash metal genre. Their album Slaughter of the soul is beyond a shadow of a doubt the most beloved and soul-enlightening creation of all time. They then evolved into The Haunted. Possibly the best band of all time.

The Haunted - Made me do it, and One kill Wonder. Just definitions of music my teenage years. Professionals, tight as hell and just perfect thrash metal. 

Meshuggah defined i guess ""djent"". I dont like the word but there really is'nt any other. Polyrhytmic deep hyper advanced death metal really.
The album Nothing did it for me. It changed my life as a drummer, and since the day it was released i have tried to master it. Tomas haake is so far beyond any other drummer and performs flawlessly every time, creating sounds and rythms that will chill your spine and wonder how a human can do that. Nothing will ever come close. Mention Dream Theatre and you dont get it. (DT are good too, but the singer is horrid and spoils it)


Other awesome albums are anything Sepultura/Soulfly. 

TL;DR

At the Gates - Slaughter of the soul. I have actually listened to this album a minimum of 8000 times.

The Haunted - Made me do it, one kill wonder

In Flames - 1994 - Lunar Strain 1995 - The Jester Race 1997 - Whoracle 1999 - Colony 2000 - Clayman are the good ones portraying their old sound. The new is good too. Great even.

Meshuggah - Nothing. The title says it all. Nothing comes close. You wont be able to speak.

Zonaria - Everything they have released so far. Awesome melodic death metal from northen sweden. It headbangs your organs inside you as well as your mind.

Down - Diary of a mad band. Think ""New Orleans is a dying whore"". Was Pantera.

Also Pantera - anything. You dont like it you are not alive.

Then I'm sitting at a bar with this girl Cassie when in walks my ex.  Turns out they are dating and have been for a while (in my dream).  My ex and I lock eyes and all of the amazing feelings that I had/have for him came rushing over me.  The rest of my dream was just a bunch of random things where Ryan is with me.  

This dream was pretty mild compared to some of the dreams I've had about him in the past, a lot of sexual dreams, me leaving my husband for him and things like that.  Feeling guilty as fuck!

Enderdejorand,"**I've always felt lucky that when I was little, I came to live with my dad.**

My mom didn't have a lot of money, is pretty much an alcoholic, and has been involved with drugs on and off throughout her life. Around my third birthday, her sister came down with cancer, and she went to Florida to take care of her during her final days. My dad didn't believe her sister was sick, and he refused to let her take me. He assumed that if she left with me, he'd never see his son again, so he immediately went to the courts to petition for custody. 

My dad's a lot more stable than my mom. He's always had a job while I was growing up and is relatively well off money-wise. He's always been really willing to help people with his money if he can. For example, when my half-siblings (from my mom's first marriage) went to college, he helped pay a decent amount of their education costs. He's also helped keep my mom afloat so she can have an apartment. 

But he's never really let me feel like I didn't have to work to get a benefit. For instance, in high school I wanted to take art classes on the weekends, to get formal training on top of my school work. For me, it was a pretty big cost: almost $200 for a semester of weekend classes. I had to work really hard on my studies to justify that type of expense, and eventually my dad paid for it. I always felt a little guilty that he would splurge on me like that. But years later, he told me he would have always paid for those classes, because he thought I had talent and he wanted me to embrace my talents. (sort of a don't-hide-your-talents-under-a-basket thing)

I believe I've done relatively well for myself, but I'm always very aware that I could have been raised in a completely different situation. People often talk about the privilege that comes from growing up with money, and I know that if I had grown up with my mom I wouldn't have had the same opportunities. For me, college was expected; for my half-siblings, college was necessary. That's one big difference among many others that let me know that I was really lucky to grow up the way I did. 

Don't get me wrong. My half-siblings are very successful, married, and have their own families now. They have wonderful lives and it worked out for them. But in my mind, it worked out in-spite their circumstances, not because of them.

Knocked him through a nine inch wall,

The good this is that you can find them on Ebay in their refurbished store: [http://www.ebay.com/itm/Monster-Inspiration-Noise-Isolating-Over-Ear-Headphones-Black-Refurbished-/121146038132?pt=US_Headphones&amp;hash=item1c34ddd774](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Monster-Inspiration-Noise-Isolating-Over-Ear-Headphones-Black-Refurbished-/121146038132?pt=US_Headphones&amp;hash=item1c34ddd774) for 99$ which is better.

To be honest, before that day I had never heard of Monster, and when I talked about it to my friends they told me it was the same kind of garbage as the beats by dre, but I only listened to my ears and bought them, and I am very happy with them now !

bito89,"Both of us were pretty religious, so it was common in our circles to get married young (partially because marriage meant sex and who wanted to wait for that?) We get married and my young 21 year old virgin self is more than excited. I'm finally gonna do it! Well, sparing the juicy details, it just would not go in. 

No mater how slow, no matter how much lube, penetration was like a brick wall. For my beautiful wife, it was like knives. We expected pain being Virgins, but not having sex the whole honeymoon?? I felt that A. My wife needs to suck it up and get over it and it will get better . Or B. something is wrong, but I have no idea what. 

Needless to say, it was very awkward having friends joking high five me for the sex or pretend to everyone that our honeymoon was  sunny, sexy and satisfying. I tried to be a perfect husband, never showing or directing my  frustration toward my wife. Marriage is not abut sex, but without it, the bond sufferers immensely. It was difficult to feel unattached to my wife after such a short time. 

The fact that we could not have sex sent her into a depression. Herself taking the blame for our suffering. After a few months I decided to see if there are others like us. the gynecologists we costed were incompetent, telling her to just relax and to have more foreplay. I became the master of foreplay during that year, but like a dog who preformed tricks with no treat, it became difficult. 

Through my research I stumbled upon a condition called ""Vaginismus"". Basically it's a physiological reaction where penetration or the anticipation of it causes the muscles of the vagina  to contract. It is a common side effect among victims if sexual assault but also with what I'm reading, ""victims"" of über religious childhoods where sex is taboo. 

My wife had been raised that sex before marriage was evil. This training had physiologically manifested in vaginismus. Long story short, we soon started counseling, physical therapy to allow her the ability to control her muscles better, and bought dilators to incrementally allow her to take larger sizes. 

Long story short, this process took about 6 months. In that time of a sexless marriage suffered, but it allowed a challenge that forged a solid and life long bond in our relationship. We are still immensely in love and now enjoy and very active sex life. I cannot stress how important communication is in a relationship, especially regarding sex. We may have been young and stupid to get married so fast, but I'd do it again in a heart beat. Love you babe! 

TL;Dr: got married young couldn't have sex. All better . Now has the sex

puppies_in_bowties,"Time to quit lurking and actually post.

I married a man I'd been dating for 3 months because on our 2nd date he broke down and confided that we was dying of terminal leukemia. He said he wanted to make the most of his remaining months and marry me. Being 23 and dumb, I believed him without asking for any proof, and said yes. My family all rallied behind me, believing him to be a dying man, and threw us an incredible wedding even though they barely knew the guy.  

He refused treatment , playing the 'wish to die with dignity' card, and finally after 4 months of marriage and no decline in his health, I confronted him. It was a lie, an elaborate lie. My husband is a sociopath and pathological liar. Wish I'd known that.

scnavi,"He was abusive, and controlling, and just overall fucking insane.  Like throwing a hissy fit in the grocery store because I wouldn't  buy him stuff to make iced tea insane.  

Now I look back and I should have seen the warning signs, but you never think your husband is going to choke slam you on the kitchen floor for a disagreement over a chicken recipe.  He also slept with one of my friends, although I never confronted either of them about it because I didn't even give a shit and was ready to end my life at that point.  

Then he left me and it was fucking awesome. It was the nicest thing he's ever done for me. 

Edit: I'm just going explain the chicken and iced tea thing better since I'm getting a lot of questions about it.  

I was making bacon and feta stuffed chicken for his mother's birthday and I was doing it ""wrong."" So he choke slammed me. 

I wouldn't mind buying stuff to make iced tea, but he got in his mind that he was going to make these incredible iced tea concoctions with gourmet tea bags and he wanted about $30.00 worth of tea bags.  I suggested he just get the normal stuff and he flipped out.  I was the only one working so we didn't have the money for it.  But he flipped so hard, I bought it for him, and he tried making these tea creations, ended up hating them and throwing them all out.  It's just one of those examples that stuck out to me.

teehee243,"He is a completely different person around his very religious family. He down talks about me to his family to make himself look better. He ""hired"" his friend to ask my friends about any ""dirt they had on me"". He lies, a lot. He has anger issues (has never been physically abusive, just very angry). Since his mother cleaned up after him he does not do it himself, even now. He is super self conscious. He cries easily. He hates me asking questions about his religion and gets pissed when I do. He talks waaaaaay to much. He acts dumb when he is confronted about things. He spends money we don't have on things we don't need. He snores (newly developed). He puts cigarette butts in his pocket and never empties them when laundry is done, leaving a wonderful smell that makes the clothes need to be re-washed again. He does not see the weirdness in having a conversation with anyone and everyone, anywhere about things that do not need to be said to strangers like, I really don't think this random person standing behind us in Walmart gives a flying fuck about how you were raised and how many cm dilated I am (when I was pregnant). 
Damn. Why didn't I wait a bit longer... 

Edit: First I want to thank you all for the kind words and criticism. I was initially trying to answer each comment but there are quite a lot to answer and more flooding in. So I will try to address the repetitive questions. 
1. This was not my intention to have this blow up and get sympathy from anyone. I seriously thought I was just listing things that I did not like about him that I found out about after we got married, like the question asked. Never did I think this was in any way really abusive relationship (this marriage does not compare to the other things I had been through) , just very bad personality traits. 
2. He is active duty military and Southern Baptist. His name is not Jeremy. 
3. He is a somewhat hard worker. He just isn't motivated much and constantly needs reassuring words and confidence boosters to get him to give everything his all. 

4.He has become a great dad, he was not at first, he will admit that himself to people if the conversation comes up. He was jealous of all the attention my daughter was getting with the co-sleeping, breastfeeding and colic baby. Also, I had some pretty bad anxiety that my child was going to die if I did not have someone watching her while I slept, so I rarely slept but he often slept 12+ hours a day. Which I thought was fine because he couldn't do much anyways. Or at least I thought so at the time anyways. He is not allowed to spank, hit, or use any type of physical ""discipline"" with her. This took a lot of talking about to get him to understand that the Bible is bullshit when it says ""spare the rod, spoil the child"". I will not stand for biblical raising of our child. She will not be going to church or be learning about religion unless she asks about it. I do not want her to be scared into religion. This is where his family and I have our issues. 

5. I do not have a separate account to put money in right now because I am not working right now, I'm getting a job next month. And that is if his schedule allows me too, if not I will be saving the extra money from my school loans, before I was using the extra to help pay off his debt. I thought I was being helpful. 

6. I am ""stupid"" for getting married so quickly and not seeing the red flags. None of them were visible to me before. We were great friends for over a year before we started dating and he seemed like the perfect man but then again I didn't have to great of men to compare them to, other than my adoptive father. 
7. I am not staying with him to ""mooch"" off him. I have been attempting every possibility to make this work. Counseling, therapy, medication, ""praying"", books, etc. I also am like his live in maid, cook, nanny, masseuse, laundry detail, dog babysitter and handy""man"". The only reason I started school and started looking for a career and to save up in case this marriage ended is because my best friend pointed out that I didn't seem happy. She has known me and watched me through the years before meeting him and after, pointing out things I do now that I didn't before. She also went through a situation where she has two kids and her husband cheated on her and she had to leave him. She had no way to provide but she had some family to help her. She got through it, I do have some that could help me but being it is on my biological father's side I don't know how that would really go over. As my biological father was not allowed to be a part of my life until I turned 18 after he gave up his rights when I was 9 (I didn't see him but 4 times my whole life prior, when asked to talk to him and find out more about him when I got older, my mother kept reminding me that he wanted nothing to do with me and I can talk to him if I want when I turn 18). Plus my adoptive father is amazing but has done what you all have described not to do, and that's stay with someone just for the kids. Even though the situation is so shitty and I hate seeing my dad so miserable, if my dad had not stuck around we would probably be in to popping pills and hanging out with drug dealing meth head family members like my mother. I am not bringing my daughter around that as that environment is worse than mine, I think. 

8. This isn't a newly developed thing me going to school and attempting to work. Between moving across country, three deployments, my side of the family emergencies, pregnancy, and all the shit in between I have a been going through school. I started a year before I was pregnant but took breaks during his deployments or during the summer. Though once I got pregnant I made sure stayed in and kept at it. I am being smart and preparing for the worse but hoping for the best, and if things were to get better then I would have a career to help him pay off his debt, or extra money to save for my daughter for school. If anything were to happen I have several friends places I could go to here on base or all my family lives within a couple hours of here. I have no issues with temporary help but nothing that would be for long term until I finish school. 

9. Everything I have listed I have confronted him about during or after the fact. His acting different around family, I tell him I find it to be unfair because I have to watch what I say in fear that his parents flip out on him for something I wasn't supposed to say. He said I don't understand how his family is. I seen him get ""the look"" for saying damn but have never gotten more than silence after I swear on accident. My family, we swear like sailors, except my youngest sibling though he does let them slip around me when he plays GTA V, but I don't care. His talking down about me in front of his family to make him look better I think is this persona he tries to keep up, he wants his family to be proud of him and think he's amazing and this innocent person. I have confronted him about it after having our daughter, he apologized and said he didn't realize he was doing it and haven't been around him family again since then to see if it has indeed changed. His asking dirt about me is I'm guessing because he has been cheated on by past girlfriends, I think that's what he had said when I confronted him on this. His angry ways I think are from his parents ""tough love"" and ""whoopings"" as a child. His parents never taught him how to cope with his anger or show him the right way too. His excessive talking to strangers just makes me feel uncomfortable, I am quiet and I keep to myself. A friendly hello or nod, or talking about how old my daughter is, is perfectly fine. But conversing about personal stuff to individuals while I'm standing right there just makes me feel uncomfortable. I have told him this. He still does this. Maybe it's because he was raised in the south and I in the north? Or because he has a loving relationship with a wide range of people from his church and I have been more of a stay out of my bubble kind of person. His self consciousness seems to be because he was made fun of for being chubby when he was little by his cousins. His crying is usually when confronted about something and he knows he was wrong and I always console him instead of stay angry at him. Though he did cry once when our cat scratched him, that... I don't know. So it's not that I have not discussed these things with him and he isn't aware about them. His lying has always been an issue and has not changed. The only thing I feel is left is couples counseling to see if that works. He is even aware of why I'm going to school, because if anything were to happen then I can provide. He doesn't like the fact that that is my reasoning but maybe that will make him work harder to be a better human being knowing I can leave if he does anything that crosses the line. 
The cigarette thing... Just is frustrating. I don't mind doing laundry, I'm happy to do it. But to have to redo laundry because you can not empty your pockets in the garbage or throw them in an ash tray before you throw your stuff in the wash, seems so simple to me. 

Through it all I love this man for certain reasons that have kept me around but there are things that needs maturing and growing. As I have things I need to change as well, I am not perfect. I know certain qualities he does not like about me, such as being so forgiving, this usually leads to problems for me especially with my mother. I do not like doing the dishes. I hate it but will do them eventually. I like to shower with the lights off, he hates it because he thinks I cant see. I love skim milk, he loves whole, I buy skim instead. I buy healthy shit to eat to help him lose weight without actually saying anything so he can feel better about himself, he wants hot pockets, microwave dinners and energy drinks on tap. 
So even though this thread was meant to just be a part of the conversation, I am thankful for all the advice and insight. I have read everyone of your comments and am so grateful to have people help me with advice, life stories and be TRUTHFUL with me. I appreciate it more than you know.

That he has severe anger issues and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde's on me regularly. I have told him that he needs to seek help or we need to go to counselling together, he refuses. I'm a mental health nurse, but he needs hard core therapy beyond our four walls. This morning, he woke up bc the cat was scratching the carpet, proceeded to yell at me for 30 minutes, stomp around the house searching for the cat so he can ""skin her and hang her from a tree"". I asked him several times to stop yelling. He said that I should be as upset as he is. I wasn't. He put his ring on the dresser and is now sleeping downstairs. He wanted my rings back. They are sitting on the dresser next to his. The next move is his... I've told him his anger would be the end of us and it seems he's made his choice. 
(Edit) I wrote him a letter asking him to spend the day thinking about life without me. He called me and told me to give him his fucking ring back. The last lines of the letter were ""I love you. I want to give you your ring back"". Now he tells me that if I do not declaw the cat then ""we are over"". The cat is 9 years old. I think declawing is  inhumane and he knows that.

wjescott,"My ex and I got married when I was 19, she was 18.

1. She used sex for no other purpose than as an acquisition tool. She never enjoyed it (her words). When I could no longer give her anything new, she used it with other guys for the same purpose. She had a shit job, yet somehow managed to buy new clothes, purses, even a car. I was extraordinarily naive (kinda still am) so I just figured they paid her well. Turns out I didn't know what they were paying her for.

2. I ended up becoming a sort of zombie. Get up, go to work, bring back paycheck and give it to her. We were married for 7 years, and I only actually took one vacation (a week) that entire time. The main reason I never noticed her cheating on me was that I wasn't there, I was always at work. 1997 was a lost year for me. I don't remember anything that happened that year at all.

3. I lost my 20's. While my younger work friends were going out to clubs, to concerts, to festivals...I was working. I was constantly trying to make our lives better, because I thought cash would do it. I was never actually ""single"" until after my divorce, when I was broke AND single, which meant I was still unable to enjoy those things, and I was 28 when it was finalized.

paninius,"He is about as empathic as a goldfish. 

Last Monday I received the news an acquaintance of mine was murdered by her ex-boyfriend and her body was found by her young daughter (the little girl I used to babysit). 

His response “What do you want me to say? I don’t know these people and I don’t care.”

I don’t know why I even try. 

EDIT: To clarify; He has met this woman in the past, seen her a couple of times. The last four of five years we hadn’t kept contact. I didn’t expect him to cry or be overly emotional. But he just sat there and stared at me blankly..It kinda freaked me out. 

EDIT 2: Ok. I didn’t expect this post to get this many responses and cause the controversy it  did. I’ve seen responses ranging from ‘perfectly normal reaction’ to ‘he’s a sociopath, RUN!’. To make things even more clear; I wasn’t being hysterical or crying, but I was upset and shocked about what had happened. Whether or not my emotions were justified, I feel he should have at least cared how I feel. I didn’t call SO any names or curse at him for his lack of response. I’m pretty sure SO isn’t invested in a serious murder plot against me at the moment.
 
Go easy on me people; I’m a Reddit virgin.  I sorta expected this post to get buried

EDIT 3: All right..The reason I called the deceased woman an acquaintance is because technically she was more of a family friend than my personal friend, someone I saw quite frequently when I still lived at home. She’d come around for birthdays, holidays and sometimes just for a quick cup of joe. When I moved out of my parents’ house I didn’t keep contact with her, but my parents did.. Hence SO has seen said woman several times when we were first dating and a  perhaps two or three times after we moved in together. 

I don’t consider myself to be a drama-queen, however I’m well aware that this will hardly convince anyone in here. I don’t plan on getting a divorce, but I will admit that his lack of empathy (or perhaps my overly emotional side) is a thing that remains the biggest obstacle in our marriage …

I learned my lesson today; don’t talk about your personal life on the internet. Thanks to all those that meant well in their advice and answers!

My marriage lasted 6 years before I finally got too fat for her. I've always been fat my whole life. I was around 350 pounds when I met the ex wife. I just thought she liked to bake. So as a fat man I wasn't going to turn down any kind of dessert. I did find it kind of weird that the food became involved in a sexual way. Like for example, I could only get a piece of ass only if I ate the whole fucking batch of brownies, pie, cake, etc etc. I honestly had no clue about this feeder fetish until she told me 6 years into our marriage. She said I was too fat for her and she wanted someone new. We ended up getting divorced and I was over 800 pounds. I don't know the exact weight because the hospital scale only went up to 800 and I error'd it. The last 3 and a half years of my life after our divorce, I've been dieting and trying to get back the life I lost.  I'm currently 450 pounds and feeling great.

NuclearShadow,"I didn't realize how greedy, selfish, and crazy my ex-wife was until I married her. I guess it was always really there but I never really noticed.  Anything from petty little things like  not saving anything for me,  like junk food, I rarely touched such and it would have likely always been hers anyways but she would devour junk food so fast because she didn't want to share.

Her big spending sprees always were things just for her.   Even after our son was born she would waste so much money on things we didn't need and junk she didn't even really want or use.   Sometimes she would know that our son needed something,  diapers, baby food, formula  and so on.   She would come back  with everything but what our son needed  time and time again.   She simply does not like spending money for any reason on others.  Causing me to have to go out and get it  every-time.

She even neglected our son to the point where if she tried to put on a show and hold him in public or in-front of friends or family our son would start screaming and want to go to me.   She is a terrible mother that never played, fed, or changed him when he was baby and toddler.
(and now she has custody)   Just recently she got into a car accident where my son should have been in a booster seat but wasn't and hit his head and had a minor injury.   She doesn't care about him but rather just sees him as another possession, that she most certainly doesn't want me to have.

Naturally her selfish behavior has caused her to grow very obese now,  when we were still married I remember one time she ate a entire  half gallon of ice-cream, and then screamed from the top of her lungs at me blaming me for letting her eat it.    She takes responsibility for nothing,   she lies to the government about everything too and was recently in trouble with the IRS    but she also commits other types of welfare fraud such as selling food stamps  and lying about how much she makes to qualify for such programs.

If I knew she was like this before I married her, I would have never.

I think procrastination stems from feeling like something is insurmountable and not knowing where to start more so than it does from laziness and poor work ethic. Train yourself to break down projects into chunks of tasks and you should see an increase in your productivity. I don't think I've ever figured out how to improve my work ethic, but I've certainly learned how to become a smarter worker and be more efficient. ",null,0,cdpufn3,1rqjp0,AskReddit,hot,1

A good quality photo frame/collage - I'm not talking a shitty one you printed on the cheapest paper, but one that is in a half decent frame and on proper photo paper. It is costly time wise but can be very personal and touching.

I went outside and started looking for a place to stay for the first week or so I was fine sleeping at a friends house but he told me I had to go because his mom didn't want me sleeping over in the house anymore. But my friend gave me a tent and some food so later that night I set up a tent in the forest started a little camp fire and went to sleep. When I woke up I heard an animal that turned out to be stray dog I gave him some food and we quickly became friends so me and Buddy (I named the dog Buddy) went to the the High school to meet a few friends I pretty much took a few of them back to my camp and explained the situation and from then on I was called HomelessT even after I went home and was not sleeping in the forrest people would still call me Homeless T I guess it just kind of stuck. ,null,0,cdpoukf,1rpuoz,AskReddit,hot,1

I am currently overweight and I have been since I was about 10 years old (I'm currently 23), I am living at home and Im stuck at a job that I really don't like. I have no college under my belt because I still don't know what I want to do with my life, the thought of working at the same place for 20+ years scare the shit out of me and if I'm going to do that I want to do something I love. I have been stressing myself out for months trying to figure out what I want to do. As fa as my weight goes I will be starting a diet after the Holliday's and I will actually follow through with it and get myself healthy, I figure if I am actually happy and healthy for once I will be able to finally figure out who I am because right now I have been living a lie for 6 years pretending to be someone Im not, pretending to be happy and confident when I'm almost always unhappy.

Basically it means that I'm obligated to preserve/restore their inflated sense of self importance by assuming complete responsibility for their inexcusable (like cheating on me, and demanding that I euthanize my dog - to be specific) behavior, and believe me, after weeks of threatening phone calls, being followed and confronted in public places, having my property vandalized, I was more than willing to use the ""you deserve better"" bullshit to finally get them the hell out of my life for good.",null,0,cdpqhe4,1rq68h,AskReddit,hot,2

chrisgond,"Prior to choosing the M.D. route, I had declared as a Computer Science/Engineering major.  But in my Freshman year, my Grandpa died of cancer, and that had a profound effect on my career choice.  My family cared for him until the final days where he needed a skilled facility.  During that time, I took more of an interest in medicine in general and specifically elder care.

With that in mind, I switched to a B.S. in Chemistry and a pre-med path.  I never loved Chemistry like I did computer programming, but I stuck with it with my eyes on the MCAT and med school.  I volunteered at hospitals and worked the night shift at a nursing home to become immersed in the culture, so to speak.

A potential red flag that I missed happened during my time as a CNA.  I despised it.  At the time, I told myself that it was just the gritty truth of nursing home care, especially during the night shift, but with 20-20 hindsight, I just hated the work.  I soldiered through it, graduated and was accepted into three different schools.  Score!  Hard part's over, right?  

Wrong.

I was always near the top of my class academically, but in med school, the competition and material became much more intense.  I mean several orders of magnitude of intensity.  I struggled, and it wasn't for lack of studying.  The sheer quantity of material and the pacing blew me away.  None of it individually was very difficult, but the collective amount of material and the frequency of week-long testing marathons kicked my ass.

If I had been truly captivated by medicine, I think I could have made it, but the subject matter turned out to be not all that interesting to me.  I grew to hate it, and in the middle of Year 2, after failing a biochem test that I had busted ass for, I was despondent.

I wasn't failing school, mind you.  I maintained a C- average, and there were aspects of it I excelled at - particularly Anatomy, but I got to thinking about being average at a career I wasn't thrilled with.  I got to thinking about being an average doctor and what that meant.  Would a patient want an average or slightly below-average doctor?  My classmates were all about ""P = MD"". In other words, pass and you get your degree.  

Another smaller factor in contributing to my decision to leave was the MD lifestyle - high divorce rates, high rate of depression, brutal hours, and high liability insurance.  Wait, you thought MD's were all rich?  Yeah not so much for a small town family practitioner. 

After dropping out, I immediately enrolled in a CompSci program.  1.5 years later I had my degree and was writing code.  But now I had a Chemistry degree and lots of medical terminology/concepts to boost my credentials, and I was offered a job from a medical device manufacturer who wanted to send me to grad school.  The $60,000+ in debt was a bitch, but it was just money, and we chipped away at it.

I am infinitely happier now.

TL;DR

**I could not deal with the thought of being a below-average anything, especially a doctor with patients' lives hanging in the balance.  Ultimately that thought and encouragement from my wife brought me to my senses, and I dropped out.**

For both those sports we practiced before school, during lunch and after school for 5 days a week while that particular season was going. He also got me into cross country running, track and field and floor hockey. He pushed me when I thought I couldn't do it, but he knew I could - and I excelled for it. I've never had a teacher who believed in me as much as he did. He knows my brother (taught him), mom and grandparents. He also coached in the baseball league I played in (never got him as a coach though). 

I will forever be grateful for having him as a teacher. I wish my kids (if I ever have any) have a teacher just like him. My grandparents still see him every once in a while now that he is retired - he has a farm outside of the city and always asks about me.",null,0,cdpqns4,1rpwnd,AskReddit,hot,1

CaisLaochach,"I'm a lawyer, though not a criminal one, but fuck it, I'm pissed.

The purpose of a lawyer in criminal proceedings isn't really soley to prosecute or defend. Instead, in criminal proceedings, the idea is that you need to ensure that the justice system functions fairly and efficiently.

For the prosecution, this is relatively simple. Prosecution barristers are required to bring to a jury's attention *everything* relevant that happened. If that's enough to convict, brilliant. 

The job of a defense barrister is more to do with ensuring that the conduct of the authorities is acceptable. In essence, if you 'know' a client is guilty, you don't put forward positive defences, instead, you make sure that the prosecution can make their case fairly and within the confines of the laws of evidence. Thus, if confessions were obtained by illegal means, or exhibits were tampered with, you flag that. Your job is to ensure the police or whatever are doing their jobs within the law. And if that means a 'guilty' client gets off, then you've done your job. And it means the investigating authorities will need to do their's in the future.",null,59,cdp96k5,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,307
FeeSimple,"I had a client who sexually assaulted several boys in a prestigious Anglican boarding school where he was the boarding master.  I wasn't a lawyer yet at the time but I worked on the defence case as a law clerk.  The accused was acquitted of some charges, but died of brain cancer just before the remaining cases went to trial.  I initially felt neutral or indifferent about my firm acting for him, but this one time I had to transcribe some police interview tapes and I listened to the accused say that he knew what he did was wrong, but he didn't think his conduct was ""particularly serious or sinister"".  I also became very emotional when I drafted the Deed of Release for the settlement of one of the civil suits against him.

I was sexually assaulted myself for several years as a child, and I resented the fact that I never brought the offender to justice or received criminal compensation for all my medical bills.  Working on that defence case prompted me to make a formal complaint to the police about my own sexual assault.  However, I never carried through with it as I spiralled into severe depression after the police told me I had to wear a hidden microphone and approach the offender to elicit a confession from him before they could arrest and charge him.

I think much of my emotions was a projection of what happened to me personally.  If I hadn't been a victim myself, I would have been largely indifferent to acting for paedophiles.  Like many others have said in this thread, professionalism usually prevails.  However, a friend of mine is a Judge's Associate in the District Court.  He told me about a case where the parents of a 3-year-old girl sexually abused her to the point where ""the front hole and the back hole tore and became just one big, gaping hole.""

juicius,"I'm a criminal defense attorney. Over last 13 years, I've handled some cases that involved extraordinarily heinous allegations. But I've never felt that I wanted to see them convicted. Closest I got was being able to sleep soundly after a client got ~270 years in prison because first off, I worked my butt off and did everything I could have done, and number two, he did in fact committed the crimes. I think I could rest easily if only the former was true.

In American justice system, you have to understand that it's a machine. The prosecution, the defense, the judge, we are all cogs in the machine. Some may look bigger and more important, but in the end, the every part must work, or nothing works. And it's a machine that is designed to spit out justice. But if one part does not do its job, then the product can be tainted. Whatever results would not be justice because the machine designed for justice had malfunctioned.

Maybe the prosecution cheated. Maybe the judge was biased. Maybe the defense was lazy and incompetent. Whatever and whoever the fault, you do not get justice if that happens. Of course, I have limited power over the prosecution or the judge. The only thing I can control is my own performance. And my job is to vigorously defend the accused. And that's exactly what I do, trusting that the prosecution and the judge would do their job with exact same vigor and passion as I. I keep an eye on them, and I object and preserve the record if I feel they're not doing their job, but like I said, my emphasis is doing the job I'm tasked with to the best of my ability.

So if everyone does their job, then whatever results is by definition justice. Now, it's a bit idealized view of the process. The machine is capable of errors even when all parts work correctly. But the best guarantee of doing justice still lies with everyone doing their job to the best of their ability. If you demur and fail to present the best defense, then you have sabotaged the process, and even if the accused is convicted for the crime he actually committed, it still fell short of justice.",null,5,cdpde8l,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,41

InebriatedQuail,"This will probably be buried, but I think it's important to add:
My parents are both (very successful) criminal defense lawyers. They have represented a lot of unfortunate people throughout their years practicing, and I've thought a lot about going into law as well. I asked my stepdad, the top defense lawyer in the state, how he could live with or justify having defended some of the people that he did. His answer was, I think, fantastic. 

He told me that he defends people because the system must be flawless. It is his job to ensure that the prosecution has an utterly airtight case. The better he is, the better the prosecutor must be to defeat him, and the higher the standard of evidence and burden of proof. He truly believes that if his client is guilty and belongs in jail, and if the prosecution isn't sloppy, then to jail they will go. But it is his job to ensure that the prosecution does their job perfectly, explores every avenue, and works tirelessly to put the right people behind bars, rather than simply anyone 

He has represented some seriously unfortunate people. Most of them got reduced sentences, not off free. They all paid for their crimes, in one way or another, but he ensured that their voice as a human being was heard, and that they had the chance to reform. The rate of recidivism of his clients is extremely low, and that's something he's proud of. He helps people in their worst times and recognizes that they are more than a person who committed a crime.

The landlords got fed up and brought in my aunt who dragged her to court again. She tried to offer the cash but my aunt would not be appeased until her clients could evict the woman. Judge ordered it. They had to move out two or three days before Christmas.

My view is that the pressure of defending scumbags can only be handled up to a point. Lawyers are no different then lay-people and are painfully aware of the impact they can have on the victims. However they do what they do because they recognize that a fair society needs them. This knowledge often isn't enough and many develop deep personal problems. 

For instance recently in NZ, our top criminal lawyer committed suicide. He was a driven by his duty but compromised by the realities of his clients.  This contributed to making him a deeply unhappy man. 

So while its easy to point the finger at defence lawyers and label them as uncaring boogey men, the truth is that they do care. After all, if they really were cunts then they'd be in commercial law.

I don't hit on every girl that I'm talking to, so unless its obvious I just respond how I would talk to a straight guy.

Saturday Night Live has some cute jokes, I especially liked the Stephan character.  But all of those shows I didn't watch regularly.  Although I am seeing Seinfeld doing standup in a couple weeks.

Perhaps a defining catalyst was American Pie, a film that aimed to get laughs not by demonstrating wit or cleverness, but by shocking gratuity.  At this point, the downward slope of American comedy had finally found its core audience - dumb male teenagers.

British comedy, on the other hand, is still for adults.  It prides itself on knowledge of the world, an appreciation of the absurd and the simple pleasures of a pun.  A panel show like IQ or Nine out of Ten Cats would never work in America because its subject matter is too refined.  Monty Python is the gold standard of all things funny and American comedy has given up any attempt to meet or exceed that standard.

Anyway, one year, my friend and I were stopping by when we saw a woman, probably in her late 20's - early 30's vomiting beside the Zipper, her boyfriend - who presumably brought her on the ride for her first time - standing beside her.

dageekywon,"I don't know if it was disgusting more than totally sad, but I stopped at an accident that had just happened about 10 miles from where my parents live in the Sierra Nevada.  It was a rollover accident and I was the second on scene right behind a guy who had a radio in his truck that he could use to call for help (where they live to this day cell service is spotty at best).  So I ran to the car.

I got there and the Woman in the front seat was pinned so I made sure she was alright and calmed her down so she would stop struggling against her pinned legs.  I looked up during this and saw her child who was in a car seat, but the seat hadn't been properly secured and it was suspended above her head between the two seats.  The child's neck was obviously broken and there was nothing I could do.  He was probably about 8 months old.  I could see him trying to breathe and then he kind of let out this sigh and died.

Because of the adrenalin I had going, I didn't react at the time and kept helping her.  It took medics and the rescue about 15 minutes to arrive on scene and I stayed with her.  They got there and started working on her and I walked away from the wreck, talking to the CHP officer and the guy who had called in on the radio about it.

Suddenly the adrenalin left me and I fell to my knees on the side of the road and threw up.

The Mom was extricated and survived.

Its not really disgusting in the sense you're probably looking for, but its something that comes back to me in my dreams sometimes, and it is something I will never get out of my head for sure in my life, ever.

SpinYourMeat,"Carl Scheele. Referred to by Isaac Asimov as ""hard luck Scheele"", he made several important scientific discoveries a considerable time before they were 'officially' discovered. He discovered oxygen, molybdenum, tungsten, barium and chlorine.

He was an old-school scientist and had an odd habit of tasting and otherwise sampling the chemicals and compounds he worked with, and was eventually found dead at his work desk surrounded by various deadly chemicals.

eisbein,"Went to a big dinner party once. As we were sitting down at the table, the girl opposite of me started to complain and excuse herself, she had a bad case of the hiccups. I hate having the hiccups myself, it's really difficult to be taken seriously in any situation - and it's a very bad start to a dinner party amongst strangers. I didn't know the girl. But I knew one thing: hiccups, its' a mental thing. It's like when you have to go the bathroom - you don't really ""have to"" go. You can hold it in for hours if you need to. Mind over matter. Same with hiccups. If your mind is focused on something else, they disappear. So, I thought to myself: I will help this girl. It's gonna be painful for a while, but it will all end good. So I started dissing her in the most obnoxious way possible: ""Here we are, nicely dressed and groomed for a special night and all you can think of is your own problems. It disgusts me. It's people like you that is wrong with society today. Me, myself and I, just talking about, thinking about, caring about yourself..."" I went on a rant for a good three minutes. She didn't have a chance to intervene. Then I stopped and said: ""How do you feel about yourself now?"". She: ""Wow, you are quite a piece of work, you are probably the most unpleasant person I've ever met"". I answered: ""Yeah, but I was referring to the hiccups, do you still have them?"". She: ""No! They're gone! WOW!"". Then we had the best of nights. Once in a lifetime.

PS. No, we didn't marry...that would have been a better story. But still...

1) We were playing catch with this gelatinous thing- something that was like a cross between Play-Dough and Goop, so it was solid but extremely mold-able/squishy and kinda sticky. My brother said something to her while he was playing video games and she turned around to him at the same time that I had just thrown this goopy thing back. It got stuck in her waist-length hair and she started crying, saying that there was no way she was going to put mayonnaise or peanut butter in her hair to get it out. Her mom came in to see what was going on, and I got out of there really fast since I was embarrassed and didn't know what to do. A few days later, once I somewhat got over the embarrassment, I apologized and we stayed good friends for quite some time after that.

2) Everyone was in the family room and on my way to go join them again, I saw one of those big bouncy balls with the handle, where you can sit and bounce on it. There was about a minute of pure bouncy joy before I accidentally pulled it out from under me as I was bouncing up. I landed directly on my tailbone and the pain sent odd shivers around my lower back and pelvic area, in a way that forced me to pee. Everyone could see me from where they were but they only saw me once I was on the floor. They asked if I was ok and I just ""Mhmm"" with tight lips and sat there for a while to just breathe and let the pain subside.

So this goes by like a typical girly sleepover with boy talk and eating and worshiping satan and all, along with a lot of iced tea. So about 3 am we all head to our designated rooms, me with the newcomer. All goes well and sleepy times are happy times til about 7ish. I had the most vivid dream that I was a nurse teaching elderly women how to be comfortable with pissing in their adult diapers. Low and behold the ungodly amount of  iced tea I'd drank a few hours ago exits my body and I literally piss the entire bed. 

surprisingly, new friend doesn't wake up and I leave to call my mom in a panic as to what I should do. She tells me to clean it up if possible and not to blow my cover. Keep on mind I'm a fucking 16 and a half year old girl at the time, no excuse whatsoever.

Anyways, so I ended up getting cups of water and soap, washing the piss off the sheets and get them into the washer down in the basement. I find a different set of sheets and wake new friend up saying I spilled cereal all over the bed and needed to change the sheets. She wakes up, helps me change them and we go back to sleep.

Or we could be a cosmic mistake that has flourished into life. 


 We could be lonely voyagers in an empty unending sea. Or part if a great community of beings on the path to interaction as we evolve in time. There may come a time in our progression where we come to an end of discovering all that is possible, which is where we find our maker. We may in fact become the maker. 



Or, like time, our discoveries and travels through the universe or even multiverse continue into infinity. That is if we aren't wiped out by the universe and replaced.

FelixVulgaris,"Communism is a political theory in which all goods are help communally by a group of people. Although Stalin and Lenin's communist regimes committed many atrocities, they did so for political or financial reasons. In other words, there have been other instances of communism (for example, hippie communes in California) that have nothing to do with murder and oppression. Although communist regimes have been associated with violence, violence and death are not necessarily built into the political theory. 

Nazism is a very specific socio-political ideology that blends authoritarianism / militarism, nationalism, and racism to create very distinct in-group / out-group dynamics in a society. It has only been tested on a large scale once, and the result of that was the Holocaust. The dehumanization of anyone different from the core group of believers is built in to the ideology; which pretty much guarantees some form of violence will result when this kind of mindset meets with a differing opinion.

fabbricator,"Best and worst, all in one.

Went on a solo motorcycle tour from CA to mid-west.  I've done this trip several times.  I always get the first leg in in one day: so cal to Denver.  It's 1000 miles exactly.  Now, motorcyclists usually make this out to be some sort of super-achievement, but honestly, 1000 miles in a day isn't a big deal at all.

Anyway, I left at 4am, things were going great.  I'm on my Honda VFR with aftermarket padded seat, full custom leather suit.  Enjoyed seeing the sun rise when i was passing Neveda.

By the time I got to Utah, it got real cold.  Pulled over, and rest for a bit.  Have some breakfast... which attributed to the ""worst"" part of the story.

This is the first time I eat on the first part.  Unfortunately, I didn't count on suffering food coma... worst yet, food coma while going at 80mph on the interstate isn't good.  

By the time I got closer to colorado, I was dozing off on the motorcycle.  I am now an hour west of Grand Junction, Colorado.  I realize I am not gonna be able to make to Denver today.  I will get a hotel room in Grand Junction, it's on the way, and only an hour away.  Or, I can go out of my way and get a room in Moab Ut.

I booked it for Grand Junction.

I was now riding half dozing off, half awake.

By the time i open my eyes, i was already in the center divider of highway 70.  Speedo says 75MPH.  There's dirt and dried brush ahead.  I let go of the throttle (hitting the brake while at speed, in loose dirt is a bad idea) but the bushes came up faster than expected and there's no way I can dodge it.  

Front wheel of the bike hit the bush, twists the handle bar immediately, and I flew off the bike.  I did a few flips before hitting the ground, and a few more flips after hitting the ground.  

At this point, i was afraid the bike was going to catch up with me.  Thankfully, it stopped about 10 feet behind me.

now the good part:

The traffic stopped, and many people got out of their vehicles to help.  I couldn't move, so they held up a blank over me to shield me from the sun.  It was just after lunch time, so the sun is pretty brutal.

Ambulance came, and took me to the hospital.

Amazingly, after an accident like that all i had was a sprang ankle.

While contemplating what to do next, one of the drivers who stopped to help at the accident showed up.  He offered me the spare bedroom at him and his wife's house, and I took him up on it.  Seeing that it's already late in the afternoon, and i have no transportation (bike was towed away, it will start, but unrideable).  He let me stayed overnight at his place, and drove me to pick up my motorcycle at the tow yard (he had a truck and trailer).  Some times, strangers will do good things for travelers, no string attached.

Called a buddy of mine after picking up the bike and he drove up from so cal to pick up me and the bike.








If there ever was a ""priceless"" commercial, this would be it:  

* $3000 custom leather suit
* $400 helmet
* $300 leather gloves
* $400 boots

walking away from a motorcycle going 75mph to 0 mph in 2 seconds... priceless.

aught-o-mat,"When I was 13, I sucker punched an 'annoying' kid at a Boy Scout meeting. Right in the guts. I couldn't tell you why, exactly. It remains the only time I've ever struck someone with harmful intent. 

And I hit harder than I meant to.  He doubled over and collapsed onto the gymnasium floor. Before I'd time for regret, I was afraid. I thought I'd caused serious injury. He was screaming. 

One of the scout leaders came over. I assumed I was in trouble, but his anger was for the boy on the floor. ""Come on! Get up! Don't just take it!"" It was his father. 

I don't think he was encouraging a fight, he just wanted us to quit the scuffling. What he didn't grasp was that I'd just gut punched his son and knocked the wind out of him for *no apparent reason*. 

In the end, he was fine. It was just cruel, inexplicable, kid stuff. But it's that kid stuff that can be formative. It sticks with you. And this certainly stuck with me. 

20 years on, I saw him at a community picnic while visiting my parents. Now a volunteer with the scouts, he was in uniform and working with kids. It was a perfect time to offer a long overdue apology. 

I sought him out, but somehow lost him. I asked everyone - including his father - if he was still around, but wasn't able to connect. I wanted to tell him that I'm sorry for, and still regret what I did then. And that whenever the ""what's the worst thing"" trope comes up in conversation (or on Reddit) I think of him.

The world is quickly becoming a post scarcity world, which means that you're probably going to be unemployed. We're not going to need factory workers anymore. We're not going to need drivers anymore. We're not going to need secretaries anymore. 

The truth is that the world needs about 5% of the population to do research and engineering. We need probably 10% of the population to do maintenance work, such as infrastructure replacement, IT, etcetera. Maybe another 20% will do service work. And another 5% to be doctors and shit. And the rest of you will need to find ways to entertain yourself while receiving a reasonable baseline salary to keep some semblance of the economy going. These are all really really generous percentages by the way, since the reality is probably going to be something like we need 300,000 engineers period. 

If you want to make money in a world where most of the population doesn't need to work, you're going to have to find a way for people to express themselves. And that's through arts and stuff. As stupid as it sounds, pinterest and etsy is your life in the future.

Sigh.

Here is what I recommend, if your in college, take a programming logic class, if you're still up for it, take an objective-C class (the code language iOS is developed in)

I know Stanford has a free class on developing for iOS 7, but without those other classes, you won't be able to keep up.

It was a warm summers evening, the sun was sizzling in the sky and roasting us in Biology. Our teacher was laid back and easy to manipulate, with our students, we made class fun. There was this young lass called 'Shannon' a red haired bitch with a moody attitude who spread certain false facts. It was time to put her down. My friend and I hatched a plan. I would distract her by throwing a eraser past her face whilst my fellow mate grabbed her bag.

Ready, set, grab... Now note this is last period and you can easily stay after school, so we had to be sneaky. Upon grabbing her bag we emptied all of its inventory around the room. Carefully hiding her iPhone, make up and multiple over nick naks. Then we placed her bag back and carried on with our work.

We then left Biology with her staying behind trying to find her stuff, I heard she stayed around an hour behind trying to search.

My group of friends and I were always mischievous and I, so I end this story saying ""Fuck you Shannon"" and that there will be more adventures of us soon to come.

My dad was an abusive drunk. But he had semiregular moments of zen. I think this was one of them. A few years later, my hairline started receding. It was rough. I was still young (barely 20), but this one feature made me distinctively old. While appearances are superficial, blah blah blah, it's a pain in the ass to be winnowed down to like three options. The crown. The cueball. The combover. That seems to be it. I guess a twin fin is an option, but that makes staying employed difficult. And all the looks, except the cueball if you're Vin Diesel, are rather ridiculous. So. You're resigned. No matter what, a rather significant portion of your appearance is ultimately always going to be somewhat ridiculous and somewhat of a concession on your own part. I actually bought Rogaine, used it once and then tossed the rest out.

I have a lot of shit to do. Obsessing over my hairline is only going to take time away from that. So, my dad's advice has always returned to me when I got a little weepy bitch about it.

*Pay your dues now while you're young and have the energy, that way when you're older you can party w/o a care in the world.

My high school guidance counselor (there was only one) was a complete fucking idiot, and actually told everyone not to bother with college because we ""couldn't afford it.""  He brought military recruiters on campus constantly, with the strong implication that that would be our only ticket out of town, but we never had (nor attended) ONE college fair.  Even the ""career fairs"" were an absolute joke -- I swear to God, the only people who showed up to those things were the local merchants, manicurists, etc.  No professionals whatsoever.

Thankfully, one of the teachers finally broke down and organized an assembly regarding financial aid.  We heard words like ""Pell grant"" and ""FAFSA"" for the first time in our lives.  We were absolutely stunned; it was all we talked about for weeks.  That was absolutely the reason that many of us went to college, and I will be forever grateful.

I studied Elementary Education, but that didn't work out for me as there are STILL no jobs in my area to this day.  I got a job at a private company in the education industry, and I'm very happy there.  My husband also grew up poor, and he studied Biology.

2006-7 facebook was fairly new to most of us and my friend happened to have a lot of family as his friends. I posted some pretty light status update as him saying ""I'm glad I came here, to come out, no need to hide it anymore, free at last!"" and left it at that. 

He comes back from getting more drinks and we play some pool and hang out. Head back to the hotel room to watch a movie or drink and smoke more or listen to music, a few hours pass.

Then his mum calls him and asks him if he's gay. With me.

aught-o-mat,"A friend in college was a pharmacy major. While learning how to make compounds and capsules, he'd often bring materials back to the dorm with him. 

Once, he showed me a powdered dye chemists use to mark specimens on a slide. When mixed with water, it looked an awful lot like blood. It got me to thinking...

I asked him to fill the largest gelatin capsule he could find with the stuff. Sensing we were on the verge of prank greatness, he readily agreed. 

Next day, he produced the goods. I explain that we're going to embed the capsule in one of dorm shower heads, specifically the shower in the corner with the best pressure - the one *everyone* used if it was available. Why? Because one of our pals was in the habit of hitting the gym every night, and would always be alone in the shower by himself when he returned. 

So, after his workout, this guy toddles off in his flip-flops with his shower caddy. The rest of us gather in the hallway waiting to see how it'll all unfold. We hear him turn the shower on, but it sounds strange and sputtering. ""I bet he's looking right at the shower head!"" I exclaim. 

There was a rush of water as the capsule broke, followed by terrified screams and the laughter that comes with a good prank. He came out *covered* in dye. As though he'd stood beneath an animal being slaughtered. 

He laughed it off, but then got serious. ""You guys, I think we have a problem though.""

We all went into the shower room and found that the capsule had exploded magnificently. It was't localized to the corner, there was fake blood everywhere. Like something out of ""Natural Born Killers"".

muchtoomuchtoomuch,"I am not a pilot myself. But I once met a sweaty guy in an Indian restaurant in Panama who claimed that he used to be one. After a few decent drinks he told me the following story:

Many years ago he was the captain of a trans-pacific flight from Honolulu to Kuala Lumpur. The plane was packed with people and the air was thick and sweaty. Smoking was still allowed in those days. The take-off and everything thereafter had gone well enough, but something apparently did not feel quite right to him. After they had reached cruising altitude he handed over control of the plane to his co-pilot and then left the cockpit to make the rounds and greet the passengers; and to reassure himself that everything was proper and the way it was supposed to. The passengers were the usual bunch for this route. There were sticky guys in tacky Hawaiian shirts, stressed families with rummaging kids, sleeping old people, slightly frightened looking young people, and about the usual amount of men in suits, not really doing anything. But this sight did not calm the pilot. The people looked wrong, and they terrified him. They all seemed to him to be empty shells, imitators. He just knew. And because he knew, he was in danger. He half-expected them all to fall quiet and stare at him blankly at any moment. And indeed, out of the corner of his eye he saw them drop their facade. He saw the faces of laughing people fall blank, the eyes of sleeping people open and those of children pierce him sharply, reading his thoughts. He was sure. Of course, as soon as he looked at them straight on they had their masks back up and looked and acted perfectly normal. But no matter, he rushed back towards the cockpit, nearly stumbling. He entered, slammed the door shut and without a word, took over control of the aircraft and began to figure out the best way to crash the plane into the ocean without his crew being able to interfere, at least before it was too late to stop him.

In the end he did not do it, obviously. The thought of dying in close proximity to these things terrified him too much. He brought the plane safely to Kuala Lumpur, disappeared into the city and got drunker than he'd ever been. The passengers never knew.",null,3,cdpl8b6,1rpkzy,AskReddit,hot,8

 Eventually after laughing at me a bit, he turned the engine on again and we came back to the airport immediately. Just about 30 minutes after we started our flight. I thought it was weird but i was more like, meh, whatever. 

We landed and he was very nervous, and it wasn't  until a few hours later while having a beer that he told me after he turned the engine off, it wouldn't start again, and it was so that he actually started looking for an Emergency Landing spot to which he could plane to. Eventually the engine turned on again and thats why we came back immediately, so he could send the plane to the mechanics. 

Phew! 

I flew a bunch of other times with him and everything was always ok. 

Eventually that piece of shit plane did it again, and this time it turned into a real Emergency Landing. The plane broke in half. but fortunately my friend and his trainee (a girl who was on her very first lesson) were completely unharmed. ",null,1,cdplphy,1rpkzy,AskReddit,hot,1

FVPlant,"I moved in with this girl I met at a coffee shop, we were both looking for a roommate at the time. I went through the usual questions and hung out with her a few times before moving in. I should have known something was up when she assumed we were moving in the moment we brought up the idea. Looking back on it she was really forceful about us living together. She said she hated a dirty house, didnt party, didnt drink, blah blah and all that. On paper she sounded great. (Im a college student and she has been out of highschool for a few years but decided on an assistant manager job at arbys) Every night she would party and drink with lots of people till 6 am. The house was always trashed! Like her clothes and underwear spread about the living room, tons of actual trash and food wrappers scattered around the house. Her room had about 2 feet of clothes and garbage. She NEVER cleaned and the bathroom looked atrocious when she got done with it. She fucked this guy all over the place, leaving me locked out of the bathroom and even apartment for hours at a time. Once, at 3 am, she burst into my room because she wanted to introduce me to the people she met in the parking lot of a bar! after a few months of this (and my grades suffering from lack of sleep and study time) I pleaded with my landlords, showed them pictures, invited them over, and got my friends to verify that this chick was a nightmare. I was willing to rent a one bedroom from them (they said I couldnt afford it though....). When she caught wind that I was trying to move out she started getting really bitchy. Telling the landlords I was breaking things, preventing her from eating by destroying the stove (I took the top off to clean it), and then full on attacked me one night. The cops where called.

Fast forward a year, Im living with 2 new people after having got away from that psycho after she attacked me. My 2 roommates are getting ready to move out forcing me to either find a new roommate or leave as well. So I chose to leave. My ,previously nice, landlords refuse to send me my deposite for 4 months. I FINALLy get it back and notice that 60% of it is missing. They claimed I had DESTROYED the apartment.

bookwench,"Welcome to the No Bullshit Cult of Growing the Fuck Up. 

1) Quit bitching.

2) Get off your ass.

3) Change whatever shit gave you the idiotic impulse to bitch in the first place. 

If 3) is impossible, I mean really impossible, I mean like breaking the laws of physics impossible not just too hard for you personally at this moment - and this has been independently confirmed by 3 other members of the cult - and it's not something like a stupid ass hangnail, but a legit, you have an issue and nothing can help problem - then, and only then, can you bitch. 

4) If any other member of the cult has a legit issue and you think you can help them fix it, you're obligated to help them, at least a little bit. Like, 5%. 

5) No fucking begging for money from other cult members. You can ask for help, but they can't give you cash.

6) You will take care of your own shit. You will not litter, you will not take charity without working for it at least a little, you will not own pets you can't handle, and prior to having a child you'll get some training and take care of your own issues so you don't fuck the kid up. If your S.O. is a dirtbag who can't handle their shit, you will dump them. 

7) You will not be a quitter. Once you accept responsability for something you will motherfucking well see that shit through to the bloody, bitter end. No pawning that shit off on anyone else. Kids, pets, work projects, art, cleaning your damn room  - this goes for everything. 

8) When you fuck up, you will admit it immediately and publicly. You will own your fuck up, and if there's consequences - even jail - you'll do it without making a fuss or being a little bitch. Once you've done this your record is clean, and nobody can ever hold that shit against you ever again, unless you're a moron and don't learn and do the same damn thing again. 

9) You do not under any circumstances ever do anything to hurt someone else. You can defend yourself, but you don't ever deliberately set out to cause damage. Ever. Doesn't matter if the damage is small or large. Doesn't matter if anyone else knows about it. Doesn't matter if other folks think it's no big deal. You don't do that. 

10) And *being* a motherfucking member of this cult, you're not just making sure you don't hurt folks - you're also going to fucking well pay attention to what you're doing so you don't do things that will *accidentally* hurt others. You've got a reasonable amount of care and responsability you have to take in this life. Make sure you take it. 

That's it. Those are the ten commandments. Grow up or get the fuck off my lawn, you little piece of shit. You can wear pink bunny slippers and a tutu, and as long as you accept these rules you're in - but if you're wearing a suit and tie and million dollar watch and you're fucking around breaking the rules, I will have the largest person in our group eat beans, shit on you, and rip up your membership card.

Finally we got old enough that we could travel on our own and actually afford to do so. And we started planning to go to this festival. 

This whole time leading up to the festival we had a theme song that really captured the whole concept of the trip for us. We looved it. We would watch the video from when it got played the last year over and over. We would play it on the big speakers, over and over. 

Finally, it comes time for the trip. We get on the plane. We get off the plane. We get on a train to our hostel. We spend some time in the town near to the festival. And finally it is time.

We get on this train, we go and get in line. And then, just as I hand my ticket to the ticket checker guy. I hear it. Our song. The one we didn't think we'd even get to hear (12 hour festival with 14 stages.. there was no chance right?). It was playing on the main stage. 

So we walk/danced our way from the gate to the dance floor. It was the most EPIC moment. It was like we had our own theme song for this start of the thing we all love so much. It felt like it went it slow motion and like the whole festival had just been waiting for us. SO GOOD

nojustice,"One of the few useful things I learned from a ""driver re-education"" class I had to take one time was that every feeling we experience has a finite lifetime in our brains. The neurochemicals that are released when we feel happy or sad or angry or aroused or need a drink quickly fade away again, **unless we keep re-activating the pathways that released them in the first place**. This is why they tell you to ""count to ten"". But it's not enough to just count to ten and let the time pass; you have to also not keep triggering the emotion. The way that I like to think about it is that i experience whatever emotion it is, I let it have its moment, and then I let is pass. It's like I neither suppress it nor reinforce it, but rather let it pass over me. 

You will find your own way of dealing with it, but just remember that each emotion only lasts a few seconds to half a minute. Any more than that is you choosing to keep feeling it. All you have to do is choose not to. (I say ""all you have to do"", but I understand it's not as easy as that.

The nurse understands immediately and points him in the direction of the bathroom. Watching my best friend gingerly climb off of a hospital bed, cradling his underpants with both hands to avoid any leakage, and hobble off to the bathroom was one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen.

copiestopresponse,"Mine is a little unorthodox.

I worked at a corn stand. It was an old Chevy pickup with a large overhang built onto the back that got loaded up with corn, and I sat by it and sold it all day for $10 an hour, which was pretty awesome for someone still in high school. The selling part wasn't all that bad, I typically just brought a book and read between customers, and it taught me how to be really fast at returning change.

The shitty part was GETTING the corn. We didn't actually grow it in the area where we were selling it, so I had to drive two hours to get the corn, and I had to drive my boss' rickety old pickup truck that should have never passed inspection. That or an old Chrysler mini-van that had no suspension left at all.

The first time I went down, I went down with someone more experienced than me. We had to pick up 100 bushels of corn. I don't know if you've ever seen a bushel of corn, but it's a lot of fucking corn, and we had to stuff 100 of them into two small vehicles. It was WAY more corn than we should have been carrying, and was blatantly illegal.

Me, being an idiot, didn't just say ""no, fuck this"" and go home, I actually did the job. So I filled a van with something like 55 to 60 bushels of corn and had to make the two hour trip back north in a van so full of corn that it was nearly bottomed out. I couldn't see out the back, I couldn't see out of the passenger's side, I had corn in my lap and I was holding up corn with my right arm so it wouldn't fall over on top of me.

Now this would have been fine on a back road. But I had to drive this monstrosity on a four lane highway, through tollbooths, during rush hour traffic, and I wasn't really sure on the correct route to go. So I was following my fellow employee in the pickup, when they get pulled over in front of me by the police due to the CLEARLY illegal amounts of weight they are carrying. We had talked before hand, and the strategy for if this happened was ""Just keep going cause you'll get a ticket too.""

So here's young, naive me, with a van full of corn on a four lane highway, trying to somehow not kill myself. In order to stop I would need at least a thousand feet, as there was literally TONS of corn in the van. And I had to switch and merge lanes by blind hope, as I couldn't actually see where the hell anything was with all the corn I had in the van.

I spent the next two-and-a-half hours in blind terror, the whole time. The van was slow as shit, and any bumps I hit at all would cause a horrific grinding noise followed by sparks shooting out the back (I could see from the driver's side mirror only).

The worst part? I was dumb enough to do this for FOUR MONTHS. I don't know how I never got a ticket after all the illegal shit I did to get fucking CORN to where it needed to go.

This was sometime like 1985).

Sertraloline,"I got a birthday card posted to me on the day of my 12th birthday. I opened it in front of my family. Inside was a message that had been typed up on a computer and basically said I was a 'fucking bitch' and 'everyone hates me' and that they 'would get me'.

I had a really nice group of friends that I'm still friends with now, so the no friend part wasn't true. Also I don't think I was a bitch - I was 12, really innocent and quite a sensitive person.  What really scared me was that the person must've known me well - they knew my home address, mentioned personal things about me and printed the message through a computer (no hand writing to analyse!)

I just a wanted to forget about it at the time and wouldn't talk about it, and even though the school got involved I never found out who sent it. So knowing that someone hates you that much and would go to that much trouble to tell you at such a young age pretty much shattered my self esteem.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"Obviously, I know nothing about your particular situation beyond what you described, but I always remain close friends with ex-girlfriends.  And one ex-girlfriend in particular remains one of my very best friends -- NOT friends with benefits.  I'd never date anyone who tried to interfere with that friendship or even demonstrated any discomfort with this friendship after hearing from me (once) that there's nothing sexual or romantic, but there is eternal, unconditional, and irreversible affection.  I would never end this friendship (or any friendship) because anyone felt unjustifiably insecure about it.  

By the same token, I have never had any problem with women I date maintaining a positive or close relationship with any ex.  My preference is that they had a great and happy relationship when they were together and that they remain close friends.  I see many people who seem to prefer that their current partner had absolutely horrible past relationships and that hatred, bitterness, or at least indifference and distance remain.  I've often wondered whether these people truly love their partners, and, if so, why they seem so keen on making sure that all past relationships were hell and don't continue at all, unless in a hateful and horrible condition.

Sadomi,"This dream came in 2 parts back when I was 16.

There I was, sitting with the girl of my dreams. Long, luscious hair, a pure, white sundress, and a couple of stools next to a bar. She stood out form everyone else in the room, who was a faceless entity save for a few people I had seen passing by me that previous night. We sit down and we start drinking all of my favorite drinks together, and Talk about football and video games. She was my perfect girl.

Then the fun started. A faceless man ran inside the bar and screamed ""ZOMBIEEESSS"" I see my dream girl just sprint past me with a shotgun in here hand. At this point i was aware of the dream, so i just picked up a revolver off the table and unsheathed my Katana. We sprint outside to a pier where there is a huge goddamned zombie spider. I did the only sensible thing in that situation. 

I threw the spider a Beer and sat and watched the Zombie Apocalypse take over, with my Dream girl just sitting on my lap and broing it up with a 4 story spider.


Part two was in the same dream. I woke up, and my family was standing over my death bed. I felt fine and looked even better. My family and friends were crying and I'm just like ""Shit you guys look ugly crying"" Now, some guy in a 3 piece lime green suit and a pimp hat walked over and started listing off the things I hadn't done yet. The only 2 I remember well were having sex and pull off a heist. The pimp doctor told me I had an hour to live.  I sit up and haul ass outside, and I see my crush from high school. She had already heard the news, and she jumps on my back, piggyback style, and we sprint towards a bank. 

We walk in, hand the bank teller a note laced with instant heart attack powder. The teller starts to have chest pains, and then My crush goes over the counter to help her out, swiping a key in the meantime(The safe only had one physical key, no keypad or anything)  She asks for something in the vault to save the tellers life, a Golden Bamboo stick. We run into the vault to get the bamboo stick, but we lock ourselves inside instead. We cry out for help, and they can't find the key. We snicker to each other and we look at my watch. I had 9 minutes till i passed away, so we did what any virgin would do in that situation.

We awkwardly tried to make love but ended up just cuddling for 6 minutes. The grim reaper walks up to me from out of nowhere and hands me a joint. I didn't smoke at the time in real life, so I don't know why that came up all of a sudden. That's when i woke up. at 5:34 AM, 2 hours before I had to get up for school.

Also ""The Kid"" with Charlie Chaplin in it and the first twenty minutes of ""Modern Times"" my daughter liked, then had to leave for unrelated reasons. Also Lloyd's ""Safety Last!"" is a good one for children - it has a fairly bare-bones story that's pretty easy to follow.

If they're in to sci-fi, maybe and I say maybe The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or Metropolis, though you will have to sit with them (as if you wouldn't anyway) to help answer any questions.

Of course, have them watch ""A Trip To The Moon"" - its only fifteen minutes and is literally one of the most important films of all time. My daughter had me put it on at least a dozen times. I usually liked to watch it completely silent, she preferred it with Daft Punk's original soundtrack (for the recent restoration).

The Crowd is a nice movie with a warmth to it and Wings is simply spectacular, though kind of a lot happens in the first twenty minutes you might have to help them with. IE, Mary loves Jack, Jack loves Sylvia, Sylvia loves David. Then WWI interrupts their little love triangle and the story expands pretty quickly where you get the little scenes with Schwimpf and the introduction of the enemy's flying squadron.

Ursus_misanthropicus,"I work in tech, so web privacy has become one of my big interests over the past few years. I'm not quite an expert at it, but there are some pretty basic ways to make yourself more anonymous than the average Joe surfing the web.
___________________________________

* [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)

This is access to the ""dark web"" of lore, but also gives you the handy trick of being bounced randomly though a world-wide router network to obscure your IP address. You can generate new IP addresses or ""identities"" whenever you feel like it. Tor is great for when you really want to fly under the radar, but I would not recommend it as a daily browser since its default privacy settings will block a lot of ""regular"" internet functions such as running scripts (although this can be adjusted).

* In-Private or ""Incognito"" browsing

This is a more realistic way to go about your daily business while minimizing the amount of information that is connected to your activity. In IE and Firefox it's called ""private"" browsing, and in Chrome it's called ""Incognito"" (but more on Google later). Browsing in-private will not create a history, you will automatically be logged out of log-in based accounts after leaving, and ads will not be customized based on your activity. 

* Location Information

In your browser, there should be a setting to disable automatic location detection via GPS or IP. On phones, there should be an option to disable automatic location detection for anything besides 911/emergency calls. Disabling your location will mean that you won't get custom map, etc. results, but it will also mean that you are not tracked as easily. I believe most social networks (namely Facebook) have the option of turning off automatic location tagging in posts.

* Cookies and Scripts

Go into your browser of choice, and dig into ""settings"" or ""internet options."" From there, go to ""privacy"" or something similar, and you should be able to adjust the default level that your browser blocks cookies, which track your information. Keep in mind that if you block ALL cookies, many common web-based programs such as Gmail will not function.

* Ad-related Tracking

If you don't like custom ads, there are several ways you can minimize their presence. Browsers like IE have a ""safety"" dropdown under ""settings"" that allows you to turn on a basic tracking protection feature. [DoNotTrackMe](http://download.cnet.com/DoNotTrackMe-for-Firefox/3000-11745_4-75653399.html) is a similar option that you can download for free. Finally, you can opt out of custom ads by going to the [consumer opt-out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for online ads and disable customization from several dozen companies that are in the business of using your browsing habits to present custom ads. **HOWEVER** keep in mind that ""do not track"" functions are actually a misnomer in the sense that they cannot prevent all tracking of activity... they just prevent custom ads that have been created in response to the tracked information.

* Avoid APIs and connections between accounts

Have you ever been to a website that offers to let you sign in with your Facebook/Google/Other existing account? If you do so, it would be connecting with an [application programming interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), which lets the two accounts communicate with each other and exchange information. You can think of it as a giant pipe connecting two water towers of information. Often, allowing one account to connect to another counts as giving ""permission"" to a hidden/implied Terms of Service agreement, which then allows the two accounts to share and collect information with each other, and occasionally automatically post information (example: Yahoo! posting which stories you are reading to your Facebook account). The more you can keep your online accounts separate, the more private your information will be, and the less risk you have of information being shared and aggregated between your accounts to create a comprehensive online ""persona."" That being said, on mobile phones, APIs are much harder to avoid.

* Avoid Google

This should speak for itself, but is a tough habit to break. Google will track nearly anything you do within its ecosystem (YouTube, Search, Mail, Google+, etc. etc.) and is in the business of connecting all of that information to your online persona. If you must -- even I have a gmail -- do your best to log out of your account whenever possible. Google's defaults are to keep you logged-in automatically whenever possible, making it easier to collect information. Some browsers can be configured to limit the amount of information Google collects, but they have famously reverse-engineered blocking settings (breaking the law, mind you) even in Apple's Safari, which was often exalted as a relatively closed and secure ecosystem. Back to Chrome. Ditch it if you can. Because Chrome is Google's proprietary browser, they can do whatever they want with it and all other settings I mentioned in other browsers do not apply. Assume everything you do in Chrome will eventually be tracked and linked in some way back to any existing Google accounts you have.

* Search off the beaten track

Google, again, tracks all search engine queries whether or not you have a Google account proper (location, IP address, etc.). Google is obviously one of the best search engines in terms of breadth and accuracy, but there are other options. If you want to search something without Google tracking it, use the native search in Tor or -- if you want to stay in a regular browser -- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). They claim not to track queries, although your search results will likely be much different than they would have been in Google.

ConfusingUsername,"I used to consider myself one, and I honestly had 3 relationships going at once, all knew the others existed, and usually would have sex with 2 of the women a minimum of 2 times a day.  Apparently they loved the arrangement due to the lack of strings, and they trusted that I wasnt going to break that bond.  They would even out source said info as well and sometimes I often found myself in new company. Oddly enough though, I had a testosterone deficiency at the time.  After a while my sex drive went from multiple times a day, to nothing.  No masterbation, no thoughts, no arousal at all really.  I have no idea when or why it happened, but I have had no desire at all for 3 years now, and honestly have to concentrate very hard if a situation arises for sex and is just selfish for me to reject the person for whatever reason.

arkilla95,"I think my ex was a nympho. Sorry if this post seems nsfw. Anyways, she wasn't a slut at all, she was a well kept girl, would hardly talk to boys etc (not that I ever encouraged her to do such things) 
One day we are both just laughing about the song blow my whistle, then out of no where she starts ""blowing my whistle"". This is the first time her and I had any sort of intercourse. Anyways, she gave head quite often after that as she said she enjoyed making me happy. (This was way into the relationship)
I thought it wasn't fair that only I got to enjoy it, so one day once she finished, I said it was her turn, and we both had intercourse. This was the day we both lost our Vcards. We had a lot of sexual chemistry between us, and had been dating for over a year. Literally we had sex like 5 times a week, or sometimes 3 times a day. At first it was amazing, but being a human, I started to get really tired of it. It wasn't me taking advantage of how consent she was, it was actually 90% of the time her encouraging me to have sex, instead. I said yes like 90% of the time too, but believe me it isn't a dream. It doesn't feel as special unless we took like week long breaks, which was quite hard for us, some times just her. I started to feel challenged, wandered if I was a real male or not. Started to feel insecure about the fact that a woman would want more sex than me so my hormones were obviously all messed up, I started having thoughts like ""wow I must be gay"" ( I'm not actually gay)

I looked for advice on the Internet and then realised i wasn't alone, and that this actually happens in a lot of other relationships. It definitely helped afterwards. After a while things turned down so we'd have sex once a week, which was completely fine for both of us.

P.s she was 16, I was 17, so it may of just been hormones.

whether this article applies to you or not is up to you, but i felt like it made sense. basically it says that 'discipline is a myth', and that the choices we make are based on love. so in your case, it's not that you're lazy, it's that you love playing League of Legends etc., more than you love learning and getting a good education. if that is true, then try and find something about education (or the end result of it, e.g. a job) that you love, or would love. when you have something like that in mind, and a somewhat clear path of how to get there, putting in the hours to study, and saying no to the distractions comes a little bit easier.

Tell someone you will do X thing by Y date. Make sure it is someone who will ask you about it. Promises to yourself are worthless, you'll break them. When you tell someone else, you will (hopefully) be pushed to do it, if only to not look bad.

Always be focused on a goal. If you have nothing (likely), then simply on the goal of turning into someone useful to society/not being poor/making your parents proud. Does not have to be very specific.

Evaluate your friend circle. Make sure you are hanging out with the kind of person(s) you want to be. Might be the most difficult on this list, because breaking and forming bonds is tough. But remember though, it is better to be alone than be with people holding you back. And feel free to PM me if you need support :)

After waking up drenched in sweat with chills running up and down my body, I decided to stagger down the hall to the strange little half bathroom at the top of the stairs. The trip down that hallway was the worst fourteen feet of my life. I must have been hallucinating because of the fever and lack of sleep, and I remember being terrified that aliens were attacking the house in the middle of a thunderstorm. There were bright flashes of light all around and strange colorful globes everywhere. At that moment I also knew for a fact that there were ...things... in each of the empty rooms down the hall, watching me.

My husband and I inherited an old advent calendar from his grandmother. It's a large tapestry that hangs on the wall and is a picture of a house with lots of rooms.

My two daughters love the calendar and take it very seriously, sitting in front of the wall every night before bed to watch where the bear will search next.

The Elf on the Shelf is just a stuffed elf that moves to a new spot in our house every night, after returning from the North Pole to tell Santa how well we have all been behaving. My daughters look for him every morning and are generally extra well behaved during December because they know the elf is ""watching"". It sounds kinda creepy when I write it, but it's a Christmas tradition.

I'm 31/m and pretty much been single the whole time minus a couple of years a few years ago.  some married friends still go have drinks with me occasionally, but the frequency of that has dwindled exponentially. Also, it's hard not having a wingman, I'm not the type that has just a ton of female friends, nor am I very good at meeting new ones.  I occasionally hang out w/ my ex, it's just turned into a booty call type situation.  In my early twenties when most of my friends were single, it was going out and meeting people all the time, a couple of times a week.  Now if I want to get out and do something, I go sit at bars by myself and talk to the other weirdos who do the same thing. Or I just sit at home and watch TV or fuck around on the computer. In the summer, the single people I go hang out with are typically in their early and mid 20s. It really kind of sucks.  Although there are some friends of mine that are married that their situation sucks quite a bit more.  However, it does allow me to be a lot more flexible with work.

I don't make a lot of money, but I've got most of the stuff I need in life, and I'm doing the things I want to do, so I'm definitely a happy person (in a holistic sense).

But, I'm *lonely*. I never figured out how to connect with women, particularly the kind of connection that leads to the Warm-and-Fuzzies. Without that, nothing I'm doing or into seems to be of any real consequence or importance. I don't feel that I'm making anyone's life any better or more enjoyable in a way that only I can do. There's a part of me that wants out, but it simply can't find purchase.

I distract myself as much as I can, though. That way, I don't think about being lonely, thus I (hope I) don't show it. I mean, no one was ever attracted to someone else because that person was lonely.

The_Levitating_Baby,"I am about a 30 minute drive from Miami so I live in the suburbs. Florida is a pretty nice place. It's always hot and really moist here. During the summer it's really hot and rains a lot. Lots of beaches to go, if you're a beach person Florida is great in that aspect. I don't think there is anything notable about our food except the sea food is pretty good depending on what fish you get.

The winter is great cause the tempature ranges from 50-80 for the most part although you most days it should be in the upper 70's. Because of this, you will only really need to get one set of clothes besides a jacket and jeans here and there. No winter clothes required which is a beautiful thing. It's very diverse in Florida, especially near Miami. Lots of hispanics there. As for Miami, it's really not all that special I think. Some places it's beautiful, some it's nasty like all big cities. Otherwise it is also really exotic from other cities as it barely represents anything American like somewhere like Boston would. The housing down here is also definitely more expensive than a place like Georgia or the Carolinas. The reason they are more expensive is due to the fact that we get lots of hurrincanes so the houses are all much stronger and most include things like shutters. All in all I like Florida, it's a fun state. I don't have a problem living here.",null,0,cdpsooh,1rqfe5,AskReddit,hot,2

He gets in the night before the meeting, settles into the hotel, and gets into the bed, but he's so nervous for the meeting that he can't sleep. He decides to hire a prostitute to help calm his nerves.  So he goes out into the street and picks one up, brings her back to the hotel, and they have sex. The whole time they're having sex, she keeps saying a phrase in Japanese over and over again. Since he doesn't know any Japanese, he has no idea what it means, but since she seems to be enjoying herself he assumes it means something alone the lines of ""good job."" He finishes and pays her, she leaves, he goes to sleep. The next day, he goes to the meeting. It goes perfectly, and he lands the deal with the Japanese company.  To celebrate, he and the CEO of the Japanese company go golfing. When they get to the 9th hole, the Japanese CEO tees up and hits a hole-in-one.  The exec is pretty impressed, so he starts clapping, and, to try to impress the CEO, says the Japanese phrase he learned from the prostitute the night before.

So we're playing a game, it was before the first half of the season, like the 3rd game maybe? And the coach's son is dancing around in that damn wolf costume on the sidelines. I didn't see this part but I guess the coach's son kept tapping his dad and his dad would wave him off to concentrate on the game.

The coach calls a timeout and we're all huddled around and some kids started giggling cuz of the smell of farting coming around. The coach is like ""stop farting and concentrate on the play"". Turns out that no one farted. The coach's son had shit himself in the wolf costume. He kept tapping the coach cuz he had to go to the bathroom.

He had developed a borderline sick affinity for hash and started smoking a pipe - like a tobacco pipe. He also decided that when we smoked pot together he was the only one allowed to roll or else he would literally wait for the joint to come to him, break it apart and re-roll. And he would only roll gi-fucking-gantic cigar sized blunts and he would do it using pipe tobacco with bits of hash interspersed throughout. Either that or he would roll all our pot at once and you'd have nothing to smoke later. So one night he rolls all my pot and we get unnecessarily high and go pick up our other friend from work who was fed up and all he wanted to do was relax and get stoned but we had no more pot and he was desperate so he starts rolling nasty, nasty, filthy disgusting pipe tobacco roaches from the ashtray into a big, sticky, smelly joint and smoked it. He nearly threw up, but he was determined. He was quiet and sort of green for 20 minutes in the back seat, and then he goes ""that was a mistake, I am really, really high."" then kept repeating ""wow I am really high"" in a calm, matter-of-fact tone once ever 5-10 minutes for like 2 hours. he had a great night",null,0,cdprqzg,1rpxpc,AskReddit,hot,1

Apple devices are generally on the expensive side, whereas Android devices usually come cheaper.

Apple devices are basically unrepairable, most (not all) Androids are to a certain degree repairable.

If you want to code, Android is easy, free, and all it needs to start is any PC, MAC, or Linux machine. iPhone coding requires a Mac and a (don't know how expensive) commercial IDE.

Rks1157,"  Good for you for having enough consideration to keep things quiet.  It sounds like you feel the need to unburden yourself of something terrible. 

Catharsis is good for the soul but never at the expense of another.  You obviously know this or you would have spilled the beans long ago.  Unless your admission will benefit your mom it is probably best to talk to someone else first even if you're not looking for their advice.  The reason is is that things will become clearer in your own mind as you verbalize them for the first time.  If your listener is in a position to offer advice then it's so much the better.

It is important to choose the right person to talk to.  You'll want to be sure that your listener can and will keep your matters in confidence.  Members of the clergy will be all to happy to help.  If you do not belong to a religious body then you might seek out a therapist.  You can also approach a complete stranger and ask for a bit of their time. Most people would be honored to help if you explain the importance of your situation.

punkwalrus,"Not an ex, per se, but everyone thought she was.  She was my best friend in high school, but we had a platonic relationship.  Anyway, our lives split apart after some shitty drama, and we grew in different directions.  I got married, had a kid, wrote a book, and started to become famous in the sci-fi convention circuit.  She got married to an abusive drug addict, and became an alcoholic (I didn't know this at the time).  At the time, I was with a burgeoning comedy group.  It had been maybe 7 years since we last saw one another.

I was at a large science fiction convention.  My wife came up to me and said, ""Hey... you know [Mary] is here?""

""Mary who?""  Mary is not her real name, but her name was really common.

""Your old best friend, Mary.""  The group had heard about Mary and how our friendship ended.  Most assumed she had a crush on me, and that's what led to the end of our friendship.  I disagreed, but whatever.  The end of our friendship was super-dramatic, and so *they just had to meet this person*.

Keep in mind this is a comedy group made of college-aged people.

If I had to do it all over again, I would have denied it was her.  Instead, I was stupid and insensitive, and we stalked her for a good 20 minutes.  She got this sense we were doing so, and double backed on us.  

She did not look good.  She was going through this... alcoholic ""I am channeling the Joker"" phase in her life (again, I was not aware at the time).  But all I saw with this former friend of mine in a ridiculous jacket, a tee-shirt showing the Joker, and bad stage makeup.  She kind of looked like a Comic-con nerd and a Juggalo.

One of our directors said a little too loudly, ""YOU used to date THAT???""  And an entire group of comedic professionals just pointed and nearly collapsed in laughter.

I immediately regretted this moment.  One, because she was my best friend and deserved better treatment than a group of strangers pointing at her and laughing.  Two, some of the insults the writers had were funny enough for me to not laugh, which I hated every fiber of my being for doing.  Three, I had a punk/goth past of my own they didn't know about, and *I* felt insulted.  And Mary?  Just stood there.  She must have been in immense anger, embarrassment, and pain and all she probably wanted to do was attend this sci-fi convention in peace.

I felt bad the rest of the weekend, and weeks afterwards, cringing at the memory.  Some six years later, I found her on Usenet, and apologized.  She thanked me, and told me what she had been going through at the time.  I still regret being part of what was essential junior-high behavior.  I am better than that.

It doesn't even turn me on almost at all 99 times out of a hundred to see a girl without seeing her face no matter what shes doing.  I think this has to do with spending alot of time reading people and looking at people in a light that has to do with drawing them and seeing them in a way that tells a story or makes them come alive in a way that's beautiful outside of skin deep superficial type beauty.  Like the way regal old person with a long history and deep spiritual connection is beautiful.  I like to read people and honestly it gives me a great deal more pleasure to see a person with a beautiful soul than a person who is outwardly gorgeous, though i often appreciate both.  For this reason I constantly find myself attracted to girls that no-one else seems to find as stunning as I do.

A couple of nights ago I was staying at by best friends house (Let's call him 'Jay') and we had just finished dinner and were going to go watch some southpark. We have to wait for it to load and then all of sudden **WHAM**, the front door had been swung open *hard*. ""JJJJJAAAAAYYY"" was all we heard; It was his dad, a recovered Alcoholic for 15 years, who had just fallen off the wagon. At this time it's probably about 12:45 in the morning. He was so intoxicated and had a massive gash across his left eyebrow and a big bruise above it. Jay's dad decides that this is the perfect time to ""bond with the boys"" which it clearly was not. He sat in Jay's room till 5 in the morning (btw this is a  monday night, we both had classes at 8) telling us OVER AND OVER that we needed to get our ""sheepskin"" and that we were both massive fuck ups. He then proceeded to force Jay to get him his 6 beer at the house and told him he was drinking again. I saw Jay break inside when he said that, and I realized that this is a big moment that I am now apart of. I'm not sure if I shouldn't have been there, but Jay was glad I was.

It wouldn't have much of an impact on Earth's gravitational pull...that tonnage is only a tiny fraction of the Earth's mass (a ratio of 2*10^-14). It would change weather patterns significantly, because it would affect the amount of light reflected and absorbed, as well as the surface friction of the earth in those regions, which would change wind patterns. There would be more surface area of the ocean to absorb light, so they would probably warm some. 

Supply chains would immediately evaporate along with those people. Many natural resources would suddenly be much rarer. It would change the nature of geopolitics, and new alliances and aggressions would form. Entire economic systems, reliant on the products exported by those countries, and services provided by them, would fail. Many, many people would die in the aftermath, of starvation, in riots, or through the wars that would almost certainly break out.

I switched seats in the middle of class to sit right next to her. I think we were reading the assigned pages from out textbooks that day. I forgot my book at home so I she let read from hers so we connected the desks side by side. Were reading on our own quietly, and I really don't know how it happened, but I guess I breathed out a bit too heavy from my nose and this colossal chunk of snot came careening smack dab in the middle of the page. 

We didn't even look at each other for the first couple of seconds; we were just staring at the new found specimen. It was green with a yellowish tint/hue, still moist and glistening. I think my brain blanked out since then because the memory of it was so painfully embarrassing, so I think we just awkwardly laughed it off and I don't remember what became of the snot afterwards. I must have I wiped it off, or maybe its the adhesive to two adjacent pages of a history book somewhere out there in the world.

Edit: Here's a little story about this. My mom used to work for my father, it was in a restaurent, I don't remember the name tho, she was a waitress. My dad had this restaurent but didn't live in the city, Amos in the north of Quebec. He used live in La Chenaie, it's about 5 hours in car, so my mom fall in love with him and you know what happen when two people love each other, they made some love. Right after, my father sold the restaurent to another person so he didn't have to come to Amos. She got pregnant (me!) and she called him but he didn't answer, it was his wife. Surprise, my mom finally got him on the phone and told him that he is gonna be a father. He said that she don't know her and it's probably not true because he never had a restaurent. 9 months later, i'm finally out and my mom wanted me to have a father so she called him again and he was telling that if she called him for that again, he will call the police. The whole story got in front of the justice court and my dad still said that it was not from him. DNA test, and suprise he was my dad. So my mom wanted him to pay something to help  our family to survive (she was a waitress), he said I will just pay a bit but i'll say my son every month. She said ok, i've got a picture from him and it's an old one so I can't see nothing. He promised me to come see me and kiss me on my head and leave, this was the last time I saw him.

swarvy_swang,"Worst?

My friend P and I were in cross country, and before one of our daily practice jogs we decided cocaine would be a great running aid.

Eventually, that devolved into us sniffing coke and not much else. He was on the phone with our doodman and said we were looking for some ""yay."" Apparently to the dealer, yayo was coke, and yay was rock. He didn't bother to verify.

So I'm chopping it up, and it's not flaky, I had yet to get some good fishscale in my life (that yellow-tinged rawraw), but  didn't think much of the debris flying off.

We do our ceremonial bowl of weed with ""yay"" sprinkled on top. I get it and roast that fucker.

Now I'm high. And I'm not coming down. Felt like continuously blasting through a case of nitrous. No ceiling in sight.

I tell him something's not right, and that I'm going to get a glass of water. Next thing I know the tops of trees are all I see. I had fallen and was laying on the ground. Eventually I find myself laying in his bed looking at his pet lizard coming to terms with the fact that I am now dead.

I walked my bike home that day. The comedown  was the worst. Like the mental depletion of benzo and amphetamine withdrawal combined and condensed.

OnlyMySofaPullsOut,"When I was in college, I was in a fraternity, and we did a metric fuckton of drugs pretty much all day, every day. One friday night before a party, I saw the joyous sight of a solid 2 zips of coke splayed out on our glass coffee table. So, me being an 8 ball a day user on my worst day at that time, decided to chop out a fat gram+ finger thick line and get all up and fucked before we started drinking.

I could feel my throat water in anticipation. I rolled up a Jackson and had at it.

I remember it being much ""sticker"" and chalkier than coke....and it felt like the antithesis of cocaine. And I could just feel shit sequentially booting down.....my pupils let in a supernova full of light and then started to slowly dim.....

Right then my buddy Kevin walked into the room. I managed to muster, ""What the fuck is this shit man?"" As he looked at me with a mix of shock and horror. 

""That's flip! Fuck!"" That was pretty much the last thing I remember as my windows on the world dissolved to pinholes and faded to black. (Flip being slang for china white heroin cut with 50% crystaline fentanyl. aka 50/50, the same any way you flip it, and it's easy as fuck to flip.)

I woke up kind of in a hyper-sweating mess about 20 minutes later after 4mL of Naloxone was pumped into me, and every epi-pen in the house was emptied into my system. Didn't feel right for about two days after.

The narcan had to be passed around, as several brothers in the room began to pass out from the ambient fentanyl dust in the air. Apparently this was set to be cut up &amp; portioned out in a vacuum in the chem lab after hours. We basically had to wet down what was on the table and vent every window in the room to keep everyone from going limp. 

Greatly truncated my drug consumption after that point. You could call it a much needed moment of clarity. Probably a good idea I have stopped all hard dabbling, since only about 15 guys out of the 60 that were in my fraternity are still alive (I graduated in '04.......)

eyeforgot,"I've had a few bad ones.

Shrooms:  Decided to dose when I found a clear stream.  Got lost in the woods at night while tripping and being chased by gremlins and goblins.

LSD: Took a crap while tripping and throught I had shit my heart out as it was beating in the toilet.  Took 2-3 years debating on whether or not to shove the heart back up my ass but before I did I finally realized that if it was my heart then I would already be dead.  My beating heart then morphed back into a turd and I learned from that to ALWAYS take a dump before dosing.

Ketamine:  Drove about 2 hours while in the k-hole.  I remember having an overhead perspective of driving home, like in a video game.  Don't know how the hell I didn't wreck or die on my way back.  That ended me driving on anything.

LSD x2: Broke my toe and smashed my face up while tripping.  Acid amplifies pain so damn much.

Shrooms x2:  Brother got the shrooms and made the tea.  I took first dose (well first 5 doses as I drank a really potent batch).  About 30 mins later my brother finds a few death caps in the bags and I go into a severe death trip.  Trip that waves come crashing in I get buried in sand and dig myself out (lived near the beach).  I was stuck in a pseudo hell with my brother for umpteen years.  Finally left and went to a friends house as my brother was being an asshole.  Came back to the house the next day and my brother was gone and the stove burners were left on high.  Was surprised the apt didn't catch on fire.  This one was the one that caused me to say fuck drugs and stay sober.

stupernan1,"shrooms:

15 minutes after eating it, i started puking/diareah, while our bathroom had dripping unfinished paint on the walls... the paint ""started to move"" thus it all went downhill..

bugs started crawling on my skin, i started thinking the thought ""i bet it's possible to OD on shrooms"" which sent me into a nightmare. I started overheating and laid next to my girlfriends laptop that blew super hot air onto my head, definitely didn't fix that issue, i thought my brain was literally ""frying"".

then the worst part, My girlfriend had an allergic reaction, half her face swelled up to the point where her left eye simply ""leaked"" tears, for no apparent reason. she was distracted watching how i met your mother though, and didn't realize.

the rest of the night i was dedicated to watching her, and guarding her from any mirrors, cause i thought ""I can handle this motherfucking hell hole of a trip, but i'll be damed if i let her feel what i'm feeling right now. If she has a seizure or starts uncontrollably vomiting, i call emergency services, otherwise i'm waiting this fucker out.""

in the end 3-4am, the swelling subsided, and everything was fine

not the most enjoyable experience of my life.

ThoughtRiot1776,"My friend on shrooms.

No fucking clue what happened because I've never seen anything like it.

We go for a hike in the Bay Area on a pretty low traffic trail.  Anyways, while I start to really feel the shrooms coming in, my buddy starts acting really manic.  He is scared of the helicopter, ranting about social media and empire and then says, ""I LOVE THIS"" and hugs me.  But he has this look in his eye that's just not him.  Anyways, he says ""I fucked my life, didn't I?""  Throws his phone away, I grab it.  He lies on the ground, muttering, trying to burrow into the ground, and all this weird shit.  All this time, I'm really starting to trip and this is not going well.

I try to snap him into reality and get him onto his feet and it's just not happening.  He's a total dead weight.  I put him on his feet and there's absolutely no attempt on his part or in his body to engage any of his muscles.

He rants about shit, social media, the evil of civilization, etc. for hours.  It sounded like a beat poem, specifically that Corvo (msp?) guy.

Anyways, this all happens at the worst place possible, a trail intersection.  People totally see us.  An EMT gave us water and him and his girlfriend had serious concerns and didn't leave us for 10 minutes to make sure that the situation wasn't dire.

I was seriously threatening him with calling his parents because I had no idea what to do and it was starting to get dark and I didn't have a jacket.  Somehow, he just snaps to.  He had no clue what happened and asked if he had a mental snap.

I sat down with the rest of the group who were already playing pool and my vision got narrower and narrower like as if I stood up too fast. And it felt like that too.

Then I turned completely blind and I turned to my friend and said; dude I'm blind..

So he took me to the bathroom threw water in my face and my vision started coming back colour by colour. I remember seeing the green pool tables as blue etc.

Then a year later I was chilling in a coffeeshop with my brother smoking weed. And I saw the stars in my eyes that I had seen last time I got blind, so I walked up the stairs to the bathroom to throw water in my eyes and at the end of the stairs I fainted and destroyed a plant in my fall.

I didn't consider it ""going bad"" because I am an experienced weedsmoker (everyday for ~5 years, 2 years at the time) and I felt normal. It felt more like a physical response.

gallerygal,"I tried E for the first time two weeks ago. There was a festival going on, and I've done MDMA before so I thought, whatever no big deal. I took one pill and soon enough I started seeing shit. Scary shit. There were men in suits hanging by their necks above where the DJ was playing and above those men were a few glum looking people dressed in funeral-like clothing looking down on the audience. I knew I was hallucinating, but it still freaked me out. I wanted to have a cig to calm me down, so I looked at my bag and bundles of 50s were flowing out. When I tried to grab them, all I could feel were my own fingers. From what I can remember, I spent like 30 minutes trying to grab the bills. I shook my head and closed my eyes, and took a short breather before walking out of the crowd because I could feel myself going insane. I was just hanging by the fence and looked around and all of a sudden people morphed into having thin, black chopstick like legs. Blinking really hard sort of help divide what was real and what wasn't but it only lasted a short second. The moon was bright and gorgeous that night too, but when I stared at it, this gravelly road went up (ala Inception) and the moon turned into a gray haired lady who was sweeping the streets. My friend eventually found me and got me water and told me to sit down. Once the festival was over, I felt better.

A few days later I was heading over to work and I was listening to Doin It Right, which was played at the festival. It made me sick and I wanted to puke. That fucking experience turned a great song into something thats banned from my iPod.

kampfycouch,"My best friend moved out of state after graduating high school to be with a girl she had met. Months later I find out that she had started smoking crack. She told me she had got clean and I went down to visit. We had always done drugs together, that was nothing new, but I had never done any hard drugs like heroin or crack. One day she just looked at me and asked if I wanted to try crack. I said sure. 20 minutes later the dealer was at the door and we all went into my bedroom ( I was staying for a long visit, they gave me an extra room). I tried it and loved it instantly. It was such a different feeling, I can't explain it. The dealer left and I wanted more. The guy I was seeing had left some money in my dresser, I stole it and we bought more crack. Later that night my friends girlfriend came home and she knew. She got pissed at us. Not because we did it, because we did it without her. She got us in the car and told us we were going to the dealers house. We got there and I was scared, but they seemed like this was normal. We start smoking immediately. For the next 9 hours we sat in this guys house and smoked crack. I have never been so high in my life. For those who have done it, you will know what I mean when I say my ears started ringing. I have never had a high that felt that good in my life. Now, it's been 9 hours and I am out of my mind from drugs. I see my friends girlfriend walk away with the dealer, she comes back and looks at me. Then tells me that she told him I would fuck him because he gave us drugs. I was just in shock. I then realized that she knew the entire time that I was going to have to do this. That she brought me over there to fuck the dealer for free drugs. This was an almost 7 foot tall, 350 pound black man. He tells us to come on and we all walk back to the bedroom. My friends start taking their clothes off and that's when I realized this was not the first time they have done this for free drugs. He makes me get naked. My friends are laying on the bed, going at it. I am scared, nervous, and I don't understand. I am too high. He comes out of the bathroom naked and proceeds to use me in every way imaginable. I just remember being on my back and looking behind me. I looked in my friends eyes and they were emotionless. He eventually finishes and throws more crack at us. We get dressed and smoke for another hour. He passes out and I ask if we can finally leave. 

Besides the death of my uncle, this is one of the most traumatizing experiences that I have been through. I have refused to try hard drugs ever again after walking out of that door that night.

oneymck,"Amsterdam 2013, Two of my friends and I, decided to purchase a few boxes of truffles to enjoy a lovely day in Vondelpark. We ended up buying boxes of different types of truffles, Mexicana, Atlantis, all to split evenly. Anyway, after eating 15g of the truffles washing it down with sprite( which had turned brown due to the backwash of truffles). All three of us sat for the first 20 mins, had been smoking since that morning and had had nothing to eat. After 20 mins of sitting, We all decided to go back into Dam centre ( something I wasn't too keen on, why? because it's busy as shit, and I didn't want to be tripping and avoiding cyclists every 2 seconds). As soon as we started to walk, a pain started occuring in my gums, a stingy sizzling pain that made it feel like the pours in my mouth were bubbling, also feeling as if my mouth was being pulled down from the inside. As well as this, my stomach was sore and I thought that this was going to be one of those ""eat's truffles, vomits, waste of money"" story. After another 25 mins of walking we got on a tram to find a cheap Turkish kebab place, this is when everything went downhill. There were no seats on the tram so I was left standing, I felt uncomfortable on the tram and felt as if I needed to get off, although I couldn't move my body and I felt nauseous. The next thing I see, is a big bright shinning sun and a clear blue sky until one of my friends comes into my POV and starts shaking me, I then realised, I had fainted and was lying face up on the tram floor shaking. I got up off the tram shaking and drinking water having no idea of where we were and also having no idea of the visuals I just saw.

bluepineapples,"To preface, I still smoke weed. However, I stopped for quite a long time because of a few experiences I had that shook me. 

It wasn't anything too exciting, but it was far from ordinary. Normally when I smoke, I relax, open my mind up and have a lot of fun conversations (even if they're a little silly in the end). But one evening, I smoked up with my normal circle of four friends and it wasn't at all the same feeling. The only way I can describe it was...empty. 

I don't know how to describe to you this feeling of emptiness. It’s like not knowing who you are. Instead, you only know what you are supposed to do and you do only that. You might know little things, like your name and birthday, but everything else is gone. You won’t know what is supposed to make you happy or sad. Everything becomes a confusing experience that you won’t know how to react to or if you’re even supposed to react. You won’t know what you want to do or what you like, so in the end you probably won’t do anything at all. 

 It’s like never really waking up in the morning. Instead, that moment when you open your eyes but you don’t yet have a reason to get up stays forever. You haven’t yet accepted your surroundings. You don’t know if you just woke up in the middle of a jungle with a broken leg or if you are in a queen sized bed with unwashed sheets. You don’t know yet. You haven’t thought at all yet. You don’t know what you’re going to do today. You've just opened your eyes.

It’s sort of like watching a movie. Sometimes you are involved in the plot and the characters. You might fall in love with a few of them; empathize with a few of them. You might genuinely laugh and genuinely cry and genuinely smile. And yet, in the end you still realize that you’re just watching a movie and you have no part in what is happening. You’re still just sitting there disconnected and apart from it all, eating popcorn and gazing into the screen like an idiot with nothing better to do. 

It’s like when you have a conversation with someone but the talking has stopped. You realize that things are about to get uncomfortable if you don’t start talking again. You are afraid of the potential silence, but you haven’t reached a point where taking action is a sure idea. Instead, you stare, afraid but unsure; waiting until you can be sure. That is what empty feels like. 

I wouldn't talk to any of my friends, I just watched the world pass me in a very melancholy way. The worst part was that there was just nothing I could really do about it. Even when I sobered up, the lingering feeling of apathy was still there for quite some time. It happened multiple times to the point where I stopped smoking all together because it was just not worth it.

I don't know if that really fits your idea of ""worst"" but there it is. I smoke now, and I do just fine and have great times. The fear that those might come back is there though, somewhere in the back of my head.

raditaz,"The worst experience I had with drugs was when I gave them to someone else.

A few weeks ago I was coming down off of an acid trip, I mentioned it to one of my friends and she asked me if I could pick some up for her. Of course being a good friend I agreed, picked her up two hits (same number I took), and gave them to her while explaining the basics of psychedelics - you should be in a good mindset, if your thinking turns sour then start concentrating on something else, it's just a drug it'll wear off, etc.... I also offered her a place to stay in case her roommate would freak out about her taking acid, since my roommate was gone for the weekend.

So she takes the two hits and we head up to my room (I live in a dorm). At first everything's going normally, I put on some trance music, dim the lights, and she's laying in bed raving about how awesome it is once it kicked in. Pretty standard. Strangely though she started to not answer me when I talked to her, just curled up in a ball, staring at me with wide eyes and this creepy smile. I excused myself for 5 minutes to go vape some bud with a friend (I was still coming down and this pushed me back up a little, I wanted to relate to how she was feeling), and when I got back she was still in the same state. I kept asking her what kind of music she wanted to listen to, if she wanted to go outside, etc, and every once in awhile she'd just say she wants to lay there. Alright, whatever she's feeling. That went on for about the first 3 hours of the trip.

Then things started to turn to shit. She started talking. Very loudly. She was actually yelling at me how hard she was tripping, how I fucked her up forever, how I've damaged her, but she was kind of laughing about it so I wasn't really sure how to take it..... But the whole time I was stressing the fact, please, PLEASE be quiet in here, if people know you're tripping it won't be good. I was shushing her and she would just laugh and keep yelling about how I've got her tripping balls.  

About this time I started to realize how profoundly stupid it was to give someone acid for their first time in a dorm. I had just taken acid for the first time in my friends apartment and I had an amazing time, I took the same amount she did and I was socializing and listening to music and just having a blast. So after this I figured I could give the same amount to her and she'd be fine too. There wasn't any room for scary visuals or anything because all that happened was some warping around and things looked like they were painted with watercolors. My state of mind, while completely different and surprising to me, could still be handled. If someone had asked me to be quiet I would've totally understood what they were saying, so I was really fucking confused as to why she was acting like this.

In the middle of my pleading with her to quiet down, I looked her in the eye and she SHRIEKS this bloodcurdling scream. Honestly I was helpless, I didn't know what to do but to keep stressing how quiet she needs to be right now. This bitch is going to fucking get the cops called. She started yelling louder, YOUVE GOT ME TRIPPING BALLS! YOUVE DAMAGED ME! Etc etc, she actually started accusing me of hurting her and hitting her at the top of her voice, accompanied by occasional screams and whimpers. She actually made it sound like I was trying to rape her, which wasn't really a good way to avoid negative attention. People were starting to peek their heads out their doors, my friend from next door stopped by just to see what the fuck was going on. I was trying to console her but she was flipping the fuck out. I tried a few times taking her out of the room to get outside and away from people, but whenever we got to the elevator she wouldn't get in, like she'd sit down and I couldn't drag her up into the elevator or push her in or anything. I'm freaking out now, I'm stuck with her and if someone called the police or something we'd both be fucked. 

So of course, as we got back to my room, my RA was waiting outside, wanting to know what the hell was going on. I told him that she was just freaking out, but then I glanced at her, hesitated, and I'm like yeah she's on drugs. She took acid. Look, I said, it's going to be over soon, we don't need to call the cops or anything. There's no need for that. He helpfully let me know that the standard procedure was to call the police in situations like these. He gave me a choice of either get her to shut up, or get her out of here. Throughout all of this she's saying unhelpful shit like ""YOUVE GOT ME TRIPPING BALLS"", she's not scared or anything, she's just kind being a loud annoyance and I couldn't see her quieting down anytime in the near future. So I said to my RA, look man, could you bring her back to her room then? You don't need to call the cops, the peak is about over, she just needs somewhere to ride it out for half an hour or so. He agrees, calls the RA on duty, explains what's up, and that dude takes her down to the elevators and that's the last that I saw of her that night.

But the night wasn't over. My friend who checked in earlier bursts into my room about 10 minutes later and says dude look out the window. Of course, out the window, there are half a dozen cop cars and ambulances. What the hell, who called the police. 15 minutes later, there were three of them knocking on my door wanting answers. They let me know that her roommate gave them my name, saying she chilled at my room a lot. Fantastic. 

They clearly knew she took acid, so I gave them the whole story minus me giving it to her, saying I gave her a place to stay, she started flipping out and screaming, and an RA took her away. Two of them were like okay, okay, and the other one was like yeahhhh.... This isn't adding up.... You mind if I take a look at your phone? I gulped, my phone? My phone had her asking me to pick her up some acid, and texts between me and my friend who I got it from. They could probably bust all of us. But if I said no they'd get pissed off and they probably had enough evidence or whatever to seize it from me. I let them see just the texts between me and her, and the cop was like, yeah that's what I thought. You know we could probably bust you for providing drugs to her, but to be honest... I don't really feel like doing that. I let him search around my room a bit but obviously there was nothing to find. They eventually gave me an ultimatum, that either they could turn me over to student services and the school would deal with me, or I could bust my friend who was also a student. I told them yeah, I'm not comfortable with that, and they said well ok then I think we're done here. They left and... I never heard any word from the school.

It was a pretty sobering experience... Never had it been more obvious to me that drugs affect everyone differently. Lesson learned.

But the next thing I remembered I woke up next to my girlfriend in our bed, but the thing is when we had been smokin, it was at a friends house. Here's where it gets good. 

I got really drunk and high at the same time and started laughing a lot apparently (this is what I was told) and then I complained that I had to pee, but couldn't really get up so my girlfriend and her friend lead me to the toilet and they had to pull my pants down and sit me on the toilet, I did manage to wipe myself though I guess... After that I guess my girlfriend decided it was time to take me home, not wanting me to do something I would regret or have me out when I was not really aware of what I was doing. 

So it took her and her friend to walk me the whole block home. After we got home, my girlfriend decided I needed a shower. She got me to sit on the toilet and handed me some water and advil but I couldn't drink the water....So she got me undressed and turned around for a minute to turn the shower on, when I ran outside completely naked screaming. She turned around and tried to chase me, but stopped at the door where I stood on her porch completely naked and saying I wanted to go visit her parents who live next door. She coaxed me back inside, though not before some college kid apparently saw me. 

Once I was inside she got in the shower with me and washed me up, including my hair, got me out, dried me off, and carried me up the stairs and tucked me in. She then studied for a test.

lsdpoo,"A couple of days ago I took two doses of 25C-NBOMe (I think around 200-300 micro-grams) with a few friends. I had to take a shit when it was beginning to take effect and ended up peaking while dropping a deuce. It was definitely an amazing experience. Shitting while on a hallucinogen is very difficult, but your bowels will experience true nirvana. The bad part of this trip was the come down. I had tripped on 25i the week before and the come down wasn't really that unpleasant, but on twice dosage of 25c (We did twice the amount that would be equal to the first dosage of 25i. Say 300 micro-grams of 25i= 100 micrograms of 25c. We did 200 micrograms of 25c.) shit got crazy. I became incredibly paranoid about everything and everyone around me. I managed to control myself and not blow a fucking gasket in front of anybody, but when I made it home I started to develop a migraine. Well you could call it a migraine, I'd prefer to call it  something repeatedly shanking my temples and forehead. It lasted until I finally passed out hours later. In that time my thought process changed from snorting a line of Ketamine to kill the pain (didn't have any, so no dice on that), calling one of my friends to try to mooch one of their safety pills of them (it was in the early hours of the morning, they were probably awake, but I didn't really want to mooch a Xanax off my friends as my paranoia also made me terrified to ask anything of anyone), to calling my aunt (who lives like a thousand miles away), to calling my friend down the hall (who probably wasn't there), to calling the police, to calling the fire department (because they help people), to calling an ambulance (which made the most sense at this point), to finally making some soup and not eating it because the microwave was annoying the fuck out of me. Overall it was a very fun time, but the comedown was my worst experience with drugs so far.

She had been in remission for 8 months, and had a mastectomy a few months prior. I always knew she would die, but I still wasn't prepared for it. I walked in and was told the cancer spread to her lungs and she was on a breathing tube. I spent the night in the ICU, with full gown on and gloves and mask. Every few hours she would wake up struggling to breathe. Her breaths were shallow and seemed like minutes apart. She kept trying to rip the tube from her mouth. She wanted to die. It was more horrifying when the nurses had to tie down her hands. It got to a point where she was in such distress that she had to be heavily sedated.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"Throughout Europe in the 1500s, people used to haul buckets for miles to get and retrieve fresh water. This was a principal daily task -- requiring huge amounts of physical labor -- for many medieval and Renaissance Europeans.  And then they began constructing piping systems that eliminated the need for anyone to do this water hauling.  

To see how this worked during a time when the transition from water hauling to piping was in progress, read Montaigne's travel journals, which are absolutely fascinating.  Water is obviously essential, but we forget that everyone -- even the wealthiest kings and aristocrats -- struggled to find and keep water resources, and, once some of them figured out pipes and fountains, it was considered an amazing luxury and brought endless entertainment to those who viewed the fountains.

Its fun to see movies about the future where our technology is advanced and we are travelling amongst the stars. But in this movie we have no hope, we haven't learned to come together and now we can see a possible end approaching. Clive Owen's character isn't some macho hero, he's a scared alcoholic who gets a flash of hope and wants to do the right thing. Not once does he fire a gun in the movie, and he's in sandals a good portion of the movie when there is rubble and debris everywhere. Plus you have a couple of those cinematography shots where the camera does not cut away for minutes at a time.

Last time, I saw Black Sabbath at the Gorge as well as a little road trip with my wife before we got pregnant.  We met a bunch of people at the show who shared their food and booze, we exchanged email addresses and hosted one of the guys on a trip up to Canada.  Then, in Seattle, there was a super rude asshole at a coffee shop who told me that he was allowed to cut in front of me in line because he was American and I was a guest in his country.  

Before that, we went to Vegas for a wedding, stayed in a great hotel, saw some shows and had lots of fun.  But someone tried to mug me.  

The time before, we were in Denver and met Jarome Iginla in the airport.  Then in the bookstore on the way to the plane, I was accused of stealing and referred to as ""Arab"" despite being Samoan and having a New Zealand accent.

**Alaska**: Little bit of Canadian in their blood, so there's some kindness but like the state itself--cold. 

**Arizona**: Not quite California, Not quite Nevada, Not quite Texas. Serious parent issues.

**Arkansas**: Oklahoma's twin that doesn't get enough attention so has to act up with its ""tornados."" (Not trying to downplay tornados, that shit is serious and I don't mean to offend). 

**California**: Superiority complex with a little bit of valley girl thrown in their for good measure. 

**Colorado**: Stoners. 

**Connecticut**: as /u/pspencer1841 stated, ""Connecticut would be very starkly bipolar.""

**Delaware**: Surrounded by two very foul places--New Jersey and Philadelphia. Asking for more attention. Please, please help.

**Florida**: America's penis. Has major trauma because of this. Recluse, but has a rough streak. 

**Georgia**: Another kind southern bell, but also with a dark past. A peachy exterior with a pit of pure evil (heh). 

**Hawaii**: Everyone loves Hawaii, and it knows it. Can be a real jerk because of it.

**Idaho**: Potato Potato Potato pot--cold as fuck. But a really nice guy once you get to know him.

**Illinois**: This dude is just full of wind.

**Indiana**: I could give 500 reasons why he's a pretty cool guy, but you just can't get over his steely gaze. 

**Iowa**: French? So by proxy, an asshole.

**Kansas**: Oklahoma's hat. A really kind soul. 

**Kentucky**: I mean come on, its shaped like a piece of fried chicken. So you know this girl has bound to be a motherly figure. 

**Louisiana**: And again, a southern bell with a dark past. Also she was dating some French guy for awhile there. She was pretty bitchy during that time...

**Maine**: Lawbstah. A wise seaman. 

**Maryland**: A small, old state, that just wants to be loved and for its kids to call it once in awhile.

**Massachusetts**: Another kind soul, but has a pronunciation problem.

**Missouri**: A miserable, miserable fellow. 

**Montana**: Sort of spread out all over the place. 

**Nebraska**: Who cares about Nebraska, there's like 4 people living there.

**New Jersey**: Faggedaboutit. This dude will rough you up.

**New Mexico**: Quiet, but if you piss them off, they'll go all Heisenberg on your ass.

**New York**: California's nemesis. Sort of a major asshole, but can be kind at times. 

**North Carolina**: Home of Steven Colbert. Automatically the coolest kid in town. 

**North Dakota**: Basically Canada. So a pretty nice guy.

**Ohio**: A sandwich of Indiana and Pennsylvania. It wants you to call more often as well. 

**Oklahoma**: OOOOOOOOKLLLLLLAAAAAAA-dusty dusty dusty. 

**Oregon**: Trying to be as cool as California, but as refined as Washington. But its got Portland going for it, which is good. 

**Pennsylvania**: Generally a nice guy, but soured because of Pittsburgh. 

**Rhode Island**: So much populous for so little land. A nice guy, but can be pretty rude during the fall seasons. 

**South Carolina**: Another southern bell that just wants to feed you.

**South Dakota**: Like North Dakota, also pretty much Canada. A nice guy at times, but pretty airy. 

**Tennessee**: A loud and proud singer, with a streak of violence. 

**Texas**: Big man on campus. Kind and warm, but piss him off, and there will be hell to pay.

**Utah**: Its over-abundant kindness is a ploy. Its hiding something. Beware.

**Vermont**: New Hampshire's exact Doppelganger. 

**Virginia**: The oldest, and wisest. But evil lurks. 

**Washington**: Refined, but is a real prick in the morning. 

**West Virginia**: Another sandwich that wants to be a big boy state like Virginia.

And, in real life, you try to make sure that nobody knows you have big money or has any reason to suspect it.  

Those wealthy people who are ostentatious are generally struggling and suffering mentally and emotionally and are quite discontented.  That's precisely why they're still constantly chasing amusements, showing off, seeking fame and reputation, and otherwise out there everywhere -- they need distractions from themselves and their own disturbed minds and, feeling nothing but whirlpools of misery within themselves, they desperately seek external affirmations of their self- worth.  Don't be fooled when you see their ""exciting and happy and adventurous"" lives -- especially when they're blasting every detail out to the world on Facebook and Instagram.

On earth, the fact that one side of the planet is now always facing the sun will result in the day side becoming warmer and warmer and the night side becoming colder and colder.

Weather would become increasingly more erratic as day-side oceans boil, cool, and get carried over to the night side, creating huge winds and storms.

Don't be hard on yourself. Remind yourself that every little bit you do helps in terms of self-improvement. Didn't get the grade you wanted but are improving? Didn't work out for 45 minutes but worked out for 30? Awesome. Celebrate that.

To feel a major sense of self efficacy, I like to do things that I am good at but might need a reminder that I'm good at. A few examples:
- A good workout fueled by tons of water and fun tunes (guilty pleasures more than OK)
- Cook something amazing and savor it.
- Talk to a friend you haven't reached out to in a while, even if it's through gchat and you're too tired/mopey to call anyone.
- Along the lines of the previous one, learn about someone else's life. Ask your friends or family details about what they're up to, help them with problems, etc.
- Play an instrument or start to play one. Even if you're not AMAZING (I am not at guitar!), the point is to have fun, not be a virtuoso.
- Watch stand-up comedians in person or on YouTube and see how they make humor out of the mundane

21st: stranded in my college town while all my shitty ""friends"" were at home, so I didn't try to plan anything because I knew they'd all flake. I ended up planning for my on-again-off-again boyfriend to come visit me and just take me for the quintessential first drink. I was a little down about it, but instead of trying to cheer me up, he immediately picked a huge fight about how I should just ""get over"" my depression, and concluded the tirade by walking out on me. Yep.",null,0,cdpidq2,1rp1is,AskReddit,hot,2

He was really one of my only friends at the time, so we still ended up getting drinks for my birthday that night (bad idea, I know). I got plastered and ended up putting a hole in the seat of my car with my heel. 

For my 23rd, my dad was in the hospital, my car windshield got busted, and my then-boyfriend (different guy than above) was too broke for us to go to dinner, so we used a gift-card (from my sister) to Outback, then we got into an argument because he wanted me to pay for the remaining $6 that wasn't covered by the gift-card.

Homeless guy is singing to himself on the train, didn't look like he was in bad shape and even had a decent voice.  A teenage kid walked over to him and asked him if he liked subway sandwiches.

The guy stopped singing and said I eat it once in a while, they are pretty good.  The kid then handed him a 15 dollar gift card to subway and told him to have a good night and got off the train.

forever_a-hole,"So, my friends and I like to play a game called ""Spider"". This is oddly fitting for the thread. 

Anyway, this game is basically Marco Pollo meets tag on an enormous playground play set. The tagger has to keep their eyes closed while on the set, but once off can open them. If the tagger is on the set and hear someone that they think is off of the set, they yell spider. Same concept as fish out of water in Marco Pollo. 

So, I'm it. Friends are staying away from the sides because I'm a quick and crafty mother fucker. 

I hop on and start running with my eyes closed across the set. They scatter, obviously. I know this play set very well, as I'm one of the few veterans of the game that hasn't graduated college and moved yet. 

I get to the end, and hear someone trying to be quiet on one of the ladder type things. So, I dash towards them and miss. But I hear them jump and land on the slide that's about 6 feet away. 


Keep in mind that my eyes are shut this entire time. 

I let completely loose and jump hoping to make it to the slide. 
I end up basically tackling one of the guys playing and he falls down the slide. I had landed perfectly in front of him as he was trying to get to the top of the slide and was holding on to the top of the slide. He ran face first into my ass.

These kind of questions are frowned upon by developers, 

It take a lot of practice, learning, and effort to be a programmer, even more to develop games or apps,

Here is what I recommend, if your in college, take a programming logic class, if you're still up for it, take an objective-C class (the code language iOS is developed in)

I know Stanford has a free class on developing for iOS 7, but without those other classes, you won't be able to keep up.

Also get a Mac, the native sdk is only compatible with them.

To publish the apps, you need an apple dev certificate, you can learn that later.

Good luck",null,0,cdpq2ts,1rq69i,AskReddit,hot,1

lumpy_potato,"You'll probably have to spend some time re-learning the basics of programming. iOS might be easier if you are coming from a C++ background, Android has Java and might be cheaper if you can't afford the apple hardware. On the other hand Android has more issues with device compatibility, so if you plan on being a legi long-term dev, prepare ot have a drawer full of android gadgets. You'll have a drawer full of iOS gadgets as well, but you will probably be able to get more Android ones for the same price as a few Apple ones.

I went into mobile programming with limited knowledge, and learned enough to get through the basics. Doing something more complicated, like involving graphics or something like that, will be more time consuming - but if you have evenings to spare and are willing to put a serious effort into it, there's no reason you can't - but it *will* be difficult, because any project where you want the end product to be quality *should* be difficult.",null,0,cdpq56u,1rq69i,AskReddit,hot,1

Woody Allen seemed much calmer and friendlier than you'd expect from his movies. He seemed really happy that I complimented him on his then just-published book of short stories and teased me for liking him at my age (I was 20, this was 2007).

He's nice, and got on well with absolutely everyone, but told really lame jokes really loudly, and  then immediately switched into serious mode in a way that made conversations kind of weird. 

And this is stretching the definitions of both 'celebrity' and 'met', but I had email conversations with the producer Larry Gelbart (who launched the 1970s TV show 'MASH') while I was in media school, and he was surprisingly candid, honest, and in-depth for a conversation with some kid who emailed him out of the blue.

lumpy_potato,"My SO is Christian. I was raised a Hindu, but tend to be less religious/spiritual about it.

It can be tough when our beliefs clash, but the most important thing is to be mutually supportive - my SO understands that I have my beliefs, and respects them. I do the same for my SO - this is important in a relationship with differing religious beliefs (or lack thereof).

This is a struggle for some people, because their interpretation of religion is such where they might feel that their spouse/partner's lack or differences in religious belief might actually be a burden on their own relationship with God/Religion - this is kind of a dangerous thing, because it can sometimes become 'my spouse/partner is coming between me and God.'

You need to have a long talk, and really discuss what is important - make it clear you respect her beliefs (I assume you do), but you want to be able to believe what you feel is right. Remind her that we all have to walk our own paths, and that you feel (I assume) that as long as you live a good and moral life, you are doing the right thing (overall).

There will be many conversations to be had if you are serious about your GF - how to raise kids, dealing with church, etc. I know at least a few couples other than my SO and I who are different in terms of religious upbringing, and it *can* work - but both sides need to be open to compromise. I've seen a Christian participating in a Hindu wedding, and a Hindu participating in a Christian wedding - it *can* be done, but it really depends on how that other person perceives things.

This shouldn't be a fight to convince her that you are right or wrong - just a conversation on how to find a middle ground where you can both live your lives according to your own moral grounds without too much conflict (people are different, conflict is inevitable, good relationships are based on finding mutually beneficial solutions to them)",null,0,cdpq25h,1rq5sg,AskReddit,hot,4

You probably agree that lying is bad.  She may get there through the 10 commandments, you may get there through an analysis of the negative effects of lying and observed repercussions.  But at the end of the day, you both think lying is bad.

Combine that with tolerance and understanding for each other's viewpoints, and it can work out very well.

blueit11,"This is tough. I think this is serious deal breaker territory for many people. Sounds like she wishes you shared her beliefs, and I think that's a warning sign frankly. I mean, if it's a focul point in her life for instance if she likes to be surrounded by religion, the church she's in, etc. it may be hard to share a life if you aren't a part of that. I think when kids enter the equation it's a big challenge as well. 

I am in the same boat, I am a non believer and my gf and her family are religious. It works because she doesn't push any of it on me, and frankly I don't have a problem with religion as long is it doesn't hurt anyone, or it's forced on me. 

I asked her in the beginning how important it was, and she said it wasn't important I be religious if I respected she had these beliefs. 1.5 years later, its not been an issue at all. I respect when her family says grace at dinners, or if she says something religious I don't tease her. 

So I think we'll work, I think you just need to have this talk. Be honest with each other and very realistic about what you expect, becasue I've all seen this break up relationships. People often make the mistake of trying to change each other in relationships.

Yossarion,"Melatonin helps me. It's the chemical your brain releases when it decides it's time to go to sleep, only in tablet form, so when it kicks in that's all you really wanna do. It also has a low probability of dependence if not used for long periods of time. Some sources I've read say that means 2 weeks, others say 6 weeks or 2 months. I generally try not to take it more than 7 days in a row just in case, my sleep patterns are weird enough already. 

Another plus, it's commonly available over the counter as a nutritional supplement for a few bucks. I'd recommend starting with the smaller doses (3 or 5mg I think are the two smallest ones, can't remember though) until you know how much it's going to affect you and in what ways. I also recommend taking them with a big glass of water; some mornings after taking it I wake up parched but hydrating the night before keeps it from happening. 

For some immediate relief, try meditating. It seems new agey but it doesn't have to be. I'm as skeptical as they come and have found meditation to be a useful trick my brain can do. The metaphysical parts are optional, and the actual practice of meditating is simple as can be: close your eyes and try to focus only on your breathing. The feeling of air entering and leaving your lungs, or passing across your nostrils, the sounds it makes, whatever works for you. When your mind wanders, and it will, stop and refocus on your breathing. Rinse and repeat until unconscious, ha.",null,3,cdpgtk5,1rp56t,AskReddit,hot,3

ramonycajones,"Disclaimer: I like video games, I play video games, I can play them all day. My biggest thing though is that I like stories, and video games are usually incredibly inefficient at communicating stories compared to movies or books. You can spend a hundred hours on an RPG to get a story that could've taken maybe 3 or 4 hours in movie form. That's the main reason I think they're a waste of time.

Meanwhile, a lot of games are not about story and are just about fun. I like that angle mostly when it comes to playing CoD or Super Smash Bros with friends or whatever, but if I play by myself then I feel like I haven't gained anything at the end of it; I managed to be mildly amused for 6 hours but I haven't learned anything story-wise and I haven't built up any social connections. At least if I wasted my time watching movies or TV I'd learn about pop culture, writing, whatever, whereas replaying a game doesn't give you any new information. 

That's my thing. I'm not gonna judge anyone on playing tons of video games because it's not like I use my time efficiently anyway, but I do feel for myself that when I play video games I'm committing to wasting that time.

Edit: Also OP, try to come at this with a little less bias. ""People who assume..."" and ""Why do you believe..."" implies that no one could think video games are a waste of time if they knew what they were talking about. The phrasing of the question is as if you're asking about people who think aliens rule the Earth. ",null,0,cdplux9,1rppcd,AskReddit,hot,1

DrNicolasCage,"Background:
I was in 8th grade taking a wood working class as one of my electives. I was using a band saw to cut out a rough shape for a bread knife handle and someone called my name from across the room. Now instead of pulling away like a logical person I just turned my head and kept pushing that wood into the saw, anyway I ended up sawing straight into my right ring finger up to the second knuckle. I didn't cut it off I just kind of split it into two longways I guess it the best way to describe it. 

Response:
Well I felt a quick jolt of pain and jerked my hand back, I looked at it held it up to my face and my forearm was immediately covered in blood. At this point I couldn't feel any pain so I walked over to my friend and asked ""Hey man you got a bandaid haha?"". He looked, saw my bloodied arm and freaked out and got the teacher. I had to run it under cold water for a few minutes then pressure was applied until I got to the hospital. I don't remember any pain until after I was out of the ER but it was just a slow throbbing kind of pain. I also started shaking uncontrollably, felt like I had a stomach ache and tuned ""pale as a ghost"" to quote my mother. On the plus side I didn't have to write my french final because I couldn't hold a pen.

She is strong, and independent even has a baby, and I love it. She's going to grow into a strong, dominant, and powerful women one day, I just know it.

Find out later that the girl had only been using me as a way to make her ex jealous. When he finally lost interest and told her to go fuck herself, she made up a story that I had tried to rape her and she was deathly afraid of me....This psychopath's utter disregard for my feelings and well being while she used me as a pawn in her twisted little games ultimately taught me a valuable (unfortunate?) lesson about the ugly nature of certain individuals.

3dogs3catsandahedgeh,"I was dating a wonderful, sweet guy and things were getting serious. His parents seemed to be happy around me, and were always smiling and courteous to me. One night we were coming home from a couple's night out, just hanging out with friends at their house. We were driving on some back roads and came to a blinking traffic light. A pickup truck came out of nowhere, ran the light, and broadsided us. The driver rolled his truck and was crushed by it. We rolled our car and the roof on the passenger side collapsed. I was driving, and broke my jaw and tore two abdominal arteries and my intestine, shattered my tib-fib, and broke my finger and thumb. My boyfriend wasn't so lucky. The right side of his head was crushed, and he was comatose for two weeks. We were both in the same hospital, so I went to visit him at his room when he was waking up. His parents acted very strange when I went to see him. I got put into a rehab center to get back to walking, and he got put into a head injury center. That's where the cruelty came in. His parents would not let me see him or talk with him. Month after month went by; I would talk with his brother to find out how he was, but could never see him or speak with him. 

His mother asked me to testify for him for the lawsuit they were bringing against the bar. The guy who hit us was drunk, and he had 3 previous drunk driving tickets. So they were suing the bar, and they wanted me to testify about the accident; but I couldn't remember what happened, since I had had a concussion. He couldn't remember either, because his short term memory was gone. And he couldn't remember me either. He had lost all of the past year, and I was in that year, so he had no memory of me. Perhaps if I had been able to see him after he woke up, or been able to speak to him, it might have stirred something, but I'll never know. Eventually they let me see him, but we were just friends. He was apologetic about it, but he just couldn't feel what he used to, and that was that. 

A psychologist told me that they needed someone to blame for the accident, and since I was driving, they blamed me. I was the only one they could blame, since the other driver, the drunk one, was dead. So, I never saw him much after that, and I just had to get over it all on my own.

At first, I thought nothing of it. Both our games hung, and my friend reset his Gameboy and loaded his save just fine. I reset mine, watched the Nintendo and Game Freak logos go by, and went to load my save game... but it wasn't there.

jsmooth7,"Here's the story of the most senselessly cruel thing that's happened to me.

This story takes place in Grade 10 in gym class. We were doing a fit run that day. We were put into relays of 5 and we would run to the other side of the gym and back and then the next person would go, until 30 minutes was up. Pretty standard, nothing too exciting. One of the guys on my team I didn't know very well. Lets call him Jack, just for fun.

With about 2 minutes or so left to go, I stopped paying attention to the order and accidentally leave one person early. Jack was supposed to go, so he yells out something to me. At the other side of the gym I stop, and he catches up. I tell him sorry about that, and then we both run back to the other side. Now I was running back at full speed with Jack slightly behind me. Normally I would only start to slow down about a meter before the wall, and use the wall to stop me the rest of the way. Well as I was approaching the wall, Jack decided to push me from behind as hard as he could. I put my arms out just before I slammed into the wall. Instantly I feel excruciating pain in my wrists.

Shock took over and I realized I couldn't stay standing up, so I just laid down on the ground. People looked at me strangely but that wasn't really something I was concerned about. The fit run ends, everyone goes to get changed, leaving me still lying on the *fucking floor* in pain. Finally the shock wore off, so I get up, walk over to the PE teachers, and they finally realize they should do something.

At the hospital I found out both my wrists were broken. The next day when I went to school I found a lot of support and sympathy from my friends, and other people too. That, combined with the Tylenol 3 I was taking made me feel a lot better. However Jack had no remorse what so ever. The school administration basically forced him to apologize, so he gave me a lovely card that said:

&gt;I'm sorry your wrists got broken. Get well soon!

Thanks for the ""apology"".

A few days later Jack got expelled. I still have no idea what motivated him to push me like he did.

homerBM,"I was dating a guy for 4-5 months who just disappeared.  Was usually with him several days per week at that point, we'd had a nice day out and never heard from him again.  You go through many emotions when this happens, worry / concern, anger, feeling down, inadequate, questioning yourself and so on.  I was able to check he was alive and well as I could see when he signed on to a website we both used. After ten days of silence from him, I stopped trying, but became near obsessive about seeking out info on him online and reading back through texts and online conversations, not something I usually do but I was just trying to piece together anything I could!

I think it's cruel because had he just said he wasn't interested any more, it would have hurt, but I'd have been able to move on.  Instead I spent a good couple months overly focused on trying to work out what happened and feeling awful and confused.

There was nothing I could do to alleviate the way I was feeling, and the terror of that only made it worse.  

I went to the ER the first time, fully expecting to be told that I was, in fact, having a heart attack, or worse.  They tested me out - no signs of any heart trouble/disease.  They ran some other tests, including a chest x-ray.  Nothing.  Finally they asked me, and I quote, ""If I was an anxious person"".  I answered, ""I guess I am.""

It came out of nowhere and I think it was a result of a period of extreme stress and two month long family crisis a year prior to my first ""attack"".  Now, If I recognize that feeling starting, I don't hesitate and I use the freakin' ativan, because I was hestitant to use it at first, and I basically had another full blown attack about a week later - again, completely out of nowhere.  

I started a very vigorous and strict workout regiment after that event, because the doctor suggested it - and it has helped.  All subsequent ""attacks"" have coincided with certain busy times when I couldn't devote an hour or more per day for a vigorous workout, so I'm certain that exercise is the only thing keeping this thing in check.

Another thing I do, now, is that I call my SO and just try to talk about it with her, or just talk about other things to help me focus on them instead of the bad thoughts. It really helps and her jokes always cheers me up. 

During my first attack my hands went numb and I couldn't move them at all, as I had never experienced this I freaked out even more. I started sweating and shaking as my thoughts kept telling me things to worry about and filled me with doubt about things. I felt like nothing could help me get out of this state and I didn't want to wake anyone in my family at first because I was anxious about their sleeping schedule. 

Afterwards I was a bit embarassed about it, thinking that there's something wrong with me. But I started reading about anxiety and panic attacks more and realised I wasn't alone. 

I'd suggest talking to someone you feel close to or seek help (I'm currently talking to a doctor about my anxiety) I feel better now afterwards, even though the first time was very hard to go through with.",null,0,cdpqb9y,1rq3gs,AskReddit,hot,1

I strived to be the older and wiser sibling and try to share as much knowledge as I could with her even while I was still developing. As we grew older, my brother eventually moved to a different city while I was still around to look after my sister and show her how to prepare herself for high school as well as sharing some of my experiences so she knows not to make the same mistakes. She is now an honours student I couldn't be more proud. My brother comes back to visit time and again and he's working on strengthening his relationship with my sister as he can still provide guidance through her teenage years. I moved to a different country so I won't be able to see her do a lot of her work, but she shows it to me from time to time.

Peevesie,"A sibling is like the best friend you have been forced to have. Like your parents put two people in a room for around 20 years and said ""Now be friends"". After about 20 years you can't wait to get away but miss each other when away. You inexplicably defend and love this person in public about everything you may or may not like about them. But in personal life you have plotted about a million ways of slowly, torturously killing them. 

Plus there are the day to the day things. Its all the small things and nitpicky things about the other person which seem designed to make your life hell. If you say anything, you are raking up a fight. So as long as it peaceful its ok if the block the bathroom and make you late for school and then brandy about that they are always on time. COz he only has to bathe and put clothes and leave. You have to do it after him and then plait your hair coz you are a girl and the stupid school rules need your hair plaited. And your lateness is family legend that you will hear even when you are married

But he is also the guy who will threaten someone who he thinks is wrong for you and be all protective and come to your college past midnight to pick you up so that you don't have to take public transport at the creepy time despite having an early term paper the next day. He would make the best food for you when your parents are away(like restaurant quality), teach you how not to die of starvation and messiness and then tell you helped to your parents. 

He is the guy you have to tell everytime he is being inappropriate to other people, call out when he is unfunny, hypocritical, insensitive and hateful and pray to the lord he doesn't end up on the streets when he is being irresponsible

HedyLamarr,"As /u/Cumberlady said, it depends on where you are going and what you want to see, but let's expand on that.  

Say you are a business person going to a conference at the convention center. You can take a cab from the airport and catch a shuttle from the nearest hotel (which is barely walking distance) to the convention center. Really, if you go to LA on business but don't have to go beyond the area of your hotel too far, you can cab/use a car service.  

If you are a tourist, it is impossible. Unless you go to LA for a single destination, you have to have a car. Yes, there is a subway, but it doesn't really go where a tourist would want to go. Yes there are busses, but they are designed for local commuters. Want to go to Disneyland one day and check out the crazies on the Venice Beach boardwalk? That's 40 miles of distance between them. Surf in the morning and ski in the afternoon? That's about 75 to 90 miles, plus a full wetsuit.

At 15 years old, I became a sort of mediator between these elders who I now saw as hypocrites, and my mother and her fiancee. It went on for months, eventually they got married and that was that. But the hypocrisy - preaching acceptance and then doing everything in their power to interfere with my family's life - did my head in.

Not long after, I ran away and stayed with my dad for a while. He's not religious at all and didn't pressure me.

If you read every verse, God turns out to be less ""Love you, love everyone"" and more ""Let's talk about when it officially becomes bad to beat your servants to death."" Liars and murderers are rewarded, over and over again. And if you even look at God, he will kill you. 

Kind of a nice habit to have, if you don't want anyone looking into the ark of the covenant. People mock Joseph Smith and his hat, but at least he didn't straight up murder everyone who looked into his storyline.   

And then the Romans take over, and after a reported baby genocide for which there is no historical evidence, those speaking for God reported He was suddenly way less blood-thirsty. Further advances in God's mercy came with the discovery of how lightning and disease transmission works.

Be humble, but don't downplay your strengths, tell your date she looks beautiful at the beginning of the date, then again at the end if it fits (don't just blurt it out haphazardly) but don't keep complimenting her over and over and over as it will seem insincere.

mRNA28,"It was pretty late one night and I was in the kitchen waiting for the kettle to boil when I spied Spitz (a blow-up sex doll) on the floor. She hadn't been used or anything, she was just a gag-gift a friend got for secret santa and we just kept her as a house mascot. 

So, I picked her up and for some reason decided to start dancing with her. Like full on Beauty-and-the-beast type waltzing - twirling around the kitchen doing dips and shit. It was actually really graceful when I think back on it...

Anyway, I didn't realise that my housemate had friends over and they were hanging out in the garden. I just remember turning around to the window and seeing 5 guys just staring at me and this inflatable doll with an expression somewhere between utter confusion and pure amusement.

I was so mortified, I placed the doll down gently and carried on as if nothing happened. And then I pegged it back to my room after my tea was made.

EDIT: [I found a picture of Spitz!](http://i.imgur.com/CHPtMwL.jpg) **(NSFW)** Taken from the garden as she chills quite happily in my housemate's bedroom upstairs.",null,49,cdoyqm9,1rn6at,AskReddit,hot,298

I was at the gym working out. I had just loaded up the bar for squats and I was feeling pretty damn sexy. My girlfriend at the time was at work in some important meeting, so I figured I'd send her a picture of me being all, uh, work-out-y. 

I took out my phone to take a shot in the mirrors and... *the goddamn flash went off.* I have *never* turned the flash on for my phone. Everyone saw it and looked over at me, and immediately I was *that guy*.

NotMathMan821,"When I was kid, still in elementary school, I was really into WWF and wanted to grow up to be a wrestling superstar. I had the little wrestler plush toys and posters of Hulk Hogan all over my room. I took my vitamins and said my prayers, just like the Hulkster told me. I also practiced my future trade. 

I would line my stuffed animals up and have wrestling matches on the bed or living room floor. Hulk Hogan was always my tag-team partner, and as I recall we were the undisputed champions for a few years running. But tag team partners have to match in order to be successful. I mean look at the Rockers and the Road Warriors, those guys were always winning on TV and they wore similar costumes.

So I took a white shirt and wrote ""Hulk-a-Mania"" on the back in red marker or red paint. I grabbed an elastic headband so we'd both have some kind of headdress to wear, put on some sunglasses, and (worst of all) adorned my face with some metallic star stickers we got from school. I'd walk down the narrow hallway in our house to the ""I Am A Real American"" tune I dubbed onto a cassette tape, and flick the light switch in my room for added choreography. 

Well my parents found out. But I didn't know this. They plotted their dastardly plan to catch me in the act next time and take pictures so they could embarrass me in front of friends and girls for years to come. Sure enough the next time I get ready for my mini-WrestleMania, they burst into the room after my grand entrance with the camera in hand. 

They still have those pictures some where, and refuse to turn them over to me. I did get one picture back though, but that was because they shared them with my college girlfriend who was creating a scrap-book as a graduation present.

An ex-girlfriend of mine actually described them as 'rats of the sky'. She didn't like pigeons.

On the other hand, there are people that for some reason love the pigeons. It's like they have never seen one before. They try and grab them, they feed them, they put corn on top of other people so that the pigeons swarm that person until there is no corn left to satisfy the bastards. Anyway, there I am, surrounded by billions of pigeons, with no more corn left because it's all on my sisters head. Obviously, she didn't want to give me hers. So I decided that just for fun, I am going to dance. Like a ballerina. Kicking high and low, doing graceful jumps. I didn't actually WANT to kick the pigeons, but it was fun to see them avoiding every single one of them (see [http://i.imgur.com/HsbAA.gif] for what I'm talking about). But, there must have been a pigeon who was either looking the other way, or just missed the pigeon-ninja school like every other pigeon on the Piazza, because I kicked him so hard that it seemed like I had a personal vendetta against him. Fuckkkkkkkkkkk. The guy selling corn saw it all, and started swearing in Italian so loudly that all the tourists around stopped whatever they were doing and just looked at me.

runcataleya,"When I get drunk, I pee outside.  Not like, middle-of-the-woods-outside either.  I made my boyfriend pull over after a night of drinking in town so I could pee in the road.  Drunk logic, I guess.  A few cars drive by, I think nothing of it, and my boyfriend runs and grabs me now that he's not scared to get hit by my pee stream and sits me in the car.

Fast forward to the next week, boyfriend and I return to the pub to have a few drinks.  Imagine my surprise when I meet my buddy's girlfriend and she exclaims, ""OMG I totally saw her peeing!"" to my buddy.  She said it in kind of an excited whisper and turned her face away from the table when she said it (not excited to have seen me pee, but probably just excited to have a secret?  I don't know).
 I don't think she meant for me to hear it.  The realization that not just strangers, but people I actually know can see me when I do things like that was enough to make me stop.",null,2,cdp3hc3,1rn6at,AskReddit,hot,10

singles_in_your_area,"The Radiolab podcasts (and shows) from WNYC (an NPR station). 
They cover almost any topic imaginable, from human understanding of regret, to epidemiology, to the history of sewage treatment, to the mathematical &amp; life importance of loops. They do all of this in an incredibly artistic and in depth way, interweaving several story lines, either anecdotal or factual, always told by either experts or primary witnesses, into whichever theme they are addressing in each show. I say it's artistic because they truly have an incredible mastery of intermingling sounds whether that be the spoken word or contextually relevant noises (bird chirps and forest sounds for a show about birding, general hospital noise in doctor interviews, or incredible onomatopoeic pairings for all words like ""click"" and ""pop"") as well as editing segments together. Their podcasts flow exactly like the human mind would while trying to grasp these varied topics: the edits cutting away from experts for explanation as soon as things get confusing. 
My takeaway each time is what seems like an experiential knowledge of each topic due to the depth and context provided, and it never feels like someone just crammed a textbook into my head because it always sounds just like a very interesting story.  

Although not strictly a podcast, most of the old episodes and podcasts can all be found online (sorry for no link, on phone). ",null,0,cdpi23z,1rp841,AskReddit,hot,3

captbritcorps,"Tell-Em Steve Dave. It's on the Smodcast network and it started off with two friends of Kevin Smith; Bryan Johnson and Walt Flanagan and another friend and former View Askew employee Brian Quinn as their 'tech guy'. If you've seen any Kevin Smith films you've probably seen Walt and Bryan in them mainly known for ther Steve Dave and Fanboy characters which is where they took the name, Brian Quinn people may know from Impractical Jokers on TruTv. Walt agreed to do the podcast originally to help Bryan through a deep depression he was going through and thought he would lose interest after 3 episodes (it's now on episode 178).

It's hard to explain it but I just love this podcast so much. It's not so much about any specific subject it's more just about these 3 guys as they talk about their lives, news stories, stories from their past etc. Usually it would sound boring but the 3 have such a great chemistry that just makes it such a hillarious and sometimes touching thing to listen to. Walt and Bryan have been friends for 30+ years, Quinn and the others for 15+ years so they know each other well.

The podcast doesn't really have any set format it's just whatever the guys want to talk about. Over the years this has included one members pretty serious painkiller addiction, them all getting tv shows, depression and basically whatever comes to mind. I'm really struggling to describe what it's about or why I love it but I'll say this it's probably one of my most favourite pieces of entertainment at any one point in the day I'm probably listening to an episode.

However, the part my therapist had said would be a ""good thing to work on stopping"" was my calorie counting (for health purposes- even number &amp; less than 1000 kcal/ day) and counting the number of steps I took whenever I walked somewhere. If the number of steps didn't land on an even number, I'd walk around the block or parking lot so my arrival to the door was an even number. When I am stressed, this routine calms me down still. But it was problematic because I would not talk to anyone I was spending time with because I couldn't count and hold a conversation.

You don't get the best price when you buy from a dealership, unless you know absolutely nothing about cars, and are afraid to pop the hood to poke around, I'd buy from private party.

If you have to buy from a dealership, still check local ads like craigslist just to familiar yourself with the market.  How much are certain brand/model going for, what type of condition should they be in (keep in mind that dealerships can work magics on used cars to make them look brand new).
