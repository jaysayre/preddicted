Hors2018,"Spirits are idiots and you have to be pretty firm with them. I can see them and I usually just make them leave. None have ever scratched me or made me feel in danger (Well, once they did but they were furious at me for getting help against them) Which may be what you need, someone more experienced than you are... Just make sure it's the correct help. 

My family doesn't mess with spirits either and we are a Christian family. Just this year though I found I am sensitive to the spiritual realm more so than others, so yeah, I had invisible friends whose actual identities were demons... Yeah, crazy sounding.

Bu the thing with them is that if you're a Christian they have to obey you and leave when you order them to in Jesus name. Pull in some people who are more spiritually mature than you are and actually believe in this. Some don't and they are zero help. 

Message me for more info if you want it.

* * * 

So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind. 

I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community. The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.

 That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night. So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.


I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue. Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry. Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would-be-physician that trains at this facility. He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure. He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 

Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here. So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious. 

The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it. He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night. It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry. I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up. When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed. Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 

I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry. I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him. ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do. 

I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home. As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient. I helped Jerry back to his bed. Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK. Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar. 

I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it. I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 

I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back. I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge. In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle. In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing. The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full. 

After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise. Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?"" I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room. I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming. I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill. With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep. 

I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital. I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes. All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man. 

The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them. The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings. I'm not really sure what to make of it. In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.

Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar. 

I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it. I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 

I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back. I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge. In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle. In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing. The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full. 

After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise. Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?"" I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room. I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming. I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill. With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep. 

I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital. I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes. All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man. 

The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them. The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings. I'm not really sure what to make of it. In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.

LucklessLemings,"Lurker here.  If you follow the UFO conspiracy theories, MJ-12 stands for the group called Majestic 12 which took over from Project Blue Book for investigating (or rather covering up) supposed UFO phenomenon.  When I researched FM 3-36 TRADOC, I found a handy powerpoint outlining what it is.  It's a field manual outlining terms and things to consider in Electronic Warfare.  The manual is available to look at here.  http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/FM3_36.pdf  As all publicly available field manuals are, it contains very little info on how to wage Electronic Warfare, but just outlines terms and things to consider.  However, some interesting things to consider.  The powerpoint I found was written by two people simply called COL Dixon and william.darley which are microsoft usernames.  There are no links to communicate.  The powerpoint was made in 2004, edited in 2009, and looks like an intro.  Considering how this field is much newer than MJ-12 and the purpose of the powerpoint, it seems like FM 3-36 could have been written in 2004, but I'm not sure.  The version available online was released November of 2012.  So it has been in operation since at least 2004.  One interesting thing is that FM 3-36 is mostly an Army manual, although there is an entire chapter dedicated to working with different agencies and friendly nations.  I haven't found anything specifically outlining hard drive security, although you can bet if it says ""Erase and Destroy"", and it was sent to be destroyed, it's probably been erased.  Now, that doesn't mean all is lost.  Many less experienced people would simply wave a magnet over it, which is an imperfect way of wiping data.  Most likely, they would use a program which erases and writes over the disk several times, erasing it pretty well.  Still, if it has not been physically damaged there could still be a chance to recover the data.  If they were uber secure about data, they might have a program which alerts a server if it's being tampered with by anything with internet access.  So if you have someone checking it out, take out the internet card.  I'd recommend taking a look at Wikipedia, since even the existence of MJ-12 is debated.  From what I understand though, if it did exist, it closed down decades ago.  What would most likely be on there is scanned and conslidated old information.  What is strange is that it would be in a desk, meaning it was being used somehow, rather than in a storage bin or server.

markzzi,"Yepp, you definitely experienced ""sleep paralysis"". It happens to me about once a month. I remember the first time it happend a couple of years ago. I was really exhausted when I went to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. I dreamt about me walking around in a mall. Then I realized I was dreaming and entered some sort of ""lucid dream state"". After having some fun in the dream flying and throwing people around, I opened my eyes and had this ""The Grudge"" looking girl hoovering over me. She pinched me down to the bed and I couldn't move or scream. Then pooff, she was gone and I jumped out of the bed. 

After this experience I read about ""sleep paralysis"" so the second time it happened I knew what was going on and was able to keep calm. 

I have no problem with it occuring from time to time since it always happens  the same way. Me realizing I'm dreaming, keeping my eyes shut, feeling her hair and hearing her whisper. Sometimes she even tries to drag me out of bed, but I'm always waking up at the same place I fell asleep. Sometimes I even open my eyes and stare at her, trying to figure out what she's whispering.

I wouldn't get paranoid. I am sure she is having a hard time with coping. She married the love of her life, and now she wants a baby and can never have one with him. It's a very big life decision that she is faced with right now. These seminars require a lot of 'feeling' and talking. She is likely exhausted from built up emotions. Put yourself in her shoes and think about what she is going through. She can either stay with you and be happy but always have the yearning to know what it would have been like to be a mother, or she can leave you and go through the process of finding someone else on equal footing as you( which may be impossible to her) and have a child...all the while thinking, what if I do all of this and then find out I am not cut out to be a mom. Or what if I leave him, never find someone else and then I'm alone and I'm not a mom.

Having children with the man you love is a massive thing for us, even if previously she didn't want kids it takes one thought to change her mind.

Having children with the man you love is a massive thing for us, even if previously she didn't want kids it takes one thought to change her mind. It's therefore unlikely she's going to stop going to this seminar, which is probably influencing her into believing she's right and what she needs is what matters, despite your thoughts.

Before I moved into this apt (14 or so years ago) I had an incident where my landlord's son came in to my apt when I was sleeping ""to close the window in case it rained"" (not a cloud in the sky).  I slept with a golf club at the time, nearly brained the bastard.  

I'm happy now that my small apt building is mostly occupied by one family broken up into mulriple apts (the kids are adults mostly and they each have their own apt and kids as well).

As far as the past life regression goes, there are techniques that involve being hypnotized and some that do not. Usually hypnosis is only done one on one for past life regression not in a group setting. The other way is basically just like a guided meditation where you relax to a point where your mind is clear and then slowly recall vivid memories from your past going backward to the beginning of your life. Past life regression happens after you recall your earliest memories from this life then keep going and recalling memories from someone else's (or your past) life. You can find guided meditations for past life regression on YouTube.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_hypnosis

As far as the past life regression goes, there are techniques that involve being hypnotized and some that do not. Usually hypnosis is only done one on one for past life regression not in a group setting. The other way is basically just like a guided meditation where you relax to a point where your mind is clear and then slowly recall vivid memories from your past going backward to the beginning of your life. Past life regression happens after you recall your earliest memories from this life then keep going and recalling memories from someone else's (or your past) life. You can find guided meditations for past life regression on YouTube.

menu_balk,"Well, I don't know how mirrors influence dreams, but I know to *never* look into a mirror when (lucid) dreaming.
Lucid dreaming is the state in which you can control your dreaming. Think as your dreams as a semi-sandbox. You can only partially influence the world you are in, but you can completely manipulate that world (fly, find/think up guns etc.). Look up how to trigger it. Its tiresome, but fun.
However, since the part in your brain that controls logic is shut down during sleep, a few things consistently don't work as intended. These are so called reality checks. You can perform these on a bi-hourly basis in real life. You will subconsciously then also perform them in your dreams. When you notice something is 'not right', you become aware you are dreaming. Do note that some reality checks might work as intended, yet you can still be dreaming. This is why it is wise to perform multiple to be sure.
Also the shock/joy of this fact alone wakes you up, however, you can prevent waking from a (lucid) dream by spinning around very fast. This forces your mind to think about balancing, thus canceling out your 'waking up' signal.
Without further ad: reality checks!

1. Digital numbers are all garbled. Your average nightclock might suddenly display something like this: http://goo.gl/rUVPRC
2. Light switches don't work. Remember: no logic. Due to this, light switches don't trigger changes in luminance. They *might* trigger other stuff.
3. Your body is only semi-solid. This means that you can for example, with enough force, push your finger through the palm of your hand. (This is a very easy reality check to work into your daily routine.)
4. Creepy check number one: your hands will often have *more than five fingers on each hand*. And usually they aren't even matched up in number
5. Creepy check number two: mirrors show a distorted/disturbed version of yourself. It sounds interesting, but it is jarring to watch, sometimes enough to wake you up.
6. You can breathe through a closed nose.

Laurashrti,"A few things about mirrors that are considered old wives' tales:

* Don't let two mirrors face each other because it can stop the flow of energy in the house.
* Don't put a mirror in your bedroom because it allows bad spirits into your dreams and they can 'steal your soul.'
* If your soul wanders during the night a mirror can 'capture it.' Another possible reason to keep it out of the bedroom.
* Mirrors can be gateways from spirits, both good and bad.

Just a few things to consider, but take them with a grain of salt. The gateway thing would concern me. Having two gateways facing each other would possibly allow for heavy traffic... if you believe in that sort of thing... :)

Lucid dreaming is the state in which you can control your dreaming. Think as your dreams as a semi-sandbox. You can only partially influence the world you are in, but you can completely manipulate that world (fly, find/think up guns etc.). Look up how to trigger it. Its tiresome, but fun.
However, since the part in your brain that controls logic is shut down during sleep, a few things consistently don't work as intended. These are so called reality checks. You can perform these on a bi-hourly basis in real life. You will subconsciously then also perform them in your dreams. When you notice something is 'not right', you become aware you are dreaming. Do note that some reality checks might work as intended, yet you can still be dreaming. This is why it is wise to perform multiple to be sure.
Also the shock/joy of this fact alone wakes you up, however, you can prevent waking from a (lucid) dream by spinning around very fast. This forces your mind to think about balancing, thus canceling out your 'waking up' signal.
Without further ad: reality checks!

1. Digital numbers are all garbled. Your average nightclock might suddenly display something like this: http://goo.gl/rUVPRC
2. Light switches don't work. Remember: no logic. Due to this, light switches don't trigger changes in luminance. They *might* trigger other stuff.
3. Your body is only semi-solid. This means that you can for example, with enough force, push your finger through the palm of your hand. (This is a very easy reality check to work into your daily routine.)
4. Creepy check number one: your hands will often have *more than five fingers on each hand*. And usually they aren't even matched up in number
5. Creepy check number two: mirrors show a distorted/disturbed version of yourself. It sounds interesting, but it is jarring to watch, sometimes enough to wake you up.
6. You can breathe through a closed nose.

Tl;dr: Mirrors *in* dreams = scary",null,7,cdo12tn,1rjwb3,nosleep,top_week,24

Laurashrti,"A few things about mirrors that are considered old wives' tales:

* Don't let two mirrors face each other because it can stop the flow of energy in the house.
* Don't put a mirror in your bedroom because it allows bad spirits into your dreams and they can 'steal your soul.'
* If your soul wanders during the night a mirror can 'capture it.' Another possible reason to keep it out of the bedroom.
* Mirrors can be gateways from spirits, both good and bad.

Just a few things to consider, but take them with a grain of salt. The gateway thing would concern me. Having two gateways facing each other would possibly allow for heavy traffic... if you believe in that sort of thing... :)

The same happened to me a lot when I was younger, it got better with the time.
I can't remember when it started, but I remember having a really hard time sleeping because of the voices. It was like trying to take a nap in the middle of a party! Most of the voices where just rambling, I couldn't even understand what they were saying. When I was about 12, the voices started to call me. Some were unrecognizable, but others were from friends and family, they kept calling my name and I started sleeping with some of those nature sounds things to muffle the sound.
It's nothing scary or anything, it just gets in my way when I'm trying to sleep. :P
Now I'm 25 and I still hear the voices, but I got better at it. Now I can block it, and distinguish what they are saying. Usually it's just lonely people looking for someone to chat with. :)
I've had some weird experiences, though. Once I woke up to someone moaning in pain, right in my ear, and when I woke, scared as hell, the moaning turned into some crasy laughter. -_-
Sometimes I hear whistling, and my dog hears it too.

What could've happened is that part of your brain stops working while dreaming which leaves a distorted image of you once you look in the mirror. Since the ghost wanted to talk about death, you had the thought stuck in your mind about death and your brain emitted screaming in return. In return of your paranormal encounter and your nightmare, you things that it's from the ghost in which gives your brain the fuel for dark thoughts.

When did the sister die? - Shortly after the last time she interacted with Jonathan.

Why was the father acting as if he had seen the sister, when he assumed she was in Jonathans room? - He was playing along, pretending like she was alive in order to give Jonathan the idea that she wasn't dead. Alternatively he could have seen the ghost of the sister, much like Jonathan did with his mother. It's up to the reader.

How did the mother die? - Jonathan first saw her when she was a rotten corpse, he never knew. The father still stated she died of a liver-failure during interviews. If she did or not, no one knows.

Why was the father acting like a british doctor of some sort? He was suffering from schizophrenia. 

Most important though, the story actually has all the hints and details in order to figure this out, and some of you did. I failed as a writer to make some stuff clearer. It's always hard knowing how other people will interpret your story. This is the first story that I've written that is longer than a thousand words.

I want to thank everyone who read it, who gave me tips and who upvoted it. I've enjoyed these 3 days of reddit posts of my story. I really enjoyed reading what people were speculating about the ending, someone mentioned that he would have something behind the fridge; that was my favorite one.

I believed there were people were trapped in my walls for most of my childhood... I heard them, after all. But if my grandmother came in for any reason, it would all stop.

Sometimes it still happens, and my doctor believes that both the shrinking/expanding and the music/whispers are a neurological phenomenon related to my migraines. He calls it ""Alice-in-Wonderland-Syndrome Aura"" or ""lilliputian hallucinations"" that cause the feeling of the room warping, and that sometimes children experience this but grow out of it.

I found it more fascinating than scary, though, and would often watch my hands or my toys and feel them holding still and staying the same as I see them change and move in front of me.  Usually it would go away awhile after I focused on it intently.  I grew out of it around the time I started kindergarten.
