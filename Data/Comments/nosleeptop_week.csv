As far as the past life regression goes, there are techniques that involve being hypnotized and some that do not. Usually hypnosis is only done one on one for past life regression not in a group setting. The other way is basically just like a guided meditation where you relax to a point where your mind is clear and then slowly recall vivid memories from your past going backward to the beginning of your life. Past life regression happens after you recall your earliest memories from this life then keep going and recalling memories from someone else's (or your past) life. You can find guided meditations for past life regression on YouTube.

It doesn't necessarily mean someone was swinging a clock in front of her eyes. There are different types of hypnosis, one she may not have recognized as such.

Having children with the man you love is a massive thing for us, even if previously she didn't want kids it takes one thought to change her mind.

markzzi,"Yepp, you definitely experienced ""sleep paralysis"". It happens to me about once a month. I remember the first time it happend a couple of years ago. I was really exhausted when I went to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. I dreamt about me walking around in a mall. Then I realized I was dreaming and entered some sort of ""lucid dream state"". After having some fun in the dream flying and throwing people around, I opened my eyes and had this ""The Grudge"" looking girl hoovering over me. She pinched me down to the bed and I couldn't move or scream. Then pooff, she was gone and I jumped out of the bed. 

After this experience I read about ""sleep paralysis"" so the second time it happened I knew what was going on and was able to keep calm. 

I have no problem with it occuring from time to time since it always happens  the same way. Me realizing I'm dreaming, keeping my eyes shut, feeling her hair and hearing her whisper. Sometimes she even tries to drag me out of bed, but I'm always waking up at the same place I fell asleep. Sometimes I even open my eyes and stare at her, trying to figure out what she's whispering.

LucklessLemings,"Lurker here.  If you follow the UFO conspiracy theories, MJ-12 stands for the group called Majestic 12 which took over from Project Blue Book for investigating (or rather covering up) supposed UFO phenomenon.  When I researched FM 3-36 TRADOC, I found a handy powerpoint outlining what it is.  It's a field manual outlining terms and things to consider in Electronic Warfare.  The manual is available to look at here.  http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/FM3_36.pdf  As all publicly available field manuals are, it contains very little info on how to wage Electronic Warfare, but just outlines terms and things to consider.  However, some interesting things to consider.  The powerpoint I found was written by two people simply called COL Dixon and william.darley which are microsoft usernames.  There are no links to communicate.  The powerpoint was made in 2004, edited in 2009, and looks like an intro.  Considering how this field is much newer than MJ-12 and the purpose of the powerpoint, it seems like FM 3-36 could have been written in 2004, but I'm not sure.  The version available online was released November of 2012.  So it has been in operation since at least 2004.  One interesting thing is that FM 3-36 is mostly an Army manual, although there is an entire chapter dedicated to working with different agencies and friendly nations.  I haven't found anything specifically outlining hard drive security, although you can bet if it says ""Erase and Destroy"", and it was sent to be destroyed, it's probably been erased.  Now, that doesn't mean all is lost.  Many less experienced people would simply wave a magnet over it, which is an imperfect way of wiping data.  Most likely, they would use a program which erases and writes over the disk several times, erasing it pretty well.  Still, if it has not been physically damaged there could still be a chance to recover the data.  If they were uber secure about data, they might have a program which alerts a server if it's being tampered with by anything with internet access.  So if you have someone checking it out, take out the internet card.  I'd recommend taking a look at Wikipedia, since even the existence of MJ-12 is debated.  From what I understand though, if it did exist, it closed down decades ago.  What would most likely be on there is scanned and conslidated old information.  What is strange is that it would be in a desk, meaning it was being used somehow, rather than in a storage bin or server.

boredboarder8,"I've formatted your story so it isn't such a wall of text: 
* * * 

So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind. 

I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community. The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.

 That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night. So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.


I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue. Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry. Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would-be-physician that trains at this facility. He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure. He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 

Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here. So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious. 

The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it. He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night. It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry. I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up. When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed. Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 

I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry. I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him. ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do. 

I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home. As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient. I helped Jerry back to his bed. Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK. Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar. 

I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it. I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 

I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back. I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge. In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle. In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing. The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full. 

After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise. Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?"" I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room. I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming. I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill. With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep. 

I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital. I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes. All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man. 

The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them. The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings. I'm not really sure what to make of it. In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.

As crazy as it sounds you need to tell it to go away, and I mean firmly tell it; literally yell at it and assert yourself. Entities (especially demons) sense your energy. With that being said you need your energy to read powerful to them. You're the human, you're the one alive, and you are bigger than it. Do not let it's bullshit (moaning, scratching, etc) get to you.

My family doesn't mess with spirits either and we are a Christian family. Just this year though I found I am sensitive to the spiritual realm more so than others, so yeah, I had invisible friends whose actual identities were demons... Yeah, crazy sounding.

Bu the thing with them is that if you're a Christian they have to obey you and leave when you order them to in Jesus name. Pull in some people who are more spiritually mature than you are and actually believe in this. Some don't and they are zero help.

Go to that old house you used to hide out in down by the farm. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk. In it you will find a small vial, a razor blade, and a folded piece of paper. Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.
Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.
When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house.

That's terrifying... It makes no sense.. Is there no return address? Is there any other way of contacting the REAL tiffany? Or, is there a way to contact this girl? or person?
Better yet how the hell could they possibly know where you live, your name, your friends name, AND a place you both went when you're younger? 
Maybe try researching the house, if there were any murders there, anything like that that could insist something that would need to be burned down, From the sound of it it's a ritual.. Even worse a blood ritual, usually that can infer a summoning of something.... Or last resort.. go there, but only if you're as careful as the person says, and see if theres anything on the vial, Or just take the vial and take it to the hospital or somewhere you can get it tested, find out what it is. but that's dangerous taking something from there because let's just say IF it's good reasoning behind doing what the letter says, there could be a malevolent spirit or thing there that could follow you back.. 
Or even worse (Yeah everything in this is bad or worse..) It could be a trap. Say this person does know you both very well like a stalker, and wants to harm you, kidnap you, or kill you, In a way it all depends on how close you and tiffany were in a way,

IAmRabid,"Here's what you should do:

Go to that old house you used to hide out in down by the farm. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk. In it you will find a small vial, a razor blade, and a folded piece of paper. Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.
Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.
When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house. After it starts going, the voices will go away. Then you need to get away from that house as fast as you can.",null,2,cdl0r0m,1r8n66,nosleep,top_week,3

That's terrifying... It makes no sense.. Is there no return address? Is there any other way of contacting the REAL tiffany? Or, is there a way to contact this girl? or person?
Better yet how the hell could they possibly know where you live, your name, your friends name, AND a place you both went when you're younger? 
Maybe try researching the house, if there were any murders there, anything like that that could insist something that would need to be burned down, From the sound of it it's a ritual.. Even worse a blood ritual, usually that can infer a summoning of something.... Or last resort.. go there, but only if you're as careful as the person says, and see if theres anything on the vial, Or just take the vial and take it to the hospital or somewhere you can get it tested, find out what it is. but that's dangerous taking something from there because let's just say IF it's good reasoning behind doing what the letter says, there could be a malevolent spirit or thing there that could follow you back.. 
Or even worse (Yeah everything in this is bad or worse..) It could be a trap. Say this person does know you both very well like a stalker, and wants to harm you, kidnap you, or kill you, In a way it all depends on how close you and tiffany were in a way,

While staying at my grandma's house for night I always slept in one of the bedrooms upstairs although there was an empty bedroom created for guests next to the living room downstairs. For some reason I didn't like that room because it gave me uneasy feeling - even when I was a teenager. I've spent there only one and only night but it was enough for me to experience one of the scariest and strangest nightmares I have ever had.

I was lying in the bed in the same room but it was a broad day. There was  a woman in a nice golden dress, probably my aunt, talking to me. I couldn't understand her, she was mumbling something uncomprehensible. Then, she disappeared leaving behind her DRESS levitating in the air like a ghost or something in front of a black wardrobe which my grandparents used to store their warm clothes and other clothes that they didn't want to throw away. Like it wasn't scary enough, after a while the wardrobe door opened and other few pieces of clothing- some dresses and a suit, all put on hangers, flew out of it. Those clothes hung in the air next to the golden dress and they started to perform crazy dance flying in circle fast. 

The hellish show lasted for short time but it was enough for me to wake up with heavy breathing and heart beating really fast.

It's also somewhat relates to me and the severe anxiety and depression episodes I'd suffer from, during the time I was convinced there was some sort of entity after me causing my sleep talking, sleep walking, sleep paralysis, random bruising, lethargy, and constant nightmares, whispers, footsteps and screaming. Broke up with my boyfriend at the time and it all went away. Turns out I suffered from some sort of psychosis due to the stress and the other many characteristics of a horrible relationship.

kasger,"This sounds a lot like sleep paralysis.

I've experience the first part of what you described a dozen of times.
Lying in bed, not able to move but able to watch.


When your body has been lying completely still for a period of time, your brain will start testing you to check if you're awake. Typically you'll get an itch or something similar that should make you move.
If you ignore these 'tests', your brain can get tricked into thinking you are asleep.


This is a common way to enter lucid dreaming, but from my experiences it's hard to do and always ends up pretty scary.

When your brain thinks you are sleeping, it will 'lock' your body to prevent most movement during sleep. After that, the 'dreaming' or, processing of the days experiences will start.
This is where real life and your imagination will get mixed together, all while you are awake.


From what I've read, people often hear whispers, sometimes from dead relatives in this state. I've heard someone whisper my own name once. It's also very common to hallucinate, or completely enter the dream world, which it sounds like is what happened to you.


If you can't avoid this, you can possibly learn to control and manipulate your dream, so instead of it continuing as a 'nightmare', it could be an awesome lucid dream instead. Check [/r/LucidDreaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming) for more info on that, and good luck! ",null,1,cdisx3k,1r1tik,nosleep,top_week,4
Rabbid_Rabbit87,"Assuming this is paranormal and NOT sleep paralysis, then I would say there are only two known types of entities that are physically able to touch you. Those are demons, and poltergeists. These two types go by different names in different parts of the world but they are what they are. Demons, as you probably already know, are evil and want nothing more than to make you suffer. Their intentions, of course, are not readily known. They could be causing you distress to feed off your fear and other negative emotions. They could just be after your soul. One way or another, demons haunt either because they want something FROM you, or they simply want YOU.

Poltergeists on the other hand are quite different and are more unpredictable which can make them more dangerous as we don't know enough about them to know what they want, if anything at all. Poltergeists are believed to be either non-human, non-religious (demon/angel) spirits, or they are beings from a parallel dimension. I believe it is the former.

What these entities want is unclear, but they have known to be harmless in most cases. Typically they are mischief makers that may turn lights on and off, or hide your car keys in the fridge. Some are more malevolent and could kill you by means of straight up throwing a knife in your back as you pass through the kitchen, or maybe make the banister you're leaning on, on the fourth floor balcony give way so that you fall to your demise.

Some have been said to protect and while others are said to mess with you in more diabolical ways. Such may be the case with you. This entity, whatever it is, has the power to touch you, reach into your subconscious and manipulate your dreams at will. Given the extent of it's ability I would say it's less likely to be a demon, though not impossible. I say this because it seems that with what it can already do with you, it should be able to possess you by now if that were it's goal.

But this is all speculation of course and this information is only based on personal experience, experiences of others, stories, videos etc. That being said, some form of research most be done. You need to video tape yourself at night and share your findings for feedback. Try placing a digital recorder near your bed while you sleep to hear what you may. You could even attempt an EVP session to communicate with it. I would suggest having someone else perform the EVP as it's you it is interested in. Also, don't bother with ouija boards. At this point I don't think you could bring in something worse than that but you don't wan to chance pissing it off or giving it more power either. Always remember, too much acknowledgement of the what-ever-it-is may give it more power. Just keep calm and go about your daily activities as if all is normal and go to bed with an idea of a nice dream in mind. Focus on that positive, happy dream, perhaps you can make it happen. I know I have done this and even controlled my dream as I slept. With patience and practice, so can you.

Please update as much as you can, as I am quite interested in seeing how this unfolds for you. I'll offer you as much assistance as I can. Good luck. ",null,1,cdiq0sy,1r1tik,nosleep,top_week,3
kasger,"This sounds a lot like sleep paralysis.

I've experience the first part of what you described a dozen of times.
Lying in bed, not able to move but able to watch.


When your body has been lying completely still for a period of time, your brain will start testing you to check if you're awake. Typically you'll get an itch or something similar that should make you move.
If you ignore these 'tests', your brain can get tricked into thinking you are asleep.


This is a common way to enter lucid dreaming, but from my experiences it's hard to do and always ends up pretty scary.

When your brain thinks you are sleeping, it will 'lock' your body to prevent most movement during sleep. After that, the 'dreaming' or, processing of the days experiences will start.
This is where real life and your imagination will get mixed together, all while you are awake.


From what I've read, people often hear whispers, sometimes from dead relatives in this state. I've heard someone whisper my own name once. It's also very common to hallucinate, or completely enter the dream world, which it sounds like is what happened to you.


If you can't avoid this, you can possibly learn to control and manipulate your dream, so instead of it continuing as a 'nightmare', it could be an awesome lucid dream instead. Check [/r/LucidDreaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming) for more info on that, and good luck! ",null,1,cdisx3k,1r1tik,nosleep,top_week,4
Rabbid_Rabbit87,"Assuming this is paranormal and NOT sleep paralysis, then I would say there are only two known types of entities that are physically able to touch you. Those are demons, and poltergeists. These two types go by different names in different parts of the world but they are what they are. Demons, as you probably already know, are evil and want nothing more than to make you suffer. Their intentions, of course, are not readily known. They could be causing you distress to feed off your fear and other negative emotions. They could just be after your soul. One way or another, demons haunt either because they want something FROM you, or they simply want YOU.

Poltergeists on the other hand are quite different and are more unpredictable which can make them more dangerous as we don't know enough about them to know what they want, if anything at all. Poltergeists are believed to be either non-human, non-religious (demon/angel) spirits, or they are beings from a parallel dimension. I believe it is the former.

Ouja boards and ""talking to the dead"" through mirrors are real life witchcraft and used in the occult. You didn't talk to the dead. You are talking to demons. You probably summoned one into the house. If you aren't Christian, I would recommend getting a pastor or a priest or something to drive the demon out. Really anyone can do it, provided that they are a believer. One of my teachers has either directly done this or has helped people do this. This is pretty much the textbook aftermath of occult practices. The ones who practice it, however, welcome the demons rather than fear them. 

It's really as simple as saying something such as, ""Dear Heavenly Father, Give me strength for the challenges I face, and cast all unkind, mischievous, or evil spirits from my presence. Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me. I ask these things in your name. Amen."" (Quote from /u/TreasureHouseofDoom 's post). It would really only be effective if said by a believer, though.
