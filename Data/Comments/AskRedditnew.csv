iamphiip,"South Korea smells weird when you get there. It's nothing horrible, it just smells funny for a day or so and then you get used to it. Also, I like the custom of handing stuff to people with both hands or with one hand on your other elbow if the object is too small to be handed with both hands. It shows respect and showing respect in the small things is a big message. Another thing most people hate but I actually liked was that when elevator or subway doors opened it was a free for all. If you actually just went for it like everyone else did, it was amazing how little of a hassle it was. Koreans are used to it and are really good at weaving in and out of traffic, it's the clumsy American tourists that bog everything down with their weird ""Wait for the people to get off before you get on"" custom.",null,0,cdnoz6n,1rivqi,AskReddit,new,1

The story went that he was sledding one winter and a snow plow that had failed to see him at the bottom of a hill where it dumped him in the street lopped his head clean off. Luckily his friend was able to drag his headless body to our house and my parents got him to the hospital in time to sew on a new head (presumably from a dead drifter.) He actually had legitimate scars on his neck from surgery shortly after birth that made it all the more believable.

homehealthgirl,"My mom just hired about a thousand seasonal workers so I got to hear all the funny stories. 

- Do dress nicely. It may be seasonal or a casual job but don't show up in jeans, t-shirt, or god forbid PAJAMA bottoms.

- Keep hair and make-up simple and clean. She had a girl show up with eyeshadow back to her ears, black lipstick, and purple hair that covered her face. Making your own unique look is fine, but for an interview please don't look crazy.

- Sell yourself. Don't say you don't know an answer. If you've never had a sale job but they ask you about a time you've had to convince someone of something- even if once in elementary school you sold chocolate bars, it's better than saying no.

- With the above, memorize a little info about yourself. ""my name is _____. I like to do photography on the weekends. I own two cats."" Whatever it is. It makes you more personable, and can even strike up a conversation.

- Be friendly. My mom has had lots of young people who sighed and acted like they wanted to be anywhere else. If they can't keep it together for an interview, how will they behave at work?

- Research the company. They aren't going to throw a pop quiz at you but they might ask a question about how you feel about the company, and it's always nice to hear a recent article ""Oh, I just saw Macy's is trying to implement more technology into the shopping experience.""

- Tell the truth. If you can't work Thursday nights because you take your dog to obedience school, tell them! My mom happens to like dogs, and hey, she won't need you every Thursday night. However, if you are hired under the impression that you are free Thursday nights, that's a problem.

Those are the basics off the top of my head. Oh, if for some reason you haven't heard back from a place, it's okay to call and ask why. If it's an online form sometimes it's red flagged. If there is something in the history that could cause a red flag (a conviction, criminal history, lack of car at the moment) you can always go in and ask to speak to the manager and explain yourself.

Well, do you want an honest answer? Of course you want an honest answer, let's see....The truth of the matter is, I'd like to be out on a beach somewhere, sitting in the sand, watching the waves shift and dance just like I always imagined they would, drinking Mai Tai after Mai Tai and falling asleep in a drunken stupor slumped over on a beach chair late at night. That'd be my routine. I'd be a complete waste of space. Most of my time would be spent laying in the sand or draped over the hotel bar like a wet towel, gulping down as many tropical island drinks as I could handle. Nights that weren't spent blackout drunk would be festive, surrounded by the local island people that I adored so. Fires and dancing and food as far as the eye could see in the black of night. The women would glide around the sand and tease everyone with their moves. I'd have my eye on one for quite some time, the way she danced around the fire and laughed with glee when the nightly pig roast was happening. Her singing voice would drift into my head and my ears would keep it trapped there. The ever consuming love that I had for her would build up until it reached a breaking point and I would have to confess my love for her in a passionate embrace that would affirm everything I believed in, and reaffirm that I made the right choice in leaving my previous life behind. Then one morning, I'd be awoken by shaking, a roar coming from somewhere under the Earth, followed by screams from the locals. They'd all be running towards me, racing in the direction of the icy blue water that attracts so many during the travel season. I wouldn't be able to make out the reason for their screams, but as I gained my footing and stood up, I'd understand the gravity of the situation. The volcano was erupting, much like my passion had erupted for Elise one fine, hot summer night. The fires of our love ebbed and flowed much like the liquid hot magma that was slowly treading towards us, ensuring certain death. In the chaos that enveloped everyone I would scream her name and be unable to find her. My screams would be drowned out in the echoes of many others. Mothers calling for their children, people yelling for their families, lava calling for death. People would run into the water hoping for some kind of safety, but I'd remain on the beach calling her name, unable to find her. As the lava approached, I'd turn around and look at the people floating away in the ocean, heading for...oh, uh, I think I'd make a great addition to the Footlocker team.

Be sure to have a question (any, really) when they ask if you have any questions. Ask what qualities they are looking for in a candidate that would make them successful in the position, and then you can expand upon their answer on why you fit the bill. Ask if there is anything additional you could do to better prepare yourself for the position (sometimes not applicable). Find a couple of good questions in case they are inadvertently answered in the body of your interview. It's also okay to write these down in a notebook/portfolio you bring with you (that should have a few extra resumes, pen, paper in it), it shows that you prepared for the interview.

You'd think this would go without saying, but after having interviewed many people, I can tell you that it does not: don't say something that is *actually* bad, like that you're an alcoholic or that you can't accept criticism. Some examples of acceptable things: you could say that sometimes you get stressed out by things going wrong with a project because you're a perfectionist. You could also use this time to address a concern you know they probably have, such as a deficiency in one skill that they requested. In this case you could say something like ""well, with regard to this particular position, my one weakness might be that I don't yet know how to use the blahblah software. But since I've used x, y, and z similar tools in the past and since I'm a quick learner, I'm confident that I can remedy this situation quickly.""

Also: don't ever be the one to bring up salary. When it's time to discuss salary, they will start.

For engineering jobs: be as prepared as possible for the technical interview. If at all possible, look around online or talk to others who work/have interviewed there, and find out a bit about the types of things that will be asked.

terbbitab,"I recently got a job after searching for over a year, so here's what I did differently from the other times when I didn't get the job:

1. I researched the fuck out of the company. I was asked during the interview if I knew what the company did, and I explained it to them the best way I could. The woman interviewing me was so impressed, she said I was the first who could actually answer the question.

2. I practiced the interview. I practiced a lot. I practiced every question they could potentially ask and I practiced in front of the mirror. I find that this really helps and it makes you aware of what gestures you make while talking.

3. Use key words used in the job ad during the interview. You don't have to use the same words, but you need to cater all your answers to what they are looking for.

That's all I can come up with at the moment.",null,0,cdo4dy7,1riuda,AskReddit,new,1

I didn't request a stop, the bus driver blew right past my apartment, and I ended up going full circle back to campus. This was all during rush hour traffic, and it was raining so traffic was even worse than usual. The constant, jerky stop-and-go of the bus had me urgently nauseous for the entire hour round trip. By the time we got back to campus I was really grouchy and just stormed off the bus. The obvious thing to do was to just ride the bus around again and request a stop this time, but I was really queasy and really irritated, so I called a friend and they gave me a ride home in their car.

I could either have my neck snapped and die right then and there or I could choose to play a lottery and I would have a 10% chance of survival. If I lost the lottery I would be tortured. 

So in the dream I chose to have my neck snapped. My head was forcibly turned very slowly until it was  nearly backward when I felt my spine snap. All of the sudden I was standing outside of the chamber I was just in. I looked around and there were about ten other chambers in this room that looked like a typical serial killer's basement. My neck was very stiff but I could move and walk around. I knew I was dead but for some reason I was indifferent about it. I didn't really care. A few seconds later a girl came to me from behind and I recognized her as a girl I go to college with named Emily. She told me that she had chosen the same fate as I had and made it clear to me that I was in fact dead. 

I walked out of the house with no problem and the world seemed normal. I could touch and pick things up but it didn't seem to affect the people that were still alive. I picked up a person's plate at a restaurant and dropped it on the floor but it had no affect on the person. That is all I really remember but it was very strange and the dream seemed to last days.

He emerged from the trap door, and walked back up to the cockpit, still looking worried.  The captain came on the loudspeaker and said that there is a problem, but they think it is a false warning light.  We are going to attempt a landing.

At this point, the fellow in the seat next to me vomited.  

We started down toward the runway and approached the airport.  As we touched down, dozens of firetrucks were racing down the runway along with us.

The pilot pulled up and left really hard. The guy behind me started screaming that we are all going to die.

It was 2 weeks before I thought to tell my family about it.",null,0,cdnp4q7,1riu8b,AskReddit,new,1
flgcanyoneer,"It's a toss-up between flying PHX to OAK on Southwest and realizing the plane I was supposed to get on had just landed on fire (didn't see the plane but saw the crash trucks). I guess the crew of that flight had to stay and fill out reports so we had a new plane but no flight crew. Long story short we took off 2 hours after we were scheduled to land in Oakland. They didn't give us any travel incentives but gave us free drinks which wasn't bad.

The other one was Toronto to PHX via IAH on United. We were on a small regional jet for the first leg. Two seats on one side of the row, one on the other side. I ended up sitting next to this really cute girl (I'd actually noticed her when we went through customs, and somehow she just happened to get the seat next to me) that was absolutely terrified of flying and was freaking out because she was going from Toronto to somewhere in Central America. Things go completely normally until we're about an hour or so out of IAH. The flight attendant comes on the loudspeaker and tells everyone to return to their seats immediately and that we would be diverting to the closest airport to land. We go into a very steep dive (out of the ordinary for sure but nothing too alarming) and the girl beside me is holding on to my arm talking about how we were all going to die. It was a really bumpy ride but in a very short time we were on the ground in Tulsa. Turns out that there was a huge storm that had just gone through the Houston area complete with tornadoes and everything and it was now between us and where we needed to go and we didn't have enough fuel to divert around it. We fueled up (for some reason we were actually allowed to get off the plane and stand around on the tarmac while this was happening) and made it to IAH without anything else too notable. When I was waiting for my connecting flight to PHX (6 hours late due to everything being diverted due to weather) a 3' x 3' piece of the ceiling over where I was sitting came down and hit me square in the head. This was right in front of the gate agent who saw the whole thing and chose to ignore it, didn't even ask if I was okay (I was). Eventually I got home safe and the silver lining of the whole thing is I got the girl's number and I'm still in contact with her.

TL;DR: 1. The plane I was supposed to get on caught fire when it landed. 2. Big storm, low fuel, steep dive, airport tried to kill me",null,0,cdnvi7j,1riu8b,AskReddit,new,1

imanimalent,"I say yes, as long as you consider the knowledge limitations of those who wrote the bible verses.

Religious people tend to limit their imagination to the world they live in.  For instance, the phrase “God created man in his own image”.   Religious persons seem to think that this means God “looks like” man, since God created man “in his (assumes a gender) own image”.  I believe the image being referred to is the Spirited image – the Soul, or human condition, rather than the physical appearance.

Time is understood by the writers and they wouldn’t have the slightest idea what a million years would be.  So 500 million years or a day could be the same for these writers of the script – a misunderstanding of the writers, not the God.  Either way, the universe and planet, the water, light, animals and man were all created and, eventually everything evolved as was intended, as was the plan, in the beginning.

Intelligent design can work for both.  Does that work for you?

Skookum5,"As a devout Christian, I can honestly say yes they are compatible. You have to think about the time the people lived in. They wouldn't understand the whole scientific lingo of evolution so it had to be explained in simpler terms so people could understand (ex: if you tried to tell people back then that humans shared a common ancestor with apes they wouldn't understand because they wouldn't know what a common ancestor or an ape was. In the bible it says everything came from the earth, in evolution everything comes from the earth). I think that God set up the whole evolution process like a computer program and let it run. He chose different mutations to pop up, certain good ones and certain bad ones. I think that he wasn't aware of if or when they'd pop up but he saw all the infinite possibilities if they popped up for a certain species at a certain time ( ex: he would see how one trait would affect this generation and the next and the next and how one trait popping up could lead to new species and stuff like that).

montyborden,"Worst Specific date

I have like 3 corner stores I go to, and I'm a friendly guy.  I'm only in the double digits, but the pretty ones still make me rather shy.

There was a specific girl working at a gas station up the street I'd ran into while finishing up an associates at a local college I'd seen in halls a few times and then saw working at the gas station I frequented, so one day I said fuck it' and just asked her out. 

She had thick black rim glasses, kept it light on the jewelry, no visible tattoos, always very smiley and chatty when I'd came in.  Seemed like a cute/interesting enough girl to get to know and go on a date with.  

When she'd given me her number and agreed to go on a date later in the week I thought it would be a good time.  Maybe go catch a band at a dive bar, or get some dinner. Something light and casual. I was only 19, my crazy half Japanese on again off again superwhore ""Oh Monty you're the only one who understands me, but you're the guy on the side and I spend every friday night fucking you and sleeping over so you're unaware of it"" girlfriend and I had been in an off period (she's my worst over all dating experience) and this girl seemed like maybe she was the kind of girl I could be content dating long enough to finally get away from the toxic relationship I'd spend the next 3 years in and out of.

She had sold me rolling papers and Arizona iced tea at 2am on more than one occasion.  I guess I just always assume people make assumptions based on the characteristics and habits they observe as I do.  I was wrong.

Anyways, she pulls in the driveway, I go outside, I say hop in the jeep. She says she'd prefer we take her car, she wants to drive.  Okay, fine, works for me.  I'll save the gas money of driving us around town and just pay for dinner I thought to myself.

I got into her car and immediately noticed the Bible on the dashboard and the rosary hanging from the rear view mirror.  Terror began to set in.  Not because I have a big problem with religion, or I'm one of those ankle biting atheists that has to mock anybody who believes in god.  Most likely just because I was brought up given the option of going to church or being lashed on Sundays. I don't -like- having a knee-jerk reaction to religious matters, I'd just been hard wired that way.

I didn't immediately chalk it up to a loss, I'd met some rather interesting ""new wave"" christian girls who loved to ""smoke weed ery day"" and two amazingly attractive girls who felt getting high brought them closer to understanding jesus and strengthening their connection to god.  

This girl was not one of those cases.

I buckle up, she buckles up, and onward into the adventure of night!

First stop, subway! She has some friends working at a subway a town over, and really wants a sandwich.  I offer to pay for a meal somewhere nicer, but she really wants to visit her friends at the sandwich shop.  Not wanting to be a stick in the mud, I go along with it.

We're driving around, she starts talking about her bible studies and volunteer work at a local homeless shelter, and what a big part of her life god is, and how I should come to church with her sometime.  I play it all off very passive and polite.  

We get to subway, she orders a sandwich, offers to hook me up with a free sandwich, I decline, we sit outside, she woofs down her sub, I have a marb, she says she has to pee, walks over to an underpass and pisses under a bridge.  

I thought that was a little odd, being that the subway we'd just gotten a sandwich from was right behind us, but whatever.  People are entitled to their idiosyncrasies, and who doesn't like peeing outside?

She says she forgot something at home, her house is right around the corner, and asks if I'd mind if we stopped by her house so she could grab something.  Sure, why not! 

We get to her house, her parents are home, she really wants me to come in and meet her folks, I thought it was really strange it was our first ""date"" and she felt the need to introduce me to her parents, not even 2 hours into the date.  Fucking awkward. 

As if Jesus and her folks weren't enough to make my dick furl up into my chest and flat line, surprise surprise, she was going into her house to grab 12 or so odd boxes of cookies she'd baked for all the police stations within a 15 mile radius of her house.

Jesus freaks me out, but jesus doesn't tailgate you on a 30mph road at 11pm until you speed up to 35 or pull over and let him pass and then give you a ticket for speeding or search you for ""suspicious behavior"" the way police do in this area of New York (we have speeding ticket quotas, I've had a police officer attempt to give me a speeding ticket, say sorry we have quotas to meet and I'm on an a deadline, and then cancel said ticket because his car printer wasn't working) 

So as it turned out, when she was about 16, she was ""smoking the reefer"" with some ""Very bad people"" and she ran away from home and stayed with them for a week, and if she hadn't called the police on them and been ""rescued"" her life would be very different, she wouldn't have found Jesus, and she'd be a mess of a person.  So around the anniversary of her ""rescue"" she liked to go around to all the local police stations and give them boxes of cookies she baked and iced herself. 

I really didn't know how to react.  I had another cigarette in her driveway, we hopped into her car, and started going to a bunch of local police stations, then even drove out to a Buffalo police station.  She had me go in with her to each one.  Repeatedly going ""into the hive"" making my asshole pucker with each and every step.  Some of the police officers appreciated the gesture and took the cookies, other cops at different stations said they'd love to accept the cookies, but it's post 9/11, and they really shouldn't be accepting that sort of thing/it isn't safe/they could be poisoned ect..

It was a pretty terrible date.

To end the evening, she took me to a University about 40 minutes away with a little man made lake/pond and some stone pedestals that was all lit up at night and we just climbed around and she leaned up against me and started talking about her life, thinking I'm quiet and interesting, and how we should get involved.  

She was cute, but I could tell there was far too much crazy behind those glasses for me to seriously get involved.  I told her I think we should just be friends for now, she seemed annoyed, we spoke some more, she took me home, and we never went out again.

I avoided the gas station for 2 weeks, went back in, and the night shift manager (An overly chatty flamboyant male clerk who freaked most of my friends out but I've never had a problem with) told me a few days prior she took a bunch of cash out of the register and quit showing up.  She deleted her facebook and I never heard from her again.

TLDR I went on a date with a crazy bible-nut who tried to get me to embrace jesus, ""turn my life around"" spend more time hanging around police /police stations, and probably would have murdered me in my sleep when I'd broken up with her. ",null,0,cdnpq2l,1riu3a,AskReddit,new,2

Tricks &amp; Treats

As what little life she had left slowly began to fade away, she began to see flashes of her life speed through her eyes: her first steps, her first kiss, her first time. It was as vivid as any reality she had ever seen before. And with each scene that passed, so did her remaining moments alive. All the while, he continues to gain vitality, as if her soul is being bestowed upon him with each kiss…
Halloween: the only time the dead come to play with the living. Like any typical college, there was a campus-wide costume party. All the girls coming out in their most alluring disguises; the guys trying not to look like complete idiots. But one thing is certain: on Halloween night, anything is possible.
She chose to wear her old Catholic high school uniform, knowing that it would be too small to fit. The skirt was low enough to fit right below her inner thighs, the cup of her rear slightly showing from the back. Her shirt was halfway buttoned and tied tightly around her chest, almost squeezing her breasts out of them. She let her tie let loose just enough so that the know would be right above the break of her cleavage. Her glasses were a perfect complement to her outfit, giving her the costume she knew guys would drool over. She slowly slipped her see-thru stockings onto her silky smooth legs, slid her tiny feet into her black high heels, and left into the night.
The moon was full, the brisk autumn wind breezing up her thighs as she walked to the party. She hoped not to she her ex tonight, wanting to forget about the recent breakup. As she walked, she endured numerous advances, none of which she replied to. All she wanted to do was focus on having a good time. 
The entire campus was at the costume party, even people from other schools came down to join the fun. A majority of the people were drunk, a couple of beer pong tables, a tall hookah, some beer kegs scattered around. Immediately, she went to find some familiar faces. Once she spotted her friends sitting on the couch, the game was on.
As the night progressed, she became more and more intoxicated, each shot making her more and more adventurous. She proceeded to reject every guy that came to talk to her, none of them being good enough to break down her defenses… Until he walked through the door.
He wore an all black suit, the fabric sculpted around his physique. His crimson tie was the only thing that made him stand out amongst the crowd, as if it were a small target upon his chest. While he seemed to glide across the floor towards her, she couldn’t help but be entranced by his deep, dark eyes. It was as if he was placing as spell on her without her knowledge.
The conversation seemed to last an eternity. With every word spoken she fell deeper and deeper into his hypotonic enchantment. The harder she tried to pull away from him, the easier it became for him to trap her. As soon as she said, “Yes”, to the question of going home with him, he knew that she would soon succumb to his will.
He couldn’t help himself from occasionally touching her as they walked back to his place, but she didn’t stop him either. Truth is, she hadn’t been touched in a while. The caressing of her hand, the grabbing of her partially revealed ass, the cool air from his breath as he whispered into her ear; every touch became more tantalizing than the next. She craved for the moment that this brief moment of teasing escalates into something more sensual, yet she feared not knowing what is to come with this man.
As the door closed behind them, her lips unexpectedly landed on his, her carnal instincts now controlling her every action. He easily guided her across room onto his bed while passionately kissing her soft lips. She could feel herself getting wetter and wetter as his hand caressed up and down her thigh. He used his other hand to undo the knot in her shirt, her perky breasts screaming for attention. Although his hands felt cold, she enjoyed the tingling sensation they gave her with each touch.
With every tender kiss that impacted her celestial body, her mind slowly began to submit unto his control. His tongue carefully left a slight trail on her body, starting from her delicate neck on down. When he got down to her breasts, he gave them the attention they had been crying for, sucking on each one, gently flicking his tongue against her sensitive nipples. Meanwhile, his icy hand continued to slide up and down her inner thigh, her juices seeping down them. She could feel her body betraying her, allowing him closer and closer to her, and yet at the same time she secretly embraced this erotic act of passion between the two.
She slightly nudges his head towards her hips, coveting his touch upon her now soaking, throbbing pussy. He looks up at her and slyly winks at her, as if to let her know to be patient. He takes the sides of her skirt and casually glides them off of her onto the floor. He precisely places each kiss on the inside of each of her thighs, tasting her succulent juices on his tongue. But, he’s careful not to move too fast, grazing over everywhere but her dripping lips. As hard as her mind tries to resist his temptations, her body remained submissive.
The first touch upon her lips sent chills up her spine. She let out a brief moan, then tried to catch herself as if the sound was a mistake. He knew that it wouldn’t be long before she fully surrendered herself to him. With each stroke of his tongue against her moist lips, she tried to keep herself from letting her lustful melody from escaping. He started off slow, his tongue drifting up and down, with careful attention not to simulate her pulsing clit. As he gradually picked up speed, her back began to arch forward, her hips pressing themselves against his mouth. She desired every touch that was arranged on her body, each one like a piece of poetry being placed together. But, it was the image of him looking at her that sent her over, his eyes still as memorizing as when they met. Her mind was finally starting to let go as her body began to tremble from the intense sensation coursing through her, her savory juices cascading with each motion.
It would not be long before her mind would soon follow the same path as her body. She knew that she could refuse him no longer, that she was under his command. But there was still a small part of her that stayed defiant. He kissed up her body, pausing right before her lips. As the two stared at each other, he could see the look on her face. She could not hide the pleasure in her eyes, the feeling of pure bliss washed over her. As he proceeded to ask her if she was ready, she hesitated. Her body was willing but her mind was still resistant. But she agreed, she was ready, her life was set, the kiss of death placed upon her lips.
As his thick shaft began to penetrate her, she let out a loud moan that echoed through the room. It was as cold as his hands were, giving her a strange, yet captivating sensation. With each stroke, she became louder and louder, her mind still fighting against his will. The two were immediately in sync, as if the two had been destined to meet each other. Her pussy began to constrict around his cock as his strokes went deeper and deeper inside of her. He grabbed her body and threw her on top of him, to which her body saw as the switch to her sensual instincts. She became like a wild animal, screaming in ecstasy as her body rode up and down. Her hips gradually picked up speed as they grinded into his. She was approaching the point of no return, her mind moments away from breaking. As she about to reach climax, he lifted himself up towards her, whispering one word into her ear, “Submit.”
The two became intertwined with each other, body and soul merging with one another. She cried in pure euphoria as his shaft pulsated inside of her, her walls gripping him like a snake. Her body had long been his, but her mind was now gone to her. Her life began to fade away, as he had now taken the essence away from her. His body became warmer, his life restored to him. She knew that her time had come, yet she was ready for the end. As she saw him walking out of the room, with her last moments alive declining, all she could remember was his one word, “Submit”....",null,1,cdnqr5h,1riu2f,AskReddit,new,2

Dark_messengeR,"1.) Because as a society, we want to produce more achievers, we don't normally settle for mediocrity. Yes there are some who would be an exception to the rule but then again, those are normally just a few.


2.) We want our kids to be prepared in real life before we release them from our grasp. It may already be a cliche that education is the best gift our parents can give us, but it's true.


3.) We want our kids to have the freedom to choose when they grow up. Yes, we may be taking out their freedom NOT to go to school but then again, we have to see the bigger picture. I for one didn't go to college even after my parents insisted. Had the balls to tell them that I can make it on my own. 10 years had passed and I'm still working as a customer care rep. with a very low paying salary. I can't go back to school even if I wanted to since my parents can't afford to send me anymore, and I can't afford to send myself either so basically I'm stuck in with this life that I chose. No one wants to hire me even though I'm capable because as soon as they check my resume and sees that I don't have a diploma, I'm automatically disqualified. Same thing goes when applying for a promotion. 

Saddest part is that now, I don't even care about getting a diploma. I just want to go back to school and LEARN. Learn as much as I can but I can't anymore. 

You still have a choice, and as choices go, you should always pick the best one. The one that would pay off in the long run. You always have to see the bigger picture.

guyintheuk,"UK: 

We are currently seeing one of our biggest problems looming large Reddit - The war on the internet by our Prime Minister (David Cameron).

Of course, there is the ever present problem of the leaders of our country still not realising we are not an imperial power.

Our relationship with the rest of Europe is an ongoing argument with a split between a very vociferous group that wants to pull up the drawbridge and the others that see a real benefit in good working relationships with our neighbours. 

The National Health Service is always a matter of angst but, despite a few very high profile issues, it works very well in the main despite poor funding. Despite it's occasional problems, you would have to go a very long way before you found any significant number of people that would prefer to be without it.

Immigration is always of disagreement. Those that feel a complete block on immigration will solve all the UK's woes and those who don't.

Like fucking global scale. Nukes are launched in a desperate attempt to try and contain the outbreak.  99.9% of society is wiped out.

Some idiots might try and form some kind of society, it eventually falls apart. Mostly because people are stupid, others are lazy and the ones in charge feel they're in charge and don't have to do the grunt work. Of course there's some guy who thinks that he's Rambo incarnated. Run from him as fast as you possibly can. He's only going to get you killed.

Zombies eventually become hordes of zombies. Flock like in behavior they march through the wastes of land, eating survivors that are left. One or two stragglers remain. Now more prey than hunter they stick to small groups. Ones and twos. Five being the largest.

Guns? Pfft. Guns require regular maintenance. Bullets are finite, so are replacement parts. Sure somebody might be able to McGuyver some sort of shooting mechanism together but in order for it to be useful it would require parts that are readily available on the fly. You're on the move avoiding hordes of zombies. You don't have time to rifle a barrel or mill a stock.

Bow and Arrow? Bows break eventually. Arrows are finite. You're constantly on the move. No time to make a new anything. 

Some kind of Zombie Apocalypse Super Building? Maybe, but you're going to need food and water. Fresh water and a constant supply at that. You maybe able to make some kind of farming community but you still need water. Those hordes of zombies? The dead that aren't the living dead are rotting in water supplies just as much as anywhere else. Plus you're living like its the 1700s. No phone, no lights, no motor car, Not a single luxury Like Robinson Crusoe, It's primitive as can be

Now if humans are lucky. And I mean really fucking lucky. The virus eventually starts to kill the zombies off because of lack of a food source. Society starts to reform. But this will take years, decades or centuries even. Humans are dying constantly because no one remembers how to make penicillin, how to set a broken leg. Fuck they probably never even learned how. Again going with getting some fucking luck, somebody might have been Boy Scout or has a Boy Scout Handbook lying around. But do you think any of them actually practiced what's in there? Fuck that.

On one of my upswings, the head came detached from the wooden handle sending it straight up into the air.  I now had an ~8 lb. metal block hurling probably 20 feet straight up in the air from where I was standing.  I was in panic mode, and the next five seconds felt like at least 30. 

At first all I did was take one step backwards thinking that it had probably been propelled straight up. Then the Laws of Physics started to talk inside my mind (not a joke).  I thought about exactly where I had felt the head come off, and ""an object in motion tends to stay in motion..."" I thought for a second that if I had been swinging the sledge hammer backwards that the head would arc backwards.  So I took a few steps forward, and looked back and the hammer head landed exactly where I had been standing.

In 9th Grade we had this older math teacher who was completely losing it in the brain department. Like coming into class crying about how she could hear her dead father-in-law's heart beating under pillow and completely misplacing assignments and then giving us all zeros when she couldn't find them. We hated her. And as any class of freshman would do, we made it our job to try and break her. Every class period was filled with attempts to make her snap and rather childish attempts of total anarchy. That is until our greatest accomplishment,

One of the kids in class went out and bought an entire display box of pop rocks and stood in front of the door, distributing a packet to each student as they entered. This teacher was always late so by the time she came into the classroom we were all sitting down with our pop rocks open and ready. She turned to get her materials set and everyone took a shot of candy, and opened our mouths. The noise was similar to a static on the radio. 23 mouthfuls of candy, gloriously united. She turned. Everyone closed their mouths. Silence. A nervous chuckle and our math teacher turned to the board. Repeat candy symphony. Turns and silence. This continued for a good ten minutes each time our teacher becoming more and more distressed. The last time we did it, she turned and screamed at us ""DO YOU HEAR IT?!!"". One kid swallowed his mouthful and replied nope just as a pop rock snapped in his throat. She snapped and started crying and ran out of the room. We took the rest of the class as victory time until another math teacher came into the room to see that we were looked after until class ended. Our class was disbanded after that, every student spread out between the other classes and entire schedules were changed to prevent our group of students from ever being in the same class again. We were legends for a good month and I have never been more proud of myself ever again.

SanDiegoSuperCharger,"I am a huge San Diego Charger football fan. 

I grew up watching football with my Dad. It was our thing. I still call my Dad all the time for fantasy football advice. My whole family loves football (well my sister pretends.) 

I've grown up with this team. I've seen them have great seasons and break records, and terrible seasons.When they win, I am excited, when they lose, I am sad. 

Sundays are my favorite day of the week, because I get to watch football all day, even if I'm having a shitty week, I have something to look forward too. 

I guess it's been important to me because it's something I've always watched with my family. Now I watch it every sunday with my boyfriend. We sit at home, drink beer and cheer our hearts out. ",null,0,cdnoasy,1rit06,AskReddit,new,1
sugarfish7,"I used to not be interested in football growing up. My dad enjoyed baseball, but by and large my parents were (still are) NASCAR freaks. Sundays were reserved for races, fried food, and naps. (And beer, once us kids were older.)  

Originally I only used to be interested in the Super Bowl because of the commercials, the get-togetherness, and the food. Unfortunately, I had NO idea what was going on during football other than touchdowns were good, field goals were acceptable, and tackles were bad.  

I met and started dating a man who not only was a die hard football fan, but he was born and raised in a football loving household, *and* his mind was a steel trap for random facts about the sport.  I started asking him questions, he started teaching me about football.  And not just things like what downs were, and how many points a touchdown was worth. The more I learned, the more nitty gritty we got into.  Six years into our relationship, if there's a flag on a return, he guesses that it might be false start and I enjoy correcting him that it's actually a blocking in the back.  

For me, it's nice having a team to cheer for. As a straight female, it's extremely nice to see athletic men in tight pants. But as someone who enjoys details and understanding exactly what's going on and is able to appreciate a well-executed play when I see one, it's really fun to watch.  

Plus, I totally like being able to call plays before they happen, and then they happen, and then the announcers say almost word-for-word what I said.

A penis is warm and quicker to relax with and it's certainly more interesting when the guy starts hitting the right notes.

A person opens up to new positions and techniques as well as offering both a loving and/or primal nature to sex. Dildos just don't cut it for me and it's mainly because of the lack of intimacy.

Stringmaster94,"Every thanksgiving their is this woman who shows up to eat with our family. (It's a huge family) She is a family friend of my Aunt and always brings her kids. Well she got divorced a few months before hand and as a result she reverted back to before she got married and turned into a slut.

Back up a few month's to the day of my High School Graduation. After we graduated we went out and naturally got drunk as shit. Well this was about two months after her divorce at this point. She showed up to the graduation party of someone that I knew. Apparently she knew my buddy's mom. Well EVERYBODY was drinking. I saw her and I recognized her but I don't think that she knew who I was. (even though she had seen me at thanksgiving diner ever since I was a kid)

Well...we were drinking and I was dancing with her. She was VERY drunk and was coming on to me really hard. She was like 40 but she was a bonified MILF. One thing led to another and I ended up having sex with her. We weren't exactly subtle about it either. I pretty much carried her up the stairs in front of the whole party, up to my buddies room. So needless to say, word got around.

Now cut to Thanksgiving. She got back with her husband and then she showed up the dinner (apparently she had forgotten that I was her friends nephew) She comes in with her kids and her husband. The look on her face when she saw me was one of utter disbelief. The entire time her husband was giving me the evil eye. It was obvious that he wanted to fucking kill me.

The most awkward part was when her kid came up and started talking to me. As soon as he did the father was like ""were leaving"" and basically dragged everyone out of the house. Everyone was just sitting their in complete silence. It was obvious that some of my family knew about it too. Thankfully nobody said anything. It was terrible to say the least.

When an actor makes an honest mistake on camera, and we're not live to tape or live to air, it can be hilarious. Flubbed lines, the wrong expression, corpsing... it's all good.

However, intentional mistakes, or repeated mistakes, start to wear thin, especially if it's a simple line or action. And if it's the last shot of the day it's also a lot more annoying than at the beginning.

It was clear that this guy (who is among the most respected actors in history) couldn't remember any of his lines and could barely function any more.

Usually the actors are being ushered from the trailer to the set, back and forth all day. They are maybe on set for a maximum of 4 hours all day, when a usual day on set could be anywhere from 12 hours to 18. 

So from my experience, you set up a scene in your respective department, sometimes it takes forever, depending on the magnitude of the shot. Then, finally, when everything is in place, the 3rd Assistant Director will go get the actors from their trailers (where they have been sleeping, reading, playing video games), drag them to set, get them in place, we run through it a couple of times before we roll, and then when they just start fucking around, oh man I could commit murder. 

At this point I've probably been out in the rain for at least 10 hours, clothes are soaked through, my limbs are in the process of freezing off, and here they are all cheerful and shit, and you start getting in to the scene and they just constantly are fucking the shit up, over and over, because once you get the giggles you just can't stop, right?

Also, it can be really stressful if the director is not in a good mood and starts getting pissy about it.

Bloopers usually happen on our show because the cast is giving new lines for a joke that didn't get a big enough laugh. 

One thing about the bloopers I don't think people/audience think about is that this is the actors job. To know the lines and how to deliver it, if the cast member keeps flubbing the lines, I know it puts stress on them, because they know they can be fired or recast. It's still a job. There's even a part in the blooper reel where a cast member says ""please don't fire me."" It always gets a laugh from the audience but it's half true.

There's even been guest stars that don't get the lines quite right, and they are either recast before shooting or we reshoot the scene with the another actor. ",null,0,cdnz5s2,1ris3f,AskReddit,new,2

nidex,"I've destroyed numerous, numerous [expensive] cell phones. My cell phone, girlfriends cell phones, that for some reason was my go-to smash item. When I was 16 or 17 I kicked the tail lights out of my (at the time) girlfriend's Mustang. Honestly, lots of the times I've destroyed property I was in such a rage that I don't remember half of the things I did. Of course, there's also the cliche punch-a-hole-in-the-drywall, but I always fixed the drywall myself so it was never really expensive.





These all happened when I was younger (about age 16-21), and 9/10 times during fights with girlfriends. When I was 20, I caught a DV case for pushing my at-the-time girlfriend to the ground and smashing her phone. This all happened in the apartment complex parking lot, so obviously several people called the cops (including myself). In my defense, she had punched me about 3 or 4 times before I laid hands on her and I had the bloody nose/bruises to prove it. Of course since I'm the male though I was the one who went to jail.






I'm glad it happened though, because I had to take DV and anger management classes. These forced me to take a look at myself, and the ""cycle of violence"" as it's called, and opened my eyes to the fact that I was abusive. Which, after digging deeper, stemmed from seeing abuse as a child.




So because of all that, I became responsible for and conscious of my actions, and am now able to stop and analyze a situation before it turns into physical (and emotional) abuse/violence. It helped me a lot.

malik753,"A router.

I live in Charleston where we have shitty internet in general. We had comcast at the time, and besides being a great bag of dicks for a company, they also let our signal get pretty bad periodically. 

I had a router that I had flashed with some special firmware. I've always been the ""tech guy"" ever since I could hook a VCR to a TV, so maintaining our home network naturally became my responsibility. And whenever we had crappy internet, I would hear about it. So I'd have to climb over a pile of crap (we lived in a small apartment and my mom has some semi-serious hording tendencies) to reset the modem and router. 

From the moment I replaced our old G router with my shiny new special-firmwared N router, my mom became especially annoyed and mistrustful of it. In retrospect, I could have just not mentioned it, and it would have been business as usual. Mom couldn't tell the modem from the router from the cable box. But I gave her something to blame.

It was set to give her computer first priority, mine second, and everything else third priority. I experienced no problems when I was using either mine or hers that couldn't be attributed to comcast. But all I ever heard was, ""Your router is broken again"" or ""Can't you bring the old one back?""

So I had a tough day, (I think I was working two jobs at the time) and the first thing I hear coming in the door is ""Your router is screwing up my internet."" So I calmly climb over stack of boxes and disconnect the router. ""This router?"" I say, just before I slam it on the coffee table and tear it to pieces. ""There, it won't bother you anymore."" 

I wish I still had it. It was cheap, but a nice little device. But at least I got my point across, because I got hassled about the internet much less after that.",null,0,cdnpe2b,1rirmm,AskReddit,new,1

By the time we've gotten to hospital (10 minutes or so - I work in a city) she's already finished a can the size of my leg and the tubing is frosted from the amount of compressed gas she's puffed through.

Take her into hospital, hand over and get her into a bed. I ask the nurse where they keep their own Entonox so we can take ours away. 

Apparently obstetric and gyne patients aren't allowed Entonox according to this hospitals policy. I know she'll be waiting a while for more potent analgesics to be administered and it really made me angry. The patient's husband said he has been kicked out before as she was waiting at least 4 hours for pain relief and they wouldn't give her Entonox and he flipped out.

I don't know why it bothered me so much but to my mind it was criminal not to begin relieving her pain and it put me in an awful mood for the rest of my shift. 

Is there some reason Entonox shouldn't be given to obs/gyne patients?

VolkStroker,"I dunno about procedure, but as far as shitty policy... I used to bank at a local place in southwest Missouri called Liberty Bank, and they had an account overdraft policy that was pretty shitty. They charged like $35 outright for any overdraft plus $5 per DAY that it was overcharged. At the time I had lost my job and was totally broke. I had a few bucks left in my account and wanted to buy some food, and accidentally overestimated how much I had left.

I overdrew 14 cents. FOURTEEN CENTS. I got a letter in the mail a few days later saying that my account had been overdrawn by 14 cents, and that I was thereby charged with a $35 fee. This by itself I thought was a bit much, so I called them. I explained that it was only 14 cents, and wondered if I could get the fee waived if I came in and paid up the account. They said no. This was annoying enough, but remember I wasn't employed anymore, was TOTALLY broke, and they charge $5 per DAY that the account is overdrafted.

I told the lady (and eventually her supervisor) that I had no income, and that it was literally impossible for me to keep caught up on the $5 daily fees, and that I would therefore never be able to pay up the account, because fees piled up faster than I could make any money.

I promised I would get the account paid up, but asked that they close it, or freeze it, or do ANYTHING with it so I could pay off the $50 or so I had already accrued without being in a never-ending hole of daily fees. They refused. They said until I paid the account up, I couldn't even close it or hold it in any way. I reminded them it was 14 goddamn cents. They didn't care.

It was months before I found a job, and by that time, the account had built to approximately -$200, and then I received a letter in the mail saying the account had been closed due to an excessive overdraft, and that my negligence has been marked against my credit.

I think it was dumb that they had to change it.  When I 1st started working there if your tv was turned off, you could get it turned back on as soon as you paid part of your bill.  You could pay as little as $5.00, you just had to make a payment.  This was not a case of, ""I lost the bill"" or ""I forgot when it was due"" or even, ""money was a little tight last month"".  I personally took calls where customers owed $400.00 and upwards on their bills and were only paying, maybe, $10 toward the bill every month.  And they only did that to get their service switched back on.  About 1/2 way thru my tenure, the policy was changed.  To get your service restored, you had to pay all of the bill.  Naturally, this did not make many people happy.  Policy also dictated that we had to ""help"" our customers by ""assisting"" them to find the right package to fit their budgets.  Every one wanted to keep the most expensive package and pay the least amount of money.

The assessors took the maximum 10 days out of the 30. My form was a day late. My learners license was suspended due to this. I must have a learners for a full year before I can attempt the test to get my full license.

I've been back to Paris, and all around France, probably 8 times in the past 5 years. I speak very rudimentary/elementary level French but I study up before I go each time and those years of HS French have come back to me.

Each time I go back, I'm surprised by how kind people are. A gentleman boarding the Chunnel train with me ordered his son in French, to apologize to me, *in English* for flinging himself in my way as we were waiting to board. The little boy walked up to me, dropped his head, and in perfect English said, ""I'm sorry"" before running off. I'm sure the man had no idea I could understand what he was telling his son.

A woman at the gelato shop on Ile-de-la-Cite in Paris asked us about our trip, and when we said we were leaving the next day and that this was our final treat on the streets of Paris before flying out, she refused to let us pay. I still vividly remember her leaning over the counter out the window waving and yelling, ""Bon Voyage!"" as we walked away.

There was a couple in Provence, who upon seeing that my husband and I were waiting for a cab for a long time, insisted on taking us back into town in their car. The wife practiced her English on me while I practiced my French on her.

In Montmartre, I was looking for an ATM. After looking up the proper phrase, I tentatively asked a very nice looking man, *""Excusez-moi? Ou est un teller automatique?""* He looked at me and said, *""Parlez-vous Francais?""* I responded, *""Oui, mais un peu. Je parle Anglais.""* He laughed, threw his arm over my shoulder and said in English, ""Let's do it this way, we will save so much time!""

Once at dinner, I asked for a table for two in French. When the hostess handed me the French menu I asked, *""Avez-vous une carte d'anglais?""* She laughed and said in English, ""But your accent's so good I thought you were French!""

I love the French. They're by and large very kind people.

horse_you_rode_in_on,"The recorded history of armpit shaving is extremely inconsistent. The earliest found reference is to the ancient Babylonians, more than one thousand years before the birth of Christ, who developed depilatories to remove unwanted body hairs. Julius Caesar reported that early Britons ""had long flowing hairs and shaved every part of their bodies except the head and upper lip"", but this quotation may refer only to men. We do know that barbers removed superfluous hair from the eyebrows, nostrils, arms, and legs from male customers around this time.

The first direct reference to the specific topic at hand is contained in Ovid's *Art of Love*, written just before the birth of Christ: ""Shall I warn you to keep the rank goat out of your armpits? Warn you to keep your legs free of coarse bristling hair?"" In Chaucer's day, the mere sight of any hair was considered erotic. Women were required to wear head coverings; caps were worn indoors and out by woman of all ages.

Eadweard Muybridge's photographic studies of the nude human figure in motion and Hillaire Belloc's photographs of New Orleans prostitutes, all taken before or immediately after the turn of the century, show hairy armpits, as do nude photos of prostitutes known to have been taken in El Paso, Texas, prior to 1915. In addition, still photographs taken from pornographic photographs of the ""French postcard"" variety which are documented as having been made in the United States prior to 1915.

Theatrical motion pictures released about and after 1915, including Cleopatra (starring Theda Bara), the biblical sequences from D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, and several others, shown shaven armpits. So what caused these women to start shaving their armpits around 1915? The first moviemaker to show the feminine armpit extensively in non-pornographic films was Mack Sennett, in his Bathing Beauty shorts. 

We do know that flappers of the Roaring Twenties adopted the sleeveless clothing that seemed o daring in the Sennett shorts.

Several psychologists and feminists have speculated that men like the shaven look because it makes women look prepubescent - young, innocent, and nonthreatening. Diana Grunig Catalan of Rangely, Colorado, who subscribes to the prepubescent theory, speculate that ""American woman, unlike their European counterparts, were not supposed to do anything with all those men they attracted with their revealing clothing. A childlike, helpless look can be a protection as well as an attraction"".

In defense of men, note that many women have visceral reactions to the presence or lack of body hair in men. Why does the same woman who like hair on the front of the torso (the chest) not like it on the back? Why is hair on the arms compulsory but excess hair on the hands considered repugnant?

Around the 90's they started shaving more of the bikini line so it wouldn't show on the sides of those 90's bikini bottoms that go up really high. It seems to be more popular for things to require more work so high-maintenance, in-shape (it's really easy to just be fat and lazy nowadays) girls became more popular so it was more popular to be skinny and tan and have plucked eyebrows and overall look more sanitary so removing more and more body hair just went along naturally right with it. Now, with the sexualization of younger and younger girls, it's popular to *look* younger by being devoid of body hair entirely (I knew a lot of girls that even waxed their arms, back in college). Their overall look is more and more ""perfect"" looking more like a drawing with no visible flaws or broken lines (from fuzzy spots) and I don't know if it's just because I grew up with that changing or what but I like it a LOT more than any body hair on women. It makes them more different from us so more exotic and therefore more erotic.

Jaraxo,"Obvious West Wing Spoilers below.

Without a doubt The West Wing [Season 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Cathedrals) finale. Two scenes come to mind. Firstly, [there's this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYcMk3AJKLk), mid way through the episode. A normally personally reserved man shows some true emotion at the death of his long time friend and secretary, in Latin. If you watch the series from the start, you know how important his faith is to Bartlett, and that he tries his hardest to keep his personal beliefs out of the Oval Office, but here we see him brought to his knees by the death of someone he loved, a rare outburst, a questioning of his faith. It's a crucial scene in the development of his character. To me, this just shows how good a writer Aaron Sorkin truly is.

The powerful emotion of this episodes developments are reflected metaphorically in the storm that is raging over Washington DC. We don't know whether the administration can weather a storm or whether it will cause irreparable damage. 

Then there's [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaUPDYXQUtw) scene at the very end of the episode, leaving the season on a cliffhanger about whether he'll run for president again or not. The music (Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits) makes it even better.

At the end, right before he goes to answer (an answer we don't see until season 3), we see Bartlett put his hands in his pockets. Now, earlier in the episode, we saw flashbacks to his relationship with the deceased Mrs Landingham, from when he was a teenager in school and she worked at the school he was at. They are debating the rights of women in the work place (a discussion Bartlett eventually sides with Delores on), and she makes the point that whenever he's debating something, he has a tell. When he puts his hands in his pockets in that very fashion, he has made his mind up. His internal debate is over, and the decision is made. 

What that decision is, we don't know yet, but he's made his mind up.",null,0,cdnn86x,1ript5,AskReddit,new,2

One time,a few years ago me and a friend were about to jump a taxi ( we called it like this if we didnt pay and ran away).
So we told him we have to go to a bank, which is near our home. At this moment he started to get sceptical - no wonder. So he asked me to give him my mobiletelephone until we pay. As i started to argue why i can't give it to him he interrupted me with the question: "" there is a clean and a dirty lake. Which one would u decide to drink from?"". When i answered, that i would drink from the clean one, he responded that i had to drink of the dirt one, cause im rubbish. At this moment things started to get weird. I don't know much of the things he Said after this because we were pretty wasted. After telling us he would die for his country, he lifted his tshirt a bit and showed me a pistol-grip, telling me we would mess with the false one. Cause we didn't have any bankaccounts, we ordered some friends to hide in the Bank to give us the money. After i gave him the money, i apologized and ran away as fast as i could. He started laughing like the worst serial killer after he killed someone. - I will surely never forget this moment when i ran away and heard this dark laugh.

Better to be slightly above average than below. Skinnier means more ribs showing (spooky skeletons), less tits, less ass, and less curves in general. A bit chunky means extra curves (but just enhancing what you have, not adding extra belly rolls, etc).

Most guys won't care as long as you're a fun girl to be around. And will care even less if you ""make up for it"" in other ways if you catch my drift.

I told her about it an explained my feelings but she didn't understand so we mutually broke things off after a year together. You got to find a good balance.

I asked myself a question, ""Is it like when you close your eyes and ears and you just float through darkness?"" I had to be honest with myself, the answer was no. Being dead means not only do you cease to experience, but your consciousness ends as well.

Qender,"Wow is very fun and well developed, has beautiful art and story, and has a lot of different things going on to keep you busy. but costs money to keep playing every month. You could try the free account up to level 20.

Eve online is amazing and dynamic. But very complicated and a little less social and more lonely due to the space setting.

Second life is extremely dynamic and programmable, but is also kind of stupid, makes little sense, and is sort of a first-come-first-serve experience where new players have to spend a ton of money to get land or do anything vs all the entrenched players. There's also no gameplay, just wandering around.

Star Trek Online has a great and vibrant world, especially if you like star trek, and it's free. But the gameplay is a bit boring.

Garry's mod has a truly unique and creative world where you can build strange mechanical contraptions with other people, and play all sorts of weird games. But there are almost no rules so most of the time the experiences are less social, and more of a contest to troll others in increasingly ridiculous ways, ie, build an exploding flying house, turn someone else invisible, etc.

Minecraft is great and social, with an amazing combination of creativity and action horor survival gameplay.

Jim had a bunch of people over for a house party at their parents house. Jack and I were there and of course got into a lot of booze. There was also plenty of pot at this party so of course we partook in that as well.

Apparently at one point later in the night I was out on their back deck and just sort of laid down and passed out. So Jim's friend had the great idea of carrying me to the bathroom for WHEN I need to vomit after waking up. While carrying me apparently my belt broke and he dropped me. I did not wake up....He then carried me by the waist of my pants the rest of the way but in the process the button of my pants came off.

While in the washroom I slipped in and out of conciousness and vomited a couple times. I was also drawn on by multiple people. The memorable one was a penis on my cheek and they went so far as to find ranch dressing to apply to the tip of the drawing. I gotta say I admire the commitment. I then woke up around 3AM went back to the party smoked some more weed and went to bed around 5.

I woke up behind the curtain and stumbled out to find a janitor and a security guard.  The janitor gaped at me and the security guard was in shock followed by laughter.  Luckily the security guard was an old sailor as well and seeing is how i had just got home from a long out to sea period and him remembering his drunken escapades, he let me go.  I did ask though how did he know i was a sailor,  his response was, son only a sailor could end up this way drunk,  well that and you are still wearing your white hat.

Brought one of my dolls in its carrying case to school once. We were doing a still life project in one of my classes, and we had to bring in a couple of our own objects to draw, and I wanted to draw one of my dolls.

Woman approaches me in the hallway and asks what I have in the case. The outside of the case has a picture of the (not clothed) doll on it, since it's a case specifically for that doll, so I guess she saw that and got curious. I'm in a hurry so I just mutter something like, ""Oh, uhh, it's for a still life project.""

She gets a weird look on her face. ""So like...is it a real dead baby?""

""What?""

""Is it a real still life?""

I didn't even know how to respond. I just stared at her for a second and then kept walking. It took me a couple minutes to realize that she probably didn't know what the term ""still life"" meant and thought it was the same as ""stillborn"", and misunderstood the doll case and the picture of the doll as being some kind of creepy dead baby coffin I was carrying around or something.

The next year, I just started throwing oranges in their yard because I thought it was fun. Next I discovered throwing them at their house was more fun. 
Over time it evolved into throwing any sort of fruit or vegetable at their house. I ended up getting my best friend into it, and we would throw produce at their house pretty much every time we hung out. I was never once caught.  remember throwing a potato at their house and it hitting the screen door and making a loud bang. Someone came out, looked around and just shrugged it off and went back on the house.
This whole thing went on for about 4 years, until I realized at 17 what a moron I was.

LilMissHell,"I'm just over coming my anxiety and ocd at the moment. I've had issues with depression for 10 years, but the last 4 years I completely cut myself off from the world. I lost pretty much all my friends, very rarely left the house but I'm lucky to have a boyfriend that's stuck with me. I started seeing an amazing therapist and I feel so much better. I learned with all this is this that it all comes from inside you. You can't control what people think about you but you can control how you react, that power is always yours. My thing was always being scared what people were thinking about me, all the judgment in every look. Thinking I'm a hideous ogre and everyone is staring, looking at all my flaws. But you know what I have learned? I'm not a hideous freak. People in all reality probably will judge, but its human nature and I can now see that I always judge myself the harshest. All these flaws with my body and personality that were so obvious to me, really other people didn't actually notice as much as I thought. People have their own insecurities that they worry about too. All you can do at the end of the day is be the best person you can be and treat people with respect, its nice to be nice! If people are assholes to you well put it in perspective, will what they say really have an influence on your life if you don't let it? They have the issue and you have the control to not make it your issue. Some people in my life treated me really badly and it did effect me for a long time, but I can see now they are dickheads and clearly had issues. Its easier to say then do, believe me I understand but you need to realize you hold all the power. I recently enrolled in a course and it starts soon, I never thought I would have it in me! But I'm actually proud of myself, dare I say! I'd been stuck indoors for years too scared to interact with people, or to even live a life and I wasted years. Trust me if I can do it anyone can, I never thought I would reach this point. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm on my phone. ",null,0,cdno6mw,1riooc,AskReddit,new,2

But seriously, the whole person-cult thing really isn't as popular here in Germany as it is in the US. People get kind of uncomfortable if start worshipping great leaders. Anything involving great germanic leaders from old times like Arminius has sort of been irrevocably tainted by the Nazis so that you couldn't make a monument including such figures without making the wrong sort of impression.

If somebody built such a monument with more modern leaders the selection would probably depend a lot on who built it. I guess Bismarck, Adenauer or Kohl might be good candidates.

That being said, since Germany is nowadays far more interested in seeing itself as a country of poets and philosophers (Dichter und Denker), a German Mt Rushmore would be far more likely to have great creators and artists rather than statesman.

If the family is less conservative you may be able to dress normally without hitches, but I'd ask the bride/groom/whoever is in charge.

A friend of mine invited me to her Sweet 16 party, at a restaurant. I went all out- got a nice dress, a gift, etc. Morning of the party, I decided to have a a slice of cake for breakfast (left over from the night before). My father saw me, and told me that I was not allowed to have the cake. I politely told him that I think I am old enough to decide what I eat (I rarely ate sweets, much less for breakfast; I was also not overweight, etc.). My dad flipped the fuck out and then decided I could not go to my friend's party. Despite pleas from my family and me, he wouldn't budge on his decision. As such, I stayed home. That was the one and only nice birthday party I have ever been invited to, and I missed it; pisses me off to this day.",null,0,cdnmzg2,1rio97,AskReddit,new,1

They did, however, like many parents, have a tendency to take away favorite toys for a period of time when I was being obnoxious.

Part of me wonders if the fairly large number of not overly materialistic folks in recent generations is due to this sort of training as a child; as if you don't place a high value on material things, you don't miss them when they're gone.

Mrs_Patrick_Sharp,"When I was in middle school, I went to a week long bible camp with my sister. I wasn't really into in but went because my parents insisted. So on like day three, I'm hanging out with the ""rebel"" kids at the camp before prayer and someone says ""Let's skip prayer and hike around the lake!"" 

So we go off, six middle school age kids around a huge lake (probably 2 miles around). We didn't tell anyone just left. About an hour and a half later we have made it about 3/4 of the way around the lake and this camp counselor/helper person rides up on his bike and sees us. He starts screaming that he found us and we are all bewildered. 

We run back to camp and are met by camp counselors. Apparently they had reported us as missing/runaways and they had news stations getting ready to do a live report on the 11PM news. My cousin, who is overly paranoid was so relieved to see me. 

The worst part was having to call my parents back home and get yelled at for leaving camp. We all had to stay around a counselor for the rest of camp and they ended up making a rule that children gone for an hour or more without checking in are considered runaways and the police will be called.

At the same speed of 300 feet per second, it takes only 20 milliseconds for the nerve impulses to travel from brain to toe, or 40 milliseconds for the round trip from toe sensory nerves to brain back to toe muscles. Fast runners complete about 1.5 strides per second with a stride of about 6 feet. That means that each foot travels a distance of about 9 feet per second. During the 40 millisecond lag time required for motor control, the foot travels only about 4 inches. Thus, the spatial lag between sensation and motor control is only 4 inches.

Mexico is another thing.  While Canada is a well functioning country, Mexico is not.  An invasion could be done saying it was for humanitarian reasons.  Mexico has oil, lots of oil.

Second Mexico is big, 115 million people, ranked 11 in the world, size ranked 14.  Lots of urban areas, densely populated, which would be lots of dead Americans.  Their military is not that bad, American trained.  A quarter million strong.  Which is not a big issue.  The big issues is they could put 90 million peole in military functions.  90 million fit for service, not a good number to go against if it lasts a while.

Since my parents worked during the day, my grandpa was retired and my grandma worked for a school so she had the summer off, I spent most summer days with them. My grandpa was far and away my best friend at that age. My uncle was as well, but there was something special about my grandpa. He owned about 15 acres at his boyhood home that he kept a garden of corn, tomatoes, green beans and peppers. The majority of this area was an apple orchard. I can still remember one mild summer day where he loaded me up on his old Case tractor and we rode up into the orchard. We sat around, ate the newly ripened apples, talked about whatever my 3 or 4 year old mind could come up with and he talked about how he remembers coming up here as a boy and how he brought my mom and uncles up here when they were little. We rode back and shortly after getting back to their house, my mom picked me up.

A few months later his brain tumor would return and within 6 months he lost his ability to speak, care for himself and eventually move. He was gone about 13 months after that day in the orchard.

I remember the dull red brick walls, the high fence gates for each kennel and all the dogs barking, except for one.The one dog on the end wasn't barking, he just lifted his head up and looked at me and put his head back down. It was almost as if he felt like he'd be ignored again. It was right then and there I knew that was the dog I wanted. I ran right to it and remember saying I wanted that dog. I had to have the one dog that wasn't barking. My parents did decide to go with that dog and after what felt like an eternity (hey everything feels like an eternity when you are 3) we got to take him home. He was so incredibly happy that he wasn't locked in a cage anymore. That big hairy fur ball never wanted to leave my side for the ten years we had him.

My grandmother was sort of my idol. At 80, she still had her license, wasn't your typical ""old lady"" and was pretty damn tough. (Had lived through breast cancer twice, double mastectomy, and choosing divorce and single motherhood in an era when you didn't do that.) We were in the grocery store together when I was about 10, so that would have been mid 90's. There were three other people in line ahead of us, a very obvious gay couple couple of guys, and a big, tough, bodybuilder type, and then us. And the body builder guy is just spewing all the hatred he can. Gay guys are totally trying to ignore him, which is just firing him up more. Finally, my grandmother, a very tolerant woman, taps the body builder on the shoulder, and says, ""They aren't hurting you, Leave them be."" To which he answers, ""What they are doing is disgusting and they shouldn't be around normal people."" My grandmother stares him dead in the eye, deadpan expression, and says, ""Sir, I know you don't agree with me or them, but a good assfucking might lighten you up."" 

You could have heard a pin drop. The cashier froze, I froze, the bodybuilder froze, the gay guys froze. My grandmother just held eye contact. After about 10 seconds, he dropped his eyes, and everybody there realized they were seeing a sort of crushing of his soul. He quietly stepped out of line. My grandmother never said another word about it, except when we got to the car, she looked over at me and said, ""Being a grown up bully is a sad thing to be.""

The owner of the property must've saw the fire and didn't appreciate us trespassing so he called the cops. Around midnight about 5 or 6 cops surrounded us. We were all underage, and we tried to convice the cops we weren't drinking.

So the cops tell us as long as we put out the fire and take down the fort we wouldn't get into any trouble.

rickyrhea,"My kid.  So he was born with some limb differences--missing bones, clubbed hands, 3 fingers instead of four because one finger had to be made into thumbs.  Was looking forward to having a boy who was into sports, but figured that just wasn't gonna happen.  Didn't think he could hold a baseball bat or throw a ball straight, etc.  Figured soccer or running, if anything, would be his thing.

When he was 2, he was really into hockey.  I figured, ""Eh!  He's 2!  It will pass!""  Nope!  Little shit learned to skate in diapers, but had a hard time holding the stick.  Wrote to a bunch of hockey glove manufacturers, and Reebok had just bought CCM (or the other way around), and they made him custom gloves.  They didn't work, but it was still really freaking cool they did that.  Kiddo got the FIRST pair of RBK gloves in the world.  

Anyway, so he turns 4 and wants to play t-ball and soccer, and gets older and tries lacrosse, all the while playing hockey.  I figure he'll give up because he won't be very good at those things, but he is.  He is actually decent at soccer, baseball, lacrosse, basketball, golf.....you name it!  Not a star, clearly, but good enough to contribute to the team.

So he turns 8, and his older buddy from the neighborhood is a hockey phenom.  Gets invited to be on all these AAA summer teams, so my kid wants to do that.  Well, he can contribute to the team, but he's nothing like this kid.  I let him try out for a new team in the area, but they don't get enough kids for his birth year.  He tries again next year, same deal.  They take a couple kids from his birth year and put them with the next older group, but not him.  So the third year he makes the team, and improves immensely, but this team isn't that great, being a new team and all.  So he decides he's going to play in the NHL, and to do that he has to play Div I hockey, and to do that, he wants to get a scholarship to a prep school near here, and to do that he needs to make a higher level AAA summer team.  Kid has it all planned out.  

So I tell him, ""Look.  Crazy talent like Crosby or Gretzky doesn't come along all that often, so teams still have to fill their rosters, but there's a lot of competition, and if you want to make it to that level, YOU have to put in the work to get there.""  This team he wants to make is ridiculous money, even in hockey terms, and I tell him if he wants to play summer hockey for fun, that's no problem, but if he wants to play on the expensive one, I am going to need to see him working hard.  No asking to skip practice, etc.  I'm willing to pay if he's willing to put in the work.  I said nothing else.  He's 11 at this time.  Wouldn't you know the little shit put in the work and made that team.  

So now he's 12, and he's got scouts coming to games and invitations to play in tournaments and special camps are coming in.  He's been schmoozing the nearest juniors coach, and one night he raced a bunch of the players on the team (ages 17-20), and kicked two of their asses (one of them being 6'5"" tall to my kiddo's 5'4"")!  Coach tracked me down and told me he was saving a spot for my kid on his team.  

He's gotten himself TV interviews, articles in the newspaper, and spots on teams by being charming, good looking, polite, and by being a hockey player who works hard and is coachable and puts the team's needs before his own, and sometimes over players who are a tad better skill-wise than he is.  So yeah.....I totally underestimated my own kid.  ",null,187,cdnrre4,1rinhm,AskReddit,new,809

He asks for an external hard drive, because he wants to move his custom kernel of Linux to his new computer (I can't remember the exact details, I was totally floored by his request). He then spots my textbook on international political economy (my boss was very forgiving of me studying in slow times) and asks me fifteen minutes of in-depth questions on one of the main contemporary theorists in the field (Karl Polanyi), beyond even what myself and my classmates had asked (the class was graduate level).

We push up to the flag and are pinned by a vicious volley of vivid viscera. Naturally, I am scared shitless and hunker down.

EightMile,"TL;DR Kid seemed like a total douche, was actually SUPER cool and humble, and is now one of my best friends.

I know that Reddit isn't very fond of fraternities, but hear me out - I'm in a business fraternity. We have a very lucrative pledging process that teaches the pledges how to hone their professional skills, such as resume building, interview question answering, and delivering effective speeches.

There was a new pledge, ""Josh"". I was a member at the time, and I was convinced that he would quit very soon after. He looked like a huge stoner, had (has) a pretty dumb-sounding laugh, seems like an arrogant asshole, barely met the minimums our national chapter sets, and just all around didn't look like he would fit in or be able to complete his tasks as a part of our process. I grew to really disliking him in a very short amount of time, for no real reason at all.

It all happened in the course of a few days.

I went to lunch and saw a blind man walking through the parking lot of the restaurant. I then see Josh approach him, talk to him, and guide him into the restaurant.

*Yeah, whatever. One good deed doesn't make him a good person.*

I went to my classes in the afternoon, and then went to teach a short lesson to the pledges about giving a good speech and presentation. I gave some pointers; most of the pledges were ignoring me and texting. Josh was listening. Intently.

*He's just being nice because no one else is listening to me.*

Time for the pledges to give a small run-through of what they've learned and give a 90-second speech. Everyone's speech blew dad dick, and then Josh got up. He used every tip I offered, and we (myself and a few other members) came to the easy conclusion that Josh's was the best.

*Alright. Everyone wins sometimes.*

I'm leaving the room. Josh stops me, and asks if there is any way he can improve, because he feels like he can do better. I give him a few more pointers, and he writes them down in his notebook.

*Hm. That's pretty humble of him.*

I continue to exit the room after speaking with him. Josh catches me again. He tells me that he really liked how calm I was able to keep myself when speaking in front of others. Josh tells me that he has a huge presentation to give in his class tomorrow, and asks if I have time to ""coach"" him on it.

*I've got time. Hell, he's asking for my help; it's the least I could do.*

We practice his speech for about three hours, into the early hours of the night. We say our goodbyes and depart. The next day, I'm walking through the hallways and someone literally puts me off of my walking path via bear hug. Guess who? Josh has got tears in his eyes. He shows me his scoring sheet for his speech. 98%. He told me he's always been too nervous, and has never gotten above a 70% on any speech, ever. He didn't mention it the night before. He profusely thanks me, hugs me again, and practically skips away.

*...Fuck. I was... so wrong...*

I will then buy the [McLaren F1](http://www.rapidcars.com/images/52010mclaren-f1-orange-gtr.jpg), Bugatti Veyron, and my favorite, the [Zonda](http://todofondosdecoches.com/wp-content/uploads/images/1c/pagani-zonda-0.jpg).  I will make him look like a total poor bitch and also buy the record company he is currently with.  When he decides to make a new album, I will force the producers to modify his music to make it sound so horrible.  I will eventually pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars if they agree to do it.  His fans would get affected by his horrible music in time, slowly turn their backs on him.  He will become so upset, he will eventually threaten me with violence.  I will then sue Bieber for threatening a major record label.  I will also find all the people Bieber has insulted or threatened in the past and make complete stars out of them.

It's good to establish what you are looking for before getting too physical.

That being said... We are all human. We make choices impulsively sometimes not thinking of the consequences that may come. If you had a good time focus on that.

RadioactiveClown,"I was expelled from a podunk Christian academy school operating out of a church in east Texas when I was in 8th grade. Attending a Christian school in a small town (pop. ~1500) located in the buckle of the Bible Belt is odd if only because everybody went to the same few churches, including the local public school principals, teachers, staff. They'd even have prayer at school gatherings, pep rallies, and football games. But public school is secular and therefore godless. But I digress...

I should point out that at this particular church school, you could be expelled for listening to rock &amp; roll music, including ""so called 'Christian rock' music"" (this was 1984 and Stryper was becoming popular among rebellious church kids).  However, that's not why I was expelled but it's an example of the BS rules they had. Oh yeah, girls could be expelled for wearing pants.

Anyway, upon my expulsion, my mom quit her job as the church school kindergarten teacher and my family moved from that two-bit town to Mesquite, Texas where I was able to eventually graduate from public school.  I met my wife at that high school, we dated in college, and we've been married for 21 years and have a wonderful family. Oh yeah, id Software opened their first office in town (the building next to my high school) and I got to know some of the founders through mutual friends. I've been working in the video game industry for over 15 years now and I've never been happier.

She was upset that her girlfriend had broken up with her, and couldn't seem to cope with it. I did my best to be there for her to talk to, give advice all of that. 

One night she told me she was thinking about killing herself. I'm in a panic, because I don't know where she lives (we were co-workers.) Was trying to figure out how to get a hold of her sister. She calmed down while we were talking, and thankfully didn't do anything. 

After that, I explained to her yet again, that a break up is not the end of the world, even though it feels that way, and that she will get better with time and that suicide was not the answer and to think of her family. I then stopped most communication with her, because I honestly couldn't deal with it anymore. I think that was her reality check. 

It's been about 2 years now, and she is in a much better place. She's thanked me many times for being there for her, and for the tough love when it came down to it.

Doesn't matter if it's $35 from some hospital bill you didn't know you had, that shit will kill you.  2.) Establish credit, and pay it back.  Keep in mind every time you apply and get denied it hurts you a little bit.  If you're having trouble getting credit in the first place, do some research into banks/CU's that issue ""secured"" credit cards.  3.) Realize that there are two types of credit (revolving and fixed), the way to get the best credit score is to demonstrate that you can pay both.    Revolving is anything where your balance goes up and down.  Don't ever carry a balance that is more than half of your limit.

Also, get a credit card. Buy something small with it, like one weeks groceries and go home and pay it off.

dirtymoney,"probably a highway zapper. They were kits maybe in the very early 90s. And one company (The edge company) assembled and sold them. Otherwise you could buy the kits from another company and you would have to assemble it yourself. I bought mine from the edge company already assembled for $50 (it was a catalog order). The kits were discontinued by request (subtle threat) from some governmental regulatory agency. Funny note: The Edge company had bought the kits and never paid the maker for them (stiffed them)

Basically what the device did was set off radar detectors (the X band I think). 

Here is what one looks like... [see the first pictures in the search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=highway+zapper+edge+catalog&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS523US523&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IzuVUt6-EenS2wXonoCIBQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=727&amp;bih=458#q=highway%20zapper&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch)

Mine has a green LED instead of a red one that are seen in the pics. I didnt like the pushbutton switch and I changed it out to a small toggle switch.

Years ago I set up an automatic search on ebay for one and only was alerted to one being sold on ebay.  Just one in all those years.

I still have mine and it still works, but not many people use radar detectors like they used to and when they do... they usually ignore the x band because the xband is set off by other things like automatic sliding doors on the front of stores like walamrt.... and because practically no police agency uses xband any more. I think they use laser.

It WAS fun as hell when some jerkoff sped past me on the highway and I could see a red light on his dash as he passed. I'd follow him and use my zapper on him. He'd hit the brakes and I could sometimes see his radar detector light up. Then after a mile or so he would speed up again and I would hit him again with the zapper and he would slow down. I'd do it over and over. Sometimes I would keep it continuously on, he'd slow down and then I'd blow past him. Making him wonder why the police wasnt chasing and stopping me. Or when we would get to a red light I'd pull up next to him... get his attention... hold up my zapper and flip the switch and his radar detector would light up like a christmas tree. 

Good times... good times.

edit: the last time I used it was maybe 5 months ago. I was sitting behind a guy at the BK drive tru and he had his radar detector under his rear view mirror. I sat behind him and lit it up over and over. He eventually turned it off because it was making so much noise. Every once in a while I will still have a chance to use it on the highway, but rarely do I get a response (the person hitting the brakes).",null,0,cdnt7tm,1rimln,AskReddit,new,2

Now, my job has recently become unbelievably difficult because everyone that walks through the door I perceive as a threat. I have a panic attack, I can't speak, I can't look at them and my brain immediately goes into fight or flight mode. 

On a more personal note, until I met my current boyfriend, I had no concept of a genuine, healthy sexual relationship. Before him, I was quite promiscuous, because if I just had sex with someone, that would be it. I didn't think I was good enough for a healthy relationship anyway. I never enjoyed sex, I always phased out during. What I mean by ""phasing out"" is that I would leave mentally. I would hate it. It was a chore, not enjoyable. And I would do and let them to demeaning things to me not because it was enjoyable, but because I just wanted to get it over with and I had no voice to say no. 

I subconsciously put on about 30 pounds because the less attractive I am physically, the less likely someone will want to have sex with me, I'll just be another girl. That was my mentality anyway. And I've only recently been able to put the weight off in a permanent way. 

PTSD for me has been like the movie Derailed. Every day I ride the same train. Everyday I try to stop it from crashing. Some days I succeed, some days I fail.

I82manycookies,My dad was a paramedic when I was a kid. One time he got a call for a lady who fell off her toilet and couldn't reach anyone for four days until her neighbor came to check on her. She was laying there covered in her own filth with nothing to eat when they found her. ,null,0,cdnm5ke,1rimgy,AskReddit,new,2
CMFW,"Paramedic here:

Walked into a house for ""Suicidal Party."" The lady hadn't harmed herself yet (thank god) and didn't seem to be in physical distress. Her walls were covered in writing of all different bibles. She had drawn Jesus being crucified, pentagrams, the UU chalice, everything. The cops pulled a steak knife out of her purse and questioned why she had it there. ""Never know when a delicious steak comes your way.""

Went to a nursing home for an older lady with vaginal pain. My female partner inspected her vagina and then told me I needed to see for myself (she was an EMT Basic and figured ALS might be required.) she was popping out of her vagina. She had an ulcer that ate through her intestines and uterus. Why she had her uterus still I don't know. 

Went to the jail once for a diabetic inmate. One the way up the security guard told us our guy was shot in the foot. We met the guy and he was not shot. Nobody was shot. His blood sugar read ""high"" which is at least 500+. The nurse couldn't land a 22G needle (infant size) in him and tried multiple times. I obtained a 16G (ropes for veins) easily. On the way to the squad he started throwing up and the guard jumped back and demanded to know where the infection was. Security guard didn't know what was up at all. 

Had a guy high on meth tackled by the cops start to spit blood at us. I gave home 5mg Valium, which would put me out (I'm 150 pounds/approx 80kg) and he was smaller than me. Didn't calm him down one bit. Still spitting blood. Gave another 5mg. Still nothing. Call hospital and ask if I can give more. They were pissed I already gave 10 because that really is too much, but the told me to be ready to intubate if he loses his ability to breathe and to give five more milligrams. I did so and it just made him calm, but didn't put him out. The gave him 10 more at the hospital. He's in jail now. 

I've pronounced two of my high school friends dead (I also volunteer at my local fire department in the town I grew up in) and I had to perform CPR on my partners baby (died of SIDS.) 

I walked into a house once for a lady having a hard time breathing. Walked in and the neighbor (who is a nurse) was doing compressions on her, holding her up at 45° angle so she could also receive an Albuterol treatment. I had her stop compressions and checked a pulse, she had one. We began to breathe for her and this nurse starts compressing again. I throw her off the patient and tell her to knock it off. I touch the patients eye lashes and they flick - a sign that the patient is still conscience. I deem the patient is faking. The cop on scene tells the family not to follow us through red lights and I tell them we aren't going lights and sirens. Then I tell the officer that the patient is faking. Our lady then wakes up and states she isn't faking and her neighbor revived her. That was fun. 

I've delivered two babies. First lady was having her 5th child and walked me through. Second lady was having her 2nd child and was very Asian. As her baby was coming out she shouted ""Ooooo I going to pee on yuuu.""

He was quite aggressive in his advances to the point where he had started to talk about me becoming his wife and I knew I had to get out of town. I was staying in a little hotel by the beach run by the most wonderful man who agreed that I had to leave and got me on a bus very late at night to Cairo. 

When I went to the bus however the other man was waiting for me. He told me that he had stopped the bus and it would wait for me while we went for a drive. Even though I tried to protest he steered me by the neck to his 4v4 and we were soon driving, out past the bedouin village into the middle of nowhere. 

At this stage I was very scared and not able to hide it, asking him very nicely to take me back to the bus as it was going to leave without me. He tried to reassure me that it would not but was starting to get angry at me, becoming quite aggressive and swearing. When we were about 30 minutes away (the bus was supposed have left 20 minutes ago) he stopped the truck at the top of a large hill. By this stage I was half crying and terrified. He was extremely angry at this stage and told me to 'get out of the fucking truck' and I thought I could very well die here, or disappear and no one would ever know.

As I got out of the truck and moved to the edge of the hill I saw the lights of Dahab from a distance. This is what he had bought me to see before I left. After about 5 minutes in silence we left back for the bus which was indeed still waiting for me.

I had a digital camera with me that I was holding in one hand so that I could film my run, and shoved off. 

A ways down, my ski hit a branch and I start to lose it. I try to keep my balance, and glide a fair bit down the slope before I crash. I right myself, and realize that I only have one ski... I take off my remaining ski and stand it up in the snow, but I've sunk shoulder deep into the power. I'm feeling around, trying to find my other ski. I can't find it. I can't find it anywhere. I start trying to slog my way up this steep mountain, shoulder deep, trying desperate to find my ski. It's been about an hour now. I have no reception on my cell phone, I'm getting cold, I'm in the middle of nowhere, my dad is waiting for me somewhere far, far away. I start yelling for help. I feel like I'm literally drowning, I'm sure anyone who has ever been in deep snow or something similar can relate. You can't move or swim, plus I'm in seriously heavy gear that restricts my movement, and heavy boots that are dragging me down. It's been two hours now. Fuck my life. I am totally lost at what to do...and then it occurs to me. The camera!

Basically, I scroll through my film and find the moment when I lose my ski (a good 50 yards at least). I fight my way back up to that spot and start looking for it, pounding my hands down through the loose snow. I'm really starting to freak out now, because it's getting dark. Eventually I find it and make my way down, and everything was fine. But I seriously thought I was totally going to die.

miltonmille,"So a quick back story about this. When I was younger me and my friends used to hang around near the woods by our houses. In the woods there was a cabin, with a road leading up to it so cars could drive in. Anyways, we had heard that the guy that was living there was ""crazy"". Every town got a crazy old dude. So naturally we wanted to see for ourselves. We usually stod with our bikes behind a tree or a big rock pretty far away and just looked. 

So one day when we were there ""spying"", this car comes up behind up. we stood on the road this time. The car starts to accelerate towards us. This scared the shit out of me and my friends so we started to peddle as fast as we could. I turned to the right and got away but my friend almost got hit (like 2,3 feet away from the car). He ran his bike next to a stone so the car stopped. This scared us a lot but we still kept spying on him. So a few days later we're there again, this time behind a tree. We started throwing rocks at the cabin, which I now realise was a bad idea. Well the old came rushed out of his house carrying this big ass knife. The big kind you usually chop vegetables with. One of my friends screamed ""HE GOT A KNIFE"" and jumped on his bike. I thought for sure I was going to get stabbed. Being the nervous little kid I was I jumped on my bike and was shaking like crazy. Me and my friends cycled a good bit from the cabin. I almost fell a few times due to the shaking. A time later we threw our bikes over a fence, a good distance away from the cabin and biked hom in silence. We never spoke of it again.

We later heard the old guy had actually tried to kill som kid for ""spying"" on his cabin. The police took him and when they searched his house they found drugs which had made him go crazy. Thinking back at it I'm real happy I got away, it could have me who got stabbed.

SweetestScience,"I was hanging out with an older guy for a job interview who was a far more experienced kayaker than myself and we were planning on hitting the water the next day. I'm comfortable in class 1-3 rapids and this would be my first class 4. He had paddled the Grand Canyon (with a permit) and competed in the Green River Narrows (an insanely dangerous whitewater kayak race). I have no idea why but we spent the evening swapping stories about kayakers drowning - he had seen several people die. His wife tells me that she nearly died on the section we were planning on paddling. She flipped on a rapid and got sucked into a hole - a spiraling undercurrent of death that is impossible to escape. It was not until the moment she accepted death and let her body go limp that it miraculously spit her out and she lived to tell the tale. I barely sleep knowing I'm in way over my head but I very badly want them to think I'm brave and can handle this because I really want them to hire me. 

Fast forward to the next day and we are headed up to the rapid that almost killed his wife. Like a good guide he pulls me to the side of the river and tells me in detail how to shoot the rapid and then off we go. My heart is practically in my throat I'm so nervous - it's way bigger than I expected, really long, and starts with a 5 foot drop which I've never done before. You already know what happens next - I hit the rapid at a bad angle and flip on my bad side. I try for a few seconds to roll my kayak back up with no success so I bail. I think the seconds I spent trying to roll saved me and I floated over the hole but I didn't know that at the time. I'm wearing a helmet and life jacket but my boat and paddle are gone and I'm frantically bobbing down this huge rapid. All I can think is to keep my feet up and in from of me (under water rocks and branches can snag your legs and break them or trap you until you drown). ""I DON'T WANNA DIE"" is screaming on repeat in my head. To make matters worse it's March and the water is ice cold. 

It took several terrifying minutes to get to calmer water. The guy tried saving me earlier but the water was too rough so he got my boat and paddle. A pair of guys on a big raft finally pulled me out and gave me a lift to shore. I had some scrapes &amp; bruises and was freezing but was otherwise fine.

Prufrock451," In a century, most steel and concrete will have dissolved, books and plastics burned or mouldered or powdered. In 10,000 years, perhaps a weathered remnant of Mount Rushmore will retain the shape of human workmanship. One or two brass statues might remain, the Statue of Liberty resting silently on the ocean floor under a crust of oysters. There will be curious traces of radioactivity in the atmosphere. A few strip mines will retain steeply graded walls. The Pyramids will be a string of weathered and pitted lumps. 

In a million years, there'll be nothing left of us but fossils and a few stray molecular artifacts. Our lasting legacy will be the genetic bottlenecks future observers might discover, invasive species settling into equilibrium with the environments that arise in our absence. 

Even the transmissions we have been blasting into space will attenuate and dissolve. By the time our broadcasts reach Alpha Centauri, they have washed out into the background static of the universe.

rebelkitty,"Here's mine:

One year, when my children were 3 and 4 years old, we drove from our hometown, ten hours north to visit their grandparents.

We arrived on Christmas eve, after dark.  As we were unpacking, I realized, to my horror, that I'd left ALL their presents at home!

Now, this wasn't a huge deal where the big presents were concerned, because grandma and grandpa had more than covered that angle.  But we had no stockings, and worst of all - no Santa presents!

In our household, Santa doesn't shop at Toys-R-Us.  Mom and Dad get the commercial toys.  But every year there's one small unwrapped toy that appears mysteriously beneath the Christmas Tree for each kid.  It looks handmade - like it might have been made by an elf.

So, that Christmas Eve, we found ourselves in the 24hr Shopper's Drug Mart, at 11pm, debating whether toothbrushes make good stocking stuffers and trying to find something that could possibly look like an elf had made it.

We ended up with a gift set mug and a stuffed animal.

The mug had a monkey painted on the front, a chocolate dipped plastic spoon and a package of chocolate drink.  The stuffy was a little tabby cat.  And when the kids got up on Christmas morning, they were *thrilled*.

Who knew a 3yo could love a mug so much?  He reacted to the chocolate spoon like he'd just discovered the secret to happiness!

That was almost 13 years ago.  My 17yo daughter still has the cat, and takes it with her when she goes babysitting. And my 16yo son still loves that mug, and won't let anyone else drink out of it.

Our last-minute Christmas turned out to be be one of our best ever!",null,0,cdnm4h2,1rilrr,AskReddit,new,2

PLS_PM_ME_YOUR_PUSSY,"Back in my teenage years, my friends and I used to frequently make jokes about each others mothers and reference disgusting sexual acts that we had performed with them; this is about one of those jokes gone wrong.

When we were in high school, most of us didn’t have cell phones, just the old landlines, most had the standard answering machine that played aloud as the caller left a message, some people had the fancier kind provided by their phone provider that the owner of the number had to call and input a password to retrieve the messages. When you called my friend, his answerphone said press one to leave a message for his mom, press two for his dad and press three or stay on the line for my friend Rowan. I assumed that Rowan’s machine was the kind that required a password to her the messages, so I went off about his mom.

I spent the next 4-6 minutes going into great detail about some very crude sexual acts that I had done with his mom, this included a bonanza of positions, anal sex, cumshots and at one point I mentioned how his mother was not on her rag but I shoved a tampon inside her and pulled it out and sucked all the juices off of it.

When I finished lacing into Rowan about these deviant acts I simply said ”call me”. Many hours later I received a call from Rowan…it turns out that their answering machine was the type that plays aloud as the message is being left, and Rowan’s kind, caring, athletic, vegetarian, algea drinking parents sat on the couch and listened live as I completely destroyed any hope of innocence they thought I had. Rowan told me that his folks played the message from start to finish for him and watched him listened to it whilst he had to simultaneously attempt to refrain from laughing and listen to his father make threats of using a shotgun on me for my comments about his wife.

For the next three years or so I couldn’t phone Rowan’s house so I’d have to get others to phone for me or call and use a fake name and voice.

Years later I semi-redeemed myself by helping his family move homes and helping dig a long six foot deep trench in their back yard, but I could never really look at Rowan’s dad the same again.

love_the_octopus,"Oh boy. I have been looking for a reason to tell this one. It has been years!

About three or four years ago my father was on one of the rising points off his work managing his own publicity company. One of the things he had learned was the importance of building a good network of relationships with a variety of people in different industries and keeping does relationships in good health. Often keeping said relationships involved us, as a family, attending dinners, parties or other events with the family of a client or associate and putting the best smile possible, as unpleasant or uncomfortable the event could be.

So, one day my father comes to us and announces we are going to the official High School Musical Live show they were having on my city. Apparently the organizers had hired my fathers company for publicity and kindly gifted us with 5 or 6 tickets to the show. The organizers were some important people on the local show industry and so it was important for us not to be rude and go. I was 18 or 19 at the time, my younger brother about 14 or 15 and none of us had the slightest interest in anything that had to do with High School Musical, but we decided to follow my father's orders and go to the darn thing. I convinced my girlfriend to accompany us so I would have someone to complain with and hopefully alleviate some of the boredom.

Now, I decided to at least google some info of the show and find that, while it was made by Disney, it did not include or had anything to do with any of the original actors in the movie (Even tough the tickets were really expensive). Alarmingly, however, none of the publicity for the show made this clear (Even after my father repeatably warned them).

I tough that that was odd, but did not give it any more tough.

The day of the event comes and as we make our way to the theater the place was surrounded with street vendors offering everything from shirts to mugs and posters of High School Musical... all of it with the face of the original movie actors on it. The line to enter was almost completely made up by families with younger kids who all seemed visibly exited as they bough as much fake merchandise as their parents would allow.

""Not good"" I thought ""They are all expecting the original actors. There are going to be a lot of disappointed kids tonight""

The parking lot was packed full. My father decided he would go and continue searching for a place to park while we made the line to enter. Half an hour later my mother, my brother, my girlfriend and me were sitting on the packet treater full of screams of exited children with no sign of my father.

The show begins with massive cheering, and one by one the actors walked on stage on each one of their intro songs.

It was funny seeing how, little by little, the cheers disappeared and were substituted by the booing of upset children and roars of angry parents. Ten minutes in it got so bad the music suddenly stopped and the actors fled the stage in alarm.

We were on one the highest seats and had perfect view of the pit of families closer to the stage, were some sort of movement was happening. A father climbs into the stage and stars cursing at the top of his lungs, calling Disney a bunch of thieves and giving the logo of the show the finger while everyone yelled. Two security guys climb to the stage and try to tackle the angry dad and a fist fight breaks out between them with the entire audience of children screaming and crying.

Before long the audience became a mob, and the mob stampeded towards the entrance and the ticket both chanting ""Fraud!"" and asking for a money refund.

At this point I noticed my girlfriend standing right next to me from our higher seat, watching it all with a smile.

""This has turned out to be a very interesting evening!"" she said, her eyes shining.

This is not the end of the story. Because while this all happened my father had found a parking spot and was walking to the theater. I will add my father's side of the story on the next post.

**TL;DR: Leaving important details out of publicity turns an audience of families into a deadly mob.**

BS, I pushed for more testing.  They tested his hearing and tested him for ADHD when finally his school psychologist diagnosed him.  When he was little I'd tell him to go to his room to get his shoes and socks and put them on so we could leave.  He'd walk to his room, find a toy along the way and sit down to play with it.  I'd come to check on him and ask him what he was supposed to be doing and he'd say OH YEAH! I forgot! and do it without prompts to remind him.  They taught him tools through the years on how to stay focused.  He's 17 now and doing very well with plans to go to college and study digital graphics.  He has an engineering brain and loves to figure out how things work.  He's still working hard on his vocabulary which a newfound love of reading has helped greatly and sometimes doesn't enunciate so I have to ask him to repeat.

As your doctor said, it's different for everyone. I've heard of people feeling ""off"" on their medication, disoriented as you said. I tried a few anti-depressants before I found this medication and they did nothing (good or bad).

banaltram,"I know this is going to be the most frustrating answer ever, but she's right, only you will know if they're working or not. It's almost impossible to tell you if it's working or not because everyone will experience the medication differently. I was on 200mg Zoloft for a long time, and it was alright, but one of my friends was on the same amount of Zoloft and had a terrible reaction to it making things worse instead of better.

I've been on half a million different meds - anti depressants, anti psychotics, anti anxiety, and various other meds to counter the side effects of what I was taking. I think I went through almost every anti depressant available before finding one that was tolerable. Generally you won't know if it's helping or not until you've been taking it for 6 weeks or more, they aren't instant like Ativan,  Zopicline, Xnax or other anti anxiety meds that work almost instantly.

I can't honestly answer the question of side effects. I was on so many things at so many times that I have no idea which side effects belonged to which medication and which ones were caused by the interactions of those medications.

Most importantly though, don't just stop taking them. Make sure you talk to the doctor and taper off (if necessary). I have taken myself of all of my meds at various points in time and it almost always made things much worse.

I would say if the side effects are hard to deal with or just don't feel right taking that particular AD then don't be afraid to try a different one. It can take a while to get the right one so don't be put off.",null,0,cdnly23,1rikkp,AskReddit,new,3

Theungry,"I think it has to do with the fact that you have to make a choice to invest in one or the other, and that choice tends to be pretty personal based on what you value most (cost, associated brands, ease of use, first to market, performance etc).

You both feel like the other chose wrong by your assessment, and most people can't help explaining why they thought their choice was a no-brainer which causes a pointless argument about whose values are more valuable.

Over time you start to internalize the choice into your identity ""I'm an Android user"" or ""I'm an iOS user"" and you start having emotional reactions of loyalty or disgust to the very logos attached to the brand, and dismiss anything identified with the brand you rejected and support everything about the brand you chose because you're committed and to admit your brand is inferior in any way feels like an admission of gullibility on your part.

Marketing plays on this and forces people to take sides. They realize that if they can get their customers to take sides, then the customers will form a bond with each other and the product.

The opinion seems to be let someone else do it. The French gov't does not adequately provide for or train their soldiers with the exception of special and anti terrorist troops. As for the French Resistance, if you take the claims of how many Frenchmen/women were in the Resistance it would have been impossible for Germany to occupy the country as they would have been out numbered thousands to one. In reality less then 2% of French people were actively helping the Allies in any way and a large portion of the population actively helped the Germans as it was felt that the future of France was as a partner of a German Europe.

Harfangdesneiges,"Just a personal anecdote about WWI: I read the diary during the German invasion in 1914 of Lorraine of my grandmother's grandfather. It was terrifying. He didn't know if he'd be bombed by the artillery (French or German, doesn't matter) the next day. Germans soldiers were living in his house, stealing stuff. His beasts were stolen or lost. People were dying of diseases around him, and he was ill too.

Americans don't know what it's like to have your land taken, your village pillaged, to see impacts of bullets on the walls. They don't know there are woods where you can't wander in because of the bombs planted here 100 years ago, ready to blow up. They haven't seen German bunkers along the coastline. There's not a single war that has taken place on the American land in the entire history of the USA.

On a more general note, some people enlisted when they were 16 or 17. They lied to get into the army, to get killed in atrocious suffering away from their home, in giant, pointless butcheries. My grandmother's brother died in his early twenties because of WWI.

If you're talking about WWII: Sure, the French army surrendered after a few months of war. But they were overwhelmed and beaten. The war didn't stop yet though. I suggest you to read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_resistance). Soldiers in colonies fought under the banner of the [FFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_French) (Forces Françaises Libres: Free French Forces) and kept on fighting against the Axis outside of France.

Intetsvar123,"A little bit of background info here. Growing up in a small, Scandinavian town, I never really believed in God, nor does the majority of my family. We still go to church that one time of year, if we find time (Christmas), have Confirmations (those are actually a big deal in Denmark). What I mean to say, is that I grew up with many people believing and many others not believing, but there was virtually no aggressiveness between us. It's just ""Do you believe in God? Oh you do? Cool."" or ""You don't? Nah, I don't really know either"". 

I just live for happiness. Or, I try to. When I think of the people who matters to me - my best friend, my sisters, my parents, my fiancé, etc - I don't need a huge motivation, a promise of something after ""this"" life, to keep on going. 

I've never associated being good or having morals as something strictly Christian. I grew up in the very proof that you don't need religion in order to be a good person. Nor do you need to be the exact opposite. These things come from within and from others. Does doing the right thing really seem meaningless to you now? It never was at any point in my 25 years, to me. Think of all of the evil done in the world, with religion as an excuse. If you can take and perversely alter what was once a great idea - religion - into both good and evil, that in itself shows that our motivation and ideas come from within ourselves. 

You don't give people you love gifts or favors because you expect anything in return, do you? Why should anyone only ever do good with the promise of something good in return? Think of how fantastic our already amazingly beautiful speck could be, if we all did good just for the sake of it. *That* alone, should be purpose enough for anyone.

1. Create a Facebook page for your troupe.  Post updates about upcoming performances, but also post random things to get people's attention.

2. Create flyers.  Find someone who is good with Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, hand-drawn art, papier mache, etc., and put them to work designing materials for the shows.

3. Create a web presence.  Beyond Facebook, you should also create a website for the troupe.  Include bios of the cast (be they real or comical), have a section for upcoming performances, and get a mailing list going.

4. CHARITY PERFORMANCES.  It may sound weird, but network with some of the charities in your area, and talk to them about doing perfomances.  They will not only be able to assist you with getting into a venue, but you can also have them link your troupe's website on their site(s).

5. Flash mob-style performances.  Make a plan to carry out a *short* public perfomance.  Show up in costume somewhere, and do a scene or two from the film with the audio playing in the background.

6. Believe it or not, show up at local goth clubs in costume as a group.  I guarantee that you'll garner interest from some of the patrons, especially if the club is 21+.  Bring flyers.

2 cups flour

1 cup sugar

1/2 tsp. baking powder

1/2 tsp. salt

1/2 tsp. baking soda

1 egg, slightly beaten

2 T. butter

1/2 cup orange juice

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Add egg, orange juice, and butter melted in the hot water. Blend together. (will be slightly sticky), add cranberries at the end. Put mixture in a greased loaf pan and bake for one hour at 325 degree oven. Remove from pan at once. Brush with melted butter.

BornToClaire-ify,"My uncle had just married into the family. My grandparents (his in-laws) are very strict, quiet people. Military household. 

We're all having dinner and one of the kids asks him to pass the ketchup. She starts to shake the bottle side to side and he says, ""No, that's not how you shake it. You do it like this...""

Then, thinking it was a screw-on cap, he grabbed the bottle by the bottom and swung it in a circle...

The cap popped open and we had a line of ketchup across the table, on the walls, and on the ceiling.

Bakgon,"My uncle joked about how my grandmother used to ride on velociraptors to catch her turkey dinner back in the old ages.  Well my grandmother was well into her handle of vodka and decided to teach my uncle by jabbing him in the hand with a fork, except instead of a light jab she full on stabbed this fork through his hand.  He screamed and stood out of his chair knocking over my brother who was bringing the turkey to the table.  Of course the turkey skyrocket into the air and landed on my little cousins lap.  Luckily for me I was in the far corner so I was able to watch this whole scene play out before my very eyes.  For some reason I remember it in slow motion, which is great.  As all of this was unfolding everyone was completely silent until the turkey came crashing down.  My little cousin started crying and that brought everything to life. The waterworks really started to show, relatives were screaming at each other, the little kids were crying and my uncle was just holding his wrist with his injured hand in front of his face silently gazing at it.  His eyes slowly moved up and looked into mine and for some reason we both burst into a hellish fit of laughter.  I practically fell over as I walked over to him to escort him to the car.  When we got back to the house from the hospital a few hours later (his hand was mostly fine, luckily no major nerves were damaged, the fork got him close to the meat of the thumb) everyone was just sitting in the living room silently.  They all looked up as we entered and there was an awkward lapse of words until my uncle whipped out the fork and said ""fork you mom!""  Laughs were had all around.

Being super open about it. This is something that is not easy for everyone. I am a person who wears my heart on my sleeve and with that I leave myself open to being taken advantage of but I have experienced quite the opposite response. People have offered me their perspectives on hardships and what they have gone through in life and thus I have been able to gain new perspectives.

I had both my parents in the sense that they were married, and we all lived in the same house.

Sure all his stuff was there, and he was physically in the house, but mentally and emotionally he was dead. He never spoke to me, or did the things other fathers do for/with their daughters.

It impacted me far more than I like to admit. I had absolutely no idea what a healthy relationship looked like because I'd never seen one, which became glaringly obvious when I started dating. My concept of a relationship was hugely different than that of the guys I was with...I had no clue how to communicate with a partner, because I experienced my emotions differently, and still do (I don't feel my emotions, I think them).

The information they learn in school is funded by the pet food companies, so the information is biased.

You'll notice these special diets sitting around on the Vet's shelves (c/d, l/d, t/d, etc) and they are all made by the same company that makes Science Diet.  One look at the ingredients on the back of the Science Diet bag should make you question why your vet wants you to feed this to your dog. By products, corn/grain, fillers, chemicals galore.   Do your own research about what kind of food to feed your pet. You'll be glad you did.

He basically wasn't giving me what I needed (simple things, like calling me once or twice a week, or doing things with me just the two of us, or keeping his promises/plans we made). So we would just be friends, and then a few months later we'd reconcile and get back together. He'd ""change"" for a week or two, and then back to the same 'ol. So we'd split up again. After a while, I eventually met and became friends with someone in the time my ex and I weren't together, and we hit it off and yeah. Would I do it again? Probably not. I just wanna be with one person, with no complications.

We were quite the motley crew! Anyway we were able to find our own house, which we spent one whacky day fixing up - it was a blast! We even got sponsored by a big time fraternity ourselves. The jocks just wouldn't leave us alone, though - they kept calling us ""nerds"" and making us feel unwanted. It was tough, but we used our superior intellect to vex them regularly! We did this panty raid on the hot girl sorority, too - I'll never forget that night!
In the end, we fought for our respect and won the talent show. I even hooked up with the hottest sorority girl on campus (had to do a little trickery with a Darth Vader mask, ha ha). She learned that we ""nerds"" weren't just brains and computers and funky robots, for sure!

* Removing a tab of uncomfortable fabric from my new shoes.  
* Popping the metal shielding off of an old bearing.  
* Reaching for my credit card when it fell under a cabinet.  (Hand wouldn't fit underneath)    
* Cutting a bagel.  
* Picking under my nails.  
* Removing old tape off my workbench.

Even if I didn't use my knife so often, I would still carry it.  It's so unobtrusive to carry around, that I often forget that it's in my pocket or waistband.  

Finally, having a knife handy saved me from a possible bout of hypothermia while hiking once, and I wouldn't be surprised if it saves my life in the future.  Maybe I'll need to cut a jammed seat-belt to get out of a car, or break a window to get out of a building.  It's a tool that I would rather have and not need, rather than need and not have.

I'm surprised that more people don't carry a pocket knife.  It is my favorite versatile tool, and carries great value to me.",null,0,cdno6pu,1rih36,AskReddit,new,3

I got a GED instead, worked several jobs, I now went back to that same job, I got married, moved and have a great resume for a 23yr old. It's just a checkbox on a job app called GED/diploma. They never ask you which.

Now I am 23, I am doing better than most everyone I went to school with, without a mountain of debt. The years they spent in school, I spent starting my life and I would consider that I have a life comparable to people ten years my senior.  

That being said I would get paid better if I had a degree I am sure, but I feel it's okay to earn that money through experience. That is, after all, the point of education, gaining knowledge and experience in the field you want to make a life with.

Eepaman,"I'm only 15, and from Sweden. 
We're kinda late with internet trends and stuff, but thanks to fj, reddit and older brothers I was kinda early with them. 
Things that I did before friends did:

Use memes, and know what they are. 
I've hung on funnyjunk (no hate) for 3 or 4 years, but my friends all started with 9gag. 

Listen to the song thrift shop. 
I shared the song with my friends sep 2012 and they hated it. 
In jan 2013 they all loved it.
Same thing happened with gangnam style and Harlem shake, but with those it was just a couple of weeks or so. 

Have a cap/hat that's folded so it's smaller, and were it more on top of your head, instead of around (if that makes sense). 

I also fold up pants, wear second hand and find new stuff. 

Because of me listening to underground music, wearing different clothes than other people and discover Internet trends way faster than they do, my friends call me hipster...

Even though I might qualify as a hipster, I don't like the term as it's now mainstream to be hipster which doesn't make sense. 

tl;dr i discovered Internet trends, new clothes and music way before my friends and is therefor called hipster.

Edit: also got ( with the help of some friends) the whole school to start playing League Of Legends. 
I started playing it the second week of s2 I think.

carbidegriffen,"I was driving a right hand drive late 80's jeep Cherokee.  I live in the states and at the time I'd never been in a right hand drive car.   
Raistlin Majere (from dragonlance) was riding shotgun.  We were in a city made of legos.  In the back seat was Shannon Long (a playboy playmate from the 80's).  We were hunting for something, I don't know what.  I was driving while hanging out the window like a dog waving a big stick/staff.  
We just kept driving through the city.  There were ""things"" like shadows or clouds that would run from us, they were evil, but scared of us.  I remember feeling fear, that visceral fear that only happens in dreams, fear for the sake of fear.  
Eventually we left the city and drove to a grassy wooded hill.  Raistlin got out of the car and walked into the woods.  
Shannon and I got it on, on a blanket on the ground.  

The really odd thing about this whole dream is that it was like a nightmare, but I wasn't afraid, I felt fear but I liked it, I guess.  
Ever since that dream, this was HS about 20 years ago, I have never had a ""scary"" dream, with monsters or demons, etc.

Whiit,From a girl who is dating a non-romantic guy: sometimes men don't realize that u r one the type of girl who likes all the cutsie stuff... Send him cute text messages saying ur feelings sometimes. don't wait on him bc if u don't show the cute romantic stuff that u should as a gf he may not think u like it or he should. Once I realized it was in part my fault as well and was able to state to him what I want from a relationship he was also able to give me feedback on if he wanted the same thing. U don't have to tell him what to do but sometimes just communicating the type of relationship u want and being willing to show him romantic gestures like back massaging or foot rubbing or whatever your bf really enjoys (mine enjoys me feeding him) can spike something in him to be like I want to show this girl how special she is to me as well.

My wife thinks that sending flowers to her office is stupid. Some of her coworkers' husbands do that.

She has very specific tastes in jewelry, and while I've gotten it right most of the time, it's better for her to chose what she likes. Rose petals on the bed? They'll just stain the sheets and are a pain to clean up.

I do things for my wife that demonstrate that I love her all the time. I cook for her, bring her breakfast in bed, plan fun trips camping or flying out to somewhere new. We'll sometimes just go to our favorite sushi place, on a spur of the moment. She loves to cuddle, so sometimes it's just a simple thing like going to bed early with a kettle of tea and cuddling against each other while reading.

We talk about this - I ask her what she wants, and I suggest things to go. ""You want to cuddle?"" ""YES!!!!"" And off we go! You don't have to say, ""I want you to be more romantic."" Put it in other terms: ""I want to spend more time with you, doing something fun. Let's try..."", and then find something you'd both like.

 I heard a scream and turned around to see our concrete pourer writhing on the ground just on the edge of the rebar. As I got closer I realised how fucking horrific his injury was. He had stepped between the rebar as he was walking and snapped both his fibula and his tibia clean in half. It was bleeding and his fibula was protruding through his leg. 

My role in his care was basically talk to him and try and keep him still. I don't really know what they did to his leg before the ambulance got there, because I was too busy avoiding eye contact with the area. So gross and mentally scarring. ",null,0,cdnklk8,1rift1,AskReddit,new,2

Beyond the element of actual absurdity, which itself is great comedic material, you come to realize that dumb looking memes themselves look dumb when in fact are quite challenging to create. To create a dolan comic, for example, there has to be a lot of thinking behind it, because it actually follows a pattern that *must* adjust to the premise and, say, ""rules"" behind the meme.

I like dumb memes because they have to be actively **curated**, in order for them to continue to be funny they must be held accountable to formatting and style, in all of its sillyness. That's why dolan (and doge, as of late) went into decadence after around a year in the spotlight (CANSUR). No curation, no consolidation.

imar0ckstar,"When I was 16, my mom asked me if I wanted to go for a ride with her to pick up my Step-dad from work.  On the way back home, we passed a car accident which had turned into a car fire.  I started freaking out saying it was my friend Rob.  I had no way of knowing this being that it wasn't his car and I had never seen that car before but somehow I knew it was him.  I made my parents stop and as the car was engulfed in flames, my step-dad did everything he could to free the trapped person from the back seat.  He even burned himself in the process.  I could hear the person screaming.  After the police and Fire dept arrived, we left and I tried to calm down.  When I got home, I called Rob's house to re-assure myself it wasnt him.  His mother said he had just gone to Walmart with some friends.  That is right where the accident was and I knew it must have been him, and I had to hang up without telling his mom.  I didnt want to worry her in case I was wrong.  Turns out, it WAS my friend Rob.  I was devastated.  That night, after crying myself to sleep, I had a dream just before I woke up:  An angel wrapped me in her arms and told me that everything was ok now.  She said Rob was feeling much better and that he would be fine, she would look after him.  I woke up feeling SOOOO much better.  It was like a flood of relief, a peacefulness.  I walked down the stairs and saw my mom on the phone crying.  She was on the phone with the hospital.  Rob had died 5 mins ago.  While I dreamt  the angel was comforting me and taking him to heaven.

TLDR - An angel visited me in my sleep to tell me my friend had died and comfort me.

NonsensicalSteph,"I used to wake up in the middle of the night and see human-like figures standing around in my room when I was renting a house in an older neighborhood near ""Historic Main Street"" of our town. The house sat across the street from very large, very prominent power lines/poles/whateverthetechnical term is. 

Sometimes these shadowy figures would be next to the bed, or leaning over the bed looking at me, standing near the window playing with the curtains, or just standing around in various places. I would wake up from a deep sleep and see them, like they had intended for me to wake up. I would normally gasp loudly, which would wake my boyfriend (now fiance) who would calm me down and help me get back to sleep. He thought I was having night terrors until he started seeing these figures as well. He stopped staying over as often after that. 

We moved into an apartment in another town two years ago and have not seen these shadow people since moving out. I don't know if it was the power lines or being in the historic part of town, or a combination of both that made these things appear, but I definitely think the experience was paranormal and not something manifested by my own brain.

twilightmoons,"I got lots... my parents' house had weird stuff going on when I lived there. I could go on about that for a while... A guy died in my house, but it's quiet - nothing really weird happens there. However, here's the two weird hotel incidents I recall:

This isn't really a scary story... Well, I wasn't scared, just annoyed at it. Others have said they'd have ran out the door and out of the hotel, regardless of the time.

Day after Mardi Gras, I was in New Orleans on a business trip, staying at a hotel in Buckhead. All normal, no issues. I had to repair a server for work, and couldn't finish at the job site. I ended up taking it with me back to the hotel so I'd have time to finish getting it set up for training the next day.

I worked on it until about 1:30 at night, and finally finished. I took a quick shower, and jumped in bed. I'm lying there, and all is quiet - the Mardi Gras crowds have already left the city for the most part, and no one's walking the halls of the hotel. I have my eyes closed... and an just settling in to get to sleep....

**I hear someone taking a piss in my toilet.**

Standing up, just taking a nice, 7-8 second piss, draining their bladder.

My first thought is just a ""WTF"" moment... and I sat upright in bed. It's not coming from another bathroom above or below - it sounds like it's right there next to me. The room lights are off, but there's a little light coming out from under the door to the room and I can make out my surroundings. There's no one in the bathroom, and the splashing sounds stop. Definitely splashing - this did not sound at all like a toilet tank that was refilling.

I'm just sitting in bed, looking at the open door to the bathroom, when I hear footsteps.

Fucking footsteps.

I could hear them as they walked out of the bathroom, towards my bed, then turned to walk in between my bed and the TV, over to the window, and stop. Nothing ""scary,"" just like someone's done with their pissing and heading to the window to take a look outside.

Nothing more... just quiet.

I sat there for a few minutes, wondering what the hell was going on. Finally, I just said, ""fuck it"" to myself, got up to see what was in the toilet. Nothing - I had flushed before I went to bed, and it was clean. No tank on this toilet, either... just a pressurized low-flow model. I got back in bed, and a few minutes later heard someone walking down the hall - completely different sound, and it did not seem it like it from inside the room, but obviously from outside in the hallway. In the morning, I heard someone flushing their toilet upstairs, and I could easily hear the difference between that and what I had heard in the night.

Weird as hell... Annoying, but nothing serious.

It was worse at a hotel in San Antonio about ten years ago, when I was lying in bed talking with my soon-to-be wife, and got what felt exactly to be a wet willy in my left ear. Like something wet their finger to get it cold, and stuck it *right* in my ear. THAT pissed me off!

Personage1,"Oooh ooh, I thought about this a lot when I had a super boring job a few years back.

So I came to realize morals come from fear.  Now, there are two types of fear, earthly and supernatural.  Earthly fear is fear for yourself in this world.  Supernatural fear is fear of what will happen to you in the next life.

Supernatural fear has been used to attempt to bring about morals for hundreds of years.

The thing that I found interesting though is that basically every single time we do something immoral, it stems from being afraid in an earthly sense.  We lie, cheat, steal, hurt, what have you because we are afraid.  A person who overcomes their fear will be moral.

Obviously fear doesn't always lead to immoral behavior, but I think immoral behavior comes from fear.

Since my last major break up well over two years ago, all I've managed is the occasional one night stand. This girl just sort of...appeared, she even took my number, we met up about a week later and had an absolutely amazing evening, she came back to mine that night and we had mind blowing sex, followed by cuddles and great bed chat, we stayed up all night naked, talking.

Then the following morning, she tried initiating some morning sexy times, and this time my anxiety filled sober brain takes over and puts a halt to all of that. She's cool with it, we get up and go for breakfast, we held hands, it was lovely. We both have the day off so she comes back to mine, we watch a film, snuggle, sexy times initiated, and yet again I fail to perform. Two for two? Fuck, it's getting a little awkward now but whatever. We hang out the rest of the day. The whole time I'm thinking A. This girl is amazing and I never want her to leave. and B. She probably will leave and not want to come back if I fail again....oh god oh god.

As she's getting ready to leave, she tries one more time, all is going well until condom time, then, flatline. She's obviously frustrated by this point and all I can manage is a meek smile and apology, I didn't want to give her the real reason, that I'm already so head over heels and terrified of messing it up that my junk don't work? Would have scared her away for sure.

I walked her to the train station, again chatting the whole way about anything and everything, though there was a definite awkwardness in the air, I honestly didn't care at that moment, I was just infatuated by everything she said.

adenzerda,"Basically, you're going to need to do two things very well: make people *want* what you're making, and earn their *confidence* that you have the skills and the drive to follow through.

 - Promote, promote, promote. Constant awareness is the biggest thing you can do to get people wanting your product. Find out your 'killer features', your big selling points, and just hammer on those as much as you can (and make sure they're *clear* and *relatable*). Get hype. Enthusiastically answer any and all questions. Spread that Kickstarter page link *everywhere*. You can't just plant an initial seed and then drop off the grid. People are lazy, and they usually need things brought to them.

 - See if any websites in your field will interview you for an article (e.g. if you're attempting to fund a videogame, contact Polygon, IGN, indie gaming sites, gaming blogs, whatever). No target is too out of reach; worst they can do is tell you 'no'. And if they do, ask yourself why they did so. Is your product not remarkable, innovative, or of high enough quality? Are your killer features not as fleshed out as they could be? Taking the videogame example, how did you make it seem fun to play? Did you provide great screenshots that show creative art direction and attention to detail?

 - Try an AMA in a relevant subreddit here when you start out. If there are multiple relevant subreddits, do multiple AMAs or promote the main AMA in the other subs. Then do another one a couple weeks later, near the end of your funding period (you've made progress since then, right?).

 - Have a roadmap of what you're going to be doing at least a half year out, longer if possible. If you've already been working on this project previously, give people a simple timeline of your accomplishments so far. The more history you have, the better.

 - Avoid falling into the trap of trying to get peoples' money via sentiment or sappy stories (e.g. 'my wife and I quit our jobs to make our dream possible'). It might be worth mentioning, but it's not a central selling point. However, *do* be personal. Who are you? Why do you want to make this happen? What about you specifically makes you exceptionally suited to see this through?

 - Be confident. Don't beg people for their money; instead, show them why you are worthy of their investment. People want to know that you know what you're doing. You need to be a rock that people can count on.

 - Get a good designer for your public-facing images and website. If you have a logo, does it look professional? If you have labeling, does it look like something you'd feel confident spending money on in a store?

And always remember, even if your pitch fails the first time around, assess where you fell short. Was it not enough communication? Needed more clarity when talking about your killer features? Didn't have a proof-of-concept? Whatever it was, work on it. Then you can try again a few months down the line.",null,0,cdnlg5u,1rifih,AskReddit,new,3

We went to the Wild Life Park, but the moose was hiding, and sadly we could not see/find him. So naturally we decided the logical thing to do was hop back in the car and head for Cape Breton...CB has lots of moose, surely we would see one there, and it's a beautiful drive and we had nothing better to do. Once again, we were disappointed and saw no moose. By that time it was kind of late, so we decided to just stay on the island for the night, so we let their dad and my mum know we were in CB and would return the next day.

The next morning we discussed our disappointment about not seeing a moose...which brought us to the logical conclusion that the only obvious thing to do was go to Newfoundland. Once again, the 3 of us hop in the car and head for the ferry...once again it had gotten late, and there was no way in hell we were going home that night, so we called home again to let people know that we would not be home that night as planned, but would probably be home the next day or the day after.

mromano90,"Wouldn't say this is the best road trip but certainly entertaining...

Me and my two buddies planned a trip to toronto from nyc via bus. I alerted my bank ahead of time knowing they would cancel my card if it was used out of country. First beer I try to purchase gets rejected. My bank mistakenly canceled my card for the weekend. I proceed to leech off my two friends for the following two days. Sunday morning comes and we miss the first of two busses out. The next one is not until 11pm. Check out of the hotel at noon and drink for the next ten hours in a local bar. 

The rest starts to get blurry...walk to the bus station late with a bottle of gin and tonic mixed. Attempt to ask passengers to rearrange their seating so my and my buddies can sit together. They weren't having it. I remember sharing my drink with a stranger and eventually pass out. Next thing I know the bus is pulled over on the side of the highway and two cops are walking to the back of the bus to drag us off. Apparently we were causing a commotion. Cops dropped us off at the boarder instead of taking us to jail and basically told us good luck. After arguing with boarder patrol we decide to walk over the Rainbow Bridge into the US. Broke and without the use of my credit card where else would we go but the Casino. Mind you we're 19 years old. I give my fake ID to an attendee outside a room with card tables who immediately knows what's up. 20 minutes later two detectives show up at the casino telling me I'm under arrest. They went through security cameras to see if I was gambling in the casino. Luckily I didn't have access to money and wasn't able to gamble. Cops eventually let us off the hook after hearing how terrible our night has been. 

Eventually some friends from SUNY Geneseo (80 miles away) came and picked us up and drove us back to their apartment. Few hours later they drove us to Rochester which was the next stop back to NYC from Toronto. Trip home literally took 24 hours and almost sent me to jail twice.",null,0,cdnknse,1rifam,AskReddit,new,2

We drove all night and got in around midday, promptly started drinking, and had one of the best Saint Patty's days of my life. 
I guess it wasn't that crazy; everything just happened so quickly. Waking up the next morning in NYC and realizing we had been in South Carolina a day earlier was pretty hard to wrap our heads around. And that we had put ourselves through all that pain just so we could go party with friends. I liked where our heads were at.

masterjedirobyn,"I lived in a small town with several hiking trails, and one such trail was perfect for walking dogs. Most of the hikers have dogs with them, and there is kind of an understanding between everyone that dogs can be off the leash if they behave reasonably and are friendly. Granted, I'm sure they're technically supposed to be on the leash by some obscure state law, but this is a small town where everyone knows everyone else's dogs, and when two dogs run up to meet each other on the trail, it's usually just a little tail wagging and butt-sniffing, and a short 'hello, enjoy your hike' between the humans. 

I had just gotten a new puppy, a small cuddly golden retriever named Sunny who wouldn't hurt a fly (This is him: http://i.imgur.com/6skvmjT.jpg ). I was walking on this trail with him off the leash and he plodded up to a lady walking. He wasn't sprinting, just sort of ambled up, wagging his tail the entire time. I called out 'don't worry, he's very friendly' and this lady yelled 'get away from me!' and kicked Sunny with full force. He flew several feet away, crying and whimpering. He couldn't walk for a few moments and I thought for for a second he might be dead. This was the scariest moment of my life- he wasn't ok and needed vet care, but I was also more angry than I have ever been. I have never wanted to simply erase someone from the face of the earth that much. What kind of human being has it in them to kick a puppy who is obviously non-threatening? And to top it all off, she started yelling at me as I was tending to Sunny by saying 'About time these dog owners get taught a lesson. You better leash that animal up before he hurts someone next time'. I would have punched her in the face if I hadn't been concerned with getting Sunny to the vet.

For example, if I want to find out what Chinese restaurants are in the area, in case at some point while I'm there I'm feeling peckish for Chinese, I'll do a search and look at Yelp or other similar websites.  I read the reviews and look to see if they have their own website, where I can view the menu.


Most of the time I travel somewhere, I usually end up staying with friends, so I'll ask their opinions and maybe ask them to drive me there, or else tell me how to get there, if I'm driving my own car.


Sometimes I'll do a bit of both.  I'll look online, say, ""I've found this restaurant or that restaurant that's supposed to be over on such-and-such street.  Have you ever been there?  Do you like it?  Why or Why not?""


Not only do I like to visit some of the usual attractions, such as museums, guided historic tours, and the like, but if there's an event being held there while I happen to be there, that I might be interested in, I'll go down there.  One of the best ways to do this is to search for news websites concerning the area you plan to visit.  They often will advertise or mention events being held in the area.  Government websites pertaining to the cities you plan to visit are an excellent source as well, since the events are orchestrated or somehow organized by the city, or in partnership with the city.

Septaphobe7,"To answer this question first we must define what we mean by ""The Worst Kept Secret"". 

For something to be secret, it must be known by at least one person, and not known by at least one person. That's the first hurdle a fact has to pass before it can be a secret.

A secret must also be actively hidden. No one knows I had two cups of coffee today, but I'm not hiding that fact. Quite the contrary, I'm posting it on Reddit. Even though there are people who will not find out, the fact that I am publicly posting this means that I am not keeping it a secret. It might be a secret if I was only publicly posting it because I knew the one person who can't know I drank two cups of coffee doesn't read Reddit, but there is no such person, so not a secret. For it to be a secret, I would have to expend at least a small amount of effort to keep the information hidden. If Billy Bob of 123 Fake St doesn't know that 4 out of 5 doctors recommend chewing Orbit, that doesn't make it a secret, because no one is actively keeping him from finding out. So a secret must be actively hidden.

The fact also must be interesting. Nobody but me knows that I had two cups of coffee today, but nobody cares. Nobody would bother to commit the fact to memory if they did know, and therefore I would have no interest in keeping the fact a secret. So a secret must be interesting. 

Now we've determined that for a fact to be a secret, it must be known and unknown each by at least one person, it must be interesting, and it must be actively hidden. So the best kept secret would be the one which was the most covered up, and known to only one person, which was interesting. On the contrary, the worst kept secret, would be that which was the least covered up (while still an attempt was made to cover it up), known to all but one person, and was still quite interesting. By this criteria, it would be the fact that your mother is a slut. Sorry you had to find out about it this way, but it's not worth the minimal effort to keep the information from you anymore. And yes, everyone but you knows.",null,12,cdnkj7t,1rie19,AskReddit,new,35

[He understands behavior modification without extreme or even substantial punishment, just minor negative reinforcement.](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/win-and-fail-are-also-prohibited).  The Epic Jar is later used to buy the kid an X-Box as well, allowing for positive reinforcement due to the kid's growth.

[He is encouraging without being belittling of strange or unusual preferences.](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/thats-a-couple-days-of-not-shaving-for-ya)  And [nonstandard people, for that matter](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/every-rose-has-its-thorn).

He allows for his kid's creativity [to shake the norms by creating something he knows is probably unhealthy, but is willing to try it just to see how it works out](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/cant-knock-it-until-you-try).

[He respects things that can be taken at a glance to be unmanly or effeminate, even before fully understanding the reason behind them.](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/im-not-sure-cyborgs-are-supposed-to-be-drinking-beer)  There's no insults, belittling, simply a statement of fact that he observes.

Maybe it depends on what kind of college student you are. Are you focused and able to buckle down? Then you'll be able to get some job and get out of the folk's house. Are you a slacker who is too lazy to find and hold a job? Then your life is gonna suck but you""ll always have the option to bring yourself out of it, if you have a supportive family who put you through college. Which I assume by default if you're a slacker. Either way, if you are already above the poverty line then it's only gonna suck if you decide it sucks.

On the other hand, I feel very accomplished having a good job at 23, and it's very rewarding to earn the respect of people twice or thrice my age .  Also, I get to dress like a boss everyday.  If you have a group of other young professionals to hang out with I think it can be as enjoyable as college, so long as you sufficient time off to do fun stuff.

But if she befriended you out of the blue, and is saying things like that and then admitting she has feelings for him still, I can't see many possibilities other than that she's trying to deliberately break you two up. Women can be cruel and manipulative. If you trust him, and believe that he never did that, then don't believe someone who has feelings for your man. 

My best friend has been with a guy for several years, and we had a married couple we were friends with. Her boyfriend and the wife of our other friend had a short fling (very short), a long time before. She was still very hung up on him, and would always says rude things, and try to tell my friend all sorts of things about how her boyfriend was trying to get back with the married woman.

I would definitely tell the girl that you can't be friends and that you are going to cut off all communication with her given the circumstances.  For him, its going to be tough because even if you sit him down, he probably won't be 100% honest with you about whats going on.  If he told her he still has feelings for her, chances are he was feeling her out to see if he could jump ship from you to her.  People tend to be afraid to be alone, so he would rather stay with you if she wasn't game.  I suggest you two take a break for a couple of weeks (with the agreement of not f'ing other people) and let him gain some perspective about what he really wants.

It's stuck ever since and I think that one word is what brought us closer together, our love of honking.

Based off of Ubisoft's popular series ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon,"" it is an online FPS that is cover-based.  It is unlike any other FPS, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone into PC gaming (Even got my girlfriend hooked on it).  This has to be the best free-to-play FPS in terms of tactics, fairly balanced with the exception of a few guns, and the most important thing, graphics.

Unfortunately, the game has become somewhat pay-to-win, with paying for a category called ""consumables"" in game results in a complete buff over other players (such as grenades which you have to purchase, inserts to make your armor better, and stronger ammo).  However, when you first start the game, this is not a large issue, as people will rather save their in-game currency for newer weapons.",null,0,cdnm9bn,1rid5j,AskReddit,new,3

I've had a couple. The worst was one where I dreamt I had woken up and sent a good morning text to my girlfriend.

This time I received a text from her mom telling me that my girlfriend had been in a wreck on her way to work and was in the hospital. I asked her which but there was no reply. When I woke up, I was depressed beyond belief. I stayed home and looked through my texts and didn't see the one from her mom, but i still didn't feel like it was a dream it felt too real. I couldn't call her phone because we live on a border town (she's in Mexico and I'm in the U.S.). It wasn't until 3pm that she came over to my house and told me she lost her phone.

People stopped to help and pulled her out of her mangled car and then first responders showed up and began CPR on her. They worked on her for a while before they called it and covered her with a sheet and took her away. I was fine, only a bruise on my knee and a little seat belt burn. I stood on the side of the road and watched it all happen. Of course my driving changed after the accident. They did accident reconstruction and verified the accident wasn't my fault. I'm a lot more jumpy as a passenger now (and probably annoying to the driver.) I'm at peace with what happened. I know I couldn't do anything about it. But I still think about her from time to time.

GUTTERbOY001,"I have prepared a handy [visual aid](http://i.imgur.com/gx3Tzq8.jpg) to help everyone understand this story. That picture is a rough floor plan of the bottom floor of my high school girlfriend's house. Now, said girlfriend lived only with her mother, whereas I lived with both my parents, so statistically it made a lot more sense to go to her house when it was time to get it on.

Generally speaking, said sexytime would take place upstairs in her bedroom, but on this particular occasion, we didn't make it upstairs and were just going to town on the living room floor. Despite my significant distraction, I had no trouble hearing the very disturbing sound of a key entering the front door lock and turning. Oh shit, her mom is home way early!

At this point, an amazing thing happened. As best I can determine, my SO somehow teleported directly off of my penis and upstairs to her bedroom. I'm serious; I have no recollection of her running out of the room, it was just like once second she was riding me and the next I was lying naked and alone on the living room floor, watching the front door begin to open.

And the worst part was the due to the location of the stairs, I had no hope of a quick escape. I'd have to run directly towards the invading mother to reach the stairs, and I'd surely be seen. And not being seen was at the top of my priority list at the moment; for some reason, I thought that if I could just get upstairs, somehow we could find a way out of this mess, despite the living room floor being covered with discarded garments.

So with my primary path of escape cut off, I had to rapidly improvise. I decided that my only hope of escape was to go through the kitchen, around the front room, and then up the stairs. That would put me behind her mom and hopefully I could escape upstairs. It was a long shot to be sure, but it was all I had. Time to get to it.

As I began to sprint out of the living room, I snagged a pair of jeans off the floor, hoping they were mine. On my way through the kitchen, I tried to pull them on. I was just comprehending that they were not my jeans when I came face-to-face with her mom. She had gone through the front room to the kitchen instead of down the hall, and my master plan has in fact resulted in this awkward standoff, her with a bag of groceries and a shocked expression, and me with a pair of her daughter's jeans halfway up my legs and my junk still wagging merrily at half-mast.

EggAtix,"Freshman year of college I was living with an extremely russian roomate. I'm talking straight out of Vladivostok Russia (thats the bit above Korea). He had, as one might expect, a whole bunch of holes in his cultural makeup. One of the holes was the subtle, universal sign of leaving a sock or a rubber band on the door handle to warn when intercourse is being performed in the room.

Well it was my birthday, and my girlfriend was giving me the best of gifts: birthday sex. I was, at this point, bare-assed on top of her, interfacing my genetalia with her breasts in what the kids have taken to calling ""titty fucking"". It was amazing. I was enjoying myself immensely, taking my time. I'm getting pretty close to finishing when I hear a clicking sound from behind me. The door is to my back, but I look up in time to see the reflection of my roommate in the doorframe. He's looking wide-eyed at my sweaty, bare ass like a deer caught in the highbeams. We make eye contact in the window's reflection, and at that moment a few things happened in quick succession:

* Vlad exclaimed, as one would expect ""Oh Jesus. Oh my god.""

* The adrenaline surge from the shock hits me and tips me over the edge, causing me to ejaculate while making unblinking, shocked eye contact with Vlad

* The surprise causes my girlfriend to instinctively try to sit up, moving her face into the path of my cum, and catching most of it with her nostrils, causing her to being choking violently.

None of us ever talked about it again. I left him one of my birthday cupcakes as a peace offering, and I try not to think about it very often.

I gave him a handjob and he fingered me (we didn't feel comfortable having sex yet since we were both virgins), and we whispered the entire time and tried to minimize our movements, but apparently, that was not enough. The next morning, his sister could barely look us in the eye. Turns out she had heard everything—all the dirty things I had whispered to him about how much I wanted his cock, and how wet I was, and so on and so forth. All three of us wanted to fall through the floor and die. We never did that again, and I still feel horrible about it, nearly three years later.

Fortunately I'd just peeked my head out, but like I said, this was some majorly sexy sexytimes going on, so this boner was not just going to quit because of some children at my door demanding treats.

I of course stopped to answer the phone, he was staying away at the time for work so it could have been important. Anyway, the conversation was brief and went like this:

""Hey mate, could you and your girlfriend keep the noise down? It's great that your mum is okay with you having your girlfriend stay over, but you could please be a bit more respectful for the people you live with?""

""Umm.....what? Where are you?!""

Then I noticed a weird pile of clothes on the ground. Then I noticed the couple on top of the double stacked driers in the laundry room.

dr481,"It was a dark and foggy night. Denise was having trouble staying awake and the road was slick. Her anxiety level was not helped by the fact that she was running low on gas and didn't know where the next town was. Finally, just as she thought she would have to pull over and sleep till morning on the side of the road, a tiny gas station appeared — very rundown, but a gas station nonetheless. She pulled in. The attendant made his way around the car and seemed to be very distracted as she asked him to fill it up, and even seemed to be making faces at her. He finally agreed to get the gas, but then asked her to pop the hood of the car because it ""smelled like trouble."" Her anxiety from being on the road was starting to flare up again, she was all alone in a creepy gas station out in the middle of nowhere and an attendant was finding reasons to keep her there. He asked her to come look at the engine, he had to ""show her something"". Not knowing what else to do, almost as if in a daze, she did as he asked, all the while wondering why she didn't scream. As she rounded the front of the car he grabbed her arm and said, ""This car needs a tow, you'll have to come with me into the office."" Then he put his hand over her mouth and forced her into the office. She began to bite his hand once they were inside and he let her go and said, ""I'm sorry, but there is a man crouched down in the backseat of your car and I didn't want him to know that I'd seen him."" 

They called the police who came to arrest the serial killer who, unbeknownst to Denise, had stowed away in her car and was waiting for the opportune moment to add her to his list of victims.

He got blamed for Columbine for no reason other than that the kids wore black.  Wearing black in those days (and even today) meant you'd get slapped with the Goth label, and the media found the ""scariest"" one to point the finger at.  

[This article](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624) he wrote for Rolling Stone is worth the read if you are interested in what he had to say about the situation.

In addition to the Columbine drama, his imagery has drawn a lot of hate from Christians and paranoid parents.  When the zealots get going, they come up with a lot of crazy shit.  I've heard so many rumors about him, none of them true.

- He didn't get ribs removed so he could suck his own dick.

- He didn't shoot heroin into his pupil and have the iris go blue, it was a contact lens. 

- He doesn't buy Mexican orphans, throw them into the crowd, and refuse to play until their dismembered bodies are thrown back on stage.   

He's just a guy, a very intelligent guy actually, who happens to express himself creatively with decidedly dark imagery.  I don't want to be one of those people who says ""Ugh, No one understands him!!! He's so deep!""  But really, many people just never gave him a chance because of the aura of negativity that surrounded him for much of his career.

Fortunately/unfortunately, mine lasted until my graduation. But don't expect it to cover all your expenses. I worked full time while getting gi bill.

He then separated the guys from the girls and told us that 80% of us were going to re class into infantry and he told us to go and pack our bags we would be leaving that next morning to Ft. Benning for further training. And he told all of the females the would be going to airborne school because the army was short on airborne qualified females.

And lucky for her I'm a fairly neat person so it was never an issue there.  However, when she would stay at my apartment she would never pick up ANYTHING.  Clothes were everywhere.  Lights/TV, and even the oven occasionally was left on.  Dishes were left in the sink.  I didn't even require her to clean them, just rinse them and put them in the dishwasher literally 14 inches away from the sink.  Absolutely drove me nuts how someone could be so peculiar in their own house, but not give a shit at all how messy they made somebody else's.  In my experience it's always been the other way around.

Then I decide to continue Redditing, this time on my laptop. The laptop is on my desk, and *just* out of my reach when I'm leaning off of the bed, which means I have to get out of bed, pick up the laptop, and then get back into bed and try to find the part of the bed that isn't cold.

I'm not very happy at this point.

Now that I have my laptop, I try to boot into Windows. Guess what shows up on my screen?

Guess how many of [these](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/error-apport.jpg) I get? 11, that's how many. Steam won't open, and neither will Chrome.

Bad thoughts are going through my head now.

At this point, I decide to pick up my tablet and play *something* to get my mind off of the horrible state of my other devices. The tablet was also out of reach from my bed, so I have to get out of bed *again*, pick up the device, and then get back into bed once more. Right before I get back into bed, I realize that I should pick up the charger for my tablet, so that I don't end up running out of battery life and breaking things. As I turn back towards my desk, feeling moderately clever for remembering the charger, I stumble, and then I end up slamming my right foot into my [*heavy wooden chair.](http://commercialsupplydistributors.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Heavy-Duty-Wooden-Chair.gif)

However I have heard (but not actually seen for myself) that the 84"" 4k LG was amazing because they used a really good panel - but they have discontinued that line in the stores I am located and the new line of smaller LG 4k's have a much shittier panel (which I have seen for myself).

As for content, there isn't much out there. But a lot of movies are being filmed in 4k now, which means the release of them in that format probably isn't too far off. Also a few sporting events have been filmed in 4k recently (Wimbledon, for example). Oh, and YouTube also allows 4K videos now too. But the main selling point of a lot of 4k televisions is that they will upscale whatever you are watching now. Watching Blu Rays on a 4k television will look much better than Blu Rays on a full HD television.

grownupbraces,"I just told this in another thread but I suppose it will fit here as well:


I used to have a recurring nightmare when I was little that there were a bunch of police and ambulance at the end of my street because there was a psycho killer on the loose, and he had attacked people at the end of my street. Every time I had this dream, he would be closer and closer to my house. The last time I had it I was around 13ish and I ""woke"" (but was still asleep) to see a crazy man in a scary clown mask standing over my bed, and he darted into my little sister's room. Then I heard her scream and jolted awake, to find she actually WAS screaming in real life. I ran into her room and she was wide awake sobbing in bed saying she had a nightmare that a man in a scary clown mask came in her room and started stabbing her.

I never had the dream again after that. 20 years later and it still freaks me out to think about.


**edit:** I am seeing some consistencies in the comments questioning the validity of my story. I swear to you this is 100% true. While I obviously cannot prove a dream, I will try to clear a few things up. 

 - My sister was about three at the time, and still in a toddler bed. I did not ask her about the dream because she was so scared; my only desire at that point was to calm her down. We lived in a split level house so our rooms were upstairs while mom's room was downstairs.

 - Up until this last time I had the dream, I had never seen the creepy clown-mask guy. All previous dreams were just about how there was a psycho killer on the loose and he was getting progressively closer to my house with every dream. So while it is possible she heard me telling our mom about *those* dreams, there is no way that she could have heard me telling mom about the clown guy, because I only saw him that one time, in the last dream.

 - My sister and I have about a decade between us in age, so we were never really *that* close growing up.  We were sisters and loved each other, but we didn't act like best friends. Now that we are older, we are pretty close and we are able to ""communicate"" with each other just through subtle facial expressions. It comes in handy when we are making fun of someone in the room.

 - As far as I know she did not continue having the dreams after they stopped for me. I asked her a few years ago about that night and she had no memory of it. ",null,3719,cdnmtpl,1riazr,AskReddit,new,6413
TheMediaSays,"I was really, really young (like, five or six) so my recall is a bit fuzzy. But I was on vacation with my parents in Massachusetts (we were living in upstate New York at the time) and we wound up going to some sort of street fair. I remember eating a candy apple, pestering my dad about getting some sort of stuffed animal, and stopping by a friend of my parent's apartment for a bit. That's not the creepy part. 

When we left to go back to where we were staying, we got on some sort of bus (I'm pretty sure -- regardless, it was some kind of public transportation). I had a window seat and was looking outside when I saw, walking past, a kid who looked *just like me* down to the haircut and everything. I lowered the window a little bit (just a crack) and shouted ""HEY!"" 

The kid stopped and looked up at me and immediately got this shocked and surprised look on his face, confirming to me that he, too, saw the uncanny resemblance. At that moment, though, the bus pulled away and I never saw him again. 

Thing is, I'm adopted. I often wonder whether I spotted some sort of long-lost brother or something that night, but I don't think I'll ever know. ",null,2475,cdnmikl,1riazr,AskReddit,new,4800

jdpatric,"I lived in Pennsylvania until I was one month shy of being 12. I know that exact date because you had to be 12 to hunt in PA and I was looking forward to it. Anyways, we moved to Florida and I get to hunt down here too so that's OK.

I had a few good friends that lived right down the street from me. We lived out in the country. My address was literally 169^1/2 ______ Road. Middle of nowhere. So we'd hang out at my buddies place, or we'd go up this hill for about half a mile until we reached the burn pile and cabin at the top.

It really was a basic cabin. Outhouse. No lights. Nothing. We'd hang out there, use it as a fort for Nerf battles, manhunt, CTF, etc. Well one night my friend invited a few of his friends/cousins up to the cabin so we could roast marshmallows and play manhunt. 

There were something like 13 of us to start, but the number slowly went down to 10 by nightfall. So we played manhunt 5 vs. 5 in the dark. Around 11 pm we were in the middle of a game and two of my friends had hung back with me because we were the fast ones. We realized that there were only three of us left on our team and that we hadn't captured anyone from their team. We tried to make a jailbreak and lost my friend (We'll call him F). It was just myself and another friend that we'll call ""L."" 

L and I were ~100 yards from the other team and they had 3 of our 5 players now in their ""jail."" They began to press our side more and mess with us until one of them told us we were cheating. L and I looked at each other unable to figure out why. Our side had about 1/4 of it covered heavily in trees. The other side was about the same, with both wooded areas near the back of the sides.

At one point when we were chasing someone off our side I saw L and I running in the same direction and someone on the other side of L. I quickly cut behind L and intended to surprise the other person and nab them on our side (I was probably the fastest person there and I didn't want to be on the team to capture nobody). Once I emerged from behind L's trajectory (we were both running) I saw absolutely no one. Nothing, no trees, no scarecrow, absolutely nothing that I could have mistaken for a person.

I surmised that there had to be someone from the other team hiding behind our lines waiting for us to cross over and then tag us there. Well, the game ended up dwindling down to us with two left and the other side with 4. We capped one person and then all parties were exhausted. I asked the other team (mostly L's cousins) who was behind the line waiting to cap us? No one claimed responsibility. I figured it was someone trying to mess with us.

Back at the cabin we start cooking hot dogs and marshmallows over a fire. We were all 10-13ish with one person being maybe 15 (older cousin), so we we're drinking soda and not beer. Note: If this had been beer and I'd been older, I'd just chalk this up to booze. All 10 of us are around the fire when we saw someone coming up the hill. It's hard to see outside in teh dark when you've been staring at a fire for a while, but at least 4 of us had seen the person so we figured it was one of the people who left coming back, or someone new. 

After about half an hour no one came up. We went and looked and found no one. Being the intelligent young kids we were we decided to investigate further. It's summer, after 12 am, and we're out playing with fire and flashlights looking for a mystery person. Yeah, we were not honor students. We went to the path that led down the hill and could clearly see my friends house in the distance (they left the outside lights on for the dogs), and no one in between. 

Someone was trying to mess with the group so they ran into the woods and came out directly on top of us scaring the crap out of everyone. After we all changed our pants and regrouped we headed back to the cabin only to see someone on the very far side of the clearing. There were three of us with flashlights, and all of us attempted to illuminate this person, but we were too far away to get a good look; as soon as we lit him/her up he/she disappeared into the woods.

OK then, now a few of us are freaking out. Six people decide to go down to my friends house to spend the rest of the night where ""the ax murderer from hell"" won't be able to get them. Since they have 6 and the 4 of us who decided to ""rough it"" are only 4 the group of 6 got two flashlights. I was the only one left with one.

We decided to figure out who this was. L had an uncle who was only 10 years older than him who we figured was just fucking with us. We knew his place was less than a mile from where we were (big extended family, large family plot of land). L, F,one of L's cousins (gonna call him ""C""), and myself began to walk across the clearing. Once we were about 40 feet from the edge of the woods we could hear someone moving around in the brush. Not stomping or anything, but very carefully moving through the fallen sticks and underbrush trying to make as little noise as possible. We figured it was L's uncle, we'll refer to him as ""Uncle J.""

So we split up again and two people waited in the clearing (F and L's cousin) and myself and L went into the woods to try to flush out Uncle J. We figured F and C could see OK from the clearing, and to be honest they actually could. L and I eventually were about 50 feet INTO the woods (further than we thought we'd need to go) when we heard this low rumble noise. This is one of those times when I regretted trying to act macho. L and I kinda looked at each other to make sure it was neither of us ""rumbling,"" and basically just stopped dead in our tracks.

I shined the flashlight up in the direction of the noise (directly away from the clearing and the fire) and couldn't see anything. There was just nothing there. It was, to this day, one of the most eerie noises I've ever heard. Like a noise a Halloween decoration would have made, but real. We stayed about 50 feet into the woods, never venturing much further in, and searched the general area. Never found anything.

After about half an hour of this (it's now past 2 am) we heard a noise just at the edge of the clearing and both of us turned around. I had expected it to be F and C coming to figure out what the fuck was taking us so long. But instead, I see one person basically hiding halfway behind a tree looking at us. I've never not wanted to shine my flashlight on something before that moment. If it was dark, I wanted to see what it was. But in the distance, well past the shadowy character, I could see F and C milling about by the fire. I had this awful feeling that there was no way Uncle J was being this creepy. I didn't want to see who it was, and I really just wanted to get away from this person. I mean the hair on the back of my neck stood straight up.

L must have seen it too because he started slowly backing FURTHER into the woods. We moved in as wide a circle as we could around this shadowy person and managed to make it back to the clearing. We got back to the cabin and grabbed F and C and began to make our way back to L's place. When we were about 100 yards from the cabin we heard it's door slam and we fucking bolted.

When we made it back to L's house near the bottom of the hill, we debated what to do; should we call 911? Was that a trespasser? Or was that simply a family member messing with us. L went to notify his parents who we figured would be overjoyed at the premise of being woken up around 3 am by a bunch of sweaty terrified 11 year olds. 

They weren't home. Apparently L's grandfather had a heart attack around 10 pm. None of us had cell phones as it was 1998, and so no one had been notified except for L's 19 year old step cousin (I never really figured out this relationship TBH) who had drank himself near blackout drunk as soon as the adults left him in charge of all the younger kids up at the cabin. Seriously, he got reamed the next day by basically every adult in attendance. That meant that uncle J, and basically every other of L's family members who could have been messing with us were at the local hospital with the patriarch of the family who'd had a mild coronary.

At 4:00 am we knew sleep wasn't an option and began to watch and wait for the shadow guy to show up at the bottom of the hill. Less than 10 minutes later I hear a sound coming from upstairs...only problem is...there's no upstairs to L's house. There's something (someone?) on the roof. L grabs his pellet gun (cause that's going to be super effective) and we go outside (cause, you know, we're smart and stuff).

We shine ever flashlight straight up at the roof and see a completely black silhouette jump off the far side of the house in a mad sprint. The way L's roof was shaped the part he (it?) jumped off of was over 25' high; there was a huge vaulted ceiling in the back room of the house and the roof was even taller to accommodate for the attic. We watched it run away from the hill and towards the creek (10' wide maybe 2' deep) and we followed it until we realized how much faster it was than us.

Once it reached the edge of the creek, it stopped and looked back at us. This rumble thing came back and it jumped the creek, and we lost it.

The next day we told L's parents and they informed us that the cabin was being torn down. A cow had been killed and dismembered IN THE FUCKING CABIN early that morning, presumably after we left. It could have been a panther (cows weren't uncommon on that part of the property, but they tended to avoid the people), it could have been a bear, but fuck, we never went back up that hill at night. No way, no how. Never saw that thing again. Might not seem like much, but to 11 year old me...I had a new face for fear.",null,719,cdnnila,1riazr,AskReddit,new,2380
Cats_in_Outer_Space,"I was 13 at the time and trying to go to sleep at a reasonable hour as it was a school night and trying to get my full 8 hours, and it was what all the cool kids were doing. However, as the night drug on it was impossible for me to relax; I felt so anxious and I was wide awake for hours. My room was very dark, but I resolved that if I closed my eyes and turned on my side maybe I could calm down. 


The instant I shut my eyes I felt someone touching my arm, brushing my hair, and stroking the side of my face. It was the most real thing I had ever felt, I could feel the soft, warm pads of someone's fingertips moving across my arm, I could hear my hair rustling and moving as I felt my hair being stroked. I was terrified--I couldn't bring myself to move, more than my legs to confirm no, this was not sleep paralysis.  Despite everything potentially awful about this situation I lost the sense of fear I had originally, and more than anything else it was comforting. I think this mysterious but very real sensation of someone stroking my face went on for more than half an hour until I built up the courage to turn around and look for the source of this strange happenstance. I really, truly expected to look around and not see anything but instead my eyes focused immediately on a person leaning over my bed. I saw a dark outline of a man standing on the side, I felt we locked eyes but everything so so dark but we looked at each other for several minutes, and became very distraught and sad for reasons I could not explain. Then he was gone. I was barely breathing out of terror, but throughout the entire time a sense of calm had permeated into the room. I sat up and pulled myself out of the bed and into the hallway. I needed to go see my parents to tell them, even though I had no idea what I would say or what even happened.


Suddenly a great commotion came out of my parents bedroom--the lights were all on, my mother is screaming and my father is yelling and I hear shuffling in their room. I run down the hallway thinking there are intruders in the house, and what I saw in my room is somehow connected. I fling the door open and see a strange picture of absolute chaos although absolutely nothing had changed. There were no ax murderers, no tornado, but my parents were a wreck.  I soon gather that my parents had received the phone call that my older brother had died unexpectedly only a little while earlier. 


I never believed in the paranormal and still don't; however, I would like to think our sibling wavelengths were always so intune my brain kind of freaked out a little when it lost that connection. Other very strange stuff happened after that I can only guess was something along the line of my brain being out of tune for a bit. Whatever it was, it still kind of freaks me out every now and then to remember how real it seemed.

jdpatric,"2:00 am this past July. It's a twofer. I've posted this before, but it still weirds me out thinking about it.


My one year old wakes up screaming. Not terribly uncommon. I go in and try to console her. Give her a bottle...nothing. She is freaked the fuck out. It happens. She'd been doing this ""night terror"" thing lately where she just woke up terrified (presumably from a nightmare).


My wife takes her shift and tries to calm her down. Nothing. So around 2:30 I decide it's time for a car ride. We have two cars and we took my wifes Yaris. We load the screaming baby into the car, back out of the garage and are on our way. I know a nice ~30 minute drive into the ""country."" We live in a pretty big ""town"" so we had to drive a little to get out of it. The roads are empty at 2:30 am so I wanted to get a good long drive in to make sure the baby stayed asleep.

Once we're ""out of town"" I head down a long stretch of basically middle of nowhere road. I hang a right onto an even smaller road (45 mph speed limit) and after about a mile down this road I see something strange. There are ditches on either side of the road filled with water ~3' deep. I've biked the road myself before (I do a 25 mile loop) and I know that there isn't much shoulder room.

Up ahead I can see traffic cones blocking the road off. No signs for roadwork. No warnings. No light at all, the cones just block the road. Wat. So at this point I'm expecting to be a victim of a highway robbery. My wife and I kinda look at each other a little nervous and I realize I need to make a quick 3 point U-turn.

Now, I want to preface this part with the fact that I was pretty creeped out to begin with, so this could have been my mind playing tricks on me, but I'm pretty sure that I saw what I saw. I slow the car down at the last possible second, begin to make the turn and as my headlights pass over the ditch on the left side of the road I see the silhouette of a person standing on the other side of the water. My wife was looking the other way to make sure no cars/psychos with chainsaws came from the other direction, so she didn't get as good a view as I did. As soon as I got that car straightened out I went from 0-60 in...well...it's a Yaris (like a step or two up from a Geo) probably not terribly fast, but I had that fucker floored. We got the hell out of dodge and went straight back home.

We get home and we go to put the (now) sleeping baby back down. As we enter her room we notice that her closet door is open. We make it a habit of closing the closet door because we (well, mostly I) think it's creepy for her closet door to be open at night. Did we leave it open? Maybe. That's not the end of it though. My curiosity now piqued I decide to make sure the remainder of the doors in our house are shut and locked. The front door wasn't locked. Did we forget to lock it? Maybe. Why was the baby crying? Cause she's a baby? Maybe.

I ""slept"" the rest of the night sitting in a chair in the living room with the TV on, while hugging the thick end of a two piece pool cue.",null,468,cdnoxew,1riazr,AskReddit,new,1913
The_Dalek_Emperor,"OK, when my daughter was 2 she started talking about a man who lived in her closet. She said he would come out at night and wake her up and talk to her. He said he lived in a hole in her closet and would take children down the hole. She said he had black eyes. 

This went on for about a week with me trying to shrug it off, I really don't believe in the paranormal. But man, she was consistent. 

The whole thing ended when I woke up one night to her screaming bloody murder. I ran into her room (other side of the house) and she told me the man with the black eyes said that I (her mother) was dead and would she come down the hole with the man. He said she had to say yes so he could take her. She said no and whatever happened next (I could never get that out of her) made her start screaming and crying. When I got to her room, I will say that the closet door was wide open and I shut it every night because of her nightmares. That freaked me out a bit too. 

I moved her into my room and wouldn't let her back into hers. We moved out of that house a month later anyway, so I just had her sleep with me from then on. She stopped talking about him. 
I wrote several paranormal investigative groups to see what they would say. I never actually went back to check their answers because she stopped talking about it.

Whether it was all in her head or not, it is the single creepiest thing that has ever happened to me.

limsical,"When I was 16, this guy called my house asking for a ""Mark"". I politely told him that there was no Mark living in the house, and he had the wrong number. He continued talking to me. He said, ""You have such a beautiful voice!"" ""You are so funny"" etc. I wasn't even saying anything to him, except ""You have the wrong number..."" and ""You sound drunk."" etc. I hung up on him about 5 minutes into the creepy conversation. I thought that was the end of that, but I was wrong.

A week later, this *guy* showed up at my house, asking to see me. My sister called me down, and I went outside to talk to this man. (I should add, he was about 30 years old). He said, ""Do you know who I am?"" 

Me: No...

Him: We talked on the phone about a week ago. Wow, you are so beautiful up close.

Me: Up close?

Him: *crying* I love you so much!

He tried hugging me but I punched him in the ""area"", ran inside, and said, ""fuck you! Go away before I call the police!"" He didn't leave, so I called the police.

Turns out this guy had been stalking me for about two months. He called me to try and start some sort of relationship, but since it didn't work, he went crazy and came to my house. He didn't try touching me, besides the hug. He did spend a little time in prison, and was put on medication. Eventually, he apologized to me saying that his wife left him for his best friend. He went to the park to get some air, which is when he saw me. Apparently I looked a lot like his wife, and became obsessed with me. He is doing good now, and actually is extremely ashamed of what he did. It's still the creepiest thing that ever happened. To know that someone was watching your every move for a whole two months... it's weird.

Edit: I DO NOT STALK MY STALKER. My lawyer keeps tabs on him to make sure whatever he is up to isn't involving whatever I'm doing. She often updates me on how he is doing. Him and his wife got divorced, and he now has a girlfriend. He's extremely involved in church, and does a ton of community service. I really feel awful for the guy.

WeightLiftingLulu,"Creepy and simply unsolved. Had a roommate in college, that I met a week prior to moving in thru a posting on one of the school boards. We met each others families and they helped move us in, we rented one side of a twin house with some stairs so the help was needed for the bedroom furniture. We had our own bedrooms, and we were the odd couple, she had a messy room with clothes, books, etc. everywhere, and I was simple. About a month in, she started complaining about having a tough time sleeping, something was keeping her up, and she had a few weird bruises and scraps on her back, we didnt know where they came from, she didnt have a boyfriend or anything, we were both nerds and studed or watch movies, no sports. 

Then one night, I came home from the library around 11pm. My roommate was home watching a movie. I said goodnight and went to bed. 

Woke up at 7am for class. 

Walked by her room and her door was open. As I walked by I looked into her room as I walked by. Her entire room was empty. She was gone. No note. I called the cops, and they didn't believe me that I had a roommate and left, even after showing the cops her parents checks then send for rent. I called her cell, disconnected. Called her parents, disconnected. Asked around campus, no record of her. To this day I have no idea how she moved all her stuff out between 11pm and 7am without me hearing anything and waking up (I'm a light sleeper) and as of 11pm no one was in the house to help her. 

To this day I can't explain it, hence, its the creepiest thing that has ever happened in my life. I moved out a week later. 

TL;DR Moved into house with roommate I hardly knew, everything seemed ok. She couldnt sleep, weird brusies and scrapes appeared. Roommate Disapeared. 

Edit: Ok, this is getting some attention from people, and it's actually pretty cool therapy for me to talk about it with strangers from all over that can share their experiences. I am seeing some /nosleep and other comments about the paranormal part of it, please keep in mind i am a rational person but what i am about to say, i dont even understand what to think and again i just passed it off. Figure people want more details so whatever, i mentioned early i left a few weeks later, one of my classmates actually asked about housing and i mentioned i just movted out of a place, and i told her it was up for rent since i peaced out, didnt get into the details of course. My classmate ended up moving into the twin, she and two her best friends. About a month later my classmate came up to me out of no where and told me her roommate/best friend pack up all her stuff and moved out telling my classmate if she ever asked why she was leaving she would never talk to her again, this girl's best friend was in the same hardwood floor room my roommate slept in and also complained of not getting good sleep and bruises an scratches.

Get_Ya_Eagle_On,"I'm sure there's a explanation for this but still creeped me out. 

My family and I went out to the lake one day and my Dad accidentally dropped his cellphone into the water. So the next day he gets a new one, new number, everything. I was sitting by my dad while he was working on his laptop and he says, ""That's weird...my old number is calling me."" So he answers it and a confused look appears on his face. He puts it on speakerphone so I can hear it too and it is just a loud gargled sound like someone breathing heavily into the phone. It went on for about a minute or so before we decided to just hang up. 

Edit: For those wondering why he got a new number, this was a handful of years ago (8 or so) so I'm not sure what the circumstances were with keeping your number back then, or if he just decided to change service with a new phone or what. It was definitely his old number that called though.  ",null,275,cdnkgvu,1riazr,AskReddit,new,1127

Alone, in our apartment, around 11:00 pm. I hear the
 doorbell ring. Wtf? Who? Fortunately, we live on the top floor. There is a window in the hall that looks down onto the front porch. I peer out of it to catch a glimpse at my mysterious late night guest. It is a man. 

I call out to him from the window. Can I help you? He looks up at me and asks, ""Is Matt home?"" I am startled by the question. I do not want to let this stranger know my guy is out of town. ""You're a friend of Matt's?"" I manage. 

He replies, ""He called me and told me to come over."" Impossible, I think. My husband is across the country. 

What's your name, I ask. 

He looks at his phone. Pauses. Unsure of how to respond. Finally, he offers up the name John. 

 I grab my cell from my pocket and call my husband. Frantically, I descibe to situation to him once he picks up. There is a man.Do you know a John?! He says you invited him over. Who is this man?! 

My husband assures me he has no idea who this guy is or why he is at our door. I believe him.

I yell down to ""john"" and ask if I need to call the police?! My husband does not know him. Leave. 

He is startled...nervous... slowly backing away. And then leaves for good. 

How did he know my husband's name? 

Edit: mail is usually pushed through mail slot and spills onto the foyer floor. Who knows how John knew. Or what he really wanted.

My boyfriend came home one night looking kinda freaked out, and he told me there were some weird noises coming from the backyard. Curious, I went out there with a flashlight to check it out. It sounded like a low, repeating hiss: nothing particularly scary. I started walking towards the treeline to see what sort of animal was making the sound, when the hissing suddenly became a low, gurgling scream coming from like, ten feet away. Sounded kinda like those brute things from Amnesia, actually.

Anyway, I tore ass back to the door yelling ""GET THE FUCK INSIDE, GET THE FUCK INSIDE, IT'S SOME STEPHEN KING SHIT"". I'm thinking it was some animals fighting, but at the time I was 100% convinced that A: Monsters were, in fact, real, and B: I was gonna get dragged into the woods and eaten.

Our neighbors were having construction done, I figured it was the workers listening to radio. When I got downstairs into the kitchen, the music was louder... I couldn't tell what was playing but it sounded creepy as fuck. Like a soft folksy depressing woman singing. Looked out the window, it was raining so no construction. I opened the basement door, it seemed to be emanating from down there. I went downstairs into our partially unfinished basement. The music was loud, it was a woman repeating ""I won't see you tomorrow"" in some kind of Celtic dirge. There are four rooms in my basement and the one furthest from the stairs is the laundry room. I went in there my heart beating so loudly in my ears, the music was literally BLARING. It was coming from an old clock radio that was above the washer. Maybe Dad had set an alarm? I go to turn it off, and it wouldn't. It was then I noticed it was soaking wet. I went to unplug it, to my surprise, it was not even plugged in. No combination of buttons would turn this horrible music off. I also noticed the area and wall behind it were not wet at all, I couldn't find a source as to how it got so wet. I turned it over and checked for batteries... It didn't even have a battery compartment. How could it be playing music and blinking 12:00? It was overwhelmingly loud, In anger and frustration I screamed and threw the radio at the wall. It broke into pieces, but it did stop playing. I will never forget this one.

hereyagoman,"I was into a regular running routine back when I lived in Florida.  One of the paths I used to run went through some local neighborhoods and led to a sort of running trail that was about 3 miles long.  On one side was thick swampy woods and on the other was an open field with retention ditches.  Half way through the 3 miles was a small tunnel that led under a local road and was usually where I'd hit my runners high before that me and my buddy would just casually chat about life and whatnot.  Anyway, it's pitch black on this trail and we had just finished the neighborhood portion and started trotting along towards the tunnel.  There's only one street light and it's one of those aesthetic ones that makes for a poor quality light source but it's enough to see the trail and a little bit into the woods as it was on that side of the path.  The street light is a bit away from both the tunnel and the road we just turned in from. 

Anyhow, we're mid sentence and about 300m from the street light when I see what looks like a small child or something crouched down by the base of the lamp not moving and looking our way.  As soon as I locked eyes with it my heart lurched and felt heavy as led, with dread.  My buddy hadn't seen it but noticed I stopped talking (however still jogging forward) and looked to see what I saw.   He immediately stopped, so I stopped.  We looked at each other then back to this shadow.  We walked a little forward not talking and as we made our first step, after we had stopped, it arched it's back and let out the loudest and most high pitched ""SCREEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"" sound I'd ever heard.    Well fear and adrenaline got me going in a dead sprint back towards the road.  ""holy.... shit... what the... fuck"".  We get to the road after sprinting a mile and stop in the street light. We're both rational people and we both know Florida wild life so we start to ask the obvious questions.  Did you see that? yes.  Do you know what it is? No.  Did you fucking HEAR that? YES.  What the fuck, we're both puzzled and still scared but decide we're being ridiculous so we continued our jog casually through the neighborhood.  After about 2 or 3 minutes of jogging I politely point out, that, obviously since it was some sort of animal it probably has predator instincts.

Y_Me,"I went on my first road trip with my best friend. We were 18, just graduated from high school and headed to Oregon. We were ready for a driving break and went down some random road that followed a river. We didn't see anyone for miles and just picked a turn out. There were turnouts ever 100 yards or so, I assume for fishing. We got out of the car and spend over an hour wandering up river, skipping rocks etc. We made it around the bend to a bridge, out of sight of our car. When we decided we were ready to head back and continue the drive, we opted to walk back along the road. As we come into sight of the car, we see an old pickup truck parked right behind our car. I'm suspicious due to an older sibling who had a stage where she read all about serial killers and convinced me that that should be my main concern. 

Anyways, I'm wondering why this guy parked here since there were plenty of unoccupied spots for miles. I figure maybe it's a favorite fishing hole or something. Realizing that we are 2 18 year old girls on a road, alone for miles, I suggest that we quietly get into the car and get out, just because. Well, shutting doors makes noise but I'm not really worried. I'm in the drivers seat and my friend is in the passenger seat, looking towards the river. The car had been having issues for a while and when I tried to start it, it made a loud, screeching sound. This was common problem for this car and if you waited and tried again, it usually started right up.
So, when the car screeches, I start laughing because we were trying to sneak out and failing miserably. Suddenly my friend starts screaming ""Oh my God, he's naked! Go go go! Lets get the fuck out of here!"" I turn to look and sure enough, there was a naked guy down by the river bank and he is running straight for us! Thankfully the damn car started and I got us out of there as fast as that car would go. I could see him running down the road after us for a little while.

TheFapman,"Finding out that someone was hiding in my house for two hours as I thought was home alone.  Just thinking about what could have happened if I found him. 

*I was at school when I wrote this and did not want to type it all out on my phone so here is the full story.*

I came home from University for Easter.  I was home alone so I spent most of my day at my grandmas.  After supper I decided to drive home.  I lived on a farm about 4 kilometres out of town and since I was on a farm I never locked my doors.  

After getting home I decided to just plop down on the couch and watch TV.  I ate wayyyy to much delicious Scottish food (mostly shortbread) at my grandmas and needed a nap.  I was laying on the couch for about 10 minutes when my buddy called.  He was in town visiting his girlfriend, but arrived early (about 8) and she did not get off work till 9.  He asked to come over and chill for a bit and of course I obliged.  I hadn't seen him in a while.  

He came over and we sat on the couch and talked.  Nothing special just catching up.  It was getting close to 9 and my girlfriend called me and asked me to come watch a movie at 9:30.  This worked perfectly so a 9 my buddy left and I was just cleaning up a bit.  I put my parents puppy that I was taking care of in her kennel where she was very calm.  I went out to my car and was just starting down my driveway when my girlfriend called and said she would pick me up and was on her way with one of her friends.  I was thinking ""great! less driving for me.""  

So I went back inside the house and the puppy was whining.  It was like a sick whine that made me feel terrible.  I thought that she saw me and believed that she was going to get out of her kennel.  I felt guilty so I decided to stand outside.  Out on the deck my newfoundlander came on the deck and I was petting her.  She was a beautiful dog and the nicest dog I had ever met.  I had never seen her get aggressive before, until now.  

As I stood there I noticed how her hackles were up and her mouth was open.  I was thinking to myself that she has some big fucking teeth.  She then started growling as she stared into my house through the large stained glass window in my house.  I turned and looked and saw a figure move across my kitchen.  I couldn't see much detail through the stained glass.  

Now my heart was racing!  My fight or flight response kicked in and sadly I ""flighted"" (if that is a word!).  I ran toward my car and waited for my girlfriend to get to my place.  She pulled in my driveway and I ran toward her car and jumped in and told them what happened.  The two of them got scared since they believed it was a ghost.  I can see the argument because my house is pre World War One, but I knew it was a real person.  My girlfriend pinned it in an effort to get away from this ""ghost"" and as she drove I could see him peeking out from behind the blinds in my bay window watching us drive away.  I will never forget that look.  

It took me about 5 minutes to convince her to turn around and I called my neighbors and they came with guns and bats.  We searched that house top to bottom and he was gone, luckily for him.  I wish we wouldn't have left while we knew he was in the house.  

So he was in my house for about 2 hours as I layed on the couch.  I do not know where he hid.  It was a two storey house so I assume he was either in the basement or upstairs.  Luckily I did not stay long enough to have to go to either of those places since our only bathroom was upstairs and most of our food was in the freezer downstairs.  Truly terrifying experience.  

The worst part though was that nothing was moved.  Everything was exactly where we left it.  I am not sure how long he was their before I came home, but I hope not long because if he was then he had no intentions of burglary.  ",null,66,cdnykie,1riazr,AskReddit,new,324
MedicsOfAnarchy,"1988.

When my daughter was around 2 years old we moved to a (new to us) 4-bedroom house.  Bedroom #1 was for my wife and me, #2 was her room.

Soon after moving in we noticed that after putting her to bed for the night, we'd hear her talking and laughing long after she should have been asleep.  Peeking in after about the third night of this we found her standing at the end of her crib, chattering away with the closet door about 5 feet away.  Typical new parents, we'd tell her to lie down and go to sleep.

This continued for many nights, and then we noticed she was actually holding *conversations* - talk a little, listen some, answer ""yes"" or ""no"" or ""I don't know"".

When we asked her about it, she said she was talking to the lady in the green dress.  This continued sporadically but eventually died down to where if she was continuing the conversations, we weren't catching them.  When we asked what she talked about, she either said ""stuff"", or ""School"" (daycare) or ""I don't know.""


Time passed, her little brother was born.  After the initial baby-in-the-parent's room phase, we moved them together into the room.  When he could stand on his own, pulling himself up on things, the same thing happened.  We'd hear him babbling, and peek in to see him doing the same thing - standing at the end of the crib, talking to the closet, his sister fast asleep in her bed.

Again, continues sporadically, slows, stops.

Three years go by.  Two boys now, so Big Sister gets her own room and the two boys share The Room.  Same behaviour from the youngest.

We have no way of knowing if they discussed this among themselves, but each described a ""lady in a green dress"".  In asking them separately, one might mention ""she has long hair"".  Son might say ""She has black hair"".  If asked if it's long or short, curly or straight, he'd say ""It's long"".  And so on in many details.  When we heard a new detail from one, and gave a multiple choice for that detail to the other, they'd always agree - belt or no belt, color, shoes, white lady/black lady/indian lady, whatever.  At this point though, we're thinking they could all be remembering the same picture from a story book or something, so... meh.


Then weird stuff starts happening.

Now, the wife and I were both smokers, and the rule was one could smoke outside, or in the bathroom upstairs (which had a ceiling exhaust fan) but nowhere else in the house.  One fine cold evening, too cold to go outside for just a smoke, I used this rule.  I'd put the youngest to bed, the two older children were downstairs watching a movie.  Suddenly I hear them yelling the youngest child's name and running through the house.  This makes more sense if you know the downstairs came up into the kitchen; go right and you're in the dining room; go right and you're in the hallway; go right and you're in the living room; go right and you're back in the kitchen.  The older two were running this circle and yelling the youngest's name in an exasperated way.

So I stub out my smoke and exit the bathroom just as the older two were making the circuit again.

""What's going on you guys?""
""We're chasing (youngest).  He's supposed to be in bed!""
I peek into the bedroom.  ""Yes, he *is* in bed.""
""No he's not.  He just went into the kitchen again.  We heard him on the stairs and just saw him run up.  He's not supposed to be awake watching movies now so we tried to tell him but he kept going around the corner so we ran after him.""

So, basically, they glimpsed someone on the steps and chased the figure.  Every time they turned a corner in this circuit, they caught *just a glimpse* of the figure turning the next corner, and continued the chase.  My youngest was truly asleep.

Turned bedroom #3 into a study.  It was downstairs.  One day I'm home in my study, wife at work, kids at school.  Someone is pacing the floor above me.  A slow walk from one end of the living room directly above me, then back again.  Since I know no-one is home I guess it's my sister-in-law, who has a key and a penchant for dropping by from time to time unannounced.  I go upstairs, doors are all locked, nobody there.  Could be street traffic?  But it was *exactly* the sound of someone walking above, that one squeaky floorboard and everything.

I mention this to my wife.  ""Oh, you heard The Walking Man.  When I stayed home sick that day last month I heard it all the time.  Someone walking back and forth in the living room, but nobody ever there when I checked.""

Okay, so we got that going for us, which is nice.  I'm wondering how to enlist this character to push a vacuum cleaner while he's at it.

No more Green Lady chats; no more phantom kids running around the house.  The Walking Man is heard from time to time but I've learned to ignore him.  He doesn't answer to questions or anything like that.  We've left out pen and paper, nada, okay, we're cool, he's cool, whatever.

2000.

We're moving - just need a bigger house.  The realtor assures us we don't have to mention the other residents to prospective buyers, so that's nice.  Most of the stuff is packed up, moved into storage so the house ""shows"" well.  Someone buys it and we start packing the last of everything so we can move later in the week.  With the ""shows well"" it just looked... roomy.  Now it actually looks like a place someone is leaving.

My oldest son (still in the #2 room, the Green Lady room bedroom, where he shares bunkbeds with his younger brother) gets up in the night to use the bathroom.

In the living room, clearly visible down the hall, is a tall man standing and staring at the wall, his back to my son.  My son said he knew instantly it wasn't me.  This tall figure begins to turn slowly towards my son.  My son changes his mind about using the bathroom and runs back into his own room, where there's a woman sitting on the floor.  In her lap is a small child.  They're both looking at my son, who at this point is screaming his head off and running into our room/bed/covers.

So we check, and there's nobody else in the house of course.

For the next couple of nights, just 'cuz, we set up a video camera in the corner of the living room that would give the most coverage.  We don't have motion sensors, and the tape runs 8 hours or so on lowest quality, but in the two or three nights we taped after bedtime nothing happened, at least nothing caught on tape.

And we moved, and that's it.

Except -

We never really noticed until the move, but when you walk into a house and there's nobody home, you somehow *feel* that.  ""I'm home, and I'm the first one home, and I'm the only one home"".  We realized that we had never felt that since 1988, only in the new house.  My wife also said it felt ""lonely"" being the first one to come home to the new house.  So at some level, maybe we all sensed something.

blessure,"You now how sometimes things like memories or personal traits have become so natural that you don't even realize they're there? Well I've remembered something else that is probably creepier than my other post, but this didn't happen to me, but my mother. Mind you, this a mix of her personal account and what I've read in the press through all these years (this happened in 2003, if I'm not wrong).

My mother used to work at a hospital in a posh part of Madrid as a clerk, helping carry patients or moving beds around or delivering X-Ray results.

One day, she was going on about her daily working routine when she heard screaming a floor below. She's always too eager to help (maybe too much, I must admit) and she instantly assumed someone was having a stroke, which is not all that uncommon. She ran downstairs.

What she found was a completely empty hallway, except for a man who was lying on the floor. She walked on to him to help him, but then saw a woman, a doctor, running towards her from the other end of the hall. **She was carrying a bloody knife**.

She went straight to strike my mother, and she covered herself on instinct with her forearm. She has now a quite ugly scar as a result, from the elbow right to the wrist. Then my mother started running down several flights of stairs, and all the while the doctor didn't stop pursuing her. It took a male nurse and another clerk to restrain her. My mother always comments that one of her rescuers's name is Salvador (which means ""saviour"" in Spanish).

She then got taken care of and always complains that her wedding band got lost when the nurse removed it so that she could properly stitch her up.

The man my mother found lying on the floor was already dead when she saw him, as were another two people, one of them was another doctor. One of the most horrifying accounts heard at the trial was that of **a fellow clerk who hid from the killer doctor inside a bathtub but was found by her and repeatedly stabbed** (the doctor actually thought she was dead and thus left her there). She has been severely crippled, both physically and psychologically, ever since.

This murderer of a doctor suffered from schizophrenia and had been displaying disturbing behaviour for a while already. She had persecution complex and was convinced that she was being routinely watched and that there was some conspiracy against her among her co-workers. She wasn't taking her medication. One day she brought with her a kitchen knife to work and the rest of the story I've already told you. Her weird behaviour was well-known. The only reason she hadn't been 'put aside', so to speak, was that the doctor's family had friendship ties with the managers of the hospital, which is privately owned.

It was heart-breaking watching the killed doctor's boyfriend say that this was all known and nobody ever said anything that could prevent the tragedy and that all the co-workers had witnessed her weird treatment of patients and her downright disturbing actions, most notably **writing on her computer... while it was off**.

My parents tried to hide what happened from me at first, which worked for about half an hour, because when we turned on the TV there wasn't talk in any channel about anything else.

**Noelia de Mingo** is her name. Look her up, I'm too lazy right now, but I think there aren't too many English-language sources on her. She's currently at the psychiatry wing of a prison in Eastern Spain, but has been allowed recently to spend days or even weeks outside. She actually has been known to travel all the way to Madrid (several hundred kilometers) all by herself.

ramboy18,"Worked at Dollar General and while I was showing an older gentleman where the shampoo aisle was. He tried to start small talk. I was busy running the cash register, but he just kept talking. So I though I would be nice and entertain him until someone walked up to the register. He then asks where something else is which happens to be in the back of the store.

Keep in mind this is very early morning and I'm the only one in the store. I walk to the back and start looking for it's exact location. I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with him, and as I spot the item and point it out he begins to rub my back, while saying thank you. Which didn't bother me at first until he kept rubbing my back and tried to keep up the small talk. I pretended that I heard someone at the register waiting to be checked out and noped the fuck out of there.

I still remember that awkward look on his face as I rang him up at the register and he left. I still get heeby-jeebies everytime I think about it. Did I mention I am a male.

Special_KAD,"I had an experience when I was about 11 or 12 that I don't have any explanation for, besides it being a ghost. I woke up for school in the morning and turned over in my bed to face the doorway. I was on the top floor of the house and my room had a closet directly to the left of the doorway with stairs leading downstairs right outside of the doorway. I watched as a little boy, younger than myself, wearing a red backpack and blue jeans (typical) walked from my closet out my door and down the stairs. He didn't look at me or acknowledge me at all, just slowly walked. I laid frozen in bed for a minute or two trying to process what just happened. I decided to go downstairs to my parents bedroom and tell them what happened. My parents room was arranged with the bed in the middle and my dad's favorite recliner chair on the far side of the room next to the window. The chair was aligned in a way that you couldn't see it until the door way fully opened. So I open the door about to wake my parents and tell them what I saw and the same little boy is sitting in my dad's chair staring directly at me. I freaked the fuck out and ran away screaming. Neither I or any of my family members saw anything like it before or since. My parents still live in the house and it was built by my grandfather. No one has ever died there to my knowledge. 

I'm not sure whether I believe in ghosts or not but that was the only explanation I could come up with. Freaky shit. ",null,49,cdnlwn9,1riazr,AskReddit,new,219

AbbyRoses,"I had a check up with my ""joint"" doctor (I have arthritis). He said that he recommended I take these shots. They were to go directly in my joints and I was going to be put under. I was a little nervous. I never really like being put under but I knew this was safe and that I would feel a whole lot better. This procedure, however, would be the scariest moment in my life. Just thinking about it now is giving me the shivers. I hope I explain it well because it was so weird. Anyway, I was put under with laughing gas. I then awoke abruptly. It took me a second to realize what was happening. For some reason, I was crying and screaming. There were doctors trying to hold me down and comfort me. And then, for some reason, I blurted out, ""Did I die?"" followed with me screaming, ""Oh my God"". Now the weirdest thing about all of this is that I felt like I was trapped in my mind, having no control of what my body was doing or saying. All I could think was what in the world was going on. After I screamed ""Oh my God"", my body struggled in the hands of the doctors and I felt myself zooming towards the wall, but I wasn't even moving. Imagine it like in the movies where the spaceships go into hyperspeed and the stars start zooming past them. Then a flash of black and the whole scenario from every detail happened again. This got me thinking, oh my gosh, did I really die and am I trapped in this forever? This is when I started to panic. But then I actually woke up and was balling. I called for my stepmom, my dad, who ever was there so I knew I was ok. My stepmom came in because she was the one who drove just us to the hospital. I was so glad to see her and cried in her arms. The procedure still had to be done so I reluctantly went back and finished. To my relief, it didn't happen again.

acydetchx,"I've experienced [sleep paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis) a few times. For those too lazy to click, basically your mind wakes up before the rest of most of your body, so you're awake but can't move; it also often comes with auditory and/or visual hallucinations.

The first time it happened was the creepiest thing I'd ever experienced. I didn't know this was a thing that happened, so I was absolutely terrified. Here's what happened:

I woke up with a start from some nightmare and my eyes snapped open. I felt a moment of relief, having woken from a nightmare. The relief quickly faded when I went to sit up, but couldn't move anything at all. I was on my stomach, trying to turn over, but my body wouldn't respond to any command at all.

Right freaked out, I tried to call out for help, but found that I couldn't speak. Instead, the scream remained in my head, stuck as internal monologue I suppose. It built as I kept trying to scream, turning inhuman, like in a movie when hell opens up, and there's the sound of thousands of tormented souls screaming. As the scream built, I saw shadows moving around me unnaturally, like darting, furtive creatures, sneaking closer and closer to me.

I don't know how long it lasted, felt like hours but I did later realize it was probably a minute at most. As soon as I could move, I darted out of bed, and hopped online to try to figure out what the hell just happened to me.",null,30,cdnm9e8,1riazr,AskReddit,new,136
BossCalzone,"i remember being a teen and going for a drive with my friends. we drove down this rocky side road for the fun of it and were just having a chat. i noticed one of the mailboxes had the name callahan on it, so i pointed it out because our math teacher was named mr callahan and he was kind of pedophilish, so we called diddlers callahans.

we continued down the street and every mailbox had the name callahan on it. we thought it might have been a brand name for mailboxes but they all had it written differently, sometimes in letter stickers other times handwritten. there were probably about 10 or 15 houses all with callahan as the mailbox. it was like a huge family all bought houses in the same neighborhood. and all the houses were dark, not as single light on in any of them, and there were no streetlights

suddenly the road got bumpier and bumpier and then it just stopped. dead end. right in front of us was this nasty broken down house with like four speedboats in the giant driveway. and a callahan mailbox. they were the only house with any lights on. we could see they were having a bonfire or something out in the back yard too.

we were kind of buggin out so my friend storks started to back up with the intention of turning into a driveway to get going back the other way. as soon as we started to back out, we saw a couple of big guys come out from behind the one lit up house. they all had big bushy beards and were dressed kind of gross, like hillbillies. they were pretty intimidating looking so storks backed out quick and popped into the driveway to the left. then more people started coming out from the back of the main house, but from the other direction so they were kinda close to us. as storks pulled the car back we saw there were about 10 guys and a couple of girls slowly walking towards our car

storks got into position and took off. now the road was crazy narrow, no more than a single car could have fit without basically crashing into bushes and trees (unless there was a space for a house) so storks was being cautious. before we got away from all the callahan houses we saw this huge pickup truck coming our way, high beams on. there was not a lot of room, so storks did his best to pull to the side so the truck could get by

but the truck stopped. two huge guys got out of the truck and started coming towards the car. storks floored it and was just barely able to make it around the truck and get past. he knocked the right mirror off his car and it was scratched up as fuck, but we made it out and got away

not sure what we stumbled upon that night but we sure as shit never went back

ZebraZealot,"My grandmother passed away several years ago due to injuries that caused her to bleed out on the way to a hospital.  Her home was very old and the plaster ceiling broke out and fell onto her head, which knocked her down.  While falling she hit her head again on the corner of the oven.  I am not sure if one of those blows to the head or both caused the bleeding, but that is what ultimately killed her.

Following her death I went up to help my father with clean up, she had been his mother so he was very distraught about it and considering some of his choices with her (she lived about 5 hours from where we lived, and we did not see her often, also, she was a window since '88 so was alone in the house).  Because of what he was dealing with I did a lot to help out, which included cleaning the blood from the kitchen.  It is very different from movies, there was just so much everywhere.

The town she lived in has a population of about 700 people and didn't really have a hotel so we stayed in the house.  She lived on the corner of a small block, and on the corner of the block across the street was a large grain mill and four silos.  Trucks carrying grain to and from the place drove right past the house and caused the whole house to shake.  Lying in bed, looking up at the same ceiling that fell in on her, mixed with the shaking of the house and the blood I had cleaned made it a very creepy place to sleep. Adding to that was the fact that she had been a bit of a shut-in, so whenever I did see her she was always in her house, with her gone the place was just so empty, cold, and vacant.  I had never been in that house without her there, and now she would never be back.

*Edit, I did type Window, and I'll leave it as there are several comments about it.  However, I did mean widow, which I'd hope most people understood.  Does inject some levity to the story though.

But I wanted to get passed that, and invited her out to my first apartment for Thanksgiving. She said no and insisted that we have it at her place. She never called me back and won't return my calls. And my grandmother is dodging me, too. So instead of introducing the love of my life to my family, I will instead be taking him to my best friend's house to be with hers. I'm still excited, just bummed that nobody in my family wants shit to do with me.

Tl;dr: falling out with dad, nobody on that side of the family wants to try and get around that. Gonna have a good holiday anyway....* bitches.*",null,0,cdnj9ua,1rialb,AskReddit,new,1

arbitrary777,"A while back, I snapped at my friend for calling me the weak point in our group.
We were doing a science project together, us and 2 other people. I set up a Google document where we would all put our research. This guy, I'll call him John, hasn't done anything. He's put a 1 on the paper and just fooled around on his computer the rest of class. Class is finished, I manage to get about a fourth of my research done which is fine because we'll have more class periods to work on it. He's done nothing for his part. Again, this doesn't worry me because if he doesn't do it we can tell the instructor, plus we still have research from the other 3 members. Fast forward to lunchtime, my other friend tells me that John is going around saying that I am the weak point in the group. This pisses me off because not only am I not the weak point and have done some work, he has done absolutely nothing. This is also not the first time he has done this, but I don't feel like elaborating on that at the moment. I get the other 3 members of the group over, they all agree that I have done significant work and he has done nothing to contribute. He still defends himself, or tries to, so I just let him have it. He always does this, he's being hypocritical, he needs to do some work, stop being such a jerk to everyone (He's always being mean to my other friends too, he throws their lunchboxes around when they leave the table, not mine for some reason probably because he knows I won't tolerate it, and the big one: he told my other friend that his crush wouldn't go out with him because of the way she would be percieved. But anyway.), etc. I didn't punch him or use violence, but I went on a serious rant. Then he went home and removed me from our group chat, which is why nobody likes having him admin anything, because he always abuses his power.

TL;DR: friend is always mean to other friends, just a jerk all around, he calls me the weak point in our group when I'm clearly not, I let him have it in a 5 or so minute rant.",null,0,cdniwyw,1riaic,AskReddit,new,1

- working in an office isn't that enjoyable
- sitting at a computer all day is boring
- you can earn just as much or more in the trades (have to work harder)
- more options for OT in trades for when you feel like earning an extra chunk of money
- you can make more money right out of the gate as compared to someone who has to 'climb the corporate ladder'.
- moving around and doing hands on work can be enjoyable

- don't have to work in shitty weather

Trade school is less expensive, but the high end of the pay scale(assuming you don't start your own *successful*  business and then hire other tradespeople) is lower then that of select degrees.

However, if you are going to school just to go and not to do something you are patient with you may end up dropping out(40% of people in college fail to get a bachelor's degree in 6 years), having no increased income, and have buckets full of debt.

Princess_Honey_Bunny,"I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch.
But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ""heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks."" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting.
And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe.
He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.

This was in the Lazy thread but I forget who wrote it :/

ShinjukuAce,"I didn't see regular web sites until 1994 - Yahoo, ESPN, and the New York Times were some of the first ones I ever got on.  Google didn't exist - Altavista and Hotbot were the most popular search engines.  I remember the first time I found an actual video online - it was a 30-second video of sumo wrestling, and people in the computer lab gathered around me to watch it.

From 1990-1993, there were BBSs (Bulletin Board Services).  A BBS was like a primitive website, but you had to dial each one individually on your phone line - you couldn't link from one site to another.  They had files for download, text-based games, and email (which someone wouldn't see until they logged on to that site).  You could spend 15 minutes downloading a low-resolution picture of a woman in a bikini if you wanted.

There was also Usenet before 1994.  Usenet was kind of like Reddit - it had different discussion boards on various topics - I used rec.travel.europe, rec.sport.soccer, rec.gambling.poker, among others.

DkPhoenix,"For chatting there was IRC (Internet Relay Chat), in the early 90s it was just EFnet, Undernet and DALnet came along in the mid-90s, because EFNet was kind of... unregulated.  All the channels (chat rooms) were user created, and sometimes there were wars where a group of people (or one individual running bots) would take over a channel from the regulars.  This was possible because a channel ceased to exist when no one was in it, and the first person to enter said empty channel would recreate it, and therefore own it.  To connect, you'd log into one of many servers, most of which were maintained by various universities around the world.  Sometimes these servers would lose their connection to EFnet, or become so lagged that they'd effectively be disconnected.  That was called a netsplit, and that was the opportunity to take over a channel.  You'd connect to a server that you knew was split or desynched, or one that you knew was likely to split (some were notorious for that),create your channel, and wait for it to reconnect.  If all worked as planned, you'd come in and your bot or script would immediately remove operator (moderator) powers from everyone else, kick them out, and make the channel private, pissing off all the channel regulars until the next netsplit, when they'd attempt to take it back.  People would also try social engineering type takeovers, where they'd come in using the nick(name) of a channel regular, hoping someone would op them without looking at the hostmask.

DALnet and Undernet introduced channel and nick servers, so you could register them and thwart the most common takeover methods, but they didn't eliminate netsplits, and the hilarity that could sometimes follow when chanserv de-opped and kicked an entire room.

IRC was all text.  You could chat in the open channels, send private messages, and also do DCC (Direct Client to Client) chats and file transfers, that weren't affected by netspilts.  The file sharing didn't really start happening until later on, though.  At 9600bps (or less) sending even a large text file could be painful.",null,0,cdnr5ed,1ri9xe,AskReddit,new,1

Tells you when to pause for reflection,
Then plunge ahead to the period’s conclusion.

Neglect it at your peril: accusations,

Pretend it doesn’t exist at all? Risk condemnation.
Treat it right for absolution.

I knew that I could always use the excuse that I was in the darkroom (we had a large darkroom where the whole class could be in there at the same time), so it was feasible to say I was in there working on prints.

At the end of the year as graduation was nearing they posted everyone's ""demerits,"" which are essentially detentions.  I had like 50 demerits for unexcused absences in Photo.  The problem is we only had like 20 days of school left so it would be impossible to go to detention 50 times to get them down to 0.

all this leads to the scariest moment.  i stayed inside at night for the next week. a week after the first incident i go for a walk at night with some friends, we get roled up on by three stolen car fulls of 16-25 year olds, they took my friends' belongings, i had only a lighter on me so they decided to kick my ass.  i thought i was going to die, i walked away from it without having to go to the hospital but the whole string of events left me pretty off-kilter for a while.",null,0,cdniocl,1ri9v1,AskReddit,new,2

Clavical89,"Encourage them to question everything. Don't force him into studying ALL the time. If you make learning fun for him, he might want to keep learning more and more. Pay attention to what he is into. Encourage him to learn more about what he is passionate about. When I was little, I was obsessed with space. My parents bought me cool space related stuff for birthdays and Christmas. I got a badass telescope that I absolutely LOVED. I used it every chance I had. I felt like I  couldn't learn enough about space. However, if my parents HAD forced it upon me, there is no way I would have found it fun. I would probably look at the stars every now and then and then go to bed. 

My youngest brother is a really smart kid. He is also fortunate my parents didn't force anything on him. He found his passion -rocks and minerals- by playing outside in our driveway. One time he got this really cool miner's shovel. He absolutely loves it. It did sounded hilarious
 when someone would ask him what he got for his birthday - ""a shovel."" lol

Also, my dad is really smart. It's fun to talk to him because I always learn something new. Plus, he is really good at explaining things I don't understand.

razzmatazz18,"Made an account just to comment here. Even if it gets lost, it's therapeutic to talk about.

My parents lied to me about moving to another continent and I only found out a week before the move.

I was born and raised in New York suburbs, but Egyptian by blood. We started selling our house when I was 10. My mom said we were just moving to another part of the neighborhood, like 10 minutes away, and 10-year-old me believed it. She even drove us around sometimes to look at houses in other neighborhoods and talk about how nice they'd be to live in, and I'd point out the ones I'd like to live in and she'd verbally consider them.

Fast forward to a few weeks in, my dad is showing around some potential house-buyers and they ask where we're moving to. He says, ""Oh, you know, we're moving back to Egypt.""

Um, what?

I had to call my closest friends and awkwardly tell them I was moving away with no time to see anyone. Granted, I was a pretty awkward kid myself, and I'm no longer in contact with any of them, but I was about to switch from elementary to middle school and had made all these awesome plans and was so excited.

Changing schools was hard, changing cultures was even harder. I got more in touch with my Egyptian side, can speak Arabic better now, and changed my personality around, but it made me grow up to resent this country. I'm 20 now and graduating college (was forced to stay at college here, but that's another story), and I'm going to leave and never look back.

newks,"I volunteer with a non-profit community action agency. When I started volunteering about 3.5 years ago, the agency focused on HIV/AIDS, sexual health and outreach. Now with the Affordable Care Act, we cover all chronic illnesses. 
Anywho. I started off volunteering with the Development Team - planning and implementing our fundraisers. I  enjoyed this and, as I was new to the area, it helped me feel invested in my new community. 
I branched out a bit and began volunteering as an adult facilitator of the agency's LGBTQ Youth Group. I found I enjoyed this a million times more than development - we hold weekly meetings where queer youth and allies aged 12-20+ can be themselves in a safe space. While my group is largely free-form, we do provide education to the youth. The education is informal, but we focus on variety of topics including safe sex, healthy relationships, self image, smart food choices, and accessing community resources. We take the kids to a lot of events such as local pride rallies and trips to our state capital to meet with legislators about equality legislation. 

We’re in a small city, so the youth represent a mixture of backgrounds and experiences. Unfortunately, a lot of our youth come from homes that are either ambivalent or unsupportive. I’ve only met one youth who had to be closeted in his home for his own safety. A lot of the issues with the kids come from lack of opportunities – educational, employment, and social. This is where my volunteering can get to be a bit of a bummer. The other facilitators and I do our best to connect the kids with members of the community who can provide them with advancement, but many of the kids simply don’t bite. We’ve got several kids aged 19+ who have a high school education, and are unwilling to find jobs or pursue further education. My point is, sometimes you can feel like you’re spinning your wheels trying to help the youth, but you have to keep reminding yourself you can only help people who want to be helped. 

I’ve mentioned this in previous posts, but I truly believe that volunteering can open up some very fantastic doors. Another facilitator is a higher-up at the company where I work now – he was my foot-in-the-door for a fantastic job opportunity and I love my workplace and I’m very happy with my career. I wouldn’t have come across this job if I hadn’t been volunteering. 

On the whole, I feel really great about my volunteering. I’ve been doing it long enough to see some of the youth really grow up and become wonderful young adults. I’m close with these kids and I feel good that they trust me to support, counsel, and educate them. 

TL;DR I like volunteering – it’s opened doors for me and I feel like I’m doing good in my community. It can be a bummer at times when things don't turn out the way you'd hoped. It’s with youth, so I can see the long term impact of my time spent with the agency.

TravisJ86,"Completely depends on what you're volunteering for.  

I've been volunteering for about 6 months now with the same organization which supplies first responders to different events around the city, such as hockey/football/soccer/baseball games, any runs, competitions, etc.

I absolutely love it.  I look forward to going to the events that I do and being able to get out into the community and get to know a wide range of people (some which you can keep in contact with that may be able to help you out sometime down the road).  It's great to be able to go out and enjoy what you're doing and give back and help someone who injured themselves, etc.

So yeah, I'd definitely recommend volunteering to anyone that is considering it.",null,0,cdninoa,1ri9ig,AskReddit,new,1

So if you start at a coffee shop have two places in mind to go to for dinner. Once you've eaten dinner have two options for what to do afterwards like a walk in a romantic spot or going to get ice cream. After that you should have in mind a place where you can go dancing or take in some entertainment, or a bar or something like that. 

It's all about having options ""I thought we might go to such and such a club and go dancing, they have a good DJ tonight, or we could go to the bar on the corner and have a drink.""

It's all about getting along with the person and landing on that final option: your place or mine.

Upon delivering our child, my wife moved out again straight from the hospital.  I was devastated and received divorce papers shortly afterwards.  We spent nearly 3 years apart going to court and not agreeing on the terms of the divorce.  

To make a long story shorter, a new judge came in during our divorce and decided that this case had been forgotten so he signed a divorce decree.  My ex wife called me crying saying that we were now divorced and it was a huge mistake.  At that point, I basically told her the only way I'd consider getting back together is if she did the legwork to undo the divorce, as the terms sucked for me anyway.  

My wife did get the divorce nullified easily because we hadn't agreed to terms.  We sat down and discussed our requirements for getting back together.  We've been together for 8 years now, and will celebrate our 12th anniversary next month.  ",null,0,cdnje9t,1ri9hs,AskReddit,new,1

* Where do you see yourself in 5 years?   

What's more important than the answers though, is how they answer them. I especially like the strength/weakness question for this. It gets them thinking, and you can see how they react under a little pressure.

What I would do in that situation, assuming both parties are willing to be completely reasonable and fair the whole time (the most important part), is have each parent explain their views to the kid when they're mature enough to understand. 

It would be tough as hell when they're little though, cuz kids at a certain age will just believe whichever parent is their favorite, and you can't control stuff like that. While they're young, each parent would have to keep up a conscious mental effort not to indoctrinate their kid, at least until about adolescence when they start to become independent. Eventually, everyone decides for themselves, but it's not too hard to brainwash a kid. I think that's the key thing such a couple should try to avoid, if they really want to be fair and balanced.

tinysideburns,"I once worked at a sandwich shop. The place was severely understaffed and there would be only three people on shift during the lunch rush, and the owner was completely indifferent. Oh, and we'd have to stay super late at night to make cookies and party subs. Party subs were the worst because you had to braid all of the bread dough, bake it, slice up enough meat, slice all the veggies and place all of the condiments in separate containers (you couldn't put them on the sandwich or it would get soggy). Cookies weren't hard to do, but baking hundreds of them took hours.  

We were allowed one six inch sub for lunch each day, which we sometimes traded with the pizza place next door. One day this new manager, Jay, worked out a trade with the pizza place; we'd give them our subs for a large pizza and some wings. 

After I left for the day, the owner came in and saw the pizza box. Instead of saying ""we bought a pizza,"" turbo-douche Jay told the owner that I had traded subs for pizza. Now, all we did was trade the six inch subs we would have gotten for free anyway for a pizza. Maybe not the most noble thing to do, but certainly not crime of the century. 

So when I came in the next day, the owner goes into a tirade against me, tells me that Jay ratted me out and that I was fired. 

Fast forward a few days. I call in and place an order for a party sub under a false name. Jay picked up the phone so I threw my voice, posing as my high school music teacher. I ordered a 15 foot party sub with extra meat, extra tomatoes, oil &amp; vinegar and mayo. Jay says, ""We put the condiments on the side so it doesn't get soggy,"" to which I reply, ""Just put them on, I like it soggy."" Oh, and I also ordered 350 cookies. The total was over $450. 

They didn't ask me for a credit card, just a name and number. I gave them a false name and the number for my high school. 

That order must have taken Jay HOURS to fill, and because I asked for all condiments on the sub, it was completely inedible. I tried pulling the same stunt three weeks later, but they got wise and asked for a credit card. 

TIL: I placed a false, time-consuming order for a very expensive party sub. The brown-nosing manager who lied to have me fired had to make it, and the owner lost the money. I wouldn't do this now, but I was 15 at the time. ",null,0,cdnidkt,1ri8y4,AskReddit,new,1

Cananbaum,"STORY TIME KIDS!! 

I was with Stop&amp;Shop and after 2 months of being horridly abused by the hire ups I had had enough. Well one day I was doing cart retrieval. 

The bitch of a deli manager would come out ever 10-15 minutes for a cigarette break and if I stopped even for a moment to even get a drink of water, I would get reported to my supervisor. I was 90 degree day and we were incredibly busy. I was constantly moving and very thirsty. 

Well I stopped to take a drink of the water I have with me and she has a fit and I get reported for a fourth time. I get called in and in front of customers I get belittled by said supervisor and the deli manager has this wicked smile on her face. I'D HAD HAD ENOUGH. 

I was never properly trained on registers, it got so bad a manager would follow me up to the time clock to make sure I didn't ""clock in early"" (I had a ""bad habit"" of clocking in about 5 minutes early and was threatened with being written up for time card padding), the store manager was critical to where ever I parked, even if I was in employee parking so I ended up parking at the farrest reaches of the customer parking lot to shut him up, and my favorite one was how my brother who I'd not seen for close to 10 months after being shipped off for the Navy came in to surprise me during what was supposed to be my lunch break (My parents had called and on one of my breaks I called back. They asked when my lunch was, that was how he knew.)- and the manager decide that was a good time bump my lunch up for an hour. I didn't get to see my brother for another week after that... it was bad. 

So I looked at the supervisor screaming at about being insubordinate and how I needed to come inside if I had nothing better to do so I told him, in front of the customers, that he and the deli manager needed to ""Get the fucking sticks out of their goddamned asses!"" 

I was fired, and rightfully so. I was happy to be fired in this case. 

But now **THE REVENGE**

I ended up calling corporate and used my voice acting abilities to convince them I was an elderly woman named Roberta - and I filed a complaint against each and every one of the higher-ups I had issues with, claiming I'd shopped there for years and saw the shit that would happen in front of the customers. IT wasn't far from the truth because people were reprimanded in front of the customers all the time. It was embarrassing.  

Corporate bought it. Two people I found out got transferred, the deli manager got fired and the store manager was replaced withing 3 months.

consilioetanimis,"I can't say for sure. I'm a gay man and I don't have a higher pitched or lisped voice but I'll give you what I can for an explanation. 

1) Part of it is confirmation bias. There is a certain expectation that gay men will talk like that. So gay men that don't talk like that for the most part go unnoticed whilst gay men with lisps or higher pitched voices will be noticed. That usually leads to the expectation that it's more common than it is. Though you seem to have noted that it certainly is not all of us or even the majority.

2) Role models. Up until very recently, there weren't at all many gay role models out there apart from the very stereotypical ""effeminate"" gay archetypes. Being gay is confusing as hell and when you're trying to figure yourself out, you look for role models. You look for people who might relate to you better. Once you get the idea that you're gay, you look around and realise that this is how all the other gay guys on TV act and that's all you have to go on.

chechenyancat,"Ok - here comes the practical no-bullshit guide how to prepare in a fool-proof way - but honestly it all depends on your people skills. If they invited you for the interview it means your profile fits, now they want to see if your personality fits into their team (if you're witty, humble, charming, etc. or just a depressed individual) try coming out as a positively minded and motivated person.

First, check the people you gonna talk to, call them and find out who will be interviewing you, then google them. Find their linkedIN and use your intellect to guess what kind of arguments will speak to them (based on previous experiences and background)

When you meet, suggest talking about the expectations first. Tell them that you found out something about the offer, but you'd like to hear more details. Then ask them some follow-ups and show genuine interest. Then talk about your expectations (you expect it to be an interesting opportunity, chance for full employment afterwards etc.)

In the meanwhile, use Jung personality types indicator (google it) to guess their preferences (detail oriented vs. big picture, logic vs. ""gut feeling"") cater your answers based on your guessed preferences (it makes no sense to talk about the big picture to someone obsessed with the practical details, etc.)

Depending on what kind of job it is, prepare some ideas you'd like to present them, kind of stuff you'd do on your first day on the job. Usually people hate designing ""job description"", they prefer people who already have some agenda and are proactive (don't be TOO extravagand tho, keep it real).

Finally, make sure you are able to answer some of the ""verification"" questions about your competences - however in best case scenario they won't have time to ask you anything else than ""your 3 pros and 3 weakneses"", ""biggest challange and how you overcame it"" or ""what role do you normally take in a team"" use google to determine optimal answers to that.

ProfessorAmadeus,"I know that all races are a part of all  socioeconomic classes. I guess I am thinking about very specific instances. A song like New Slaves addresses the history of oppression for African Americans.  Yes,  white people can enjoy that song and respect it for what it is. They are allowed to be angry about the inequality that has taken place. There are white people who I feel do not really respect how powerful the message is in that song,  although they love how it sounds. I have seen white teenagers be like this.  But in no way am I saying all white teens are like this.

So I see people taking songs for granted that can be a really sensitive song for others, including the artist who made it.  I am talking about hip hop specifically,  but I know it can be in any genre",null,0,cdnj5nj,1ri8ni,AskReddit,new,1

There is not a single shred of evidence that, in any way, supports the claim that life exists elsewhere in the universe.


What's even better is that, logically, there should be. There should be civilizations within our detection radius, or capable of transmitting at high enough power to be detectable from earth. We should have been visited by an ET civilization, or have found some sort of artifact (in orbit) that was meant to communicate with possible civilizations. Logically space-faring civilizations would put some sort of communications device in orbit around candidates for probable civilization cultivating planets. Or they would have a navigation system based on radio nodes and transmitting dated, repetitious radio signals. But no.

Also god's evil he has killed far more people ""directly"" than Satan.

Jesus became the first hybrid human/alien to better understand us, sadly the evil in our hearts caused by the fear of a race we couldn't even comprehend since we were such a young race back then.

They couldn't give us their the technology, though they still used what they had, which were their flying  vehicles, which in the bible got translated to flaming chariots.

They didn't know what was going on, this race was too far ahead, they had to let us do this naturally.

So they bred with us and gave up their tech.  God was most likely a leader of the alien race, and Jesus a human/alien hybrid which was artificially inseminated in the virgin Mary.  Cause how else would a virgin have a baby?  Magic?

I had a government phone that had 400 minutes on it a month and I picked the bridge because there was outlet at the base that the lock had been broken off. Free power!

After a while I was able to get to a library and look for work. after a bit I got hired and could walk to work. After a while I was able to move into a furnished studio paying weekly. 

I had hit rock bottom and I was too proud/stupid to ask for help. I had lost everything I wanted/had due to an addiction I could not let go of.

Jumped in as project manager of the student satellite project, though the aerospace stuff was pretty cool. Went to a conference, found a really cool company that did aerospace stuff. Worked towards getting a job at that company. Now I work for that company.

marcusthecrab,"Man walks into a bar and pauses: at the other end of the bar, there's this guy with a big orange head. Just kind of sitting there, mooning into his drink. So the man asks the bartender, ""Say, what's up with the guy with the big orange head?"" And the bartender says, ""It's an interesting story. Buy him a drink and maybe he'll tell it to you."" 

So the man walks over and introduces himself and offers to buy a round. The guy with the big orange head says, ""Yeah, I'll bet you want to know the story, huh?"" To which the man replies, ""Sure, if you don't mind."" 

The man with the big orange head sighs and says, ""You know, I've gone over it in my mind a million times. Basically, it's like this: I was walking along the beach one day, when I stubbed my toe on something. I looked down, and there was an antique brass lamp. I picked it up and dusted it off a little -- when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out! 

""The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt. I will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude.' 

The man at the bar is agape. The guy with the big orange head continues: ""So I said, 'Wow, okay. Well, my first wish is to be fantastically wealthy.' 

""The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And all of a sudden I have rings on my fingers and a crown on my head, and my wallet is full of money and a dozen ATM cards and the deed to a mansion in the hills -- I mean, I was loaded! 

""So I said, 'Amazing! Okay, for my next wish , I want to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world.' 

""The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible. 

""The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'"" 

The man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer. He says, ""Now, you know, this may be where I went wrong. I wished for a big orange head. ",null,0,cdniu9e,1ri8av,AskReddit,new,1

From 2002 to 2007, my school got more and more computers, scattered around in computer pools, the library and the cafeteria, and the teacher that administrated reached his limits quite often.
Both machines in the cafeteria were really slow NT machines that had hardware barely capable enough. And after some random auto update, not enough cache. After a few minutes of internet usage the memory was full and forced a reboot. The admin didn't know how to change it, and wouldn’t let us do it. It kept rebooting for weeks.

We got the biggest laugh out of his new school network that we got after summer break 2006. All computers in the whole school (pools, library, laptop classes, teachers PCs) were added to one big network environment, the same basic one you can use at home. And since he had hired a company to install school wide open wireless network (just the hardware), more than 30 PCs and laptops from our boarding school got in as well. Including all their shared folders, music, movies, and lots of porn. Accessible from every other system in the network.

jcorley101,"I work as at a small retail electric provider in Texas and we handle a lot of pissed off customers in regards to billing issues, disconnection of services, and service requests. One customer in particular that comes to mind, let’s call her Erica. Erica had a business account with us that serviced a few properties out in far west Texas (out in no-man land) - her business was to coordinate wild redneck hillbilly parties. You could make the assumption that Erica was a little rough around the edges and she was not by any means a business woman. Erica called in often (usually to get her services reconnected after we disconnected them). One particular call I took from Erica was pertaining to her account numbers with us. She did not like her account number with us and blamed the fact she couldn’t ever make payments on time due to this account number. Although she had several, 2-3 of her accounts started with the numbers “666” – she claims due to the fact it was set up with those numbers she had a tainted account and it needed to be changed. You could hear her obnoxious husband in the background going off about the issue and she would continue to shut him up throughout our conversation (pretty sure she wore the pants in this relationship). She cursed and swore – she yelled – she started to read passages from the bible. After a heated conversation she ends up releasing the line and swears we are all going to hell.

jcorley101,"Uno mas: Customer calls extremely upset about our billing/disconnect practices. Customer wanted to us to change our policy on not being able to select the due date as well as how fast we send out the disconnection notices – advised customer that we bill around the market meter schedule that the utility company has his meter to read around a certain time each month and from there they send us the read and within three days we create the invoice and in turn it is due sixteen days later, further I advised the customer that is a business decision that we do not hold our invoices and that the disconnection notice is sent immediately following the sixteenth day in order to mitigate the losses we sustain as not all our customers can be account on to pay. Customer then claimed he understands all that but doesn’t agree with it and it makes him incredibly bitter claiming we have a dark age business practice and he doesn’t believe that a manager doesn’t have the ability to override this also stating that we are okay with losing business – I advised the customer that we don’t want to and are not okay with losing business but we do have our practices an d they are not adjustable. He then goes on (or maybe he did a little sooner) that his family owns a local press company and he will force a change in our company because he feels that we use guerilla tactics to impose on customers he wanted to speak with my boss at this point because he was going to make a change. Advised customer that there will be no escalation of the call because we have addressed and answered his concern however he does not agree with it and wanted to speak with someone who will make the change. I informed the customer that we have these policies and they are not changing he then asked who our CFO is, explained to the customer that we are a privately held business and we do not have to disclose that information. Customer expresses that my bosses are cowards who sit in ivory towers and said that is not how he runs his business and asked if the people who run this company are okay with bad press. Took the customers payment, customer then continued to claim how he will run a monthly article out of bitterness alone to rip our company apart.

One layer of tp over them and a little powdered ice tea mix for color and clumps and then I broke a red paintball on it so it looked like just a massive bloody dump.  After three days it was still there.  So I scooped it out and just chalked it up as a loss.

We used a piece of cardboard against the door opening to fill it completely, shutting the door, and sliding the cardboard out.  When the poor victim opened his door, he got a newspaper avalanche.

cenr,"RCAF pilot here. There is no way to give you an accurate answer, every job is so different. Some positions have day to day routines, some are pure variety, I'm lucky to be doing the latter at the moment. 

On my current aircraft, I might sit in the office and do paperwork one day, and leave on a mission halfway around the world the next. Our missions can be anything from training flights to combat missions to humanitarian relief. One mission I could be crossing the ocean at 35,000ft, the next I could be flying at 500ft on night vision goggles. There are downsides though, I wish we flew more, but since we are officers first and pilots second, we usually end up doing other duties as much or more than flying. Flying transports also means being away from home all the time, missions can range from a day to several months if you deploy, and when you add it all up I'm usually away from home 6-8 months per year.

Each type of aircraft has it's own challenges, instructors at the flying schools are home all the time, but fly multiple flights per day training student pilots. Search and rescue pilots may spend their days on standby just waiting for a call to go on a mission. Transport pilots like me fly people and cargo all over the world, from CFS Alert to Afghanistan to most recently the Philippines, and everywhere in between. Fighter pilots...they're probably off having a **** measuring contest or something, we don't really talk about them... Seriously though, they work ridiculously long hours briefing, planning and training. You also can't forget the dreaded ground tour, after a couple flying tours (3-4 years each), most pilots will end up in a ground job for a few years before they get another flying tour. The ground tours could be anything from a job in headquarters to working in an operations center to running a recruiting center.",null,0,cdnsq7o,1ri6rv,AskReddit,new,2

I was 17 when I met my now boyfriend. He was 24.

I'm from Quebec he's from Texas, (we met online.) If I remember right the legal age for Texas is 17, 16 for Quebec.

He liked me, (no, not in a creepy way), we talked alot about the game and other things, so it started from there. We played a MMO together.

When we got together, I was afraid he'd get into trouble and asked him if he was ready for that, he said he didn't care about that. He really doesn't care what other people think, as long as he and I are happy, that's what matters.

I'm 18 now and we 'got together' when I was '17 and a half' so I guess it wasn't as bad.

I still get awful looks when I say that, though. It kind of hurts.

Last time I said this I got downvoted and berated but I'm sharing anyways because it's related.

I'm younger by 7 years, and while he has more 'adult' experience than I, I have experiences he doesn't have. One would be living in Quebec, since it's mostly French and I'm English. I've dealt with racism all my life over here, he doesn't like it when I mention the crap I've seen here.

It's strange, as others are mentioning in the thread, after 20 or so, people stop caring about the age difference, for the most part. There's still some that will raise eyebrows.

Working in a supermarket.  A bat somehow makes its way into the store, and is hanging around the produce section.  Manager calls for assistance.  Meanwhile, everybody else is hanging out watching where the bat is.  Customer comes in and before we could stop him, he wanders into the produce section to do some shopping.  He gets buzzed by the bat.  The bat buzzed the wrong person.

On a daily basis, as in, what gets me out of bed in the morning: my dog. I love the ever-living shit out of her. She is 5 now and is the first dog I raised by myself. I rescued her when she was 3 months old and I was 20. 

My parents told me I would regret getting a dog, and I would never be able to take care of a dog or to train it well. I proved them very wrong. I read three or four books on dog training and dog care before adopting. I spent hours training her and playing with her every day from when she was 3 months old until she was about a year and a half. I learned the secret is to reward good behavior and correct bad behavior. Punishment, yelling, and hitting only teaches a dog to be scared of you. When I take her to dog parks I get all sorts of compliments and questions about how I raised her, and this concept somehow just doesn't sink in to 99% of the people I talk to.

Everyone who I know says she is the most well-behaved dog they have ever met. Now every time I go out of town I literally have people bribe me to let them take care of her. My parents can't get enough of her. She knows several tricks. But by far her best trick is following me around on our daily 30-45 minute walks, stopping at each intersection and knowing to stay on the opposite side of me from the road. She doesn't need a leash but I keep one in my pocket for legal reasons. She is so well behaved and listens to me so well that I have gotten out of tickets because animal control was so impressed. Her daily routine has very much become OUR daily routine. If that routine gets interrupted it affects both of us.

She is my biggest motivator because she keeps me grounded, she is my best friend, and I put my heart and soul into raising her. She has been with me through 2 girlfriends, 2 cities, 4 apartments, alcohol dependency, and the death of my best friend. All she asks of me in return is that I rub her belly. I'll never have another like her.

They don't need a test to tell them they are intelligent. Just a heads up for those thinking they are intelligent. World is full of ""misunderstood geniuses"". 

It's the willingness to learn. 

Most people have potential to be ""intelligent"" but they never use it. If you think you are much more intelligent than average person but are underachiever or similar, there's a great chance you aren't that unique you think you are. 

Humans compete for achievements. 

If you succeed more than once to above average achievements, you are clearly intelligent. Even if you think your high intelligence is the root of your problems or success, it's much more about what you do or don't do. ",null,0,cdnhq8k,1ri642,AskReddit,new,1

Financial services are valued at over a quadrillion dollars, while actual GDP is around 70 trillion. Combine this overvaluation with the fact that social programs no longer receive support (not just welfare, but education and infrastructure) and there is a real war going on. Money is percolating up to corporations and financial elite, who then engage in risky financial schemes that attach value to the trendiness of a product - not to actual material or potential future earnings. Karl Polyani wrote a book called *The Great Transformation* that showed how the growth during the gilded age laid the groundwork for what he called a ""vivisection upon society"" that undermined the values of society. This phenomenon then led to the social milieu that incubated nationalism and led to World War II. If his thesis holds true, we could face a similar result when the bottom falls out. The good news is we have all the information in front of us to do something about the problem, the bad news is that there is little political will around the world to take the necessary steps.

DrJanitor101,Mine just happened yesterday. In the Chicagoland (surrounding suburbs of Chicago) it snowed yesterday and the first snow of the year means no one can drive. After school I was driving down the four lane road that goes through our town and a dump truck was driving in the lane next to me. I was in the farthest lane to the right. While driving down the road a Ford ranger spins out and slides into the lane of the dump truck. The driver just misses the ranger by swerving into my lane getting literally 3 feet from my car. Almost smashing my car and throwing me off the road. The ranger slid back onto its own side of the road and tbones the car next to him. It started and ended in just over 6 seconds.

He used to talk to the servers like we were dirt beneath his feet and that we should be kissing his ass for even an opportunity to be verbally abused by him. 

In the middle of a particularly busy lunch shift he began to follow me in the kitchen while berating my quality of service, when he then continued to follow me out of the kitchen to the dining area I told him if he could do it better than he better get on it.

One day I was putting down pallets of parts for separation. One of my coworkers asked me to move a load I had just put down. I grabbed it, and started to move it, when he yelled at me again to just put it back. I look over at him briefly and ran right into a shrink-wrap machine. My supervisor came running over due to the noise and saw it. Instant piss test.

After a chat in his office, he told me to go to a contracted facility they used often to get my UA. I knew I'd be fired the next day so I quit right there on the spot.

Horrorland is a good one. Its a mystery book with some supernatural stuff.

More than likely there are laws requiring that they give you a copy on request. They may be allowed to charge you a ""reasonable"" fee for that service. If they still refuse, Google search tenants rights for your state. If they don't have a copy of the lease, your state probably defaults you to month-to-month.

Don't correct for wind and you miss the runway and go in the dirt or hit a building. Don't know which buttons/levers to use, you don't put down your gear and you belly-in. So, in the order you asked, if you snuck into a cockpit and tried to land without any training

1) Fighter jet- You will die

2) Big passenger jet- You will die and take a lot of people with you

3) private jet- You will die and take a few people with you

4) small plane- You may be able to land but probably cause damage to the plane

Edit- Forgot about the takeoff part....

Taking off isn't a piece of cake either. Its incredibly easy to get slow or have to high of an angle of attack, then stall and crash. Its easy to run off the runway before ever taking off if you don't know how to control the steering. If there's any kind of issue on takeoff, such as an engine fire, or blown tire, without proper training, you will probably crash and die.

NeoMegaRyuMKII,"&gt; It's always seemed to me like the Allies went to these people who had nothing to do with the war, and basically said, ""This is your home? Well fuck you. It's Israel now. Because Holocaust.""

This does not look at the whole story. The allies divided the land that is now Israel (including the West Bank) into two areas. The northern half (the part that is rather lush and easy to work with) would have gone to the Palestinians and the southern half (which was and somewhat still is mostly desert) would have gone to Israel. Israel accepted this partition and were recognized as a country by the UN. The Palestinians did not accept the partition, refusing to believe that the state of Israel has a right to exist. A war broke out and Israel won. Yes, there were those who were forced to leave but there were also those who left by choice (some sources say that the Arab armies promised that if they won the war those who left voluntarily would be able to obtain the property of the short-lived Israelis). And then there were those who stayed despite the war and then at the end of the war became citizens immediately.

This brings us to

&gt; but I never could understand how that justified/justifies displacing the people who already lived there

One thing that rarely comes up in discussion is that the same happened the other way around as well. That is to say it was not just Palestinians who left Israel to other parts of the middle east. There were Jews in other parts of the middle east who were forced to leave and go to Israel (and keep in mind most sources that research this indicate that there were MORE Jews who left the other parts of the middle east than there were Arabs/Palestinians who left Israel).

&gt;  And yet the victims are considered the bad guys because they want their home back.

There are those that just want their home back. But there are those that want MORE. There are those that believe that a Jewish state has no right to exist whatsoever. The same organizations think that The US has no right to exist. 

Now you might point out something like implementing a system in which Palestinians could legally live in an Israeli state (or vice versa) in a manner similar to Native Americans in the US. Well... that exists. For the most part, Israel does not have much of a problem with Palestinians living in Israel if they live there peacefully. But the fact that many Arab nations' refusal to accept the legitimacy of Israel and the use of terrorism (suicide bombings, rockets, etc) are common is very much reason to assume they have more in mind than having a home. 

The big issue is the lack of willingness to negotiate. Israel has made MANY attempts at negotiation and peace. In 1967 Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt during the 6 Day War. A few years later Israel RETURNED control of the region to Egypt as a form of a peace offering. Jordan had the same type of negotiation (involving the Jordan River). The West Bank is mostly under Palestinian control (with the exception of Jerusalem, which is international (for lack of a better term)).

&gt;  Islamic countries who sympathize with the other Islamic people who got fucked (because Holocaust) are ""evil"" for not wanting Israel to be in what is rightfully somebody else's home. 

As I said before, if those Islamic nations were OK with letting an Israel exist elsewhere then it would be fine. But most, if not all, of those nations are not willing to take such a stance. As for ""rightfully somebody else's home""... that is debatable given the questions of ancestral homes, etc.



You say

&gt; I get that there should be an Israel.

Which alone is a step that shows an absence of anti-semitism. But the question is: what solution do you offer?

So: Do I think you anti-semitic? I do not know. From all that you wrote there you appear, at the very worst, underinformed. This is what I see when I see something talking against Israel. A lot of the data is very biased given the So, now that you have read the whole thing, I wish to know your reaction. Did the information I provide change your view?

Now for the question you ask: people are often considered Antisemitic if they present views like yours because often they are not aware of both sides of the story (often ignoring the Israeli side) and are unwilling to learn the other side.",null,0,cdnhj9x,1ri4b0,AskReddit,new,2
qmechan,"Alrighty. To begin, it's probably a good idea to talk about the impetus for Zionism. The Holocaust was seen as a symptom of the need for Zionism, rather than a cause on it's own. Nationalism is this belief that a group should have a country. And a lot of groups do have countries--Irish people have Ireland, Spanish people have Spain, etc. They have a place where they can kind of do their own thing. And that's important. For Jews, there's never really been that place where we can kind of be ourselves, figure things out for ourselves. In other countries, we tend to get mistreated, outright expelled, or worse. After a long enough period, it simply felt like the safest thing to do  was to have a place where we knew we would be safe domestically. After the Holocaust, people in Europe suddenly saw that yes, that's not a bad idea considering how things have gone. Hence, Israel.

The reason opposing Israel is antisemitic is simply a rejection in that philosophy. First of all, opposition to Israeli policy isn't antisemitic, but the country itself is. ""I hate the existence of Ireland"" is bigoted. ""I hate Ireland doing X Y or Z"" isn't. So...be specific if you want to criticize. But if you believe the Irish people ought to have a country of their own, but not the Jews....usually that's a symptom of antisemitism. Treating Israel on a different standard isn't fair.",null,0,cdnhk5v,1ri4b0,AskReddit,new,1

havalinaaa,"My husband has a high earning job (six figures) that allows us more than enough money to live a very comfortable life. He also works from home about 75% of the time, occasionally he travels. I worked for a long time as well, but when we moved to a new state, he was able to keep his job and I wasn't able to keep mine. Initially I was looking for work, but we both began to realize we liked having me home all day. We eat home cooked meals 5 nights a week, the house has never been cleaner, our pets are happy to have someone to cater to their inside/outside desires all day, we like seeing each other most of the day, etc etc. Also, with the job market being what it is now, I would likely have only found a slightly better than minimum wage job that someone else probably really needs. We have plenty of money; we don't really need a second income. I actually save us money by not working since we no longer have a house cleaner, a dog walker, a commute budget, and we eat at restaurants way less. Plus we both really would like a stay at home parent when we get around to having kids and thought this would be a good chance for me to get used to not working (it has been a significant psychological adjustment).


While he works from home, we still don't see each other much of the day because he's holed up in his office actually working. A typical day goes like this:

* wake up, let dogs out, make coffee, do dishes from last night (he scrapes and soaks, I wash)

* start laundry if needed, let dogs in, internet time

* switch/fold laundry, let dogs out, bad tv/video game time

* make lunch, hangout with husband while we eat, clean up lunch, let dogs in

* clean a room - I rotate throughout the week, let dogs out

* more internet/bad tv/video games, whatever

* start dinner, let dogs in, smoke a j with husband

* eat dinner, fall asleep watching good tv with husband

We wanted to run around the house and turn the lights on, but mom and auntie said no. Then the sound came. A low, howling rumble like a far off train with a low-pitched horn. It got louder and louder. My cousins and I gravitated to the window even though we had been shooed away, and what we saw terrified us.

A funnel cloud was about a mile away across the fields, throwing debris skyward as its howling wind began rising to a shriek. My aunt bustled past us as we gaped out the window, took one look and screamed, ""INTO THE BATHROOM, NOW!"" Their house didn't have a basement, so all the kids jumped in the tub and my mom and aunt threw a twin size mattress over us, then held one over their heads as they crouched on the floor at our side. 

It was oddly quiet in the tub. There was no elbowing, no bickering, no juvenile humor. We were all terrified. We sat there in the dark for what felt like hours. No flashlights, no radio. Just a moaning wind that occasionally shrieked to the upper registers. Sometimes a scratching or a thud as some piece of debris was flung against the side of the house or went tumbling down the street. We knew we could be flying through the air next, but nobody wanted to joke about it. 

Finally, after what seemed like ages, the wind died down and disappeared and the Civil Defense horn sounded the all clear. The funnel cloud didn't get much more than a half mile away from us we think, but that was plenty close enough. We had dodged a bullet, but some of auntie's neighbors weren't so lucky. She packed up a few things and went out to survey the damage and help those who needed it while mom took care of the kids. Driving home later we saw framing timbers and roof shingles scattered like confetti across a few roads, along with tons of inflatable pools, yard tools, mailboxes, and anything else that might have been left outside. Overall it was a fairly small tornado. No one was killed, and only one or two houses were completely wrecked, but half a dozen or so had their roofs ripped off. 

I can't recall a single moment of my life when I felt more scared than when I saw that funnel and the danger I had been warned of all my life became immediate and real. In the face of such power our existence is very temporary and fragile.",null,0,cdnh587,1ri2zj,AskReddit,new,2
DkPhoenix,"I have been in a building that took damage three times in my life.  I'll tell you about the one I remember best, because I was an adult when it happened.

It was a mixed wood and brick apartment/condo setup, two stories, about 12 units.  I was watching TV, the weather reports here get pretty damn precise, tracking the progress of a storm block by block.  They were reporting that it was about 3/4 of a mile away when the cable went out.  That's close, but not scary close when you live in Tornado Alley.  I went and got my battery powered radio/CD player, and tuned in the audio from one of the local TV stations.  (This was back in the days before all digital TV signals, when you could do that.)  The funnel cloud was about 5 blocks away.  Then, the power went out.

Uh oh.

So, I grabbed my two cats, flung them into the bathroom, took said battery powered radio in, and shut the door.

I'm sure you've heard the sound of a tornado compared to a freight train.  There is that element to it, but there's also a shrieking banshee like metal on metal kind of sound, and thumps and cracks, when the debris hits something.  The whole building shook and popped and creaked, then, it got quiet.  Really quiet.  (Except for the piteous meowing coming from the bathtub.)  I opened the bathroom door, fully expecting to see daylight.  Instead, the power came back on.

I went outside to see if there was any damage.  Most of the open carport was gone, as well as the shingles from the roof, and several low wooden fences that hid the water and gas meters.  All the cars in the carport were still there and relatively undamaged, some had debris on top of them like strips of tar paper, sheetrock, insulation, pieces of wood and branches, etc.  There was also debris scattered around on the concrete.

There was a row of old frame houses across the street, not in perfect repair to begin with, and some of them fared much worse.  They had taken a more direct hit, too.  None of them were completely flattened, but some were missing their roofs entirely, and one had partially collapsed in front.  There was a medium sized oak tree uprooted and lying across the street, and several cars overturned.  The stop sign at the end of the street was gone.  There was lots more random debris lying around, same as in the parking lot, also some bricks, shredded tire rubber, broken glass, and twisted up pieces of metal from guttering and drainpipes.

This tornado was an EF3, and it was a ""hopper"", which means it didn't stay on the ground for the entire path.  The same one tore up a strip mall, completely flattened a church sanctuary, and wrecked a truck stop about 10-15 miles away from my building before it spent itself.

As an aside, my father lived about 3 blocks from that church that got flattened, and he slept through the whole thing, sirens and all.",null,0,cdnqdc3,1ri2zj,AskReddit,new,2

happahiro,"For me when I have to focus on some school work/work I need to finish up at home:

-Keep your long term goal in mind.  Sure it would be easy to put off studying or the report or cleaning, but it will just build upon itself, along with other things that I'll have to do, and I'll end up having even less time doing it later on.  Do it now at a leisurely pace or stress out about it later.

-Take some short breaks.  Try focusing for about half an hour then take about a ten minute break to do whatever you want.  TV, check reddit, facebook etc.

-Reward yourself for progress; if you have a lot of assignments, or lots of chores to do, it's nice to reward yourself with something small in between each of the tasks, this kind of goes along with the breaks in between working too, but as rewards some things I do are tea/soda/ a snack.  Pretty much food hahaha.

-Put on some music while you're doing work!  I like to hum to something while I'm working, it helps time go by faster and at least for me, listening to something I like while working makes any task more enjoyable 

-If you're doing cleaning/chores/classwork, if you can work with a partner that'll keep you on track without getting TOO distracted that's also a good way!",null,0,cdngdb9,1ri2sb,AskReddit,new,2

grownupbraces,"I'm not a teacher, but I have a story from when I was in high school, back in the late 90s. I was in Art and it was the week of setting up for the Art Show (near the end of the school year). Everyone had their own little walk-through display set up in the gymnasium; It was a big deal for us art nerds. Anyways I was at my friend's house, and her brother's friend (who was a bit of a trouble-maker) was also there. I had my mom's car with me and I told my friend that I needed to go work on my display (the school was open until dark every day so students could prepare), and her brother's friend asked me if I could give him a ride to the school. Sure, no problem.

We get in the car and after I pull out of the driveway, the kid goes ""Hey look, I wanna show you something,"" and he pulled up his shirt to show me a gun tucked into his waistband. Now, this was a few months before Columbine, so school-shootings were not something that people thought about. It was practically unheard of. I freaked and asked him wtf he had that for. He just smirked and shrugged. I was scared, but not in an ""Oh my god, he's going to kill someone"" way. More just nervous about myself getting in trouble. I didn't know what to do, so I just kept driving to the school. When we got there, I ""remembered that I had to stop at my house to get something,"" so I dropped him off and FLEW back to my friend's house (this was before everyone had a cell phone). I ran into her house and yelled ""Craig's got a gun! He took it to the school!"" -- Again, this was before the Columbine shooting so we weren't thinking ""He's gonna shoot up the school."" We were thinking he was gonna show it off and possibly accidentally hurt someone. My friend's mom called the police and I went home to tell my mom what was going on.

The police went to the school and arrested him. I wasn't there, but I heard it was a big scene. Everyone was talking about it, but no one knew it was me that ""told on him."" He ended up going to juvie and I don't think he finished high school.

mrhymer,"1. General advice - When you are 28 you will look back on your 18 year old self and think he was a lovable idiot who thought he knew everything. When you are 38 you will look back on your 28 year old self and think he was a lovable idiot who thought he knew everything. This will repeat for every ten year period of your life. Don't take yourself too seriously.

2. Girls - the key to a healthy relationship is to stay separate people and only come together to enjoy each other. If you live with or marry a girl you need to have your own spaces in the home to go to. Your own TV and your own tech, etc. Split the household bills fairly. She buys shared groceries and you pay when you eat out. Live like roommates fuck like cheaters. 

3. Work - The goal is not to work for someone else as soon as you can achieve that. You need to get out of the being an employee business by age forty. You become much less valuable to corporate America at fifty. Train yourself to be an entrepreneur. Find your niche and start your own business. 

4. Money - Money is freedom. Debt sucks. Do not go into debt for anything other than business, house, and if you have to a car. If you need a couch then save the money for the couch, charge it and then pay off the credit card with the saved money that day. **Never** hold a monthly balance on a credit card. Have only two major credit cards. Buy gas and major purchases on the one with the best rewards. Buy groceries on the other card. Pay them both to zero each month. While you are young you can do without nice things more comfortably than you can when you are older. Live well beneath your means. Your goal should be to save as much as you possibly can up to 25% of your income. 25% sounds extreme and it is. The key is to start by saving 10% (more if you can) of your current salary. Have it removed from your pay before you get your hands on it. Once you adjust your life where you are putting away 10% then live that way for the next ten years. Increase your savings with each raise, promotion, and better job change. You will be the only 28 year old among your peers who can buy a new car with cash or pay 50% down on a modest house with a 7 year mortgage or invest $50k in starting a new business. 

5. Drinking - moderation. It's not fun to be the drunkest guy in the room. It is more fun to watch and post the video of the drunkest guy in the room and then remember everything enough to give him shit the next day. Also, you always want to be much less drunk than the girls. Take time off from drinking to make sure alcoholism does not fuck you in ass. One complete month every six months. If you cannot go a full month without drinking then get help. 

6. Drugs - Not worth it. 

7. Pets - You never want to be known as a cat guy. 

8. Porn - Porn and masturbation are what good men use to keep from cheating on the women they love. Don't be a cheater be a beater.",null,0,cdnge15,1ri27s,AskReddit,new,3

chaos_owl,"Best soundtrack as in best fitted to enhance the game it is part of, would be Shadow of the Colossus.

Best soundtrack as in most worth listening to on its own outside the game, would be Oath in Felghana.

Tangentially related: the little-played Sega Master System was notable for having games that generally had better music than NES. Zillion and Miracle Warriors are particular standouts in that regard. Miracle Warriors is actually kind of a crap game but is the king of all 8-bit RPGs in terms of having an incredibly catchy main battle theme that it is almost impossible to get sick of despite hearing it over and over again all throughout the game.",null,0,cdnmtxp,1ri1ql,AskReddit,new,1

The entire soundtrack is basically just one song remixed over and over again. But my God it makes an atmosphere unlike any other.

Best Zelda soundtrack IMO
