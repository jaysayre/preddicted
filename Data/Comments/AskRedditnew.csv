bookwench,"Welcome to the No Bullshit Cult of Growing the Fuck Up. 

1) Quit bitching.

2) Get off your ass.

3) Change whatever shit gave you the idiotic impulse to bitch in the first place. 

If 3) is impossible, I mean really impossible, I mean like breaking the laws of physics impossible not just too hard for you personally at this moment - and this has been independently confirmed by 3 other members of the cult - and it's not something like a stupid ass hangnail, but a legit, you have an issue and nothing can help problem - then, and only then, can you bitch. 

4) If any other member of the cult has a legit issue and you think you can help them fix it, you're obligated to help them, at least a little bit. Like, 5%. 

5) No fucking begging for money from other cult members. You can ask for help, but they can't give you cash.

6) You will take care of your own shit. You will not litter, you will not take charity without working for it at least a little, you will not own pets you can't handle, and prior to having a child you'll get some training and take care of your own issues so you don't fuck the kid up. If your S.O. is a dirtbag who can't handle their shit, you will dump them. 

7) You will not be a quitter. Once you accept responsability for something you will motherfucking well see that shit through to the bloody, bitter end. No pawning that shit off on anyone else. Kids, pets, work projects, art, cleaning your damn room  - this goes for everything. 

8) When you fuck up, you will admit it immediately and publicly. You will own your fuck up, and if there's consequences - even jail - you'll do it without making a fuss or being a little bitch. Once you've done this your record is clean, and nobody can ever hold that shit against you ever again, unless you're a moron and don't learn and do the same damn thing again. 

9) You do not under any circumstances ever do anything to hurt someone else. You can defend yourself, but you don't ever deliberately set out to cause damage. Ever. Doesn't matter if the damage is small or large. Doesn't matter if anyone else knows about it. Doesn't matter if other folks think it's no big deal. You don't do that. 

10) And *being* a motherfucking member of this cult, you're not just making sure you don't hurt folks - you're also going to fucking well pay attention to what you're doing so you don't do things that will *accidentally* hurt others. You've got a reasonable amount of care and responsability you have to take in this life. Make sure you take it. 

That's it. Those are the ten commandments. Grow up or get the fuck off my lawn, you little piece of shit. You can wear pink bunny slippers and a tutu, and as long as you accept these rules you're in - but if you're wearing a suit and tie and million dollar watch and you're fucking around breaking the rules, I will have the largest person in our group eat beans, shit on you, and rip up your membership card.

But I did not have a passport, and did not want to sleep with the lead singer who clearly wanted to sleep with me (or probably anything) and they dropped me off at home. 

I was only 18 years old and it was the best experience I think I could have hoped for. Then I got in to music promotion and started meeting lots of artists. 

And after that it got less exciting, but still cool. Now I get to see them fairly often. While I still have tons of respect for these people, I've met enough to realize they really are exactly like you and me. ",null,0,cdpulmd,1rqkuf,AskReddit,new,1

PhedreRachelle,"Way back in the day, me and some friends used to watch videos of this festival all the time. We loved the music and we were obsessed with the festival. Finally we got old enough that we could travel on our own and actually afford to do so. And we started planning to go to this festival. 

This whole time leading up to the festival we had a theme song that really captured the whole concept of the trip for us. We looved it. We would watch the video from when it got played the last year over and over. We would play it on the big speakers, over and over. 

Finally, it comes time for the trip. We get on the plane. We get off the plane. We get on a train to our hostel. We spend some time in the town near to the festival. And finally it is time.

We get on this train, we go and get in line. And then, just as I hand my ticket to the ticket checker guy. I hear it. Our song. The one we didn't think we'd even get to hear (12 hour festival with 14 stages.. there was no chance right?). It was playing on the main stage. 

So we walk/danced our way from the gate to the dance floor. It was the most EPIC moment. It was like we had our own theme song for this start of the thing we all love so much. It felt like it went it slow motion and like the whole festival had just been waiting for us. SO GOOD

Took us another four months to become a couple.

Yea, he started kicking me after a few weeks (""I'm not hitting girls, boys shouldn't hit them."" Apparently, kicking was okay). He was extremly jealous. I wasn't allowed to talk to other males. He showed up at my school to see if I was sitting next to anybody. I wasn't allowed to. No talking to other people when he was around. No back talk. 

After hurting me he always started to cry. Told me he loved me. That I didn't love him enough.

I moved away from LA but we kept in touch and by some weird cosmic coincidence I moved to Alabama right near where her parents live so she came out here often and we saw each other.

dachloe,"The thing is... men measure ""league"" in terms of looks alone. Women measure it by looks, and ""status"" which is hard to define and differs in each social circle. Women have a lot more factors than men!
Men who are not physically attractive can still end up with women ""out of their league"" by just have one ore more of the following: money, status/fame, power.
I've personally seen several cases where guys end up with girls way out if their league and it's always been an odd pairing in some way. I knew a quite and rather blah guy who dated the hottest cheerleader in school for a short time. It turns out spent time together and bonded as camp counsellors over the summer. But as the school year went on she was pressured to date a ""better"" guy and eventually ended up with a jock football player. From that time on her life was like a soap opera; she had lots of guys cheat on her, a couple beat her, steal from her, and she was used a lot in college. She never got past freshman year of college because of ""guy trauma."" She got fat and lost her looks and ended up dating a must more average guy who works for minimum wages in retail. They have two kids.
The guy, dumped in high school, when on to date a drama geek in high school, a couple of ""quirky"" girls in college and then married a girl he works with at the office. He changed a bit in college. He got more confident and better able to relate to people; he's still a nerdy guy, but now since he's in IT he fits in better with the world outside high school.
I also knew a guy who dated a ""super model"" for a few months. They met at a party and she was very drunk. She was very flaky and flighty and never really was anything close to normal. Guys were always after her. But this normal regular guy got her just for the fact that he wasn't trying to ""get"" her. It didn't last long. She moved on to some other kind of guy and moved away to a more adventurous life style.
Most of the time when a guy end up with a girl out side his league it doesn't last a long time. I'm sure there are exceptions, but they are very rare.",null,0,cdpuk7z,1rqkpy,AskReddit,new,1

There were these huge juts of rock coming up out of the ground occasionally. And I was running. 

Why was I running? The wolves and the ravens were after me. Chasing me endlessly across this expanse. Any time I thought I was gaining ground, a new rock monolith would rise up out of the ground in front of me and I'd have to change direction. Losing momentum and letting the pursuers cut the corner to gain on me further. 

I had this dream night after night after night for most of my childhood years. Very much a bad one. Well it was this one and two other nightmares I would shuffle through.

I lied, not the most terrifying. The most terrifying was extremely short and simple. I was walking around to get to the door of a blue truck. As I did so, a large cube van whipped by and hit the side of my face. I continue to the door and look in the window to see that the flesh and cheek bone had been ripped off. Underneath the flesh and cheekbone were tiny little ribs, like my cheek was actually a ribcage. Sticky, mucous stuff was suspended between them. That was probably the most horrifying dream I've had.

So, I was afraid to ask to change pants.

liz1729,"It's all in the attitude, a very cheap attitude. Small things done repeatedly become habits which leads to you consistently saving money (ideal option), breaking even or getting further and further into debt (avoid). I had a highly interesting conversation with some coworkers about a year ago: despite the fact we all earn the same amount and have the same basic outgoings (unmarried, no kids, renting) one is totally broke and the other has modest savings. I save about 30% of my salary so have savings beyond what I thought possible. It was the fear of debt and ruin as I needed to be financially independent aged 21 that made me create a huge safety net for myself and I've not changed my habits from then. 

A luxurious lifestyle for me means being able to spend large amounts at will because you have a large stash of cash to draw from. This meant that when the perfect house came up for rent, I could have it as I had the money for a deposit ready. When a shoe shop had a ridiculously good one off sale of their quality leather shoes for 25% of the price, I was there buying 5 pairs to last me the next few years. This reduces my expenditure over the long run as I'm flexible enough to get the best deals. 

Tip 1: Save as much as possible. Research the best savings accounts and stash your money in them accordingly. Many I have are one year special deals (with hopeless interest rates when they year is up) so I set up reminders to switch when the year is up. When you get your pay put into your bank account, pay your savings account as well as your bills and get used to living frugally on the amount left. I read some research once about how normal people scale up their lifestyle expenses each time they get a pay rise so they have the same amount left over/in deficit each month as they did before. Don't be like them! Maintain your lifestyle. One rich dude I know in his 40s still goes to supermarkets before closing and buys the dirt cheap food about to go off and eats the weird mishmash of items for dinner that evening. A habit from 20+ years ago that he doesn't care to drop even though he can afford to. 

Tip 2: Pay the smallest amount possible for everything. Check the deal you have for electricity and gas and swap if necessary. Ditto insurances, never auto renew. 

Tip 3: Decide what things are important to you and which are not and stop dropping money on the unimportant things. e.g. I am a no-maintenance kind of girl so all haircuts and hair removal is done at home for next to no cost. I don't mind second hand so my house is furnished with second hand stuff and my clothes were dead cheap off ebay. Suits by posh brands for £30 which I got hand tailored by my grandmother to fit perfectly make me look wealthier than average while I'm at work. This frees up tons of money for the important things: I do care about having a nice car so I spent a lot on a soft top sports car. This makes my daily hour of commuting exhilaratingly good fun. My fiancée went to America for work so I went to visit and stopped by New York while I was there. I'd take those over a daily coffee from a takeaway place, or a brand new £800 sofa, any day! 

Tip 4: Avoid bad debt. If you're sensible you should have a credit card, spend freely (the equivalent money is therefore earning you interest in your savings account) then PAY IT ALL OFF. ALWAYS. ",null,0,cdpv3ok,1rqk8m,AskReddit,new,1
gallantgallade,"I was at the zoo, and there was this horse exhibit. There were about 5 horses in total at the exhibit. Two of them were calfs. The male horse mounted one of the females and began humping her, but she protested and ran away. It was clear that she was already pregnant and the two calfs were her babies. The male ran after her, his long penis flailing about. The two babies got on either side of their mother as if to protect her and ran alongside her as the horny male kept chasing them. This went on for about 5 minutes until the zookeeper intervened and isolated the male horse in the back. ",null,0,cdpu1z4,1rqk81,AskReddit,new,2

FarahKh,"The tepid water and my wrinkled finger tips mark the end of my bubble bath. Mommy just checked on me, but my patience has doubled since then. I call for her to help me out of the tub, but she does not respond. I try twice more but I hear no returning calls. I decide that I do not really need her help; I am five and a big girl. The slippery acrylic tub and my misplaced feet results in my arm roughly slicing on the sharp faucet. A metallic and unknown smell engulfs me. All I see is red, just like candy apples. So much red falling from my arm and coloring the bathwater. Unexplainable fear and pain overcomes me. I start to cry and within seconds, mommy is standing at the door. 

She has always been beautiful, but the flour smeared on her face and the stress lines present on her face does not do much for her. The sheer horror on her expression scares me further and transforms my cries into screams. She appears white as a sheet as we stare at each other, motionless. The tub water is noticeably darker when I start to feel a painful sensation shooting down my arm. In a flash, daddy is carrying me while wrapping a soft towel around my arm. Suddenly, I am dressed and inside a speeding car. I look over, still screaming, and see my father dripping in his wetsuit. He looks concerned but is oddly working more on comforting mommy than I. Mommy is wearing her special apron and is holding me tightly with a frightening look on her face. 

The vehicle comes to an abrupt stop and I am being quickly carried out into a building. It takes me very little time to realize I am in a hospital. The pungent sterile stench and cold of the room does not calm me. The waiting room is filled with all kinds of people, so busy looking. I am still crying as daddy carries me into one of the rooms, with two doctors trailing behind him. There was no warning given before one of the doctors started putting a needle and thread through my skin. It reminds me of sewing a dress together. I can only feel a light tugging, but it does not quiet my cries. She finally cuts the thread after what feels like forever. She has a grin on her face that makes he seem less callous while she wraps my arm up tight. The sight of the second doctor taking out a colorful basket quiets me completely. Stickers! So many stickers! I want them all. The first doctor comes around with a jar of lollipops. Oh, how I love the hospital. They are both decorating me with pretty stickers as I enjoy the sweet blue raspberry goodness of my sucker. This room no longer feels so cold. I am taken by the hand and walked out to the reception area when something purple catches my eye. There is the prettiest, fluffiest stuffed bunny I have ever seen. Before I know it, the bunny is in my arms. I give my new friend a big hug and a sticker. As I leave the hospital, beaming, the only thought in my head is: I should slip more often.

2007zeke,"Back in the 7th grade I thought I was the shit. In gym class I would always run and jump to smack the backboard and stuff.  One day I decided to find my inner black person and go for gold. The net.   Mussed horrifically and wasn't even close.  My great idea before gym started was to have my strong friend butterfly jump me so i could grab it.  Sounded pretty cool and I needed to impress the 7th grade bitches so I complied with it.  With a running start I ran and the kid pushed me up after I jumped. Right off the bat I knew something was wrong, I over shot the bitch.   My face and chest were above the rim and in the last effort I tried to grab the flimsy metal hoop to slow me down, bad bad bad idea.  Rim started to bend and glass cracked. I let go for the sake of the poor backboard.  This dismount was not clean and i fall hard as a motherfucker.  Got up fine and everyone was dead silent. My head hurt a bit so I walked it off and then I looked at my arm.  It was not good. I'd say a good 30 degrees out of place and was flopping like a limp dick.  At this point I was fucked and my parents were going to shit bricks. No teacher was there at this point and all of the little kids were yelling so my friend screams ""EVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP AND YOU MOTHER FUCKERS DIDNT SEE ANYTHING"" this foul language was not normal around our little semi-innocent minds so this hit home.  So no one was going to snitch cause my friend was hella intimidating.   
   The next thing I needed was an excuse and fast.  The teachers came out and blew the whistle for the warm up jog. I didn't have an excuse yet so I had to run. My arm was flopping and I swear I was about to pass out. My friend says to fake a fall and use that as an excuse. I had no other option so the next lap i face planted like no other right in front of the teacher. Then I showed them my arm.  I was sent home and whent to the hospital right away.  My plan went will so far.
   At the hospital I didn't leave made up plot.  ""I fell and it was twisted"" was my excuse and they could tell I was lying but didn't say anything.  The next thing they needed to was place my bones back into place. It was terrible it hurt sooooo bad.   The doctor afterwords goes ""You wernt dunking or anything were you?"" On my way out.  If reeked out and got hella scared but nothing happened and I laughed it off. My arm still isn't right and my parents still don't know what really happend.

yungfella,"When I was little, I loved to pee on ant hills. 

loved it. 

One day, I decided to smite a particularly large ant hilll in the middle of our yard. We lived out in the country, so I had no qualms with whipping it out as soon as I spotted any ant mound arrogant enough to be in our nice, green lawn. I saw this one and immediately decided it had to be peed on. 

If you have much experience with ant hills, you know there are ants beyond where you see the dirt that makes up the mound. Halfway through peeing, I realize I felt stinging on my legs and ants moving up rather quickly. 

I run across the yard in a panic and don't start tearing off clothes until I get in the house. By this time, I had a World War Z level swarm on my thighs and groin. 

My aunts were in the living room with Mom. I run past with an arthropod speed and holding a beautiful soprano note into the bathroom where I took the saddest bath of my life.

He threw my hood up and attached this fully grown chicken onto it and just left me there, sitting with this chicken pecking at my head. I was terrified and wanted the thing of of me but I was too scared to ask, so I sat there quietly and cried while he carried on talking. 

After about 5 minutes of terror my mother saw that I wasn't happy about the chicken and politely asked the man to remove it from my head, which was extra embarrassing as everyone turned to watch as he apologised and watched me cry.

My college roommate came down with gastroenteritis (basically a really nasty stomach bug that has you shooting out both ends for a few days). It got to the point where I had to take him to the hospital. I get him checked in, he's in just the gown and his boxers on the bed, and the nurse is asking him some questions.

At one point, an unconfortable look comes across his face and he stammers, ""Um, I just...uh...""

The nurse understands immediately and points him in the direction of the bathroom. Watching my best friend gingerly climb off of a hospital bed, cradling his underpants with both hands to avoid any leakage, and hobble off to the bathroom was one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen.

He disagrees. He says it was the moment he realized I was truly his best friend.

BunsofthePatriots,"Every Saturday a mutual friend of mine and my girlfriend's comes over my house and we watch Breaking Bad and have a few drinks and wait for my girlfriend to get out of work so she can join. Last Saturday I wanted to try Bacardi 151, so I bought a bottle, made dinner and set up so we could just get to watching when she showed up. 

She showed up but looked like she had been crying, so I asked what was wrong and she told me she just had a horrible week and would rather just let it go and have fun tonight. So we did, we drank...and drank...and drank...and kept drinking until neither one of us knew which was was up. She ended up crying again and told me about her work day, so I put my hand in her back and told her everything would be okay, she told me I was sweet. Then she reached for the bottle and even though I was drunk I had a feeling that more alcohol would make things worse so I took the bottle from her and and we locked eyes and kissed.

It was one of those passionate drunk kisses that feel great. Midway through it, my logical side spoke up and told me to stop because what I was doing was wrong, so I did. Immediately after, I had forgotten it happened and was confused as to why she was holding my hand. I figured she was just drunk and it gave her comfort. 

I woke up with a hangover the next day to texts from the friend saying she was sorry and how upset she was and how big of a piece of shit she felt like. I had no idea what it meant until it clicked...holy shit did we have sex? I started to panic and flat out asked her, she said no and told me that we kissed. I was kind of relieved but not fully. I had to see my girlfriend, so I set out on a drive to her house. When I got there she had told me the friend called her and confessed everything. She blamed the whole thing on herself to keep my relationship from ending. I confessed to my girlfriend and apologized profusely and told her it was a drunken mistake. Pretty sure I ended up crying like a pussy but understand that I truely felt terrible for that. 

She forgave me, and our relationship is fine. I'm still upset though, the friend came to the conclusion that she had begun to develop feelings for me after spending so much time together and decided she was gonna lay low for a while and hope the feelings go away. I feel like such a scumbag and before everyone loses their shit, I know alcohol is no excuse. ",null,0,cdpua7t,1rqjpa,AskReddit,new,1

PhedreRachelle,"I had recently moved back in to my mom's so that I could go to school. It was going well, but then my student loan money got delayed a month. So I couldn't afford to pay her rent for December. We agreed I would pay it when I pay January rent. 

Then her boyfriend got drunk and freaked out, and after calling me quite a number of names, kicked me out. My mom said nothing to him, but she did try getting my sympathy for what she has to go through all the time. 

So I found a couch to crash on while I lined a place up. On a student budget. That I wasn't even getting for another month. Mom calls me the next weekend. Not to tell me I can come back and fuck that guy, but to tell me that she was going to go see her parents. If her boyfriend called me, I was to tell him she was in Toronto. Sure mom, got your back. Thanks for getting mine

So I finally line a place up to live, sign the paperwork. Good, that is all awesome. Except the next day the room mate decides to back out. 

Let's not forget that I had left my abusive boyfriend 6 months earlier and all my friends disowned me as a result.

Mr_A,"My daughter loves Buster Keaton. Try ""One Week"" for example, its only 20 minutes and is mind-blowingly dangerous. As for features, ""The General"" is good. Also ""The Kid"" with Charlie Chaplin in it and the first twenty minutes of ""Modern Times"" my daughter liked, then had to leave for unrelated reasons. Also Lloyd's ""Safety Last!"" is a good one for children - it has a fairly bare-bones story that's pretty easy to follow.

If they're in to sci-fi, maybe and I say maybe The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or Metropolis, though you will have to sit with them (as if you wouldn't anyway) to help answer any questions.

Of course, have them watch ""A Trip To The Moon"" - its only fifteen minutes and is literally one of the most important films of all time. My daughter had me put it on at least a dozen times. I usually liked to watch it completely silent, she preferred it with Daft Punk's original soundtrack (for the recent restoration).

The Crowd is a nice movie with a warmth to it and Wings is simply spectacular, though kind of a lot happens in the first twenty minutes you might have to help them with. IE, Mary loves Jack, Jack loves Sylvia, Sylvia loves David. Then WWI interrupts their little love triangle and the story expands pretty quickly where you get the little scenes with Schwimpf and the introduction of the enemy's flying squadron.

1. Attended a local church one Sunday morning, when people started asking normal questions (Where are you from? Any Kids? Etc.) She freaks out and starts ranting about working for ""Stalker Magazine"".

2. Calls my grandparents who live near her and complains about their granddaughter Missy who ""Tried to run her off the road in her Jeep on 2pm Tuesday"" Missy does drive a white jeep, but was out of town at the time. My grandparents are freaked out that this lady knows Missy is their granddaughter even though she doesn't live nearby, has never talked to the woman and doesn't share the same last name.  Three days later an envelope with a picture of Missy's state champion softball team is put in their mailbox. Crazylady had circled the face of the wrong girl (although Missy was in the picture) claims to God above  that she knows this was the girl who almost ran he  off the road and gives advice that they should look into her ""drug problem"". I repeat Missy was nowhere near the area on the Tuesday Crazylady claims this happened, and neither is the girl who's face she circled (that she mistook for Missy). Missy has also never done drugs.
My grandfather scared her off and called her insane when she tried to harass them about it again over the phone.

4. She's been kicked out of all the local parks for sicking her dog on people.

5. She accused her neighbor (Who drove down the road to her  parents house because her elderly father had fallen)  of ""trying to spy on her naked body"". She proceeded to follow the neighbor and harass her. It was 3 o'clock in the morning.

I though I was some big-shot cool kid when I signed up to MC the talent show.
It ended up being me, this other girl, and some 7th grader with cerebral pulsy. all the jokes and lines were written by the principal in about five minutes, so we didn't have much material. It was bad. The girl with cerebral pulsy began to ad-lib, and she would butt-in in random occurrences and say something off-topic. Now, the audience was understanding of this, and I don't think anybody minded. But it made me nervous (i thought I would mess up a line).

It was near the end of the show when I announced this duet. The girl's name was Saffron I think, but nobody cared about her name. At that exact moment, I let out the worst voice crack any man has laid ears upon. It echoed in the gymnasium, and the crowd roared with laughter. It was a good thirty seconds before the laughs stopped.

I became known as the voice-crack guy. If anyone cracked, they had a ""Shut-Up-Tyler"" moment. Because of this, I ended up voice-cracking more often.

ThisGuySal,"When I was partying in college, I befriended a guy training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ).  While he was a nice guy, he was pretty young and his fighting skills in conjunction with his ego occasionally made him act like a cock-sure ass.  He was a drinking buddy and I had to put up with listening to what a badass he thought he was.  I mean, I'm sure he was *but*...

One day he missed class but came in to the cafeteria at the college and said he wanted to talk.  He looked like he'd been throwing up.  Long story short, the night before he'd been drinking at a bar downtown and walked up to a random guy and his hot girlfriend and literally said ""What's to keep me from smacking you to the ground like a bitch and just *taking* your woman?""  He actually used to boast about using this line to me prior to the incident which was one of the reasons drinking with him was so annoying.  I never thought he actually did or would do it.

Anyway, the boyfriend invites him outside to settle their differences.  My friend was drunkenly thinking he'd get to show off his fighting skills but, instead, once he and the boyfriend are outside, the boyfriend pulls a pistol out along with some kind of badge and says he could shoot my friend dead right then and there and nobody would think twice about it.  He invited my friend to never, *ever* be in downtown (our city) again.  Which was very bad for my friend because his BJJ dojo was smack in the middle of our (fairly small) town.

Didn't hang out with him much after that.

___________________________________

* [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)

This is access to the ""dark web"" of lore, but also gives you the handy trick of being bounced randomly though a world-wide router network to obscure your IP address. You can generate new IP addresses or ""identities"" whenever you feel like it. Tor is great for when you really want to fly under the radar, but I would not recommend it as a daily browser since its default privacy settings will block a lot of ""regular"" internet functions such as running scripts (although this can be adjusted).

* In-Private or ""Incognito"" browsing

This is a more realistic way to go about your daily business while minimizing the amount of information that is connected to your activity. In IE and Firefox it's called ""private"" browsing, and in Chrome it's called ""Incognito"" (but more on Google later). Browsing in-private will not create a history, you will automatically be logged out of log-in based accounts after leaving, and ads will not be customized based on your activity. 

* Location Information

In your browser, there should be a setting to disable automatic location detection via GPS or IP. On phones, there should be an option to disable automatic location detection for anything besides 911/emergency calls. Disabling your location will mean that you won't get custom map, etc. results, but it will also mean that you are not tracked as easily. I believe most social networks (namely Facebook) have the option of turning off automatic location tagging in posts.

* Cookies and Scripts

Go into your browser of choice, and dig into ""settings"" or ""internet options."" From there, go to ""privacy"" or something similar, and you should be able to adjust the default level that your browser blocks cookies, which track your information. Keep in mind that if you block ALL cookies, many common web-based programs such as Gmail will not function.

* Ad-related Tracking

If you don't like custom ads, there are several ways you can minimize their presence. Browsers like IE have a ""safety"" dropdown under ""settings"" that allows you to turn on a basic tracking protection feature. [DoNotTrackMe](http://download.cnet.com/DoNotTrackMe-for-Firefox/3000-11745_4-75653399.html) is a similar option that you can download for free. Finally, you can opt out of custom ads by going to the [consumer opt-out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for online ads and disable customization from several dozen companies that are in the business of using your browsing habits to present custom ads. **HOWEVER** keep in mind that ""do not track"" functions are actually a misnomer in the sense that they cannot prevent all tracking of activity... they just prevent custom ads that have been created in response to the tracked information.

* Avoid APIs and connections between accounts

Have you ever been to a website that offers to let you sign in with your Facebook/Google/Other existing account? If you do so, it would be connecting with an [application programming interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), which lets the two accounts communicate with each other and exchange information. You can think of it as a giant pipe connecting two water towers of information. Often, allowing one account to connect to another counts as giving ""permission"" to a hidden/implied Terms of Service agreement, which then allows the two accounts to share and collect information with each other, and occasionally automatically post information (example: Yahoo! posting which stories you are reading to your Facebook account). The more you can keep your online accounts separate, the more private your information will be, and the less risk you have of information being shared and aggregated between your accounts to create a comprehensive online ""persona."" That being said, on mobile phones, APIs are much harder to avoid.

* Avoid Google

This should speak for itself, but is a tough habit to break. Google will track nearly anything you do within its ecosystem (YouTube, Search, Mail, Google+, etc. etc.) and is in the business of connecting all of that information to your online persona. If you must -- even I have a gmail -- do your best to log out of your account whenever possible. Google's defaults are to keep you logged-in automatically whenever possible, making it easier to collect information. Some browsers can be configured to limit the amount of information Google collects, but they have famously reverse-engineered blocking settings (breaking the law, mind you) even in Apple's Safari, which was often exalted as a relatively closed and secure ecosystem. Back to Chrome. Ditch it if you can. Because Chrome is Google's proprietary browser, they can do whatever they want with it and all other settings I mentioned in other browsers do not apply. Assume everything you do in Chrome will eventually be tracked and linked in some way back to any existing Google accounts you have.

* Search off the beaten track

Google, again, tracks all search engine queries whether or not you have a Google account proper (location, IP address, etc.). Google is obviously one of the best search engines in terms of breadth and accuracy, but there are other options. If you want to search something without Google tracking it, use the native search in Tor or -- if you want to stay in a regular browser -- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). They claim not to track queries, although your search results will likely be much different than they would have been in Google.

Darblin85,Hay there I'm a former army guy. When it comes to recruiters some are good and some will try to screw you over. I know of one guy that had a degree in astral physics and his recruiter got hem in as field artillery 13 B. Really best advise I can give you is do your research. As far as branch I have served with them all over seas and each one has its ups and downs. So really look in to every thing figure out what you want and go for it. Know one can say any one it's better then the other. They just have different things. Also if you are graduating with a bachelor's degree make sure you get everything you can for it. You should start out with higher rank E3 minimum. Or in the army that would be private first class. If you have any specific questions feel free to message me.,null,0,cdpuc5g,1rqisi,AskReddit,new,2
Rainstorme,"Army officer who commissioned from college here, I'd highly recommend going the officer route. You kind of set yourself behind the power curve on that path by not going through ROTC but it should be possible to still do it through OCS (or whatever the other branches call it). Recruiters have been able to stop misleading people now that recruitment goals have been dropped drastically but don't trust anything they say that isn't in your contract (which means actually read the contract). If you have an ROTC program at your school I'd go talk to them there, they'll definitely help you out and will probably give you advice before you even go to a recruiter. If you do try to become an officer, make sure you are physically fit because OCS slots are sought after and PT score is usually a major part in deciding who goes.

As for branch, if you want to do something related to your degree you have to go Air Force or Navy because the Army and Marines will just put you where they need you without regard to what you majored in (outside specialized fields like law and medicine). It is a lot harder to get into the Navy and Air Force, though. People tend to get in and not get out like they do in the Army so there isn't as big of a demand for recruits.

If you want to enlist, don't expect to do much that would be meaningful work experience in your field but you will have the ability to pick what you do to a larger extent. You'll also have to put up with a lot more of the bullshit stuff like cleaning latrines and buffing floors. Hopefully an Airman or Sailor will drop by to go over that because I don't really know what their busywork tends to be.

With your background, geospatial/ imagery intel or 9S would probably in your best interest.  9S is a new job and many people don't know what exactly they do, but from what it sounds like, they deal with detecting nuclear  activity around the world...your background may benefit some jobs but is irrelevant when getting into a job as you will get trained in that particular field anyways (I graduated with a degree in biomedical sciences)...if you have any questions, let me know!!

The downside is that If you go enlisted and your first tour is on a ship you could be out to sea for 6 months or more. On top of that you will be doing at least 2 tours in a 4 year rotation. Also there are a lot of 2-3 week training exercises for qualifications before deployment.

homopopsicle,"I had to come out twice. The first time I came out to my parents at 15 as bi. I literally told them ""I think I'm bi."" Their response was basically, ""oh thats nice dear,"" as if I was doing it to get attention or be cute. Don't get me wrong, they were accepting, but I also didn't think they took me that seriously. They seemed to have no problem with it when I started dating another girl. 

The second time I came out at 19 as transgender. Their reaction was similar, but it wasn't until I actually physically started transitioning from female to male until my mom went apeshit. She told me I looked like an ""ugly lesbian with chin hairs"" and that nobody would want to be in a relationship with me. My father took it very well. I think he was actually excited to have a son in his life. My relationship with my mother has been very strained while my father and I have bonded very well. It wasn't until a couple months ago that my mother started using male pronouns (even though I've been passing for years now--ugh, the public humiliation she put me through--Imagine overhearing a mother ask her bearded son how his gynecological exam went in the middle of a crowded Costco. Yeah, it was bad). 

I think I've actually had it pretty easy as I've never been kicked out or told I'm going to hell by any of my family, but my mom still admits that she hasn't ""accepted"" the fact that I'm a dude now. She rarely looks at my in the eye and doesn't like talking to me on the phone (I don't think she likes hearing my deep voice).

My advice is that if your parents are assholes, give them time. A lot of them turn around. If you are under 18 and dependent on your parents, tread carefully. If they are manipulative and homophobic, they could make your life a living hell.

The only problems I really ran into came when the doctor said that without a doubt that I was transsexual. They wanted me to ""just be gay"" more than anything. However after 7 months of frequent arguing they came around. I will agree with homopopsicle. If you're still dependent on your parents be careful. However, if you're beginning to feel suicidal in anyway it may be best to come out or at least find yourself a medical professional to talk to.

We dated in secret for a while because his parents are homophobic to the extreme (they'd disown him if they found out he was trans or gay), and I thought my parents were. Mom just kinda figured it out when I kept asking to spend so much time with him because I still can't drive on my own because I'm too lazy to go out and get my permit. Eventually we were openly dating, at my house at least, and my dad was eventually told as well. He doesn't like it, but doesn't stop me.

When I was 11 years old I saw to bullies being picking on their usual target. It was actually getting out of hand.

Maybe because the cast came of early so I could go swimming on holiday in Antibes (France).

When I was in the boy scouts, around 14 years old, I drank some beers, sitting on a roof of our camp site. A little woozy I thought I heard someone coming and fell of the roof when trying to stand up. I landed on my feet, and you might think that's a good thing, but it wasn't, broke both.

Had both my feet in cast for 5 of 6 weeks (and fell in a pool at some point with those, pretty hard to swim with two casts and druk. My friends thought it was funny though).

A couple of years later I was playing pool in a bar and accidentally knocked over someone's beer. He immediatly got very angry and I was like ""I would have offered to buy you another one, but you are being an ass hole"". He hit me. I've been hit before and after that, but never that hard. I think my feet might have left the ground. Anyway, I broke a girls nose with the cue. Still feel kinda shitty about that.

a_beauty,"December 1st, when the advent calendar and Elf on the Shelf come out.

My husband and I inherited an old advent calendar from his grandmother. It's a large tapestry that hangs on the wall and is a picture of a house with lots of rooms. Every day you pin a stuffed bear onto a different numbered spot in the house, until the bear finally discovers Christmas with his little bear family in the main room on the 25th day. My two daughters love the calendar and take it very seriously, sitting in front of the wall every night before bed to watch where the bear will search next.

The Elf on the Shelf is just a stuffed elf that moves to a new spot in our house every night, after returning from the North Pole to tell Santa how well we have all been behaving. My daughters look for him every morning and are generally extra well behaved during December because they know the elf is ""watching"". It sounds kinda creepy when I write it, but it's a Christmas tradition.

Those are the two things that signal the beginning of Christmas for me. The other things like cookie baking and house/tree decorating fall on different days every year, but the calendar and elf always come out on the 1st of December.",null,0,cdptwfg,1rqhn9,AskReddit,new,2

Yosemite?!!!
We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right! We fought for moral reasons, we passed and struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, and we acted like men. We aspired to intelligence; we didn't belittle it; it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election, and we didn't scare so easy. And we were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed.

In hindsight, it's possible that I was missing the jokes.


I don't think the reveal made much more of an impression on me than the rest of the film - it was a big, fantastic story, and all of it was incredibly cool and amazing and wonderful, and the bit where the bad guy was the hero's father just fit right into all that as a perfect part of the awesome climax...  
and then the film just kinda stopped with a ""to be continued"" feel. But I didn't really mind, and it was an awesome experience.

toxlab,"My first real date was seeing Empire.
I saw the original Star Wars as a kid at a drive in theater. I sat on the roof of the car with a blanket, and there was a meteor shower happening as the movie swung into gear. To say this captured my imagination in a big bad way is an understatement. Star Wars had my heart. And nearly every cent of my whopping two dollar a week allowance.

When they started promoting Empire, I lost my shit. I was going to the first show on opening day, no question. A girl who lived in my apartment complex seemed interested in going, as well. I knew nothing about girls, and most of them seemed kinda prissy, and not interested in cool stuff like Godzilla, Star Wars, and Marvel comics (my holy trilogy). This girl would play action figures with me, and we would have wild adventures in the tall grass behind the building. And she never argued with me about rule number one: I am always Boba Fett. 

So we're cruising Darth and Boba around the parking lot, drowning Chewie in a puddle, and discussing what we thought was going to happen. She seemed sad. I asked her if she was going to see the movie. She explained that she didn't have the money. I thought maybe I could sweet talk my mom into giving me enough for her ticket, and told her so. We didn't have much, but my mom was an easy touch and always went the extra mile to make us happy. I told her to hold onto Chewie, put Darth and Boba in my pocket, and rocketed home.

My mother and her mother were sitting in the kitchen of our apartment, drinking tea and chatting. I ran over, all vim and energy, and explained in my breathless manner that the fate of not only our world, but the entire galaxy, depended on my friend joining me in a galaxy far far away. 

Mom was sympathetic, but unswayed. I had already gotten an advance on my weekly allowance, and she just couldn't afford to give me more. 

My grandma was captivated. ""Do you like this girl?"" She asked. 
""Uh huh. She can ride bikes real fast, and she plays Star Wars with me, and she will play Chewie even though nobody likes Chewie. She's rad!""
""Well,"" Grandma said. ""You should ask her out on a date. You can take her to the movies, and then go out for dinner. And if she likes you, she might give you a kiss.""

My mom objected. Grandma was always, like myself, a creature of fancy. She was an artist, and a flutterbye, settling on one new thing after another. My mom had to be much more grounded in reality. There was no way we could afford this ""date."" 

Grandma took this as a challenge. She would pay, drop us off at the theater, pick us up afterwards, and then take us to a pizza place, and chaperone. I thought this sounded awesome. Grandma explained how to politely ask for a date, and what a gentleman on a date did. Hold doors, defer to your date's choice of pizza topping, make sure you brushed your teeth so you didn't have stinky breath, etc.

My heart was glad. I could take my friend to what I was sure was going to be the best film ever made. I couldn't find it in me to run and tell her, because I had all this new information swimming around in my head. I had to be a gentleman. Would she still like this new me?

I found her in the parking lot, grinding Chewie's head against the asphalt. (We had decided that Chewie would be cooler if he was ""pointy"".) I told her that my grandma was going to take us. Her face lit up. I explained that we would go out on a date. Immediately, she seemed crestfallen. I panicked and went into full sales mode. We would go see the movie, then grandma would come get us, and we'd go get pizza! Two  	
unbelievable treats in one! How could you lose? 

She seemed shaken. She handed me Chewie back, and said she had to go home. I told her that the movie started at four, and we'd have to get going soon. She didn't answer. I didn't know what to think.

A little while later, there was a knock on my door. My friend's older sister was there. At thirteen, she seemed as grown up to me as any adult. While my friend was kind of a tomboy, her older sister was the super sassy ultra girly girl, and I pretty much avoided her because my stomach felt weird if I looked at her too long. 

She asked about the date, and I explained my intentions. Movie, pizza, ride home with grandma. At that age, I hadn't really learned yet how to be disingenuous. Older sister explained that younger sister didn't really understand what a date was. I told her that I was a Gentleman, and knew how to treat a lady. (Thanks, grandma.) She thought this was adorable. She said her sister would be ready at three. 

I was in the living room watching TV when a story about Empire came on. The newsreader was standing in front of our local theater, and behind her was a line that stretched around the building! Still a few tickets left, she said. Oh no! I hollered for my grandmother and told her we had to go NOW! She said to get my date, and meet her at the car.

I rang her bell. I was half an hour early, and was bouncing up and down in anticipation. She answered the door...in a dress. I had never seen her in a dress before. ""We gotta go!"" I cried. I grabbed her hand and we ran to the car. 

As we sat in the back seat of grandma's LTD, I realized that she was wearing her sister's perfume. A lot of her sister's perfume. ""Huh."" I said. ""You smell nice. Never seen you in a dress before."" She looked embarrassed. ""It was my sisters idea. Stupid, I know."" ""No."" I said. ""You look nice.""

We got to the theater, and grandma pulled up to the end of the line. She gave us money for tickets and popcorn, and told us where to meet her after the film. As we settled in for the hour plus wait, the capricious Pacific Northwest weather suddenly changed. What had been a crisp day suddenly became a massive storm of huge fat snowflakes. Neither one of us had a coat. After a few minutes of big wind gusts, and snow sticking to our skin, we were both miserable. But dammit, Star Wars! We huddled together at the corner of the building, waiting for the line to move.

When the doors opened, a great cheer went up. I flexed my stinging hands, trying to work the money out of my pocket. 

The movie began, and we saw AT-ATs for the first time. I was entranced. When Luke's snow speeder entangles the legs of the great machine, I was mesmerized. I leaned forward, trying to absorb this movie into my pores. I set my hand to the hand rest, and realized I had put it on top of hers! What should I do? Do I yank it away? Would that hurt her feelings?

Suddenly, she shifted her arm so that her hand was holding mine. She locked her grip in mine. This was perhaps the most amazing thing that had ever happened to me. Not quite as amazing as Star Wars, but still...

As the film went on, I was no longer chilly, but suddenly quite warm. Sweaty, in fact. My gaze was locked on the screen, but I had a tingling where our hands met, and this was an entirely alien sensation.

Then came that great reveal. ""He told me you killed my father!"" 
""I am your father!""

I gasped, and looked over. She was already looking at me. She smiled. The chemicals in my brain were doing backflips. I had a sense of intoxication I had never known before.

The rest of the date went swimmingly, but I told you this long ass story in answer to your simple question because seeing that film in those circumstances left an indelible mark on my soul. So yeah, you could say it was pretty remarkable.

TL;DR: 9 year old me loved the shit outta Star Wars.

EDIT: wow, this gained traction in a big way. Thank you for your kind responses. I realize now that Boba Fett wasn't an action figure yet, and I've addressed that within the thread. I also posted how the date ended up.

EDIT 2: Holy moley. I answered as many posts as I could before going to bed at 2 am. Woke up this morning to a message avalanche like I'd been accepted into Hogwart's. Story submitted to r/defaultgems, Reddit gold, and hundreds of kudos. I'm stunned. This is by far my most successful post in over a year of Redditing. Thanks, guys. Glad you enjoyed. I adressed my Boba Fett slipup in the thread. That hasn't stopped a ton of people from asking about it. Scroll down a little. Or click my user name. Either way, my mistake doesn't change the story much; my love for Fett just clouded my mind like a jedi mind trick.
As for the girl: I also posted how the date ended up- scroll down/user name again. A lot of people want to know if we got married or some such. I haven't really added any more info because I'm sure that whatever romantic ideals your mind can conjure up will be way better than boring old reality. I'd rather it remain a mystery from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Nootch.",null,0,cdpvt3h,1rqgfi,AskReddit,new,1

The_Horse_Yeller,"I had heard rumors that there was a big plot twist, but no one knew the specifics. This was before the days of Twitter, Facebook, and the rest, so they could actually get away with keeping in under wraps. I had my own theories. I thought that maybe Han Solo was a double agent. Maybe the Death Star they blew up was actually a decoy, and there was some Super Death Star lurking in the midst. 

On a cold, dark night in 1980, I drove to the theater with my fiance. We were all dressed up in our finest Star Wars attire- I went as Luke, my fiance went as Leia. We had a bit of a scuffle with the ticket taker because I thought the ticket price was too high. I refused to give it to him. My fiancé told me I should just give in and pay it, but I stood my ground. So we snuck in through the back.

I could immediately tell that it was better than the first one. The acting, the pacing, the dialogue- all were so much better. When Lando Calrissian betrayed Han Solo, I thought that was the big twist everyone was talking about- but boy, was I wrong. 

I remember watching that fateful scene on the edge of my seat. I was trying to stay focused on the movie, but some asshole sitting behind me kept poking me. I turned around and politely whispered that he stop.

""I know who you are, asshole!"" he said. ""You're the guy who wouldn't pay the ticket price! You snuck in! That's it, I'm getting the usher! You're busted, pal!""

He raced off for the exit. My blood began to boil- Luke and Vader were having an epic lightsaber battle, and I knew that something big was going to happen. One of the theater attendants, who had just been informed of the situation, approached me and asked me to show him my ticket. I fumbled through my pockets for a while. After obviously not finding it, I told him I must have lost it. 

""You're not fooling anyone, sir,"" he said. ""Let's go.""

As my fiance and I were being escorted out of the theater, I heard those fateful words come out of Darth Vader's mouth. So *that* was the twist, I thought...I never would have guessed it. 

After making our way towards the entrance, we were confronted by the ticket taker. ""You snuck in, asshole! You better pay up now or you're banned from this theater forever. C'mon man, it isn't that expensive. I need about tree fiddy."" Well, I wasn't gonna give that asshole no tree giddy, so me and my fiance made a run for it. Since my movie watching experience had been so ruined, I felt like ruining it for everyone waiting in line for next show. I screamed at the top of my lungs that Darth Vader was really a fifty foot tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era.

YellowOrbitz,"Edit: I just remembered another one! Also I apologize for my bad writing I'm on my phone. I was with my boyfriend and his older brother in the basement when my boyfriend got a boner. However, we were under a blanket (not including his brother) when it happened so it wasn't a big deal. Well, my boyfriend pulled his pants down to free his boner under the blanket and forgot about it. So he's talking with his brother and they get into some playful argument when his brother rips the blanket off my boyfriend. My immediate reflex was to hide his junk so I immediately grab it. His brother was laughing his ass off and it took my boyfriend a second to remember he pulled his pants down a little. It was so weird staring into his brothers eye while holding my boyfriends boner. 

Also: 

Well, one day I was crying and talking with my boyfriend when he got a boner. We had sex and I actually felt better. 

Another time we were at the mall and I had gotten a new dress. We had already had sex so I thought it would be okay to change into the new dress I had gotten. Nope, instant boner (I'll admit I felt very complimented). We couldn't leave because we were going to see the movie at the mall and it was too far from the house to get there and back. We had sex in the car. We missed the movie. 

I don't think it was awkward for me as much as him because he didn't know how I'd react. I mean I've never turned down sex from him but I guess he thought I'd say no? It was really cute too because he'd give me the guilty face like he did something wrong. 

Oh, and every time we were with his family and he got a boner. I know that was definitely weird. ",null,2,cdpt6k6,1rqgeh,AskReddit,new,2

A half century later, in 1675, after Plymouth Colony had grown exponentially, and southern New England had seem the formation and growth of Massachusetts Bay Colony, Connecticut Colony, and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantation, the Wampanoag went to war against Plymouth.  

This turned into an all-out war of cultures, with the European colonies all siding together (notable because everyone outside of Rhode Island hated Roger Williams) and most of the tribes of the region fighting together (the Wampanoag and their traditional enemies, the Narragansett, along with the Nipmuc and Nauset tribes).  

Interestingly, several ""Praying Indians"" gave their loyalty to the colonies, and played pivotal roles over the course of the war.  Also, the Mohegan tribe aligned itself with the United Colonies (PC, MBC, CT) and Rhode Island.

The events of the war were incredible.  

The fighting was done in raids rather than battles, the colonists got whipped in the beginning, the tide turned in the winter with a massive preemptive strike against the Narragansett (who had been neutral, but were not trusted), there was an attempted alliance with the Mohawk of the Iroquois nation that could have swung the balance of war, Plymouth was attacked, Providence was burned, western Massachusetts was retaken, until eventually the outnumbered and outsupplied native coalition ran out of steam.  

The war ended Metacom/King Philip returned from Iroquois territory to his home at Mount Hope in Pokanoket (modern Bristol, RI) and was shot through the heart by the brother of one of his own men.  Amazingly, the remaining Wampanoag escaped the raid on Mount Hope by their octogenarian missinge (war chief) named Anawan.  Anawan had known Metacom's father, Ousamequin (better known as Massasoit, which was his title), and would have presumably have been alive through the plagues of 1616-1619, the landing of the pilgrims, the souring of the relationship between the two cultures, and the war itself.  Anawan was later captured out in a swamp with the last remaining warriors trying to take back their ancestral lands. 

King Philip/Metacom's body was drawn and quartered, and his body parts were hung from a tree.  The Praying Indian who shot him got his hand and head as a souvenir; he sold his head to Plymouth, where it stayed on a pike for over 20 years, until--the legend goes--a Wampanoag climbed up and took it back. Anawan was promised safe passage by Benjamin Church, the commander of the men he surrendered to, but upon his return to Plymouth he was executed.

The war was incredible for the historical impact it had.

The war devastated the nations that had inhabited this land.  Their cultural influence in the region would not recover.  The survivors of the war were either executed or killed.

Not having a written language, much of the native history in the region is now lost--and that which we have is filtered through the pen of a colonist.

It essentially won southern New England for the European colonists, who in a mere 50 years had arrived and taken complete control of the region.

The modern United States Army Rangers originated during this war.  Church organized them amongst the United Colonies, and they received training from natives friendly to the colonists.  There is a direct lineage to the rangers Church organized to the modern rangers.

The fighting was brutal.  This was total war that surpassed even William Tecumseh Sherman's march through the south.  Every man, woman, and child was fair game, and were frequently killed.  Towns and cities were targeted, fields were plundered and burned, and livestock were stolen or slaughtered.  It was a war of cultures, not a war of armies.

The war galvanized the colonies and their citizens together in a way that was new and unique.  Notably absent in the war were the British--it was American colonists that fought and died together.

The new spirit of togetherness and self-sufficiency, combined with the guerrilla tactics learned through this experience would be revived by the colonists in another major conflict that originated in Massachusetts.

In terms of casualties, there are some experts who rank this war as the bloodiest that we know of to ever be fought in North America.  That is to say, as a percentage of population, this war possibly killed a bigger portion of the two sides fighting than any other conflict.

For such an important and dramatic event, I'm really surprised nobody has taken on the war in a major audiovisual production.  The biggest restraint would be time--to tell the scope of the war (the causes, the fighting, the political ties, the long weary terrifying year that it was for both sides, the effects, etc) in a typical two hour film format would be nearly impossible.  My own opinion is that you'd have to go for a trilogy format (which would be an expensive gamble) or go with a TV miniseries (which, until Game of Thrones changed things, I would've said could never work).

There are many moments in this conflict that would translate beautifully to the silver screen though:

The prelude showing the treaty and Thanksgiving feast as the cultures met and bonded in 1621

The arrest and death of Massasoit Wamsutta at the hands of Plymouth (didn't even touch on that, this is getting long, look it up; one of the soldiers that arrest him, Josiah Winslow, later became governor of Plymouth during the war)

The meeting at Mount Wachusett where the Wampanoag and Nipmuc decide to make war. 

The violence and brutality of the raids, and their emotional impact.

The raid on the Narragansett winter fort in the ""Great Swamp Fight.""

The plea of Metacom to their enemies of the Iroquois Confederacy.

The elderly Roger Williams (who was a true friend and ally of the natives) watching his city of Providence burn to the ground, while the warriors around him spared his life.  (In a film, he'd catch glances with a warrior and share a knowing look.)

The death of Metacom, shot through the heart on Mount Hope, by a ""Praying Indian.""  (You can't make this up--in Hollywood they'd call you a sap for overdoing it on the symbolism, but this is exactly what happened.)

The desecration of native bodies, living and dead after the war.  Surviving natives bound in chains. Metacom's proud body being torn apart, a heroic figure who deserved so much better.  Then, after the credits roll, a silhouetted figure climbs the pole to take back Metacom's skull from the pike on which it has been stuck.",null,0,cdpv168,1rqg4n,AskReddit,new,1

He essentially turns into a villain because he finds out that not only was he adopted, but stolen from Odin's enemies in an effort to one day unite the two opposing groups. He finds himself without a true family, without a path to the throne that he so desperately wanted, and saddled with the knowledge that he only had the family he did because of the possibility that he might be of use to them politically in the future. I think there's a lot to his character that people can relate to - feeling out of place, having something taken away that you feel you deserve, feeling the weight of expectations on you at all times, and especially living in the shadow of your sibling's triumphs. He's a very relatable character on a lot of levels I think, because the things that really push him into being a villain are very human and widespread.

Second: more than likely, your other friend/her ex isn't going to find out unless she reciprocates your feelings &amp; you two decide to tell him that you wanna start dating.  Which, by the way, is what I suggest you do.  Don't fuck her behind his back, because it *will* get out &amp; then he *will* be pissed.  By being up front with him, there's at least a chance he'll be able to get over the initial shock &amp; hurt, if there even is any.

Third: if she doesn't reciprocate &amp; stops being your friend, or if you lose your other friend whether you &amp; the girl date or not, well...them's the breaks.  You can't upset the status quo &amp; expect there not to be consequences.  Part of being a man is learning to face the music whether it's going to play sweetly or not.

The_Levitating_Baby,"I am about a 30 minute drive from Miami so I live in the suburbs. Florida is a pretty nice place. It's always hot and really moist here. During the summer it's really hot and rains a lot. Lots of beaches to go, if you're a beach person Florida is great in that aspect. I don't think there is anything notable about our food except the sea food is pretty good depending on what fish you get.

The winter is great cause the tempature ranges from 50-80 for the most part although you most days it should be in the upper 70's. Because of this, you will only really need to get one set of clothes besides a jacket and jeans here and there. No winter clothes required which is a beautiful thing. It's very diverse in Florida, especially near Miami. Lots of hispanics there. As for Miami, it's really not all that special I think. Some places it's beautiful, some it's nasty like all big cities. Otherwise it is also really exotic from other cities as it barely represents anything American like somewhere like Boston would. The housing down here is also definitely more expensive than a place like Georgia or the Carolinas. The reason they are more expensive is due to the fact that we get lots of hurrincanes so the houses are all much stronger and most include things like shutters.

ThxForTheDownvote,"When I was 10, I played youth football. The coach had a son who was spoiled and an asshole but didn't want to play the game so he insisted the son be the team mascot. We were the Wolves so he spent like $200 to get this wolf mascot costume and the son would wear it and jump around and stuff.

So we're playing a game, it was before the first half of the season, like the 3rd game maybe? And the coach's son is dancing around in that damn wolf costume on the sidelines. I didn't see this part but I guess the coach's son kept tapping his dad and his dad would wave him off to concentrate on the game.

The coach calls a timeout and we're all huddled around and some kids started giggling cuz of the smell of farting coming around. The coach is like ""stop farting and concentrate on the play"". Turns out that no one farted. The coach's son had shit himself in the wolf costume. He kept tapping the coach cuz he had to go to the bathroom.

chrisgond,"Prior to choosing the M.D. route, I had declared as a Computer Science/Engineering major.  But in my Freshman year, my Grandpa died of cancer, and that had a profound effect on my career choice.  My family cared for him until the final days where he needed a skilled facility.  During that time, I took more of an interest in medicine in general and specifically elder care.

With that in mind, I switched to a B.S. in Chemistry and a pre-med path.  I never loved Chemistry like I did computer programming, but I stuck with it with my eyes on the MCAT and med school.  I volunteered at hospitals and worked the night shift at a nursing home to become immersed in the culture, so to speak.

A potential red flag that I missed happened during my time as a CNA.  I despised it.  At the time, I told myself that it was just the gritty truth of nursing home care, especially during the night shift, but with 20-20 hindsight, I just hated the work.  I soldiered through it, graduated and was accepted into three different schools.  Score!  Hard part's over, right?  

Wrong.

I was always near the top of my class academically, but in med school, the competition and material became much more intense.  I mean several orders of magnitude of intensity.  I struggled, and it wasn't for lack of studying.  The sheer quantity of material and the pacing blew me away.  None of it individually was very difficult, but the collective amount of material and the frequency of week-long testing marathons kicked my ass.

If I had been truly captivated by medicine, I think I could have made it, but the subject matter turned out to be not all that interesting to me.  I grew to hate it, and in the middle of Year 2, after failing a biochem test that I had busted ass for, I was despondent.

I wasn't failing school, mind you.  I maintained a C- average, and there were aspects of it I excelled at - particularly Anatomy, but I got to thinking about being average at a career I wasn't thrilled with.  I got to thinking about being an average doctor and what that meant.  Would a patient want an average or slightly below-average doctor?  My classmates were all about ""P = MD"". In other words, pass and you get your degree.  

Another smaller factor in contributing to my decision to leave was the MD lifestyle - high divorce rates, high rate of depression, brutal hours, and high liability insurance.  Wait, you thought MD's were all rich?  Yeah not so much for a small town family practitioner. 

After dropping out, I immediately enrolled in a CompSci program.  1.5 years later I had my degree and was writing code.  But now I had a Chemistry degree and lots of medical terminology/concepts to boost my credentials, and I was offered a job from a medical device manufacturer who wanted to send me to grad school.  The $60,000+ in debt was a bitch, but it was just money, and we chipped away at it.

I am infinitely happier now.

TL;DR

**I could not deal with the thought of being a below-average anything, especially a doctor with patients' lives hanging in the balance.  Ultimately that thought and encouragement from my wife brought me to my senses, and I dropped out.**

Bake it for 35 mins, and voila, chicken with a touch of gravy on it.  Very tasty, and will look like you know what you are doing.  I prefer the herb one that has a touch of lemon, not the parmesan one.  Cut up some yellow squash and zuccini, put a stick of butter in a pan, add some garlic, put in the veggies, coat well, stir every 4 mins or so until browned slightly, and there you have it.

seattle_stranger,"I'll probably get downvoted to hell for saying this but for a few years I would cut the UK foreign aid budget.

we are facing massive spending cuts within the country affecting a lot of people, pushing more into needing foid bank and charity aud, but they give billions away each year. I know when in a position to do so it is good to help people in need (I have regular donations set up to 3 charities), but when there are so many people within the country struggling why not be a little selfish and fix our own economy, then once it is back on its feet we can put a more concerted effort into helping others. After all if you personally are in massive debt, but continue to give massive amounts to charity I don't think the bank will be very understanding.

Also make checks more thorough on people claiming benefits, some people admit they choose to live on benefits as a life choice, and many of them are better off than people who work minimum wage jobs. Perhaps use a voucher system instead of cash, so foid vouchers could only be used for food, not going out and getting pissed. At one point I had to claim benefits for 3 months, most depressing and shameful time, I hated doing it, but had no other choice and worked hard to find a job.

I would also like to leave the EU, not strictly budget related, but a large amount of money is sent there so I guess it counts.

It has always been about career training. People who treat college as an opportunity to train for a career have much better success in life than those who don't.

Of course, if you're in a position where school is paid for and you don't have to worry about finding a job after school, then college can be whatever you want it to be.

Twelve days after I graduated from college, I was taking a shower in my childhood home. When I shut off the water, I could hear my Mom's voice on the other side of the wall, speaking softly on the phone. Instantly 60% sure she was cheating on my Dad, hard to explain how. She'd been acting more distant and dressing better lately.

Next day (asshole me) went through her texts on her phone. Saw a guy's name a couple times, but nothing definitive. Up to 75% or so. Two days later went through her email in the middle of the night, which she always left open on our family's shared computer(!). The 100%-sure moment is the one that sticks... I cried, drank myself into a stupor, confronted her then next morning. 

My Dad and brother are 'oblivious' types, but wanting to possibly save them from the pain I was in, I coached her how to cover her tracks better for a few weeks. Still caught her and scolded her multiple times.

She faked her way through marriage counseling until the inevitable divorce a year or so later, two-ish years ago. She was definitely the favorite parent, so life sucked for awhile. Getting back to normal-ish now, she moved to a more tropical locale with her new boyfriend, visited for the first time last week. Life goes on!

Earth_Bug,"For example, last night, I had a dream about my ex who I haven't even seen or talked to in almost 10 years.  It's not the first dream I've had about him often either.  

The dream; I was in a town where everyone that I've ever known lived in.  I owned some sort of business until this Asian guy comes and fires me.  Then I'm sitting at a bar with this girl Cassie when in walks my ex.  Turns out they are dating and have been for a while (in my dream).  My ex and I lock eyes and all of the amazing feelings that I had/have for him came rushing over me.  The rest of my dream was just a bunch of random things where Ryan is with me.  

This dream was pretty mild compared to some of the dreams I've had about him in the past, a lot of sexual dreams, me leaving my husband for him and things like that.  Feeling guilty as fuck!

For the record, I am completely devoted to my husband and have a near-perfect marriage.  In my dreams, I'm always elated to see my ex but when I wake up, I feel really down about things all day.

Puffsdangerfield,"The whole idea of ""Black Friday"" is now a farce. Rarely does anyone save any real money. There is quite a few reasons why:

1. If you have camped out for longer than 24 hours, You have probably spent more money in preparation and expenses than you would have saved in the difference between actual and markdown price. 

2. Quite a number of items sold on Black Friday are cheap versions. Some TVs will be made in a cheaper version just for this special purpose. 

3. If you took any amount of time off to shop on Black Friday, you have lost pay. If you used paid vacation or paid leave, you have still lost, since that is time you earn. 

4. All items sold on Black Friday will be sold at a much smaller price in the off season. Look at the cost of shorts in the fall and coats in the spring. You also have deals like this for electronics in low buying seasons or when the newest models of anything are about to be rolled out. (And everyone knows if it is a gaming console, you are gambling on the quality of product for the first few months of its roll out. Look up the problems with both the XBox One and PS4.  Same thing as the Windows hype back in the 90s.)

5. If you spent money on any object, you didn't save anything. A TV marked down from 200 to 150 didn't save you 50 dollars, you spent 150 dollars. 

There is also other things like the mob mentality that takes over. People are scary in that mode and I avoid it like the plague. Besides, most of that crap is not needed, especially as far as gifts go. It's great if you have the money, but most don't, who the hell needs a waffle maker for Christmas that bad? Most of the time it will get used once or twice and then chucked in that place where kitchen gadgets go to die.

Enderdejorand,"**I've always felt lucky that when I was little, I came to live with my dad.**

My mom didn't have a lot of money, is pretty much an alcoholic, and has been involved with drugs on and off throughout her life. Around my third birthday, her sister came down with cancer, and she went to Florida to take care of her during her final days. My dad didn't believe her sister was sick, and he refused to let her take me. He assumed that if she left with me, he'd never see his son again, so he immediately went to the courts to petition for custody. 

My dad's a lot more stable than my mom. He's always had a job while I was growing up and is relatively well off money-wise. He's always been really willing to help people with his money if he can. For example, when my half-siblings (from my mom's first marriage) went to college, he helped pay a decent amount of their education costs. He's also helped keep my mom afloat so she can have an apartment. 

But he's never really let me feel like I didn't have to work to get a benefit. For instance, in high school I wanted to take art classes on the weekends, to get formal training on top of my school work. For me, it was a pretty big cost: almost $200 for a semester of weekend classes. I had to work really hard on my studies to justify that type of expense, and eventually my dad paid for it. I always felt a little guilty that he would splurge on me like that. But years later, he told me he would have always paid for those classes, because he thought I had talent and he wanted me to embrace my talents. (sort of a don't-hide-your-talents-under-a-basket thing)

I believe I've done relatively well for myself, but I'm always very aware that I could have been raised in a completely different situation. People often talk about the privilege that comes from growing up with money, and I know that if I had grown up with my mom I wouldn't have had the same opportunities. For me, college was expected; for my half-siblings, college was necessary. That's one big difference among many others that let me know that I was really lucky to grow up the way I did. 

Don't get me wrong. My half-siblings are very successful, married, and have their own families now. They have wonderful lives and it worked out for them. But in my mind, it worked out in-spite their circumstances, not because of them.

Catharsis is good for the soul but never at the expense of another.  You obviously know this or you would have spilled the beans long ago.  Unless your admission will benefit your mom it is probably best to talk to someone else first even if you're not looking for their advice.  The reason is is that things will become clearer in your own mind as you verbalize them for the first time.  If your listener is in a position to offer advice then it's so much the better.

It is important to choose the right person to talk to.  You'll want to be sure that your listener can and will keep your matters in confidence.  Members of the clergy will be all to happy to help.  If you do not belong to a religious body then you might seek out a therapist.  You can also approach a complete stranger and ask for a bit of their time. Most people would be honored to help if you explain the importance of your situation.

There are more options for bigger range of audiences.  For those who has childish fun, they can try the mainstream r/funny or r/aww, and they are still pretty damn good. If a person wants to go to ""deep"" conversation reddit, they can go find it. Depthhub still exist, true(philosophy, gaming, etc) exist. Doctor who fans can go to r/doctor who for memes, which represents culture and those who are genuinely  interested in discussion can go to r/gellifry. Discussion especially on a site that is as popular as reddit still exist in large quantities, impressive I might add on how this site isn't sold out yet with this many user base.  

This website is a great one for autodidactics, I want to learn how to draw for example I can go to 10 different communities on here to show and critique my drawing. If I have programming. Questions, there's an entire

I was happy, secure in my warm and cozy world of shitty reposts. 


Then I found 9gag. ""Like, OH EM GEE,"" I could be heard squealing. ""Le 9gags is teh GEM of the internet."" I was a cool kid. But soon I tired of 9gag, and its limited content. I found Reddit.


At first, Reddit was too confusing. All those links, all those things called ""subreddits,"" that weird thing called ""karma."" I shied away from the front page and the defaults. I found comfort in f7u12, the diarrhea of everything reddit has to offer. Yet I loved le rage comics, sympathizing with forever alone guy, asking my mother ""Y U NO cook dinner?"" It was a dark time.


But as I grew more comfortable with Reddit, I crept into the default subs. First r/funny, then r/pics. AskReddit soon became my go-to sub. I even experienced a world beyond default. I saw r/mildly interesting and r/foodporn. It was a love affair, but abusive. I tried to leave Reddit in search of a better future. But Reddit kept calling me back, keeping me up at night, refusing to let me work. A few days ago, Reddit finally held me down and forced me to make an account.

A couple of nights ago I was staying at by best friends house (Let's call him 'Jay') and we had just finished dinner and were going to go watch some southpark. We have to wait for it to load and then all of sudden **WHAM**, the front door had been swung open *hard*. ""JJJJJAAAAAYYY"" was all we heard; It was his dad, a recovered Alcoholic for 15 years, who had just fallen off the wagon. At this time it's probably about 12:45 in the morning. He was so intoxicated and had a massive gash across his left eyebrow and a big bruise above it. Jay's dad decides that this is the perfect time to ""bond with the boys"" which it clearly was not. He sat in Jay's room till 5 in the morning (btw this is a  monday night, we both had classes at 8) telling us OVER AND OVER that we needed to get our ""sheepskin"" and that we were both massive fuck ups. He then proceeded to force Jay to get him his 6 beer at the house and told him he was drinking again. I saw Jay break inside when he said that, and I realized that this is a big moment that I am now apart of. I'm not sure if I shouldn't have been there, but Jay was glad I was.

Bradley is already onto his 5th lot of chemo in which he is coping extremely well with. We have been told that Brad has a long way to go and it's going to be a rough ride but my baby is a fighter so the least I can do is fight it with him no matter how much I'm hurting.

High risk neuroblastoma has up to 80% relapse rate if cured the first time and the UK don't have no relapse treatment, this would mean having to take Brad abroad to pay for treatment therefor any fundraising you can do no matter how little or how big would be appreciated. If Brad doesn't need the money it would then go to someone who does. 

Please help my baby get through this horrible disease xx




This is copied from his appeal website. He is a local boy who was diognosed in january this year. He is now on his 6th lot of chemo.

He has only just been taken off his ventorlater and tonight he has be allowed back to his normal ward. He is awake and eating icepops while watching santa films.

It wouldn't have much of an impact on Earth's gravitational pull...that tonnage is only a tiny fraction of the Earth's mass (a ratio of 2*10^-14). It would change weather patterns significantly, because it would affect the amount of light reflected and absorbed, as well as the surface friction of the earth in those regions, which would change wind patterns. There would be more surface area of the ocean to absorb light, so they would probably warm some. 

Supply chains would immediately evaporate along with those people. Many natural resources would suddenly be much rarer. It would change the nature of geopolitics, and new alliances and aggressions would form. Entire economic systems, reliant on the products exported by those countries, and services provided by them, would fail. Many, many people would die in the aftermath, of starvation, in riots, or through the wars that would almost certainly break out.

I switched seats in the middle of class to sit right next to her. I think we were reading the assigned pages from out textbooks that day. I forgot my book at home so I she let read from hers so we connected the desks side by side. Were reading on our own quietly, and I really don't know how it happened, but I guess I breathed out a bit too heavy from my nose and this colossal chunk of snot came careening smack dab in the middle of the page. 

We didn't even look at each other for the first couple of seconds; we were just staring at the new found specimen. It was green with a yellowish tint/hue, still moist and glistening. I think my brain blanked out since then because the memory of it was so painfully embarrassing, so I think we just awkwardly laughed it off and I don't remember what became of the snot afterwards. I must have I wiped it off, or maybe its the adhesive to two adjacent pages of a history book somewhere out there in the world.

We will never know...

Amadeus3698,"To preempt some criticism (which I welcome; my goal is to foster discussion) I will state that I am American and have been since birth and my family has a long history in the US.  This discussion was prompted by discussions last night with my family.  My discussion here will focus on the US however, but I am sure people from other countries will agree that things are similar in their own countries.  I encourage people to add to what I have or rebut my points.  After all, I can be wrong too, but please keep it civil.  You can still disagree without being profane or attacking me personally. 

The things that I think need improvement in the US:

1.	A culture of consumerism – one of the huge reasons why businesses have grown so large and influential is that we have let them do so.  One example is the existence of “Black Friday” and its encroachment into Thanksgiving.  Every year people rush to stores to save a few hundred dollars on Christmas gifts; I find the idea of fighting someone for the bare-bones model of a plasma TV and waiting in line for an hour to buy it to be asinine.  No one needs something that badly and all the deaths and serious injuries each year are senseless.  I feel sorry for the unfortunate souls that have to work these stores over night and deal with insane customers the next day instead of enjoying the company of their families for Thanksgiving.
2.	Failure to perform one’s civic duty – the social contract that all Americans have with their government is that the power of the government is derived from them not the other way around.  A government that does not serve its people is not a legitimate government.  Many Americans fail to stay informed about what is going on.  I am not saying that you need to follow all the happenings of the world but you should know what your local and state governments are doing in a general sense.  Also, investigating candidates before voting for them and not just voting along party lines is also your duty
3.	Lack of accountability and oversight of government – do you know who your state and federal representatives are in your state’s legislature and in Congress?  Do you know what this person does/did before becoming a politician?  Probably not.  A majority of politician are probably “good” in that that they aren’t embezzling or conveniently awarding contracts to a relative’s company or their own, but this happens sometimes.  A politician can construct the law so that they and/or their family comes out on top.  It’s hard to do anything after the fact because it’s “legal”.  The recent fiasco of the healthcare law should be lesson that someone needs to be watching and guiding this process.
4.	Lobbying – this the most deleterious and the result of the previous three points.  They are inherently self-interested.  Groups like the NRA, AARP, Cassidy and Associates, and many other have undue influence over governmental affairs.  Lobbying has its place, but its power has grown unchecked and much of what goes on is obscured so that the laity cannot understand what is going on.  People should be allowed to form groups to request their representatives help with an issue, but the representative should not be pressured because those groups might not support them in the next election or actively undermine them later.
5.	Elections/gerrymandering – in this technologically advanced country, elections should all be by popular vote; the Electoral College is archaic and is no longer needed.  In this way the person who is truly favored by the people is the one in office and not the one who’s good a playing the system.  The same is true for gerrymandering; carving out safe districts so that the same people continually get elected leads to stagnation in the government.  Campaign finance needs to be reformed.  There is no need to spend tens of millions of dollars on a campaign; election campaigns should be funded from taxes and private donations should be banned.  The defense that contributing to elections is freedom of speech is weak; your First Amendment rights end where someone else’s begins and downing out other voices because you can write a bigger check is not respecting other’s rights.
6.	Blindly following – just because your pastor, parent, church, political party, news channel, or other “authority” says something does not make it true.  You must think for yourself and not let others tell you how to vote.  It is your right and no one else’s; any arguments to the contrary are inherently false.  I have had friends in college tell me she votes in line with her parents because they support her financially and her father knows which candidate is best so that he won’t hurt financially.  This again shows lack of civic duty on her part; she should investigate for herself.  In the end, she may decide to vote the same way her parents do, but at least she decided to do it.  Another good example is the war in Iraq.  At its beginning, if you did not support the war, you were viewed as un-American.  The Dixie Chicks are a good illustration of how an essentially brainwashed fan base ended their music career (granted the girls should have known, but still).  I doubt many of the people that hated them knew anything about what was going on in Iraq and to this day still probably don’t understand what went on.
7.	Lack of foresight – years of borrowing has left the federal government in disarray and threatens to destabilize the economy.  Never should the government been allowed to borrow so much money.  Government services should be paid for through taxes; if you don’t want more taxes then you get fewer services.  Borrowing money to pay for these is poor financial planning on the part of politicians; they should not be advocating for plans that they then don’t want to fund by increasing taxes.  As a nation, we must choose, lots of services and higher taxes or fewer services and lower taxes; the balance must be found.
8.	Being distracted by hot button issues – gay marriage, abortion, entitlement programs, and others are all important topics that need to be settled, but for any of them to be the constant focus of discussion or a deciding factor in who you vote for is foolish.  “The gays” aren’t going to destroy America by getting married.
9.	Policing the world – it is not the job of the US to fix every problem in the world and we should stop trying to because it is bankrupting the nation.  That is not to say that I don’t care about the people of Syria, Libya, Haiti, or whatever other country seems to be on the brink of collapse, but we should be encouraging the UN and other nations to facilitate this.
10.	Arm-twisting – no other country exerts as must influence unilaterally as the US.  Economics is how the US manipulates weaker countries into forming partnerships that are mostly in favor of US business.  Also, subversive actions by American intelligence has played a large part.  Go to Wikipedia and look at the numerous things that the CIA has done in Latin America.  The people of these countries know this and American arm-twisting is a major reason for a lot of disdain abroad.

TeapotYo,"This is less about game mechanics or specifics across games, but more how games helped my reaction time, problem solving, and awareness improve.

As a kid I had started off with what seemed like difficult games to me. Wolfenstein had no saves. E.T on Atari was just so terrible that it was hard, and then I was exposed to the side scrolling games of Super NES such as Earthworm Jim, Donkey Kong, and the various Marios.

Those early games had taught me that it wasn't all about finishing as fast as you can, but trying to beat games 100%. There were so many hidden areas or secrets within those games it was nuts. I'd go too far without seeing a secret and have to back track, or I'd just see a suspicious looking ""mound"" in Donkey Kong and I just knew a barrel would open it.

So you pick up on patterns like that, but I think the peak of my awareness and decision making care throughout the years of Halo 2. I've played other FPS at the time but this one put such an emphasis on team shooting. The level of awareness required was high and there were just so many variables. Even if it seemed like a blatantly obvious easy kill, it wouldn't always be best to finish that player of chase him.

perringoldeye,"I used to, and still do love Age of Empires II. I used to spend hours upon hours playing that game, and I was always drawn to the Mongol race. Anyway, as many of you may know, the game had a page that outlined the history/technology of the race. I became very familiar with the Mongol civilization due to this brief page.  I also learned a lot about their civs like the Japanese and Chinese. 


Fast forward to graduating year in highschool. I took an AP History course that was called ""West and the World"". The course as taught by my teacher was strictly focused on European interactions with North America. No eastern relations whatsoever were covered. Anyway, I sign up for the AP exam which would count for a University credit. The day of the exam comes along (keep in mind they charge you to take these exams, and you just score level 4 or 5 to gain the credit). 


The exam procedure starts and I open the booklet. The first thing that caught my attention was the title, AP ""World History"". Not West and the World. I initially thought I was fucked.However, due to my vast knowledge of Age of Empires, I found myself being able to answer more and more questions. Then came the final part. An essay worth the majority of the exam. The prompt? ""Discuss the progression of Mongol civilization, by examining their culture and conquests"". Motherfuckers. Finally my time had come. I bullshit the most spectacular essay of all time. Thanks entirely to Age of Empires II, and I ended up getting a level 4 and earning the credit.

rhythmforest,"**I believe quite a bit of it has to do with ego.**

They want to soften the situation or avoid the discomfort because it's not just an uncomfortable situation - it's also a miniature pandora's box of self-doubt and questioning for some people. 

If someone knows and has to own up to being responsible for something negative, they may have to face the fact that they don't always have all of the answers. They may smart to question whether or not they are smart, brave, responsible, etc.

It's natural to want to protect your self-esteem.

As for facing a situation - again discomfort. We are creatures of comfort and habit. We enjoy happiness and positive sensations. Just as the majority of people have an aversion to physical pain and will go great lengths to avoid it, some people have aversions to social pain and avoid situations that they may see as potentially painful. (Situations involving rejection and/or the questioning of their abilities, decisions, etc. and therefore who they are as a person.)

Of course, often if people would just face the situation or answer the question concisely, they would probably suffer less, but they don't consider the consequences in the future.

studio595,"**Alabama**: Like many southern states, a warm southern Mother figure with a dark, dark past.

**Alaska**: Little bit of Canadian in their blood, so there's some kindness but like the state itself--cold. 

**Arizona**: Not quite California, Not quite Nevada, Not quite Texas. Serious parent issues.

**Arkansas**: Oklahoma's twin that doesn't get enough attention so has to act up with its ""tornados."" (Not trying to downplay tornados, that shit is serious and I don't mean to offend). 

**California**: Superiority complex with a little bit of valley girl thrown in their for good measure. 

**Colorado**: Stoners. 

**Connecticut**: as /u/pspencer1841 stated, ""Connecticut would be very starkly bipolar.""

**Delaware**: Surrounded by two very foul places--New Jersey and Philadelphia. Asking for more attention. Please, please help.

**Florida**: America's penis. Has major trauma because of this. Recluse, but has a rough streak. 

**Georgia**: Another kind southern bell, but also with a dark past. A peachy exterior with a pit of pure evil (heh). 

**Hawaii**: Everyone loves Hawaii, and it knows it. Can be a real jerk because of it.

**Idaho**: Potato Potato Potato pot--cold as fuck. But a really nice guy once you get to know him.

**Illinois**: This dude is just full of wind.

**Indiana**: I could give 500 reasons why he's a pretty cool guy, but you just can't get over his steely gaze. 

**Iowa**: French? So by proxy, an asshole.

**Kansas**: Oklahoma's hat. A really kind soul. 

**Kentucky**: I mean come on, its shaped like a piece of fried chicken. So you know this girl has bound to be a motherly figure. 

**Louisiana**: And again, a southern bell with a dark past. Also she was dating some French guy for awhile there. She was pretty bitchy during that time...

**Maine**: Lawbstah. A wise seaman. 

**Maryland**: A small, old state, that just wants to be loved and for its kids to call it once in awhile.

**Massachusetts**: Another kind soul, but has a pronunciation problem.

**Missouri**: A miserable, miserable fellow. 

**Montana**: Sort of spread out all over the place. 

**Nebraska**: Who cares about Nebraska, there's like 4 people living there. 

**Nevada**: The fun dad state. He lets you stay up all night and have fun. But wont care about you in the morning. 

**New Hampshire**: Vermont's exact doppelganger. 

**New Jersey**: Faggedaboutit. This dude will rough you up.

**New Mexico**: Quiet, but if you piss them off, they'll go all Heisenberg on your ass.

**New York**: California's nemesis. Sort of a major asshole, but can be kind at times. 

**North Carolina**: Home of Steven Colbert. Automatically the coolest kid in town. 

**North Dakota**: Basically Canada. So a pretty nice guy.

**Ohio**: A sandwich of Indiana and Pennsylvania. It wants you to call more often as well. 

**Oklahoma**: OOOOOOOOKLLLLLLAAAAAAA-dusty dusty dusty. 

**Oregon**: Trying to be as cool as California, but as refined as Washington. But its got Portland going for it, which is good. 

**Pennsylvania**: Generally a nice guy, but soured because of Pittsburgh. 

**Rhode Island**: So much populous for so little land. A nice guy, but can be pretty rude during the fall seasons. 

**South Carolina**: Another southern bell that just wants to feed you.

**South Dakota**: Like North Dakota, also pretty much Canada. A nice guy at times, but pretty airy. 

**Tennessee**: A loud and proud singer, with a streak of violence. 

**Texas**: Big man on campus. Kind and warm, but piss him off, and there will be hell to pay.

**Utah**: Its over-abundant kindness is a ploy. Its hiding something. Beware.

**Vermont**: New Hampshire's exact Doppelganger. 

**Virginia**: The oldest, and wisest. But evil lurks. 

**Washington**: Refined, but is a real prick in the morning. 

**West Virginia**: Another sandwich that wants to be a big boy state like Virginia. 

**Wisconsin**: Again, basically Canada. But the nicest fellow you will ever meet.

Be prepared for an emotional rollercoaster.  Not all divorces are bitter struggles, but don't rule by exception.  You may lose friends.  You may lose family.  You may lose material things that are important to you.  You may lose money - a lot of money - depending on your situation.   

I guess what it really comes down to is making sure that you'll look at your divorce without regret.

At some point in our lives, related to out marriages or not, we all have to realize that we cannot control other people. We cannot make people do something we want them to, regardless. Giving up that desperate struggle for power and control is the first day of the rest of your life. It will positively influence every interpersonal relationship from then on.

And regarding a suicidal SO, when I left, I called my dad to come help me leave and I called his brother to come and stay with him after I left. He downed a ton of pills anyways but it just made him sick. We both realized that night we couldn't control each other anymore. I couldn't keep him from trying and he couldn't keep me emotionally trapped in the relationship. We both married other people and he seems to be happy now. I am too- i learned so much about myself.

Now, motorcyclists usually make this out to be some sort of super-achievement, but honestly, 1000 miles in a day isn't a big deal at all.

Anyway, I left at 4am, things were going great.  I'm on my Honda VFR with aftermarket padded seat, full custom leather suit.  Enjoyed seeing the sun rise when i was passing Neveda.

By the time I got to Utah, it got real cold.  Pulled over, and rest for a bit.  Have some breakfast... which attributed to the ""worst"" part of the story.

This is the first time I eat on the first part.  Unfortunately, I didn't count on suffering food coma... worst yet, food coma while going at 80mph on the interstate isn't good.  

By the time I got closer to colorado, I was dozing off on the motorcycle.  I am now an hour west of Grand Junction, Colorado.  I realize I am not gonna be able to make to Denver today.  I will get a hotel room in Grand Junction, it's on the way, and only an hour away.  Or, I can go out of my way and get a room in Moab Ut.

I booked it for Grand Junction.

I was now riding half dozing off, half awake.

By the time i open my eyes, i was already in the center divider of highway 70.  Speedo says 75MPH.  There's dirt and dried brush ahead.  I let go of the throttle (hitting the brake while at speed, in loose dirt is a bad idea) but the bushes came up faster than expected and there's no way I can dodge it.  

Front wheel of the bike hit the bush, twists the handle bar immediately, and I flew off the bike.  I did a few flips before hitting the ground, and a few more flips after hitting the ground.  

At this point, i was afraid the bike was going to catch up with me.  Thankfully, it stopped about 10 feet behind me.

now the good part:

The traffic stopped, and many people got out of their vehicles to help.  I couldn't move, so they held up a blank over me to shield me from the sun.  It was just after lunch time, so the sun is pretty brutal.

Ambulance came, and took me to the hospital.

Amazingly, after an accident like that all i had was a sprang ankle.

While contemplating what to do next, one of the drivers who stopped to help at the accident showed up.  He offered me the spare bedroom at him and his wife's house, and I took him up on it.  Seeing that it's already late in the afternoon, and i have no transportation (bike was towed away, it will start, but unrideable).  He let me stayed overnight at his place, and drove me to pick up my motorcycle at the tow yard (he had a truck and trailer).  Some times, strangers will do good things for travelers, no string attached.

Called a buddy of mine after picking up the bike and he drove up from so cal to pick up me and the bike.








If there ever was a ""priceless"" commercial, this would be it:  

* $3000 custom leather suit
* $400 helmet
* $300 leather gloves
* $400 boots

walking away from a motorcycle going 75mph to 0 mph in 2 seconds... priceless.

 Personally, and this is just me, but the entire winter holiday thing is supposed to be about togetherness, appreciating what you have, and helping others. The only of those three main tenets that is touched upon in this Black Friday garbage is togetherness, and even then only in the sense of ""TOGETHER WE CAN DEMOLISH THIS BARRICADE AND GET TO THE TASTY DEALS WITHIN"" And you better believe that as soon as that barricade raises or comes down, all semblance of cohesion is lost as everyone starts running around, grabbing, shoving, and fighting like fucking retards. 

What it comes down to is that this behavior speaks ill of Americans as a whole. A casual observer may believe that we are incapable of acting in a manner resembling civility. Having worked in 3 different types of store over the course of 5 holiday seasons, I am inclined to agree. You always roll the dice with customer interaction, it comes with the territory. But in my experience, Black Friday dice are weighted to roll snake eyes. The ability to get a TV at half price or what have you seems to bring out the worst in people. Not just in their wanton destruction of whatever retail environment they may currently inhabit, but their treatment of other people as well. I'd never heard someone actually call a person a cunt with intent to insult until Black Friday. (Granted, I swear like a sailor, and jokingly throw that word around like it's ""and"" but here you will find that it is the baddest of words, for some reason.) I have seen groups of people break out swinging when told we are out of stock on a high demand item. Stealing shit out of other peoples carts. No civilized person should be acting this way.

Granted, not everyone acts this way, even among those who are habitual Black Friday shoppers. I met quite a lot who were just out, didn't like the packed stores or long lines but couldn't afford high price gifts if they didn't get them at a Black Friday sale, and really wanted to get them. These folks were more often than not courteous and understanding, and the ones that weren't didn't force it too terribly. These folks are exempt from my rant. They may go and do whatever they must today with no ill will from me. 

There's a lot more to my hatred of Black Friday than listed above, but those are the main points. It's not all bad as an idea, but(**TL;DR**) it attracts all the wrong kinds of people and causes them to behave in a way that I find fucking reprehensible. ",null,0,cdpshrq,1rq6vq,AskReddit,new,1

forever_a-hole,"So, my friends and I like to play a game called ""Spider"". This is oddly fitting for the thread. 

Anyway, this game is basically Marco Pollo meets tag on an enormous playground play set. The tagger has to keep their eyes closed while on the set, but once off can open them. If the tagger is on the set and hear someone that they think is off of the set, they yell spider. Same concept as fish out of water in Marco Pollo. 

So, I'm it. Friends are staying away from the sides because I'm a quick and crafty mother fucker. 

I hop on and start running with my eyes closed across the set. They scatter, obviously. I know this play set very well, as I'm one of the few veterans of the game that hasn't graduated college and moved yet. 

I get to the end, and hear someone trying to be quiet on one of the ladder type things. So, I dash towards them and miss. But I hear them jump and land on the slide that's about 6 feet away. 


Keep in mind that my eyes are shut this entire time. 

I let completely loose and jump hoping to make it to the slide. 
I end up basically tackling one of the guys playing and he falls down the slide. I had landed perfectly in front of him as he was trying to get to the top of the slide and was holding on to the top of the slide. He ran face first into my ass.

aught-o-mat,"When I was 13, I sucker punched an 'annoying' kid at a Boy Scout meeting. Right in the guts. I couldn't tell you why, exactly. It remains the only time I've ever struck someone with harmful intent. 

And I hit harder than I meant to.  He doubled over and collapsed onto the gymnasium floor. Before I'd time for regret, I was afraid. I thought I'd caused serious injury. He was screaming. 

One of the scout leaders came over. I assumed I was in trouble, but his anger was for the boy on the floor. ""Come on! Get up! Don't just take it!"" It was his father. 

I don't think he was encouraging a fight, he just wanted us to quit the scuffling. What he didn't grasp was that I'd just gut punched his son and knocked the wind out of him for *no apparent reason*. 

In the end, he was fine. It was just cruel, inexplicable, kid stuff. But it's that kid stuff that can be formative. It sticks with you. And this certainly stuck with me. 

20 years on, I saw him at a community picnic while visiting my parents. Now a volunteer with the scouts, he was in uniform and working with kids. It was a perfect time to offer a long overdue apology. 

I sought him out, but somehow lost him. I asked everyone - including his father - if he was still around, but wasn't able to connect. I wanted to tell him that I'm sorry for, and still regret what I did then. And that whenever the ""what's the worst thing"" trope comes up in conversation (or on Reddit) I think of him.

Or is it more like the United Nations, where I would be the central figure over different heads of states (Only with some sort of power over the other nations)?  If the world is unified, does that mean internal conflicts between all countries have ended?  Is there a centralized military, or is that up to me to dismantle previous national militias and create a (scaled down) World Police force?  

Regardless of those issues:
Generate incentive based funding for Energy, Science (Including Space exploration), Transportation, Environmental remediation, Medical exploration, and Global nutrition/Clean water.  (Similar to the Gates Foundation model)

Begin cultural campaign to diminish importance of collecting material wealth while promoting the benefits and status of people who help their neighbors.
Aaaaand...since all countries are all unified, the now unified world bank means tax havens and loopholes are much easier to close.  

Massive reforms to copyright legislation.

Education reform, in that standardized curriculum is pared way down.  Teachers and Professors are in charge of determining their curriculum, best teaching methods for their classes.  Curriculum is encouraged to teach practical life skills expanded to encourage appreciation of nature and manual labor (home-ec, Shop, gardening, basic animal husbandry).  

Drug reform.  Legalized, quality controlled, heavily taxed, provide safe places to use and dispose.  Black market sales of tainted quality risk life in prison or execution.

Correctional institute reform.  It needs to reform prisoners.  Teach useful life skills.  After following a curriculum of basic life skills the capstone to their learning, is to develop a life plan for once they leave the prison.  Allow them to work while incarcerated (auto repair, farming, computer programming, etc) and apply that money toward their life-plan, such that they can more easily transition between release and regular life.

Healthcare.  Eeeeesh, what a cluster.  Unhealthy lifestyle choices are taxed heavier (cigarettes, alcohol, junk food, sugars / desserts).  Procedures for people unwilling to make lifestyle changes will have their treatment priorities diminished and/or their co-pay will be increased.     

Tax Reform.  Taxes are flat, and based on consumption, not earnings.  Luxury items and items that require more natural resources are taxed heavier.

Prostitution is legalized.  Men/Women must be of consenting age, tested every few weeks.  Taxation offsets clinical costs of test/treatment.  Pimps for underage children are given life sentences or executed.  

Zero tolerance for religions that preach or practice violence.  Anyone who kills others for religious reasons will be executed and have their remains publicly desecrated, according to their religion (pigs blood, excommunication, whatever).

Pleecu,"Anyone with natural dreads that has even a bit of self respect washes them with soap and water just like everyone else. We don't roll around in mud or  put weird shit on our head so it's just hair (most people don't anyway.) Since it's essentially long tangled mats of hair, you run soapy water through them and squeeze them out and they rinse clean, like once a week or so. I don't understand why everyone assumes they're dirty, some are but like i said any self respecting person with dreads takes care of them, even going through great lengths to do so (special oils, shampoos, and other junk)

On the flip side some people who are impatient or ignorant to natural dreads will put dread wax in their hair to achieve the look with uniformity in size and shape. this method is fast and somewhat reversible, but the wax will cause the dreads to pick up dirt and other gross stuff over time and holds water, causing mildew. If you see gross looking dreads they're probably these type, which do not clean easily and in fact attract grossness.

tl;dr: Natural dreads can be washed weekly quite easily and are usually clean. Waxed dreads (cheater dreads) on the other hand don't clean easily and attract dust and dirt and other crud. They also need a TON of maintainence.",null,0,cdpw2me,1rq5v3,AskReddit,new,1

lumpy_potato,"My SO is Christian. I was raised a Hindu, but tend to be less religious/spiritual about it.

It can be tough when our beliefs clash, but the most important thing is to be mutually supportive - my SO understands that I have my beliefs, and respects them. I do the same for my SO - this is important in a relationship with differing religious beliefs (or lack thereof).

This is a struggle for some people, because their interpretation of religion is such where they might feel that their spouse/partner's lack or differences in religious belief might actually be a burden on their own relationship with God/Religion - this is kind of a dangerous thing, because it can sometimes become 'my spouse/partner is coming between me and God.'

You need to have a long talk, and really discuss what is important - make it clear you respect her beliefs (I assume you do), but you want to be able to believe what you feel is right. Remind her that we all have to walk our own paths, and that you feel (I assume) that as long as you live a good and moral life, you are doing the right thing (overall).

There will be many conversations to be had if you are serious about your GF - how to raise kids, dealing with church, etc. I know at least a few couples other than my SO and I who are different in terms of religious upbringing, and it *can* work - but both sides need to be open to compromise. I've seen a Christian participating in a Hindu wedding, and a Hindu participating in a Christian wedding - it *can* be done, but it really depends on how that other person perceives things.

This shouldn't be a fight to convince her that you are right or wrong - just a conversation on how to find a middle ground where you can both live your lives according to your own moral grounds without too much conflict (people are different, conflict is inevitable, good relationships are based on finding mutually beneficial solutions to them)",null,0,cdpq25h,1rq5sg,AskReddit,new,4

blueit11,"This is tough. I think this is serious deal breaker territory for many people. Sounds like she wishes you shared her beliefs, and I think that's a warning sign frankly. I mean, if it's a focul point in her life for instance if she likes to be surrounded by religion, the church she's in, etc. it may be hard to share a life if you aren't a part of that. I think when kids enter the equation it's a big challenge as well. 

I am in the same boat, I am a non believer and my gf and her family are religious. It works because she doesn't push any of it on me, and frankly I don't have a problem with religion as long is it doesn't hurt anyone, or it's forced on me. 

I asked her in the beginning how important it was, and she said it wasn't important I be religious if I respected she had these beliefs. 1.5 years later, its not been an issue at all. I respect when her family says grace at dinners, or if she says something religious I don't tease her. 

So I think we'll work, I think you just need to have this talk. Be honest with each other and very realistic about what you expect, becasue I've all seen this break up relationships. People often make the mistake of trying to change each other in relationships.

H00ded,"I was on a holiday with my best mate. We couldn't get anyone else to come along so it was pretty gay. We were on an island full of couples and newlyweds and their families etc. No single women around for miles. Two blokes drinking sex on the beach's and swimming and hiking and playing mini golf. 

2006-7 facebook was fairly new to most of us and my friend happened to have a lot of family as his friends. I posted some pretty light status update as him saying ""I'm glad I came here, to come out, no need to hide it anymore, free at last!"" and left it at that. 

He comes back from getting more drinks and we play some pool and hang out. Head back to the hotel room to watch a movie or drink and smoke more or listen to music, a few hours pass.

Then his mum calls him and asks him if he's gay. With me. 

He'll never live that down. His mum wasn't on Facebook, his sister had seen it, called his mum, she freaked out and called him. Absolute gold. The look on his face when she asked, and then he turned to me and I just about shat my pants. ",null,0,cdpq1oa,1rq5o0,AskReddit,new,1

Over the course of several months I would squirt a moderate amount of transmission fluid under the truck at night; I did this 2-4 times a week.  He took it to the dealership and several other shops but of course they could find nothing wrong.  I guess the dealership told him there was nothing they could do since nothing appeared to be wrong.  He eventually got so frustrated that he traded it for something else.  It was exceptionally hard not to laugh when he told me how much money he lost in the deal.

aught-o-mat,"A friend in college was a pharmacy major. While learning how to make compounds and capsules, he'd often bring materials back to the dorm with him. 

Once, he showed me a powdered dye chemists use to mark specimens on a slide. When mixed with water, it looked an awful lot like blood. It got me to thinking...

I asked him to fill the largest gelatin capsule he could find with the stuff. Sensing we were on the verge of prank greatness, he readily agreed. 

Next day, he produced the goods. I explain that we're going to embed the capsule in one of dorm shower heads, specifically the shower in the corner with the best pressure - the one *everyone* used if it was available. Why? Because one of our pals was in the habit of hitting the gym every night, and would always be alone in the shower by himself when he returned. 

So, after his workout, this guy toddles off in his flip-flops with his shower caddy. The rest of us gather in the hallway waiting to see how it'll all unfold. We hear him turn the shower on, but it sounds strange and sputtering. ""I bet he's looking right at the shower head!"" I exclaim. 

There was a rush of water as the capsule broke, followed by terrified screams and the laughter that comes with a good prank. He came out *covered* in dye. As though he'd stood beneath an animal being slaughtered. 

He laughed it off, but then got serious. ""You guys, I think we have a problem though.""

We all went into the shower room and found that the capsule had exploded magnificently. It was't localized to the corner, there was fake blood everywhere. Like something out of ""Natural Born Killers"".

ThatsSoDorian,"I was a cook at a Sonic Drive-In in small town Iowa. I mean, I hated it, but there were also some fun stories that I took away from it. 

1) There was a guy--Luke--who was a redneck slacker. You'd ask him to do something, he would make you explain it six times until you get up and did it yourself then later brag about how he got out of work. I hated working with him, and so did everyone else. 

Fall rolls around and school was starting again. We were open until 11. Despite being 16 at the time, I was closing 4 or 5 nights a week. I liked the money, but pulling 37 hour weeks while in high school and living at home is a tad extreme. What made it infuriating to me was that they never announced the closers. Managers just told cooks to go home at random intervals until there were two left. It was like a gameshow from hell. But somehow, it was always me and Luke and Luke always got out of it saying he had a big test tomorrow or he'd close next time. It was bullshit that I had to close until midnight four days a week because he had other things to do. One night, the manager told him at the start of the shift ""Luke, you're closing tonight. Thatssodorian has closed for the last three."" His response: ""I can't. My mom won't let me close."" Spat ensues with the manager, and she lets him go around 9:30 under the stipulation that his mother calls and explains to her why her son can't close. 

Once he leaves, about 20 minutes goes by, and the phone rings. Manager answers, a few ""uh-huh""s later, the conversation ends. ""That was Luke's mom."" pause ""There was no way that girl was over 16."" So she got out Luke's application, and called his home number to speak to his real mom. She made no such rule. In fact, he doesn't come home until 1 am claiming that he was closing every night. So yeah, I closed that night (for the 4th time in a row), but I closed with a plainly visible justice boner. 

2) I had a coworker quit by changing his voicemail to ""Fuck you. I quit."" and not coming into work.

3) One of the cooks, we'll call him Jeff, was a self-described fuck up. Military background but left after a tour (I think--he was vague on the details), currently working as a cook, dreamed of opening a car stereo shop in my town. Nice guy, if a little coarse. 

When I worked with him, he'd always say things like ""Yeah, I'm good at this because I've been doing it so long. I don't like it, but I'm okay with it. Every now and again, we hire kids and they're really fucking smart, you know. If I can scare one of those smart kids to doing something better with their life, like my life as an example, like you don't want to end up like me, man. Like, thatssodorian, you're pretty fuckin' smart, you know. There's nothing glamorous or rewarding about this job, and you gotta go do something better when you grow up.""

This story has a little less of a plot, I guess. I just still remember Jeff, and his ""Don't fuck up your life like I did"" speeches. I don't know if he ever opened a shop. I occasionally Google his name and find nothing. I doubt he'd even remember me. But as a 16 year old kid in Iowa, I remember him pretty vividly.

Something I am doing this year is definitely my research. Depending on what you are looking to buy, I would check online for prices first.

You can always check craigslist too... sometimes I've found brand new things on there for cheap.

Also, homemade gifts are great! I'll probably be baking a lot this year. It's slightly embarrassing that I can't afford to buy the gifts I really want, but the thought it was matters (yes it's cliche, but it's the truth!).

You know, if I had three wishes that I could make this holiday season, first, of course, would be for all the children to get together and sing.. the second would be for the $30 million every month to me.. and the third would be for all encompassing power over every living being thing in the entire universe.

And if I had four wishes that I could make this holiday season, first would be the crap about the kids.. second would be for the $30 million.. the third would be for all the power.. and the fourth would be to set aside one month each year for an extended 31-day orgasm, to be brought about slowly by Rosanna Arquette and that model Paulina somebody, I can't think of her name, of course my lovely wife could come, too. She's behind me 100% on this, I guarantee you.

Wait a minute, maybe that sex thing should be the first wish! So, if I made that the first wish, because, you know, it could all go boom tomorrow, and then what have you got? No, no.. the kids singing would be great, that would be nice. No, no, who am I kidding! I mean, theyu're not gonna be able to get all those kids together!

DrNicolasCage,"Background:
I was in 8th grade taking a wood working class as one of my electives. I was using a band saw to cut out a rough shape for a bread knife handle and someone called my name from across the room. Now instead of pulling away like a logical person I just turned my head and kept pushing that wood into the saw, anyway I ended up sawing straight into my right ring finger up to the second knuckle. I didn't cut it off I just kind of split it into two longways I guess it the best way to describe it. 

Response:
Well I felt a quick jolt of pain and jerked my hand back, I looked at it held it up to my face and my forearm was immediately covered in blood. At this point I couldn't feel any pain so I walked over to my friend and asked ""Hey man you got a bandaid haha?"". He looked, saw my bloodied arm and freaked out and got the teacher. I had to run it under cold water for a few minutes then pressure was applied until I got to the hospital. I don't remember any pain until after I was out of the ER but it was just a slow throbbing kind of pain. I also started shaking uncontrollably, felt like I had a stomach ache and tuned ""pale as a ghost"" to quote my mother. On the plus side I didn't have to write my french final because I couldn't hold a pen.

TLDR: Saw cuts finger, no initial pain laugh it off but pain, sickness etc. later. ",null,0,cdppwq9,1rq48t,AskReddit,new,1

Lisaland,"I broke up with my boyfriend of nine months after his girlfriend informed me she had been with him the last three years, and they were still together.  Swore to me he wouldn't see her.  Showed up unannounced and she was there, on the couch, next to him.  Broke up again.  Refused to talk to him.  Over the course of the next six weeks, he broke into my house, poured water down the back of my 52"" plasma tv, stole items of emotional value, stalked me, keyed my car that I had bought six months ago and reported to my boss I was selling drugs out of her office.  (Not true). Endless texts and phone messages at all hours.  Finally got a Stalking Protective Order when he left a voicemail message that said ""I'm going to kill you bitch"". 

He spent 30 days in jail and got out after pleading to a class A Felony.   No previous felonies or jail time.

Left me alone for four months.  Then texts and messages started arriving from unknown and blocked numbers.  Begging me to meet him so he could say he was sorry and return my stuff.  Three weeks of this.  In retrospect I should have reported him for violating SPO, which carries a mandatory minimum.  But I didn't.  Foolishly enough, I met him with the hope of getting my stuff back and that he would then leave me alone.

Ended up dating him again for about three weeks, then realized he was still the same pathetic loser I could never be happy with.  When he showed up to take me out last Saturday night as prearranged, I just couldn't do it.  I just didn't want to be with him.  Not even for dancing and drinking.  He hung out two hours hours while I did other stuff, and finally said he was going hone, he was tired.  Great.  Finally.  I then left for some pool at my favorite bar.

Ran into, what I thought was, his ex.  Nope.  We started talking and sharing texts and pics only to discover he had never broken up with her!  He literally was either with her or me, leaving my house for hers and vice versa!  While chatting she receives a text from him inviting her over for movies.  I said of course he did, I cancelled on him!  We decide to set him up.  She replies she'll be right there.  Then I text him saying I changed my mind and decided to come over.  He then texts her and says something came up, gotta cancel.

We arrive at his home arm in arm, a united front, both deciding neither of us want to be with the lying, cheating, idiot.  We also commit to supporting each other as friends.  

While all three of us are standing there, and she is civilly laying it out, I start looking around and thinking about all he hurt I've allowed him to cause me, and I started loosing it.  I did something I've never done before.  In an act of pure freedom, hurt, anger, and self loathing, I threw my arm out in a wide sweep, taking out a lamp, tv, and Bose speaker system, that all crashed to he ground, complete with the sound of breaking glass.  He threw me on the ground.  He pinned me.  We exchanged punches.  He is screaming at his adult niece, who lives with me to call he cops.  His ex and niece are screaming back that if she does he will go to jail because of the SPO.   They repeatedly order him to let me go. I manage a few feet every so often towards the front door until he rep ins me.  Finally I break free and we are out of there!

So me and his other girlfriend go to my place and stay up talking until 4 am.  Real life plot twist:  she's been MARRIED for the last ten years!

Sunday afternoon the sheriffs office calls.  Apparently he demanded we both be arrested and jailed for assault, burglary, and that I pay restitution!  We talked a very long time, and he also called the other chic he was seeing, that I was with.

Monday morning he was arrested on SPO violation, and he remains in jail.  The cop I spoke to sounded more than amused when I shared my part of the event, and assured me none of the females involved were going to jail.

I am 51, in fact, all three of us are.  I own my own home and have worked in the lea gal field for over 30 years.  I'm a Notary Public for Gods sakes!

This was my first relationship in 8 years.  Being single the rest of my life doesn't sound so bad .

nojustice,"One of the few useful things I learned from a ""driver re-education"" class I had to take one time was that every feeling we experience has a finite lifetime in our brains. The neurochemicals that are released when we feel happy or sad or angry or aroused or need a drink quickly fade away again, **unless we keep re-activating the pathways that released them in the first place**. This is why they tell you to ""count to ten"". But it's not enough to just count to ten and let the time pass; you have to also not keep triggering the emotion. The way that I like to think about it is that i experience whatever emotion it is, I let it have its moment, and then I let is pass. It's like I neither suppress it nor reinforce it, but rather let it pass over me. 

You will find your own way of dealing with it, but just remember that each emotion only lasts a few seconds to half a minute. Any more than that is you choosing to keep feeling it. All you have to do is choose not to. (I say ""all you have to do"", but I understand it's not as easy as that.

lazlounderhill,"I thought I was actually having a heart attack.  Pulse was racing and I couldn't make it slow down and  I felt an overwhelming sense of doom.  The most frightening thing, aside from the racing heart was that physically, I felt as if my innards were being crushed by ribcage, as if there wasn't enough room for my organs - it is the strangest and most unpleasant sensation.  There was nothing I could do to alleviate the way I was feeling, and the terror of that only made it worse.  

I went to the ER the first time, fully expecting to be told that I was, in fact, having a heart attack, or worse.  They tested me out - no signs of any heart trouble/disease.  They ran some other tests, including a chest x-ray.  Nothing.  Finally they asked me, and I quote, ""If I was an anxious person"".  I answered, ""I guess I am.""  Needless to say, I was extremely embarrassed, but actually VERY relieved.  

The Doctor gave me a PRN script for ativan.  I had it filled and have used it 5 times since then.  I don't ever want to experience a full blown attack like that again.  It came out of nowhere and I think it was a result of a period of extreme stress and two month long family crisis a year prior to my first ""attack"".  Now, If I recognize that feeling starting, I don't hesitate and I use the freakin' ativan, because I was hestitant to use it at first, and I basically had another full blown attack about a week later - again, completely out of nowhere.  

I started a very vigorous and strict workout regiment after that event, because the doctor suggested it - and it has helped.  All subsequent ""attacks"" have coincided with certain busy times when I couldn't devote an hour or more per day for a vigorous workout, so I'm certain that exercise is the only thing keeping this thing in check.

Another thing I do, now, is that I call my SO and just try to talk about it with her, or just talk about other things to help me focus on them instead of the bad thoughts. It really helps and her jokes always cheers me up. 

During my first attack my hands went numb and I couldn't move them at all, as I had never experienced this I freaked out even more. I started sweating and shaking as my thoughts kept telling me things to worry about and filled me with doubt about things. I felt like nothing could help me get out of this state and I didn't want to wake anyone in my family at first because I was anxious about their sleeping schedule. 

Afterwards I was a bit embarassed about it, thinking that there's something wrong with me. But I started reading about anxiety and panic attacks more and realised I wasn't alone.

RandianHero,"Not directly, but she did admit to cheating on me. She didn't infect me with anything, though, so I didn't really see it as a big deal. I just told her good luck and that we were done. Of course, she pleaded and tried to get me to take her back, ""I made a mistake"" and all that usual rigamarole. But I just told her that I had other prospects on the horizon, and she clearly wanted to see other people. So I wasn't going to waste anyone's time trying again.

I wasn't mad about it. I've cheated plenty of times before, so it's not like I don't understand the motivations behind it. But I'm also of the opinion that once the illusion of fidelity is gone, there's really no point in pretending things will be the same. I'd expect the same if someone I'd cheated on found out. Once that trust is gone, you'll never get it back. It's a better idea to just leave it and go on with your life.

HedyLamarr,"As /u/Cumberlady said, it depends on where you are going and what you want to see, but let's expand on that.  

Say you are a business person going to a conference at the convention center. You can take a cab from the airport and catch a shuttle from the nearest hotel (which is barely walking distance) to the convention center. Really, if you go to LA on business but don't have to go beyond the area of your hotel too far, you can cab/use a car service.  

If you are a tourist, it is impossible. Unless you go to LA for a single destination, you have to have a car. Yes, there is a subway, but it doesn't really go where a tourist would want to go. Yes there are busses, but they are designed for local commuters. Want to go to Disneyland one day and check out the crazies on the Venice Beach boardwalk? That's 40 miles of distance between them. Surf in the morning and ski in the afternoon? That's about 75 to 90 miles, plus a full wetsuit.

If you're in any one of the multitude of suburbs, then you will definitely need a vehicle or you'll spend more time getting to your destination than you will being at your destination. For example: I live 13 miles from work. I used to have to get up at 5:00 in the morning to catch three different buses in order to arrive at work by 8:00 (and I'd still have to walk at least a half mile from the nearest bus stop to work once I got there).

Mescacakanisnapesis,"""I managed to muscle in on a fishing day with my Dad and is buddy, Ted. The day started off well, I was volunteered to drive, put the boat in, pull up to the dock and park the truck while my impatient mentors sat in the boat. Once we were on the water, I was more than ready to wet a hook. We pulled across the channel to a rock wall, a favorite spot of the two old anglers. They gladly pointed me to the ""choice spot"" to fish from, the drivers seat of the boat. Strategically placing their casts, they forced me to the other side of the boat, and open water. I took advantage of my Dad when he was ""buzzed"" by a bird the size of the boat. Dad hit the deck, I checked to make sure he was OK, then snuck in a few casts on the ""prime"" side before he gathered himself. On the second cast, ""it"" hit. Out of the water jumped the biggest largemouth I had ever hooked. I reeled and kept tension like a pro as this fish exited the water another time, showing us its size and beauty. I told Dad to grab the net. He took too long reaching, fumbling, and kicking for the net. By the time he had a firm grip on the net, the fish I had worked so hard to get in the boat had freed himself from my line. Disappointed by the lost battle, Dad apologized with the biggest ""I'm so sorry"" I had ever heard. The spirit of fishing was not with us the rest of the day, as we didn't get anything else. The only thing we talked about on the way home was the ""dive bombing"" bird. My Dad passed away a few years later and at the funeral several stories were told, but one story had new light. Ted brought up our fishing trip, and what he told me brought tears of joy and sorrow. He said there were forces beyond my control keeping me from landing the ""bragging rights"" fish that day. He then told me that when Dad was reaching for the net, he paused to look at Ted and winked-this fish wasn't going to make it in the boat. Tears rolled and as I walked over to his casket, I remembered that award winning line, ""I'm so sorry"". But now, I knew he meant, ""I gotcha""!",null,0,cdpoxm1,1rq25j,AskReddit,new,3

All I ever wanted for her was to be happy again. Do whatever it takes. I realized she needed to ""fix""/address the family issue for that to happen. I told her that. So, back home she went. She's now back here in AZ, and with a great guy.",null,1,cdpp87q,1rq25j,AskReddit,new,2

I met her in Kindergarten and we were best friends, we would hangout everyday and we never left each others side. It was like that until third grade. Both our parents thought that we would be like that forever, they would joke around how we were perfect for each other. She moved at the end of 3rd grade and we gradually lost contact. Ten years later she finds me on facebook. I'm scared to talk to her because I know I would want to try to date her, she's an hour away so it's not a big deal.

Ash_ash,"I met him this summer at a concert. Got his number but wasn't too interested. Was kind of hung up in my ex who moved to Europe. He would text me a bit for the whole month of June and I would answer for a bit and then stop. Just thought it of it as nothing. Then I had someone close to me pass and I mentioned it to him in a text one day. For a stranger, he said so much that actually helped me through this rough time, more than any of my close friends had said. So I decided to give it a shot and go out to dinner with him. Our first date lasted 7 hours. I had never met someone who I just instantly clicked with. Felt like I finally understood what people meant by that stupid love at first sight thing. We spent the entire date just talking non stop. We spent the next 3 weeks hanging out everyday, met his family, met his friends. Then summer was over and I had to move 3 hours back to school for my final year. He was 25 and had a full time job so we couldn't see each other too much. He visited me twice and we talked everyday for 3 months. Then he slowly stopped answering. Our plans fell apart. Then one day he just sent me a message saying he was done, and he was sorry. That's it. Haven't seen or heard from him since.

(I won't say what it is because maybe he reads this o_O.)  I didn't really realize that he felt I was embarrassing him infront of his friends when I said ""hi (insert nickname).""  So me being hurt and immature I publicly ignored him because I felt he's response was so cold, blunt, and harsh.

In reality he was communicating in a healthy, mature, and correct manner for a kid.  Years later his mom said he gets so embarrassed when she uses his nickname in public.  (I wish I had told him as he sat by me that when his mom teases him or affectionately calls out to him, it just shows how much he's loved.)

He got away because he really was super sweet, confident, smart, and a nice guy.  And extremely handsome!  I met him years later and I just got dumb shy and didn't really speak.  Guys huh, can be so sensitive. ",null,0,cdprhaw,1rq25j,AskReddit,new,1

Sadomi,"This dream came in 2 parts back when I was 16.

There I was, sitting with the girl of my dreams. Long, luscious hair, a pure, white sundress, and a couple of stools next to a bar. She stood out form everyone else in the room, who was a faceless entity save for a few people I had seen passing by me that previous night. We sit down and we start drinking all of my favorite drinks together, and Talk about football and video games. She was my perfect girl.

Then the fun started. A faceless man ran inside the bar and screamed ""ZOMBIEEESSS"" I see my dream girl just sprint past me with a shotgun in here hand. At this point i was aware of the dream, so i just picked up a revolver off the table and unsheathed my Katana. We sprint outside to a pier where there is a huge goddamned zombie spider. I did the only sensible thing in that situation. 

I threw the spider a Beer and sat and watched the Zombie Apocalypse take over, with my Dream girl just sitting on my lap and broing it up with a 4 story spider.


Part two was in the same dream. I woke up, and my family was standing over my death bed. I felt fine and looked even better. My family and friends were crying and I'm just like ""Shit you guys look ugly crying"" Now, some guy in a 3 piece lime green suit and a pimp hat walked over and started listing off the things I hadn't done yet. The only 2 I remember well were having sex and pull off a heist. The pimp doctor told me I had an hour to live.  I sit up and haul ass outside, and I see my crush from high school. She had already heard the news, and she jumps on my back, piggyback style, and we sprint towards a bank. 

We walk in, hand the bank teller a note laced with instant heart attack powder. The teller starts to have chest pains, and then My crush goes over the counter to help her out, swiping a key in the meantime(The safe only had one physical key, no keypad or anything)  She asks for something in the vault to save the tellers life, a Golden Bamboo stick. We run into the vault to get the bamboo stick, but we lock ourselves inside instead. We cry out for help, and they can't find the key. We snicker to each other and we look at my watch. I had 9 minutes till i passed away, so we did what any virgin would do in that situation.

We awkwardly tried to make love but ended up just cuddling for 6 minutes. The grim reaper walks up to me from out of nowhere and hands me a joint. I didn't smoke at the time in real life, so I don't know why that came up all of a sudden. That's when i woke up. at 5:34 AM, 2 hours before I had to get up for school.

ConfusingUsername,"I used to consider myself one, and I honestly had 3 relationships going at once, all knew the others existed, and usually would have sex with 2 of the women a minimum of 2 times a day.  Apparently they loved the arrangement due to the lack of strings, and they trusted that I wasnt going to break that bond.  They would even out source said info as well and sometimes I often found myself in new company. Oddly enough though, I had a testosterone deficiency at the time.  After a while my sex drive went from multiple times a day, to nothing.  No masterbation, no thoughts, no arousal at all really.  I have no idea when or why it happened, but I have had no desire at all for 3 years now, and honestly have to concentrate very hard if a situation arises for sex and is just selfish for me to reject the person for whatever reason.  It's amazing how completely objective everything became after that as well. Also no sperm at all, so children are out of the picture.

arkilla95,"I think my ex was a nympho. Sorry if this post seems nsfw. Anyways, she wasn't a slut at all, she was a well kept girl, would hardly talk to boys etc (not that I ever encouraged her to do such things) 
One day we are both just laughing about the song blow my whistle, then out of no where she starts ""blowing my whistle"". This is the first time her and I had any sort of intercourse. Anyways, she gave head quite often after that as she said she enjoyed making me happy. (This was way into the relationship)
I thought it wasn't fair that only I got to enjoy it, so one day once she finished, I said it was her turn, and we both had intercourse. This was the day we both lost our Vcards. We had a lot of sexual chemistry between us, and had been dating for over a year. Literally we had sex like 5 times a week, or sometimes 3 times a day. At first it was amazing, but being a human, I started to get really tired of it. It wasn't me taking advantage of how consent she was, it was actually 90% of the time her encouraging me to have sex, instead. I said yes like 90% of the time too, but believe me it isn't a dream. It doesn't feel as special unless we took like week long breaks, which was quite hard for us, some times just her. I started to feel challenged, wandered if I was a real male or not. Started to feel insecure about the fact that a woman would want more sex than me so my hormones were obviously all messed up, I started having thoughts like ""wow I must be gay"" ( I'm not actually gay)

I looked for advice on the Internet and then realised i wasn't alone, and that this actually happens in a lot of other relationships. It definitely helped afterwards. After a while things turned down so we'd have sex once a week, which was completely fine for both of us.

P.s she was 16, I was 17, so it may of just been hormones.

Real music is released in its finished form as an album. Not individual songs. Unless its pretend music pushed out JBs flacid sphincter.

I blame pop. Popculture was pushed on us, eventually most budged and started loving it just because the flood of pop flushed out real music. We had no time to wade trough the shit any more. The fact remains it is scientifically designed to be smooth and easy on our ear canals. Do we want oat meal, or chilli stir fry? 

Rant over thanks for not agreeing.


Please listen to the albums by the artists who defined musical categories. Whatever your preffered category is.


I listen mostly to melodical swedish metal, death and trash, power and polyrhytmics such as djent.

Made in Sweden(c) tells you its genuine and thought out in a fashion you wont find anywhere else in the world.
An experienced metalist will be able to tell whitin seconds where the band is from. Especially if its american (just btb). (not that american music sucks, its often really good). 

In Flames defined death metal in the early days, and continued to pave the way into melodical death metal. Any of the early albums, take your pick. 

At the Gates defined the thrash metal genre. Their album Slaughter of the soul is beyond a shadow of a doubt the most beloved and soul-enlightening creation of all time. They then evolved into The Haunted. Possibly the best band of all time.

The Haunted - Made me do it, and One kill Wonder. Just definitions of music my teenage years. Professionals, tight as hell and just perfect thrash metal. 

Meshuggah defined i guess ""djent"". I dont like the word but there really is'nt any other. Polyrhytmic deep hyper advanced death metal really.
The album Nothing did it for me. It changed my life as a drummer, and since the day it was released i have tried to master it. Tomas haake is so far beyond any other drummer and performs flawlessly every time, creating sounds and rythms that will chill your spine and wonder how a human can do that. Nothing will ever come close. Mention Dream Theatre and you dont get it. (DT are good too, but the singer is horrid and spoils it)


Other awesome albums are anything Sepultura/Soulfly. 

TL;DR

At the Gates - Slaughter of the soul. I have actually listened to this album a minimum of 8000 times.

The Haunted - Made me do it, one kill wonder

In Flames - 1994 - Lunar Strain 1995 - The Jester Race 1997 - Whoracle 1999 - Colony 2000 - Clayman are the good ones portraying their old sound. The new is good too. Great even.

Meshuggah - Nothing. The title says it all. Nothing comes close. You wont be able to speak.

Zonaria - Everything they have released so far. Awesome melodic death metal from northen sweden. It headbangs your organs inside you as well as your mind.

Down - Diary of a mad band. Think ""New Orleans is a dying whore"". Was Pantera.

Also Pantera - anything. You dont like it you are not alive.

abetterthief,"Mainly co-worker blunders. Had one guy leave the back door of a 4 door sedan open and back it off of a 4 post lift. Post on the right rear caught the door and bent it forward till it was flush with the passengers front door. Little old lady driving it didnt seem too upset about it. We of course ended up paying for it to be repaired. 

Had another co-worker who removed all the lug-nuts off the wheel before lifting the vehicle off the ground. He hadnt even set the hoist up, just started removing nuts. Called me over because he was confused as to why he couldnt get the wheel off.

I my self have had butthole puckering moments where the lock on one of the posts of a 4 post lift stays locked, but the rest of the lift keeps lowering. In essence the vehicle starts tipping towards one direction and will keep doing so unless you lift it back up off the lock.  Did this with a BMW 5 series that rolled until the tire chucks stopped it because I wasnt paying attention. 
 
I've got more if anyone cares.

*EDIT TO ADD*

I had a coworker who forgot to take the expensive alignment head reflectors off the passenger's side of the vehicle after aligning it. Drove it around the block and somehow they managed to stay on. Luckily as they are atleast $600 a piece.

I had a service manager have one of the techs remove an air pressure regulator off our tire machine because it was too slow to fill up tires. Service manager later had his drag racing buddy bring in pure aluminum rims so they could mount some tires for him. Machine ended up completely warping the rims beyond use because there was nothing to stop it from continuously putting force on the rim. Shop ended up paying out $1300 for a new rim.

Sooo many double gaskets. So many. 

I had a 60 year old alcoholic coworker, while he was welding exhaust, accidentally weld a hole into a metal gas tank on a 1970s something-or-another(it was while ago so I cant remember what kind of vehicle. Maybe a Maverick?) Seriously starts dripping gasoline out right next to his arc. Only moments away from horrible firey disaster.

I watched the owner of the previous shop I worked for spray brake cleaner all over the underside while it was in the air, to clean up some oil. Which is no big deal its what we all do. But he did it moments before the tech working on it came back and did not tell him so. The tech was going to get the acetylene torch to cut off some exhaust shielding. It was too late to tell him before the underside of the car started on fire with a ""poof"". Luckily the tech had a water hose in front the the car to spray it down with.

Something driver related: Had a 92 Acura Integra brought in for a clunking noise. While I was lifting up the vehicle, the upper ball joint fell out of its socket. Like just fell out so the knuckle was hanging by the lower control arm and the tie rod. We tell the driver she cant drive it like this its 100% going to cause a crash. She says she will call a tow truck to come tow it away. I set the ball joint back in the socket while im lowering it so that we can atleast roll it out of the shop. While we weren't paying attention the driver grabbed her keys off of the hang up hook and drove the vehicle away never to be seen again. Thats is as dangerous as you can get.

We nicknamed a previous coworker chicken sandwich. He had just gotten lunch at Wendys and had a unwrapped chicken sandwich in his hand. Other coworker comes up behind him with a lighter and brake clean. Proceeds to light it and spray said sandwich eating coworker, which then lights sandwich eating coworkers ass on fire. Takes his sandwich and pats out the flames, then proceeds to continue eating it like nothing happened.

That made his rims bounce around on the studs a bit, and was the reason. We checked the balance, none were out.

Second one happened a few days ago. This lady had ran her tire while it was flat and the sidewall got cut in half. Tire fell off. So she had a spare on (her husband did all that). She bought 4 new because AWD, and it turns out she destroyed her rim while driving on it with no tire. So we phone her up and tell her we'll mount the first 3 today, and to get a new one (just a steelie), and come back tomorrow for the last.

spoiledfruit,"When I came to the US at the age of 10, I was so immersed in fitting in and learning to be American/speak English, that I lost a large portion of my Russian speaking ability.

A lot of people have trouble believing that I wasn't born in the US).  The one memory that is very much vivid and sad that sticks out is when my grandmother passed away.  I remember my father bringing me to my grandparents apartment, and my mom was there in all black clothing, sweeping, when she sees me she starts crying and tells me that ""babushka, isn't here anymore, and that I won't be able to see her.""  I think the reason this memory sticks out so much is because my grandmother and me had such a strong bond.  Off topic but the most fun memory I have is:  My grandmother was disabled on the left side of her body because of the flood of Babi-Yar.  Even though she was disabled she would still horse around with me and be a regular grandma.   My grandmother and I were sitting on a circular bench in her kitchen that curved around a table, we started at one end and I kept sliding close to her and bumping her and she would move over.  When we got to the other end, she fell off the bench.  My family still talks about this story even though it was 30 years ago.  I was the younger of only two grandkids, and I'm pretty sure I was her favorite.  Anyway, the saddest part of this is how it hurt my mom to lose her.  ",null,0,cdpovf2,1rq0lf,AskReddit,new,1

Also, it's hard not having a wingman, I'm not the type that has just a ton of female friends, nor am I very good at meeting new ones.

Now if I want to get out and do something, I go sit at bars by myself and talk to the other weirdos who do the same thing. Or I just sit at home and watch TV or fuck around on the computer. In the summer, the single people I go hang out with are typically in their early and mid 20s. It really kind of sucks.

Without that, nothing I'm doing or into seems to be of any real consequence or importance. I don't feel that I'm making anyone's life any better or more enjoyable in a way that only I can do. There's a part of me that wants out, but it simply can't find purchase.

I distract myself as much as I can, though. That way, I don't think about being lonely, thus I (hope I) don't show it. I mean, no one was ever attracted to someone else because that person was lonely. I practice or exercise when I've got the energy, watch movies when I don't, go hear some live music when I can afford to go out, and just keep myself busy.

I did some on the job sit-ins with 911 dispatchers because that's what I thought I wanted to do when I finished high school and college.

One time I was just listening in and we get a call from an older woman, very older woman. She was crying and saying her husband was hitting her and that she was afraid he was going to kill her.

The dispatcher that was my guide for the day got a sad look on her face and went on to ask general questions. Where she was, was she hurt, what did he do, where is he?

The older woman just kept repeating that she was scared and that her husband was going to hurt her. After reassuring the woman she would be okay she transferred the older woman to another line.

The whole time I was shocked beyond belief and wondered why my guide acted the way she did and why she didn't seem to take this call seriously.

It turns out the older woman that called had dementia and her husband had been dead for some years. She still got delusions that he was alive and out to harm her. She called 911 often and there wasn't much anyone could do. We would send officers over to check on her but she was never really in any harm.

It's just weird because it's a very real thing to her and she felt real danger even if there was nothing wrong. That's got to be a huge thing for 911 dispatchers and that's why I decided I didn't want to go into that.

Well it turns out earlier in the day someone stole the dog and it broke him so he started drinking profusely. I eventually calmed him down and we managed to turn off the alarm so we got off the phone. 

Problem was in his drunken stupor he kept reactivating the alarm and it eventually got to the point where I believe he kept falling over and was unable to turn it off. We eventually contacted someone on his emergency list to visit him and they found him on the floor in tears crying.

He tied his belt around the stump and crawled to his phone on the porch and called. He died with the phone in his hand.

**2)** A man locks his 2 toddlers in the bathroom, shoots his pregnant wife, calls 911 and says, ""Call my father and send police. I killed my wife and I'm going to kill myself."" He hangs up and kills himself. Police get there and hear the toddlers crying in the bathroom and they kick in the door.

**3)** I heard a female in the closet whispering that someone is breaking into her house. You could hear them banging on the door and then you started to hear glass breaking as they broke in the windows. Police got there in time.

**4)** An elderly male finds out that he has terminal cancer. He already cares for his wife who has Alzheimers. He shoots his wife and then shoots himself. When relatives find them 3 days later, he successfully commited suicide but his wife wandered around the house for 3 days leaving blood all over the house until she finally expired.

Lonewolf8424,"I'm an emergency dispatcher for a company that monitors emergency elevator, help, and pool phones. I work the night shift on weekends so I get a lot of weird calls. Honestly, after a while, they all kind of blend together, but a few stick out. 

Back when I first started, I had a lawyer who was stuck in a public storage elevator call in. I ask my questions, and I'm just about to hang up and begin calling for help when she starts ranting about how she's a big fancy lawyer and is going to sue public storage and my company if she's not freed from the elevator in the next five minutes. I had to try hard not to laugh at the absurdity of threatening the only people who can help you. I believe she ended up staying in the elevator for another thirty minutes or so. Which is actually pretty quick as far as elevator entrapments go. 

Another time we got trolled hard by this one guy. Now, being a little fucker and misusing the phones isn't uncommon, but it usually amounts to some asshole kid calling, yelling, ""DICK"" into the phone and running off. This time was different. At the time, we were acting as the answering service for an elevator company. The only thing about that that's relevant is that when someone called in on that line, it wouldn't pull up the exact location of the caller. So this highly irate gentleman calls in yelling about how's he's stuck in the elevator. I'm unable to get a location message to play, and all the guy will say when asked is a nonexistent address in Manhattan. Then he starts calling me a cunt, among other colorful things. Now the elevator company I was answering for was based in Colorado, not New York. When i pointed that out, he'd just repeat the address in Manhattan he listed earlier, then rattle off the same string of insults. After about five minutes of arguing with him and becoming more and more irritated, it dawned on me that everytime he said something, he'd say it in the exact same tone and rythm. Yep. It was one of those Soundboard things. I wasn't even mad. I'd been duped by a machine. I transferred it to my supervisor and told her my Soundboard theory. The best part is that she proceeded to argue with it for another five minutes even though I told her it was a machine. There's probably a recording on YouTube somewhere.

It was about 2 in the afternoon and I get a call from a frantic lady calling in saying her baby is not breathing. I get her address and *BOOM*, EMS is haulin ass code red. I ask her if she knows CPR and she says no, I convince her to let me walk her through it while we wait for EMS to get to her. I start with standard CPR for babies and when I tell her to put him on her leg, she says he is way to heavy for him to be lifted. 

At this point I was little thrown off....so I go with standard CPR. Three minuets go by and she says she can hear the ambulance outside. She can see the Paramedic running to her house so I let her go at this point so she can be with EMS.

Anyway, about 20 or so minuets later I get a call from EMS. I figured it was just them calling to give me and update so I can notate what happened for records...nope.

You get a lot of really stupid calls, usually people who don't get the concept that 911 is for emergencies, but it's not a big deal to me unless they use an unusual amount of resources (calling a lot, faking information to get higher priority, using ambulance as a taxi, etc.)

One guy called FRANTICALLY saying that he saw the dead body of a young woman, early 20s, wearing nothing but shorts. He gave a detailed description, hair color, skin color, body position, the whole bit and said she was by the side of the interstate (in the middle of an affluent suburban area at rush hour) so we figured this had to be a really fresh crime scene. We started scrambling together officers to get there ASAP, a big hassle considering it's rush hour and they're all dealing with accidents and stuff like that. On top of that, we can't say what the issue is on the radio is because we have too many busibodies who monitor police radio, then call us to try to get juicy details, or othewise meddle. So we have to get these officers to their cars to read the computer, leaving other issues, etc. And these are suburban cops in the Midwest, a murder is a damn big deal.

The guy calls back a few minutes later. ""Uh, I checked again, it's a dead deer.""

OrganicOrganics,"Once passing through those marked doors you step outside of civilization and into a wild nightmare. At first the people try to keep order as the cavalcade of bodies march in and out in a neverending stream. 

Then people start to slip up. A toilet sits unflushed. Someone blows their nose and throws the tissue beside the toilet. Little things at first. But then when other notice the slight slip-ups, they begin to do the same things because that is how it was when they found it. 

The slight things add up. A toilet is now clogged. People still need to evacuate waste and get back to their shopping but there are only 2 stalls now. Impatient people begin piling their wastes on-top of the clogged toilet, all the while insisting that it is not their problem-- it was like that when they found it. That is how it must have always been done. 

The line for the toilet forms. A man waits impatiently because he has to go NOW. Tired of standing around yo-yoing his excretions like some kind of sick game, he pulls down his trousers and squats over the urinal. Many people look away, but they are inspired. ""If he can do it, why can't I?"" The other urinals become occupied as people unload themselves into them. 

Now the smell of wastes in unbearable and the urinal squatters must wipe. They clomp over to the paper towel dispensers in a squatted walk and wipe themselves. But the paper towels are thin. People touch their own waste. Infuriated they throw paper towels covered in their own mess in the general direction of the trash bin. Some make the shot, others do not and they hit the groud with unpleasant splatters or smush onto the wall, glued to the once white tile with the leftovers of a thanksgiving dinner. 

They go to the sinks and spread their filth, leaving particles and streaks on the faucets and inside of the tubs. A parent holds their crying child over one sink and begs them to 'let it go' so they can leave this incredible hell. 

After many hours, the day is done. The hellhole these people have created is forgotten by them as they dash home with their loot. A solitary custodian opens the once stark-white door slowly and gazes upon the horrors that ordinary people have unleashed. He sighs exasperated and slowly pushes the mop bucket into the room, knowing there is a very good chance he will never return.

I'm from Germany and in summer 2013 I was in England for two weeks. It was kind of a language course and there were about 60 other students in my age. Two weeks passed and I had a lot of fun meeting people, living at a host family and doing stuff with my frined who had come with me.
On our last evening, when there was almost no time to meet the others, because early in the morning we had to return, the whole group ate pizza at a restaurant. I sat there with my friend and all of the sudden a girl I haven't seen before sat down on the other side of the table.
We had one of the most magical and enthusiastic conversations EVER. It was amazing. I've never before felt such a deep and strong connection to anyone. We were definitely meant for each other.
Unfortunately we were seperated, because when we had to go back to Germany, I got to know she lives in the south and I rather in the north. 
I'm so glad I asked her for her number, usually I am not the guy to make such a optimistic move when getting someone to know.
We chatted since then everyday on Whatsapp and it is still amazing, because she felt the same way I did in that restaurant: our conversation was absolutely fantastic and we soon fell in love with each other. There are like 500km between us and we didn't have the chance to meet each other yet, but we will.

OlivesRose,"I started talking to this guy on facebook, he was blunt, opinionated, and from what I could tell a genius. He intrigued the fuck out of me on an intellectual level and we started talking. Mostly joking and insulting eachother. Eventually I got comfortable with him and I'd vent to him, even though I was sure it only bothered him. It didn't. 

One particularly bad day, I wasn't really in the mood to talk to anyone, and I made it known. He told me that he didn't count when I didn't want to talk to anyone, and he ended up giving me his phone number so I could text him about it. I did. I stayed up all night texting him. He kind of became the only person I went to to talk about things, but at that point we weren't interested in eachother romantically. He was pursuing a different girl kind of quietly but I ended up catching on after a couple months.

Now I have to take a second to say, we were totally opposite people. He smoked, drank, partied, and generally didn't give a single fuck. And I went to church every Sunday, got straight A's, and had never gotten drunk. It sort of bothered me that he was into those things, but I'm also not the type of person that will tell you how to live. And like I said, he intrigued the fuck out of me.

One night, he called me. I thought it was on accident because it was late at night and well, he'd never called me before. I answered hesitantly and sure enough he called on purpose. We talked for about 5 hours that night. He was so interesting to me, and from then on we talked on the phone quite a bit, often for hours at a time.

Anyway, the girl he had been pursuing ended up changing her mind. It broke his heart, and I remember him telling me that I was the only girl he didn't hate now. At the time I didn't know what he meant. By this time, I cared about him more than he knew. This is where it get's scary. I almost lost him before anything began. He almost ran away, he stole a truck and made it to the border of our state and then decided to turn back. He later told me, he came back because of me. He didn't tell me this even happened until a while after it did. I remember a little while after he told me, he went camping in a part of our state that is essentially wilderness. There was no cell service and he didn't answer me for 4 days. By the 4th day, I thought he left. It scared the shit out of me. We weren't even dating at that point.

Fast forward a little and we started actually hanging out. It was kind of an unsaid date the first time we hung out. He walked all the way across town to meet me and we hung out at a park. He'd comment on how small my hands were just so he could compare hand sizes and almost hold my hands. I think he thought I was oblivious. I wasn't. 

We continued hanging out and everytime he would walk all the way across town. He'd say sweet things to me and we both knew where it was going. One day, we were sitting on a hill overlooking a feild at just about dusk and he put his arm around me. It was the time of year where your not quite used to the colder fall air. He was warm, and I was shivering. Half because of excitement, the other half cold. I remember it like it was yesterday. 

Then he officially ask me out. It was all so perfect. He'd call me every night before I fell asleep to say goodnight. Actually, he still does only now sometimes I'm asleep first. We'd write eachother letters, and he made me music. We'd lay on a blanket outside and look at stars, and we even danced under the moon. He'd sing Frank Sinatra to me when we go on walks. One time we met at the beach and it started pouring rain, I wanted to wait it out under a gazebo but he insisted we just walk back to his house. So we did. It was summer and the rain was warm enough to comfortably get soaked. We ran the couple blocks back, kicking water at eachother and laughing. I only wish I would have kissed him to make it more cliche. Nonethless, that day was wonderful. We've been together a little over a year now and I feel like my life is a romance novel. We of course have our fights, not everything is perfect. But I am incredibly greatful for the memories I have shared with this man. He means the world to me.

TL; DR I got carried away. Literally and figuratively.

Gettin_Hooked,"Time for another addition of ""Super Gay^^*literally* Story Time"":


I fell in love with my female best friend when I was 14 years old. It was confusing and given the fact that she was extremely religious, conservative and by all noticeable signs straight it was pretty much a bummer. I never told her I was gay let alone in love with her and it strained our relationship throughout the years. 

As most 15 year old girls are, she become pretty much awful throughout high school. Obsessed with social climbing and doing whatever was the status quo. We drifted apart and I had to painfully watch her date d bag after d bag for a few years. Eventually I came out and had a few relationships, in the long attempt to move on and forget about her. 

Toward the end of high school we rekindled our friendship and she apologized for letting peer pressure get the best of her. Right before graduation we got drunk and hooked up. It was about as amazing as I ever thought it could be. But afterward she freaked out and insisted we should talk or see each other especially next year(we ended up at the same college).

As much as it hurt I respected her decision and figured it would stick since she was going Greek which is essentially the college version of high school cliques. I had accepted this end until she called me one day a few months into freshman year saying she had to see me.

We met up and she instantly started sobbing, saying she couldn't do this anymore. That she'd always been in love with me and had tried so hard to just ignore it. She had no idea what this meant for her life or sexuality, but she knew she couldn't fight it any more.

It was a long long journey and it hasn't ever been easy but we're now out to friends and my family. Going strong for over a year now. I still can't believe it when I wake up next to the love of my life who I thought would never be mine. There were a thousand times when all reason and sense told me to give up on it forever, but sometimes the heart knows best.

Flubbing,"My girlfriend of 8 months (still a baby relationship, but still counts) started off as good friends. When we met, we were both freshman at a new college and both had semi serious long term relationships. We first met when I caught a closing elevator with my hand, and slithered in through the cracks of the doors. My first words were, ""Have you ever had that fear of being crushed by the elevator doors?"" Suave, I know, but she smiled and that was the last I saw her for the day. 

Over the next couple months, we built a friendship in a group among other friends. As a commuter to the college, I had a car with which I started giving her rides back home everyday. Overtime, we grew away from the group of friends and became close friends to one another. 

Separately, both of our relationships to our other significant others kind of  deteriorated from issues of distance, miscommunication, and differences that were no longer able to be abridged.

freedomsong85,"You want a love story? Um... Okay. Let's see. Oh yeah! Okay, so um.. yeah, here we go..

Met my husband back in high school. We were friends. He married one of my best friends. We had a series of party houses with semi-regular room mates. Basically, lived together (including his wife/my bff? and others)off and on for years. She cheats. They have a crappy divorce. I was right there for him. I am still best friends with him at the end of it. 

We continue living together with friends for a couple of years. One day I am just sitting around looking at him and realize I have a HUGE crush on him. (I'm talking one of those scramble to the journal and freak out moments.) Since we were best friends, I decided that going for it was a terrible idea that would end our friendship and destroy the house dynamics. My world is crumbling. So, I set him up with a girl I know. Logical solution? (IDK) Obviously that doesn't work out. 

Then, the worst luck ever has to strike. He and I wind up going after the same girl. (Crazy confusing, I know.) That doesn't work out for either of us. So, I start dating a guy and we hit it off.
 
Future hubby finds out and his world comes crashing down now too. 
He starts going after me HARD. I soon find myself in a bad break up. Presto! 

Future hubby and I start talking about our feelings. I was VERY resistant to the idea. (To the extent that we sat down and had several very long talks about it.) I never saw myself with someone like him, I didn't think he could handle the kind of relationship I needed, and I couldn't see our relationship change going well. Basically, my answer was a cautiously stern NO!

Little did I know that he was a man who had finely crafted the 'Wear them down' approach to love and war. Through a series wide of romantic gestures, like ninja kisses, he slowly won me over. It was a week or two before I realized we had already transitioned from best friends to boy/girlfriend. Surprisingly it worked. VERY well.

I have never been good with relationships. Honestly, the fact that we were friends for a decade before anything happened was probably the only reason we lasted the first year. 

We dated for a year, were engaged for another year, and have been married for four years now. We were inseparable as friends. (As in if someone either of us dated wouldn't deal with our close friendship and constant presence in each others lives, the relationship was over. In hindsight, that was probably a BIG clue.) I can't imagine my life without him.

I always had a rule that I would never date my best friend. Friendship is important, and lasting friendships are more precious then you realize when you are younger. If it weren't for the series of insane events that brought us closer and closer together, we^never would have gotten married. 

Today, I would highly advise anyone considering letting a possible happy relationship pass them by *due to friendship* alone to feel it out and give it a try. 

It is not a 'normal' love story I suppose. It was chaos from the start. It was exactly what we needed. Finally saying YES to him was by far the best decision I have ever made. I am happy and we have an amazing child together. This really could not have turned out any better for us. ",null,1,cdpq94r,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,7
gobabygo11,"I'm sorry. :( My SO and I have been together nearly 7 years. We met in high school, but it wasn't until after he graduated (he's a year older) that I put it together that he was interested in me. 

In class, he would draw me silly cartoons of pirates, make me gifts and we would share cosmic brownies. He ate the icing, while I ate the brownie and the little sprinkles on top. We hung out outside of school a few times with friends, where he showed me that he learned how to play my favorite Christmas Song on the guitar and he borrowed a friends Nintendo Wii because he knew I wanted to play it when it first came out.

What did I do? I tried to find him a date for prom, talked him into going with this crazy exchange student and I was completely ignorant of his feelings for me while I was dating a guy that was manipulative, mean and controlling. 

After about a year of him trying to show me that he had feelings for me, it finally hit me. It gave me the strength to break up with my mean boyfriend and I showed up at my current SO's house on Valentine's Day with an origami rose.

groovyrubie,"I met a boy at a concert during the summer of 2010...we had both wandered off from our friends, were both massive fans of the band and had an amazing night enjoying each other's company. Being in a slightly altered state, we ended up only exchanging names.

Fast forward to January of 2011. I run into him at a party at my school - turns out he had transferred to my college that September (although he didn't know I went here). We began spending time together, as friends at first but I soon realized he was everything I'd ever hoped to find in someone.

mantarey5500,"We meet at at a gender-bending party.  I think, ""damn, that dude looks good in a dress!""  So I go over and over to him.  Turns out he is a really cool geeky person like me!

Fast-forward a couple weeks.  We've been talking every day, and we get along really well.  We go to Quizno's for our first date, and he's wearing socks and mandals.  I take this as a sign that he's a comfortable, casual person, and I like him a lot for it.

Our second date is at my place.  We stay up talking long enough for my roomie to go to a party, come back, get high, and eat two bags of oatmeal cookies.  At 3 AM he leaves without kissing me.  I get a text later that says ""Sorry I didn't kiss you.  I'm always really nervous the first time.""  This is coming from a 23-year-old man.  I decide that he's the most adorable man I've ever met.

Our third date is at his place, and we watch ""The Thing"".  We kiss for the first time, and I find out that he's a damn good kisser too!

Fast-forward a month or two.  I stay over at his apartment for the first time.  My friend attempted suicide that morning, and I've been having an awful time.  We snuggle all night.

Fast-forward another few months.  We've been staying over at one another's places for a while, but no sex.  We're not abstaining for any reason, we just haven't felt like it I guess.  One morning I wake up and see his face caught in the sunlight that's slanting through the curtains and think ""This is the most beautiful person I have ever met"" followed promptly by ""Oh shit"" because I realize that I have feelings for him, even though we're supposed to be just casually dating.  I proceed to squash down those feelings.

Fast-forward another few weeks.  We split up over the winter holiday because we'll be long distance and supposedly neither of us is invested in the relationship.

Fast-forward another two months.  I go over to his apartment to play games and hang out.  A couple hours later, we go into his bedroom and sit down on the bed.  I tell him that I want to start dating again.  He gets all flustered and says he doesn't know if that's a good idea.  I convince him that there's no harm because I think he's awesome and I liked when we were dating casually.  He finally agrees.

Fast-forward to the next morning.  I find out why he thought it wasn't a good idea.  He wakes up, looks me right in the eyes and says in the cutest, happiest voice ever ""mantarey5500, I love you, and I don't want to just be casual anymore.""

I love him too.  We've been together for over two years now, and I couldn't be happier :)",null,0,cdpt3o7,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,3

Ive never loved anyone. I never did, I do not love now, and i dont think im capable of this kind of feeling. I had some deeper affection towards certain women in my life. But i was always declined. ALWAYS. 

Yet now i share my time with certain girl, and while i am not sure what i feel, i know one thing: I feel good and warm when she smiles and laughts. I feel good when she hides in my arms. I dont think its love. I think she gives me purpose, she gave me the meanin behind being a human being and a man at that. And it feels just right. 

this wont last long i fear. This will colapse or spiral down as we do not use similiar values to describe reality. But i dont care. Shes a good girl, Im obidient calm man. 

We have some good times. If I just loved her, it would be perfect. And it would be perfect if she would give me more of her time. Cause she works all the time, and we cannot see eachother that much. When we do - its ok. 

And being just ok, is good. After being alone for so long, i find myself in \ok\ position and im happy. im good. Im satisfied. 



... somewhere deep inside my soul wants to die. Wants to rip my heart from chest with bare hands. just because i dont love. But i keep demons inside as long as it is ok. 

so keep it cool. Keep it under control. Find something that gives you control. Sence of puprose - like my girl that gives me that feeling of being involved and important for someone.

cakesarelies,"I used to help her out in school with Maths and stuff, we'd sit together in the library, every time our arms touched, I swore I'd get a boner. One day I told her how I felt, she told me she felt the same way, we started dating.

I used to dream about dating her and sweeping her off her feet like in the movies. I've always wanted to be a film critic so I used to watch all these rom-coms and stuff, and had this idealistic view of love.

It took me two weeks to realize that she needed help with EVERYTHING in life (not just Maths), her parents were ultra-conservative, there were at least three guys into her apart from me who made it their personal mission to ruin my life.

When I finally did end it with her, I came out of it jaded. I used to think that the moment I saw her, I was in love with her, but as it turns out, it was just my hormones.

I've been in love once more, but that one is not that interesting, this one taught me that there is no such thing as love at first sight, to fall in love with someone is to know them as completely as you can know them, its not something ideal or cliched you see in the movies, its much more organic in real life, and if you're hanging on to the glorified vision of love, just let go.

As for the OP, I'm sorry it ended for you, what you need is not love stories from other people, you need to go make your own new one, and keeping making new ones till you find one that lasts till you die. I wish you all the best.

TL;DR: Don't idealize love. Love is more 'Annie Hall' and less 'When Harry Met Sally'

chatttheleaper,"I'm not doing this to get advice, I'm doing it because you asked. 
I met her 3 years ago. Actually, we have varying opinions on where we first met. She says we sat together at one point, and I talked to her briefly. I say we met staffing a Halloween carnival. (She's entirely right about where we first met, but she likes to mock me with what I said, so I tend to ""forget"".) At the class where I first met her, I thought she was kind of strange. Cute, but not somebody I thought I'd have any interest in. Looking back, it seems funny that someone who's come to matter so much to me, initially seemed like somebody I had no interest in as a friend. So, later at the carnival, I was stuck working a booth with her. So, I made some small talk, and we wound up hitting it off pretty well. And then, at the end of the night, she introduced me to the girl I had sat with at the class. Confused? So was I. Turns out, the girl I was working with was the identical twin of the girl from the class. So, we talked for a bit more before I left. At the classes after that, we'd hang out, and times were good. I started to fall in love with both of them, since they were both great friends, and I enjoyed hanging out with both of them. As we started to hang out more, I only loved them more. However, our schedules caused us to see each other infrequently. After about a year, we saw each other less, and most of our communication was electronic. This worked fine at first, but even that slowly stagnated. But then, this year, we started attending the same school. They were new to the area, and didn't have many friends, so they spent a lot of time with me. It was around this point I figured out which one of them I wanted to be with. However, they started to make new friends as well. I became obsessive, and started to worry every time they talked to a guy who wasn't me. I saw them flirting where they weren't, and I started to become more closed off.

scoatney_hall,"Typical beginning. I dated a whole lot of jerks and was verging on desperation and/or spinsterhood. My best friend was having a lot of luck on a dating site and convinced me to join. It seemed like a failure at first. Then one night, I was watching a movie about a character from a certain part of the UK and thought the accent was cool. Randomly searched for guys from that area on the dating site and checked a few profiles out, but didn't initiate contact because I figured no one would want to start something with a girl in America.

A few minutes later, I got a message from one of the guys whose profile  I looked at. We wound up talking for hours and kept in contact. Long story short, I planned a trip to meet him but my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I scrapped the idea for a while. He got a girlfriend in the meantime, though I was too overwhelmed with my mom's health issues to think about it. Once she got better, I went to Scotland with a friend who insisted that we meet if I was going to be in the UK anyway. Turns out, he and the girlfriend had broken up a few weeks before I got there. We meet in his home city. After a lot of initial awkwardness due to my social anxieties, we hit it off immensely and I left the UK with a long-distance romance.

We went back and forth between America and England for three years. It was expensive, it was exhausting, but it was also incredibly beautiful at the same time. We had ten airport reunions. The last airport reunion was when he came in two weeks before our wedding. We cut the visa process close, but we got it by the skin of our teeth. 10 days later, we were picking up his mom and friends at the same airport. That was a year and a half ago and this has been the best year and a half of my life.

Everyone always thinks that how we met was the fairy tale, but the fairy tale has been everything that came after. We've had a lot of obstacles in our way, but at the end of the day, I married my best friend who I somehow managed to meet from thousand of miles away. He's the funniest, most intelligent person I have ever met. We're usually laughing within the first 5 minutes we're awake and in the 5 minutes before one of us (usually me) falls asleep. I've never felt comfort with anyone like I have with him. I could go on and on, but I'll just sum up by saying I didn't know this was possible. And it's all because a friend had to push me into starting a dating site profile. Fun fact: She also met her husband on a dating site and we're all best friends now. Thank you, internet.

suicidal_reverie,"Well, uh... This has a sad ending but I like it. :) Here goes:

Freshman year of high school, I was kind of a hopeless loner. Didnt have any friends since I'd switched school districts; ended up spending most days in total silence. One day I finally talked to that cute girl named Natalie in art class, and she smiled and actually *talked back* (No one ever talked to me when I talked to them, so this was a pleasant surprise), and we had a nice conversation during class change.

Next couple days, we break the ice some more and become semi good friends. One day, I get a random text message. It's from her; she'd found my page on Facebook just to get my number. I'm normally stupid about this kinda thing, but I got the hint this time; it was obvious she was at least a *little* interested.

We ended up becoming amazing friends through text messages. She became my sole confedant, and I hers. Well, three weeks after I first talked to her, I asked her out. It was New Year's Eve, and I'd already worked the entire date out with her parents (how she'd get there and all). She said yes!

An hour later my brother drives me to her house and her parents drive us to a nearby theme park (we were both freshman, not old enough to drive), then let us stay there til the next morning since the park was open and monitored the whole night due to it being New Year's Eve.

We rode some rides for a few hours and then ate at one of the ""fancy"" (it was disgusting and overpriced) restaurants in the park. Then we got in the ridiculously long line for the ferris wheel, but we were lucky: we managed to get on at the perfect time to be at the very top the minute the ball dropped.

It was possibly the most clichéd moment ever, our first kiss. Top of the ferris wheel on New Year's Eve with fireworks going off in the background... It was *magical.*

Fast forward a year and we're still dating; I'm convinced I'm going to marry this girl. Her brother, a complete and total stoner, is supposed to drive her home; she has no clue he's high. He runs a light and gets t-boned by a semi. She dies instantly, he gets a few scratches.

We met in a bar, the day we both were supposed to meet other people but they didn't show up. Coincidence.
I was planning on leaving the country three months later (I was working there for a year and wanted to go back to my country because my work contract was not going to be renovated), we kept hanging out together but we tried not to get too atached because we knew we would separate short after and there was nothing we could do against, and we also didn't wanted a long distance relationship.

Well, we did get attached, and two weeks after I took the plane to go back to my country, he decided to drive for 3 DAYS straight to see me. He drove trought 4 countries. I freaked out and took a plane as soon as he told me he was driving, to meet him somewhere in the middle of the way. The day we were supposed to meet, he would not respond. I waited for hours. I arrived there at 7.00, and waited until around 14.00... I thought he just said that as a cruel joke that i took too serious and never took his car, or if he ever took it, he died in a crash and that's why he would not respond his phone or call me.

Well... he finally calls me. I was already crying, because I didnt bring money with me to go back home since I thought I could drive with him, and I didnt tell anyone I was there. He told me where he is, not far away from where I was, and run there. He got mugged, and they broke his car window. He was calling me from an internet shop. He had to beg for gasoline and sold something just to get where I was.

We spent 3 days more in the road with no money, no food and drinking water from service stations... until we finally got to my place. The thing is, we realized we were in love with each other when we had no food, no bed, we were both smelly and tired... but happy, because we were together.

Dinosarah,"I'm making a website for this exact thing, so here's a rundown of this. 

We met in 2009 in Marching Band.  We both had friends who were somewhat popular who we tended to cling to.  Our friends became friends and everyday we were sitting next to eachother not really participating in the conversation.  I remember the first day we met, he said something and no one believed him.  He got really annoyed with us and made a pouty face for the rest of the meal.  Looking back, I find this really cute to think about.  One day he said something rude to me like, ""why are you here and not with the other girls?"" I was in colorguard and he was in band, but I never really was close to all of them as much as I was to my other friend, A. A was the one who was friends with my boyfriend, Ryan's, friend.  So I just told him that and we didn't really talk for the rest of the year in marching band, to be honest.  Eventually, the schoolyear began officially and we had a class together. 

In Spanish class I found him annoying, he would be the one to ask the teacher dumb questions like, ""Are we supposed to answer the questions in Spanish?"" and she would say, ""No. Mandarin Chinese.""  My friend Tiffany was convinced that he was super hot, though, even though I couldn't see it at the time.  I had my eyes set on different guys, one in specific I dated. 

Oddly enough, dating this guy was what made me see the great things about Ryan.  The year passed uneventfully, except that my ex and my current boyfriend talked sometimes, this caused tensions later on, but I will get there when I get there.  We all would spend anime club together and take pictures and laugh together.  

The next band season we took our yearly trip to cedar point.  On the bus I sat next to A, Ryan sat in front of us by himself.  During the ride he fell asleep, but we still took pictures of us around him and messing with him.  When he woke up I asked him who he was going to be with, he said no one. I am a huge follower of the buddy system, so I told him to join my group.  He agreed. 

My friends eventually dispersed to do their own things, leaving me alone with Ryan.  I was upset to have been left alone by people I cared so much about, so I forgot to drink water. In 90 degree weather.  I obviously got dehydrated and began barfing everywhere.  My mom didn't know what was wrong with me, but Ryan did.  He took care of me when I was sick and basically forced water down my throat and comforted me about it.  This was one of the first times I started to see that Ryan was a great person and this meant a lot to me.  

Sophomore year went by with very little movement afterward, but I did like you as a person and we talked a little bit more that year, which was great.  A big deal in the progress, however, was that my relationship with the other guy was getting worse and worse.  He made me feel bad about everything about myself and was weirdly controlling and I just was completely unhappy.  

By the summer, I hated everything about him.

That summer was my junior year and third band camp, this was the first year that I started to get sick everyday.  I threw up a few times and spent a lot of time with Ryan. We ate lunch together everyday and I was so happy with him, and we got closer everyday.

Meanwhile, in my other relationship, I hit a breaking point.  I ended it leading to months of stalking and depress.  Ryan would talk to me and his role never changed.  He always made me happy, even through the horrible things.  He got a lot of shit from my ex for talking to me and all of that, even into our relationship for almost the entire first year, my ex still texts me to tell me he's an asshole, but that doesn't bother me. 

In December that year I realized how strong my feelings were and I Realized I would explode if I didn't let him know.  I knit him a scarf and gave it to him and gave him a letter to show him how important he was.  We didn't start dating until 6 months after my last relationship ended.  In that week was his birthday and we began being inseperable.  We didn't kiss for 6 months, we were always together. And we've been dating for 2 years since.

In that time I've shown him all of baggage and I gained a little brother through an affair my parents had and everything got better through time for me.  I'm completely happy and Ryan still makes me ecstatic.

Well it turns out there was this girl who also took the same route as me to her car, and I noticed she was in my class.  We made small talk for a few weeks.  Then in April, I finally asked her to lunch, and she said that she's been wanting to ask me out as well.  I would love to be able to say we're still together, but alas, she broke up with me in August.",null,0,cdptybt,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1
charlie2292,"My story is pathetic. I'm pathetic. I met her when I was young, even before high school. I was relatively new to this school but I already knew most people by that time, apart from her. Some friends were talking about her and I didn't know who she was, so they pointed her out and my god, it was like I had seen an angel... It may sound cliché but I really have never experienced something like that again. I've had a few crushes before, this was very different.

I was still pretty social back then so I didn't really have any trouble introducing myself and I learned she lived nearby. From then on I just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. When I was playing on the streets I would always check if she was out aswell or when we were at school I'd try to be around her as much as possible.
We've had some good times together, some are definitely highlights of my life. Most likely not as meaningful to her as they are to me however.
 I honestly didn't try having a relationship with her. If she wanted it, heck yeah, but I didn't want to force it in that way. I just enjoyed being with her, I was happy. 

But then of course the clouds got darker. See, my brother was also in love with her but he didn't approach it in the same way. He told her pretty much right away and he got rejected. He didn't give up though and made several other desperate attempts to confess his love to her. Eventually she got fed up with it I think (can't blame her) and she insulted him by calling him a fatass. We've always been larger than most kids, not obese or anything, just bulkier. I've always been pretty insecure about my body and this certainly didn't help, since I was a few kilos heavier than my brother. It didn't change the way I feel about her though. I simply realised she doesn't feel the same way about me, or atleast my chances would be very low. 

Then my parents split up and we had to move and change schools. We lost touch. The whole family situation (stepmom mainly) had quite an impact on me. To put it short: became very insecure, got addicted to computer games which made me lose pretty much all my friends, and my social skills are zero. Got fatter on top of that. Still didn't get back in touch with her.

This went on until my last year of high school.  I started thinking about what's gonna happen after high school. I had zero ambition. I started looking at some possible educations and decided studying IT would be my safest bet. Then I looked at what colleges/unis would be possible and I noticed she went to the one that stood out the most. Some other good stuff happened aswell, which made me realise it isn't all that bad and some changes made me lose my MMORPG addiction. I started going to the gym which made me lose quite some weight. Life was starting to get better.

Skip to my first year in college. I wanted to see her so badly but I'm so fucking shy and socially awkward. My appearance improved a lot but I'm still fucking insecure. I checked when and where she would have class and I'd try to 'accidently' meet her. This went on for a few weeks but I never saw her for some reason. Until one day it finally happened. There she was, so beautiful... I got so nervous I could barely walk and I definitely didn't have the courage to go talk to her. I walked past her and hoped she wouldn't notice me. This went on for the rest of my first year. I saw her a few times but never had the guts to go talk to her. 

Now I'm in my second year. I lost some more weight but still very insecure, shy and socially awkward. I already saw her a few times in the first period but again I always chickened out. Until one time I just thought ""fuck it"" and I finally said hi. It was fucking awkward... She was so nice to me but I just didn't know what to say. It turned into some awkward smalltalk. I wanted to know so much about her but I just didn't get to it. Now I'm still trying to 'accidently' meet her on the subway and have a second chance...

Even after all these years she means so much to me, eventhough nothing ""serious"" ever happened, and she probably couldn't care less about me. She's what has kept me going for the last 3 years. Without her, or atleast the idea of her, I would have ended up much worse. I just want her to be a real part of my life again. I don't want to be just a stranger from the past... I'm pathetic.",null,0,cdpu3uq,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1

lil-praying-mantis,"When I was in high school I had a douchey football player as my ""first boyfriend.""  He was a terrible person to me, I don't know why he even wanted me in the first place. I was never popular, just a plain wallflower. All he wanted was sexual favors and never got it, and when I found out he was asking out my cousins (who told me right away) he beat me for trying to leave him. Punched me in the face. Got away with it completely.

After him I had instant love at first sight with a boy in the hallway, our eyes locked and I was sold. I'd take shortcuts in the hallway to pass by him every day, i'd rush to my class in hopes that he was slow putting his books away... and I could've sworn he smiled at me. I found out he was an 11th grader who was a very nice boy; had this reputation of being friendly to everyone. He was perfect, but then I found out he football player and tried to force him out of my mind. How could I date another guy, let alone a football player again? 

I graduated high school miserable, especially because I never told him how I felt. He probably didn't even knew I existed. I met guys in college who I just couldn't get past being friends, nobody compared to this guy I never spoke to. I gave up and found him on facebook, flat out confessing my creepy love to him. It turns out he felt the same way the entire time, he creeped on me too and DID give me that cute smile. He wasn't a jerky football player, just a sweet guy who liked the sport enough to join the team.

We instantly became best friends and dated shortly after. Since he was a year younger I went to his prom and graduation, everything I wanted to do with him when I was a senior. Now I had my second chance. He's my absolute best friend, I go everywhere with him. He's exactly my other half who I've always wanted in a boyfriend, such a charming guy. He wants to marry me within the next few years and I'm looking forward to spending my entire life with him. Nobody in the world is better than him.

**TL;DR:** Got in an abusive relationship with a football player in H.S, fell for another guy who ended up being a football player too. I tried to force him out of my mind to prevent pain again, but caved in years later and confessed my love to him. Turns out he felt the same way, we lived happily ever after, and I love him to pieces.",null,0,cdpu4wm,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1

toridoubleyew,"At the time, I was in high school and living in the Middle East. This was back when FB still had proper groups I was a part of one, along with a about a hundred or so others. We made/shared old school memes, awful, scum of the internet type stuff. It started off being a way to pass the time during the summer, but soon I was hooked. It wasn't long until I started contributing and started online friendships. Since it was probably 2008/2009, MSN Messenger was still alive and kickin'. One day, out of pure boredom I started a conversation with him about what he would name his first child. She'd be called Mia. That started a friendship between him in Brazil (where he was for school) and myself in Kuwait. A year, exchanged pictures, and hours of late night chatting later my family moved back home to Seattle, Wa, USA. He'd been back home in Ontario, Canada. In January 2010 we admitted to each other that there were definitely feelings. In August 2010 we met for the first time at SeaTac Airport.

Fast foward to Novemeber 2013- we've been together ever since. I've had two trips to Canada, he's had three to WA. Unfortunately still living apart to to immigration/costs. Engaged since Decemeber 2012. I haven't seen him in person since August. I tell him I'll come for a visit in May but what he doesn't know is that I've planned to surprise him for Valentine's Day.

NowWithMoreChocolate,"Winter of 2008. I was 13 and had just joined the girls basketball team at school in order to impress my ex because I still liked him. On the way to the game, we passed by a performing arts school. The girl I was sitting next to on the bus, Olivia, commented that she went there and we got into a huge discussion about it, resulting in me deciding to join. 

Fast forward a few weeks to that day. Our first lesson was Dance and as I walked into the dance studio, I saw a guy of my age sitting on the windowsill on his own while everyone else was standing around the room, talking to their friends. I asked Olivia who he was and she said his name and said that he didn't really talk to anyone in the group.

Now, I suffer from slight social anxiety. To this day I still hate the thought of having to talk to someone I don't know unless they speak to me first. But something about this guy just drew me to him and before I knew it, I was standing it front of him, introducing myself and getting into a conversation about Doctor Who.

I liked him as more than a friend within 6 weeks of knowing him. He took about a year before having an epiphany into realizing that he liked me back. However we both only realized that the other one liked us back after 5 months of his epiphany when, in a game of truth or dare, he got asked whether or not he would date me if I asked him out.

We dated for a month. We broke up and I ended up dating his friend for almost 3 months. Broke up with him because I realised I still loved my SO. Got back together with him, dated for a year, broke up again. Got back together for a week, broke up again. It then took us 6 months to finally get back together, including a period of friends-with-benefits. We've now been together almost 2 years and I couldn't be happier.

The break ups were all my responsibility, me doubting my emotions and breaking up with him because I was scared. I am so thankful that he has always taken me back. He loves me more than I can comprehend at times and sometimes I can't believe how lucky I am to have found someone that has that much love for me. He looks at me as if I'm the universe itself. He'll do whatever it takes to make me laugh or to cheer me up even if he ends up looking like an idiot. He takes care of me when I'm sick and makes the best grilled cheese and ham sandwiches IN THE WORLD.

I'm now about to turn 19. I can't see a future where I don't end up marrying this guy and I wouldn't change that for the world.

Met on a relatively obscure ('urban') gay social networking site. Neither of us frequented it much and were both at the stage of being content single. My wife lived in the midwest and I on the east coast. We were never too far from each other, it seems.

Gwenji,"Get ready for a rock and roll love story to rule the others....

I lived in a big house when my roommates were moving out and I needed to find new ones. I searched for months to no avail when my roommates said they found 2 guys to take over. They were friends of theirs and music majors at the local university, which was perfect for me and I knew we would get along. The first time I met them they visited me at work and I fell in love quick and hard. 

His name was [DT], he looked like Jim Morrison, dressed like 80s Keith Richards and acted like axl rose. A few nights after we met, I came home and found DT on the porch, drinking whiskey, smoking a cigarette, van halen blasting through the window. He was wearing more jewelry than me, nose ring, vest but no shirt, tight white jeans and shit kicker boots with his feet propped up on the ledge around the porch. From that moment on, he's never left my mind.

We started hooking up immediately. We were young and ripe to party, and every weekend it was another Kurt and Courtney type escapade. We would make out on tables in bars, in our yard, no concern as to who saw what because we were in love. I'd go to his gigs and he'd make me feel like I was the only person he was playing for.

Come Christmas we had been officially dating about a month and I was late. Sure enough, I was pregnant, and we weren't ready at all. We decided we were going to give our son up for adoption pretty quickly, and that meant our lives had to change. No more parties, no more recklessness, and we crossed our fingers hoping there was more to our relationship than that. We got lucky, because there was most definitely more to us. Through the entire pregnancy and post adoption fog, DT was there. I became a part of his family, which was something I had never had before, and through their love and his I became a better person.

We eventually broke up, but it wasn't for lack of love. The adoption had changed us both and to be the best versions of ourselves we could be, we needed different things. We are still good friends, his family and I still speak and we will forever be a big part of each other's lives.",null,0,cdpud6g,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1

Lascondes,"I was in Canada (from Australia) and was talked into getting on a silly dress up pub craw on St Patrick's day, green everything. We ended up staying at the third pub because the lines were getting long. This guy super drunk walks past knocks into me and spills green beer on me, while trying to talk but he was to drunk to talk. His friend came over and apologized to me and sent his drunk friend home (the drunk friend lived in an apartment on top of the bar so it wasn't far), I ended up getting pretty drunk and making out with the friend. My friends wanted to leave and I wanted to go with them, so we said goodbye and I never expected to see him again. 

Two weeks later I was getting a coffee in ANOTHER CITY and here was this guy again, we exchanged numbers and he called a week later for dinner. We went to dinner but I was leaving to go to see my parents in Australia so I said I'd call him when I got back. He found out from my roommate my flight details and picked me up at the airport with flowers and a nice frosty bottle of water, I was pretty shocked and to honest a tiny bit concerned that he was a stalker. 

We spent a great summer together, we just had fun with each other ""hey I am going to teach you to fish this weekend"", ""We should really hold rifest in your backyard for weekend"", ""So I saw a deal to buy a kayak at the local pawn shop, wanna get it?"" (we sank the kayak as we packed too much food and wine, we are not smart people). 

Then one day after 6 months he said ""I think I should meet your parents"" I sort of said ""Well they are in Aus, it is kinda far"". We both had good paying jobs so we found tickets and made plans to go, snag was I hadn't told my parents about him so basically it was like ""Um Mum and Dad I have a boyfriend and we are coming to see you in three weeks p.s Can he stay at our house?"" That did not go down so great but after my parents met him they loved him. We came back to Canada and talked about if I was going to stay in Canada as I had an option to take another year contract so I did. From then on we have just been a stable couple, dated a couple of years, got married, move from one side of Canada to the other, then China then Chile. We just fit each other. We have made sacrifices for each other, career and family wise but we (fingers firmly crossed that we continue to do so) just completely ""get"" each other, we talk our options though, I think the success of our relationship  boils down to the fact that we each want the absolute best for each other.

So there is this Canadian girl I met 2 years ago at a science camp here in Australia. And I didn't just love her instantly at the time, I just thought of her as an extremely interesting girl, and loved spending time with her. After our short two weeks together, we were both crying when she had to leave, and I gave her a kiss on the forehead.

During this first week, my friend and myself all slept together on the same bed. So me and my awesome Canadian (let's just call her Felicity) got some great cuddle time over the next few days.

First day of college. Freshman keg party. The crowd parts and SLO-MO moment: who is that beautiful blonde?

Although a fairly confident fellow, I was usually the type to ""look cool and hope she notices me."" In other words, kinda shy. Not this time. I strode right up to her and we had a nice half-drunken chat. Chemistry but no action... and it turned out she left school a couple of days later (long story). I promptly forgot about her.

Fast forward to the first day of 2nd semester. I'm strolling the dorm, notice a door open, and WHOA! Who is that beautiful blonde? 

Again feeling preternaturally emboldened (seriously, with no other beauty have I felt so confident, so quickly), I walk right into her room as she's unpacking, put her bra on my head, and generally do anything I can to make her laugh. We become friends. Just friends. Both of us had SOs at that point.

Fast forward again, to sophomore year. We are good friends now. Flirting more and more openly as our respective relationships decay. I finally break up with my SO (she's already single), and turn to The Blonde for counsel and comfort. We make love. It's awesome. 

Still together 25 years later. Still going strong. Passionate, fun, loving... And I swear to you, she still looks like that gorgeous teenager! Carded nearly every time we order a drink.

He calls me and BEGS me to go to this Indian restaurant with him and some of his friends from uni. For whatever reason I actually agreed to go even though I wasn't hungry, and when we got there his friends were already eating. I sat down across from this guy who was stealing the show telling stories of his childhood to the group. Im really not one to be a ""maneater"" and had never really found someone super attractive before, nor do I ever think about random dudes in an intimate way if I don't know them. But with this guy, I was instantly interested- I started admiring the muscles under the shirt, the way he laughed, the sound of his voice, the way he ate (ok sounding creepy here), everything. I started to think about what kind of lover and boyfriend he would be. I really felt that I wanted to get to know him. 

When we left the restaurant I specifically remember being disappointed and literally thinking ""well I will probably never see this guy again"" which I have never in my life thought about somebody I have just met. About 2 months later I'm at my best friend's bday party (delicious, free food and booze) and for some reason, I'm completely restless and just want to go and hangout with the friend from Okcupid (no, not for sex, just for some professional potato-couching). After we meet up this friend from the Indian restaurant calls (who is actually more of a friend of the other people that were there) and asks my FWB if he wants to hangout, but doesn't know I'm there. We go and there's a full house playing poker and doing shisha, but the indian restaurant guy and i spent the entire night in the corner talking. The next morning my FWB is scrolling on FB and I see this weird name that I specifically point out (because its that weird) and he tells me that its the longform name of the indian restaurant guy and encouraged me to add him. I did, and we've been together ever since. 

We never fight, and if we disagree we talk about it, but it isnt often. We have a great time doing absolutely nothing. We can and do talk about everything under the sun. He's absolutely brilliant, kind, compassionate, a critical thinker (essential lol), and generous. The sex is unreal, I never thought it possible to be SO attracted to somebody. I kind of feel like this was in the cards for us all along :)",null,0,cdpw6wr,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1

thisis_willis,"Not a troubled youth myself, but I worked at a residential treatment centre for children with mental illnesses in the US. 
Almost all of the kids that were there ended up there because they had severe behavioural problems, that last time getting in trouble sort of made it come down to a decision between juvenile detention or a treatment facility. At least for those under 18 years old.  
It was apparent that many of these kids came from relatively normal families with parents who were just not capable of handling these kids, or didn't know where to start. (Before it turns into a blame-the-parents witch hunt, i will use a specific example: a few of the kids I came into contact with were born in Albania and left neglected in an orphanage for the first 2 years of their lives and were adopted by Americans.)  
Due to serious anxiety problems a lot of the kids had impulse problems, so if they got frustrated many would react the only way they could think, violently.  So a lot of kids ended up there as a result of acting out violently at home and school toward parents and other children.

He also decided that when we smoked pot together he was the only one allowed to roll or else he would literally wait for the joint to come to him, break it apart and re-roll. And he would only roll gi-fucking-gantic cigar sized blunts and he would do it using pipe tobacco with bits of hash interspersed throughout. Either that or he would roll all our pot at once and you'd have nothing to smoke later. So one night he rolls all my pot and we get unnecessarily high and go pick up our other friend from work who was fed up and all he wanted to do was relax and get stoned but we had no more pot and he was desperate so he starts rolling nasty, nasty, filthy disgusting pipe tobacco roaches from the ashtray into a big, sticky, smelly joint and smoked it. He nearly threw up, but he was determined. He was quiet and sort of green for 20 minutes in the back seat, and then he goes ""that was a mistake, I am really, really high."" then kept repeating ""wow I am really high"" in a calm, matter-of-fact tone once ever 5-10 minutes for like 2 hours. he had a great night",null,0,cdprqzg,1rpxpc,AskReddit,new,1

I'd been saying my now wife for about 6 months. And every year we have a white elephant party with horrible gifts. Gifts like 2 year old cookies that get re gifted every year.

My grandma, who is a prankster showed me this ring she had.. A giant plastic ruby looking heart. Knowing that my wife was meeting everyone for the first time, we thought we'd test her sense of humor.

So right in the middle of gift giving I told everyone to wait a second, dropped down on a knee and told my now wife ""Baby, I know we haven't been together long...."" And opened the box. She meanwhile is looking around trying to figure out who will save her from having to say no. Then she sees the ring and everyone laughed.

Apple devices are generally on the expensive side, whereas Android devices usually come cheaper.

Apple devices are basically unrepairable, most (not all) Androids are to a certain degree repairable.

If you want to code, Android is easy, free, and all it needs to start is any PC, MAC, or Linux machine. iPhone coding requires a Mac and a (don't know how expensive) commercial IDE.

The problem is, yes, there are many things that could have been changed by someone being forewarned. Many assassinations could be at least foreshadowed, if not completely avoided. The problem is that this completely undoes the reason why that message needed to be sent.

If JFK was assassinated, I could warn him that he was going to be shot while in Texas on that day. But then what would happen. Either he would go ahead with it anyway, and get shot, OR he would do something about it, and not get shot. If he decides to do something that makes him not get shot, how would I know that he was going to be shot that day?

I wouldn't, so I wouldn't sent the message when time got to this point.

Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole 
Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity 
The smell was unbearable As I unburied her
I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
down her throat, swallow 
Eyes glassy and vacant
body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
tonguing her rotted anus 
I need a live woman
to fill with my fluid
A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill
her body exceptional
she thought I was normal
but I wanted more 
I came blood inside of her
choking on the clot
gagging on the snot
gushing blood, from her mouth
bloody gel leaking out
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find

""Will I die of dehydration before someone finds me?""

It was after the 7th grade, and I was struggling to make friends (only some years later til I learn I have Aspergers). For one reason or another, I had been in the sand, and someone shaped it to be like I was a turtle. Details hazy. Over above me, there was a girl taking pictures. She had the most beautiful body and golden blonde hair, with eyes as grey as a valiant knight's armor. She also has the most adorable laugh and smile that would make your heart melt. I asked her for her name. I had never asked a girl for her name before (still haven't after her). Her name was Ally, short for Allyson. I swear I heard that name for the first time that day, even though it was the name of my neighbor's cat. He hung out that day, and many days after that during the summer. I spent some of the best days of my life that summer, and the summer after that. We never had time during school because she went to a private school and I went to a public school. For the first time, I felt like some girl understood me, was weird like me, yet wanted to be my friend. Never in my life had I had a female friend. She became my best friend and one of my only friends. But, I started to fall in love with her...

I ruined our friendship and maybe a possible relationship. She's dating a girl and I never felt so alone in my life (especially with me mom, who really understood me, just died of Ovarian Cancer). I fucked it all up and she won't even talk to me (her GF doesn't want her talking to me either). I wish so much to just have a second chance. Just fix all the mistakes I made.

 The woman was an elderly lady and had to take plenty of medications to keep her from getting ill. I had been walking my dog when I saw her down by the river walkway. She informed me that her room mate was acting oddly and that she needed her medications but did not want to go home alone. I went with her. The first thing I noticed were her room mates eyes when he opened the door, then the glass on the floor, and shortly after we were in the house that the walls were ripped wide open. 
 
 My dog whined and he kept us locked in that house for 4 hours, as he would casually take turns dragging a machete type knife across our throats. I was almost raped. I talked him into letting us leave. The Special Task force had to be used to remove him from the apartment after that. The house was trashed and she had no where to go. My mother is a lovely woman and insisted that we go with her. Both the old woman and myself moved into my family's home.

 The woman turned out to be not a kindly old woman but was a thief and an alcoholic. She stole thousands of dollars from my parents over the course of a year. Her son, who we had heard stories of, was released from prison and he ended up in our house. Turned out he had been incarcerated for murder. My sister became pregnant at 17 with HIS child, and then he got himself killed 6 months after my nephew was born in a confrontation during a drug deal. My sister was pregnant with her second child at the time. My sister is now a widow with 2 children.
 
 As a result of the money stolen by this woman, my parents lost their house because they were unable to make payments to the property/mortgage. They were forced into a small 2 bedroom apartment in the city. We lost everything. Our home. Our innocence and our trust.

MissFrizzel,"Ready for a long one reddit? Just a bit of back ground first to make sense of everything. 
 
Since the age of 8 I've been dealing with horrible depression. It runs pretty heavily in my genes so I just so happen to inherit it (yay for me). Anyways I have been on and off medication my whole life (I'm 21 now, female btw) and in about grade 9 it got to it's absolute worst. I couldn't get out of bed in the mornings, I basically stopped going to school. I had started self harming very young (10) and it just continued to get worse and worse.  

 I was hanging out with the wrong crowd and I basically didn't give a shit about anything and thought I was invincible. Anyways I happen to get in a fight at school with another girl when I was in grade 10 (I still cringe thinking about it) and her mother pressed charges against me. I should tell you that I come from a pretty good family but this little incident was too much for them to take. 
 
My siblings pretty much stopped talking to me all together, I was facing assault charges and I was failing in school and I had stopped all contact with my friends. I was in pretty rough shape, and I pretty much knew that I wouldn't be around much longer as suicide seemed like the only escape. 

If it weren't for my parents unconditional love and support I wouldn't have made it. I figured I was at a fork in the road and I could continue down the path of destruction or I can make a change. Thank God I decided to change. I found an antidepressant that worked for me (finally) and that pretty much kick started my brand new awesome life! I'm currently in uni and have an A average, my relationship with my siblings is wonderful and I am as happy as a clam! It still blows my mind to think that five years ago I was pretty much ready to leave this earth, and I didn't even know how beautiful life can be. 

That single fight changed the course of my life, and I am so thankful for that.

Her and I had our little spats, but I never thought I would become one of those people she chased out of her life and repeatedly tried to reel back in.

",null,0,cdptsvx,1rpwpk,AskReddit,new,3
eodiv,"I've had several but the most recent happened just two days ago.  
  
I was married but ended up separating from my wife due to my own substance abuse issues (mainly alcohol). At one point during the separation, we didn't talk at all for a good 2 months.  During that time, I landed a great job, was able to buy a brand new car and was really turning things around.  Then one day, she called me and said she wanted to meet up.  So we met at an iHOP for breakfast.  It was August and she was wearing a hoodie, which I found odd.  After we sat down, she proceeded to tell me that she wanted to tell me about what she had been doing.  It turns out she had started using and became addicted to heroin.  One night, she overdosed and was found by a neighbor unconscious on the floor.  They called 911.  An ambulance and police came and the police searched her apartment, finding heroin and paraphernalia. After she was released from the hospital, she was taken to jail and charged.  Her parents, who were extremely well off, got her a good attorney and she pled out, getting only probation and an order to attend outpatient rehab.  
  
Needless to say, I was upset and disappointed about all of this.  We had done other substances together in the past but we had an agreement that cocaine and heroin were the two things we would never do because of how dangerous they are.  
  
About two months into her probation and rehab, she was tested randomly at rehab (I've been, they pick one person at random each session - which occur every other day, three times a week - and test them) and she pissed dirty for heroin.  She was taken back to jail, bonded out and went back to court.  Her lawyer negotiated a deal to keep her out of jail but requiring her to attend a 30 day inpatient rehab facility.  
 
During all of this, she (pressured by her parents) decided our marriage was irreparable, and we got divorced in January of 2012.  We still kept in touch though.  The rehab seemed to do her good at first but once she really got clean, about half way through it, she turned into a huge asshole.  She would call me or text me and say degrading things.  Eventually, she stopped and then I never heard from her again.  
  
Due to the divorce and my own mental health issues, I was struggling worse than ever with substance abuse.  I was drinking heavily every day and abusing Adderall and Klonopin.  Last June, under the influence of a lot of alcohol and Klonopin, I lost my balance and fell through a plate glass topped coffee table.  The glass shattered and a large piece lodged itself near my shoulder and, as I learned at the hospital, nicked my caroted artery.  I had to call 911 and was rushed to the hospital where I received 46 stitches and was told that if the glass had gone in a half an inch further up, I possibly would have bled to death.  Just the next month last July,  I was hospitalized after I began hearing things due to being up for 3 days straight on Adderall (amphetamine psychosis, basically) and probated for 9 days.  I had to attend a court hearing and basically convince a judge that I was capable of taking care of myself and living on my own.  I bullshitted my way through it and was released from the hospital, got on medication for bipolar disorder and began seeing a social worker/counselor twice a month.  I stayed clean for awhile and would text my ex to let her know how I was doing but never got any response.  It pissed me off.  
  
A few months ago I began drinking again, as well as abusing Adderall and Klonopin and smoking weed and I could see myself sinking fast.  A couple of weeks ago, after talking to my parents, I decided I needed help and checked myself into the emergency room, attempting to be admitted to the psych ward or referred to a rehab facility.  They refused to do either because I was drunk as hell and released me instead after keeping me for about 4 hours and giving me IV fluids to re-hydrate me.  When I got home, I texted my ex and told her that I was planning on checking myself into a rehab facility. Again, no response. I figured she would have been proud of me for doing the right thing.  
  
Two nights ago, I found out why she hadn't been responding.  
  
I looked her up on Facebook, as I knew she had an account but nothing came up for her name.  I found that strange.  So I Googled her name and the first result was an obituary. She died from a heroin overdose in her parents basement in October of last year.  Even though we were divorced, I never stopped loving her so I pretty much lost it and began crying.  
  
After regaining my composure, it hit me.  While I may not be doing heroin, the Adderall and Klonopin abuse could be just as dangerous.  I could take too many of one or a lethal combination of the two and die and since I live alone, no one would find me for days.  As much as I abuse them, I have been extremely lucky up until this point even though I've been put on a 72 hour hold in the hospital twice (the one I mentioned previously and prior to that in 2005) for overdosing on Adderall and flipping out.  
  
So I took both pill bottles into the bathroom and flushed the contents of them down the toilet.  Today, I called my doctor who has been prescribing them to me and admitted what I have been doing and asked him to stop prescribing them to me.  I have resolved to never drink or smoke weed ever again and I'm researching Narcotics Anonymous meetings that are close to my house and I will start attending them at least once a week.  
  
I'm absolutely heartbroken over my ex wife's death.  She was only 30 years old, had moved back in with her family and seemed like she was on a good road to recovery.  Part of me is mad that noone called and told me that she passed.  It would've been fine if they didn't want me at the funeral but a phone call would've been nice.  Yes, we were divorced but we were together for almost 11 years.  We started dating when she was 19.  I was a huge part of her life.  When I told my parents about this yesterday, they were shocked that noone called me.  Another part of me is upset because she had told me, when we met up for breakfast after she OD'ed, that she started doing heroin because I was doing so well at the time and she ""felt like she deserved to feel good too.""  In a roundabout way, blaming me.  I'm sure she shared that with her parents, who never liked me to begin with, so I wonder if they hold even more of a grudge against me in light of her death.  I thought for an hour straight earlier today about calling them but after talking to my dad, I have decided against it.  I'm not going to get anything out of it and it's only going to upset them and open up the wound I'm sure they have and probably still are working extremely hard to heal. I do know where she is buried though and this weekend I am going to go buy some flowers and place them on her grave with a little note so that anyone who comes to visit her will know I was there. 
  
I don't know what I'm going to do to cope with her death but I do know that I will never use drugs or alcohol again.  If she couldn't overcome her addiction and died as a result of it, I could just as easily suffer the same fate.  I realize this is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.  I'm going to need support and I may slip up but  I don't want to die.  Despite my drug and alcohol abuse, life has been going really well for me lately.  The medication I take for Bipolar disorder is working well and it's basically in remission.  I don't get hyper manic like I used to.  I don't always think people are talking bad about me and I'm not constantly paranoid.  I've turned into a pretty friendly, outgoing, normal person.  On the surface, at least.  After being unemployed for over a year, I've landed a great new job that pays well and I enjoy and have started dating a cool, intelligent and beautiful girl.  In addition to not wanting to die, I don't want to risk losing any or all of those things just so I can get high.  
  
Drugs and alcohol have cost me a $50,000 a year job, my aforementioned new car, almost all of my friends, my marriage and have landed me in the hospital numerous times.  Yet I basically flipped fate a big ol' middle finger and kept at it.  Now that I know drugs have taken the person that I was closer to than anyone ever in my life, my eyes have finally been opened. I'm **done**.  I wish I would've known sooner and had this eye opening experience a year ago but, despite the sadness I'm feeling right now, I'm filled with the hope of having a happy, healthy and substance free future.
  
TL;DR - I abuse drugs, found out my ex wife died of a heroin overdose, threw all my drugs away and have resolved to never use again.",null,2,cdpve67,1rpwpk,AskReddit,new,5
cornflakez,"Every day for 6 years I suffered from migraines, insomnia, heart palpitations, stomach pain, nausea, panic attacks, crippling depression, and a slowly degenerating spine.  The symptoms were all treated by individual doctors, none of which put together the full picture.  My primary diagnosis?  Bipolar disorder.

Eventually, my primary care doctor found a [benign tumor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_hyperparathyroidism) and related all of my symptoms to the condition.  It seemed impossible.  How could one tiny tumor cause so many issues?  At that point, I was on a high dose of anti-psychotic medications, sleeping up to 14 hours a day.  My life was a haze of naps and doctor's appointments.  I had given up on the possibility of a future that included graduating from a university or raising a family.  

The conversation with the pre-op nurse went like this:

Nurse: ""Have you ever been diagnosed with bipolar disorder or severe depression?""

Me: ""Yes, Bipolar disorder.""

Nurse: ""Mood swings?  Insomnia?  Severe depression?""

Me: ""Unfortunately""

Nurse: ""That will go away when the surgery is done.""

Me: &lt;long pause&gt; ""...What?  Really?""

Nurse: ""Yes, most people feel better in a few months.""

Me: ""Can you please say that one more time?""

She did.  I silently cried through the rest of the call.  It was the end to a nightmare.

Today I am off of all of the medications and in good health.  I am also back in college.  My dreams are possible again, and it feels amazing.

TLDR: The day a doctor changed my diagnosis from ""crazy"" to ""cured.""

But my grandma brought a full bottle of 1873-whatever and had a little too much since he wouldn't drink. She told me later she felt sick and wants to go home. I wouldn't only call her dizzy, she was pretty drunk actually (lady of 80 years). When my grandpa drove her bacl home, she even fell down in the grass of their garden and couldn't stand up. I felt terrible for being amused.",null,1,cdpnkoe,1rpwjq,AskReddit,new,15

alyssavee,"Christmas Eve has always been a big deal on my mom's side of the family, and we've all celebrated it together since 1986, with everyone taking turns each year on who is going to have it at their house.

My mom's eldest sister decided it was her turn to host this shit show (my mom has the most disorganized family on planet earth), and stick all of us, roughly 45 people, in her basement. My dad and I usually become wall flowers, watching what shenanigans happen, and a few did happen that night:

-My brother was forced to play Santa Clause by my aunt for her grand children. When he initially refused, she accused him of being the ruin of these children's Christmas, and she was **not** quiet about it. He eventually gave in which produced [this](http://i.imgur.com/5urwgkz.jpg) lovely photograph

-My cousin's wife (who is the size of a Cornish pixie) got profusely drunk and got into a very loud argument with my aunt because she wanted to hold a baby, while wasted, in five and a half inch heels.

There was more, both at that Christmas Eve as well as years past. I'm so happy no body wanted to host it this year, and we're all doing our own thing. Those people give me nothing but a migraine. ",null,4,cdpr30d,1rpwjq,AskReddit,new,12

DraperWhite,"Two of my cousins (adult women in their 30's-40's) got into a brawl and it all started because some soda was spilled on the floor.


My two cousins (let's call them Maria and June) each have kids. Maria has a son ""john"" who at that time was 2, maybe 3 years old. June has three kids that ranged from 7 to 13. One night our family got together and had dinner at my aunts house. June's middle son Ray was pouring soda for Maria's son in a cup. John moved the cup, soda spilled on the floor and started laughing. Ray got upset and screamed at him. Maria didn't take to kindly to that, told him to STFU and to pour him the soda. Ray started complaining and whining which angered Maria and she slapped him upside his head. June got upset and started arguing with Maria. 2 minutes later June goes into the kitchen and Maria sits on the couch. It seems the drama had passed when all of a sudden this plastic container with beans goes flying across the room and it strikes Maria. It. Was. On. Shit got real and they started hitting each other. It moved from the dining room to the kitchen back to the dining room. June's eldest daughter was hitting Maris from the back which prompted another female cousin of mine who was a year older to grab her and beat the living shit out of her.

After the mayhem there was food every where, no one ate with the exception of one of my cousins who sat in a corner during the fight and gingerly enjoyed his meal. ",null,3,cdps06l,1rpwjq,AskReddit,new,8
De4con,"My dad picked me up on wednesday night after work to go to my aunt's house and have thanksgiving dinner a day early since we'd all be meeting at my grandparents' assisted living place for their excellent buffet. It was a really good night, my brother wasn't able to make it that night due to working, but we met up afterward and had a couple beers, my mom had one later when we came back to my parents' place. My dad did nothing but bitch and moan, then exploded at me the next morning since he was kept up past his bed time, and proceeded to throw a tantrum that made my mom refuse to come to thanksgiving lunch. My dad drove by himself, my brother and I brought the gifts my mom and I got the night before on the way home, and everyone enjoyed themselves.  My dad left a short while after the meal instead of staying as long as everyone else, my brother and I were still around and being family, and that was that. My mom's still pissed at my dad for how he treated my brother and I and how he totally fucked up a wonderful family thanksgiving because of his bitchy attitude and how he can't ever let anything go, and my brother and I grew closer with family after so long of us feeling and thinking that we were always on the outside of them because of our dad's relationship with his family.

**tl;dr** - Dad's an asshole, everyone's pissed at him for his bad attitude, the rest of the family gets closer since he opted out of it. The pre-thanksgiving dinner the night before was great, but the thanksgiving lunch the next day was also good even though my mom didn't show because my dad's an asshole.

PrincessMaruchan,"I had an uncle that everyone was always telling to lose weight for his health. He and my aunt had just had a newborn boy about 3 weeks before and he was carrying the newborn. It was Christmas Eve so we were all in my grandmother's living room and there was a chair in front of the TV. He sat down on the wooden chair, it broke, he fell back and hit his head. The TV was broken and his head was bleeding profusely. The baby was okay, but the noise scared him and he cried all night.

Of course, that same year New Year's Eve was spent at our ranch with the extended family. Same uncle decided to pop some fireworks...near the hay bales. It might have been fine had it been the smaller fireworks, But no. This man had to tie multiple medium sized fireworks together and lighted them with a Sparkler.

Laugh_With_Me,"I had just moved out. I was renting a furnished room from a lady my mother had found for me. What I did not know was that although I was paying for the room, my mother had her own key and was in constant communication with the homeowner. The homeowner had seen fit not to tell me, either.

I was invited back for Thanksgiving, but arrived to find my bed destroyed. I don't mean packed away or sold or something. My sister had thrown my mattress into a pool so I ""could never return."" So I was not in the best of moods when I had to go to sleep the night before Thanksgiving on the floor. I was in a worse mood when I woke up in an empty house to a ringing phone.

My mother proceeded to yell at me about the state of my apartment and the dustbunnies she'd found while moving my stuff. I asked her why she was at my apartment and also why she was moving my things.

She was moving me back in. The homeowner had decided to sell the house and move literally days after I'd moved in, but had never bothered to tell me.  I looked around for my car keys in the hopes of intervening, but she snapped at me that she'd had my sister take it so they could carry all my things back in one trip with the two cars. While I was trying to wrap my head around what was happening, she proceeded to yell at me for not being there to help move my things.

That's right. She'd intentionally hidden from me that the owner of the room I was renting was about to move away, tricked me into ""visiting"" with no intention of letting me leave, taken my car while I slept, had snuck out to move all my things back in without my knowledge, and was now screaming at me for not being there to help.

Ready, set, grab... Now note this is last period and you can easily stay after school, so we had to be sneaky. Upon grabbing her bag we emptied all of its inventory around the room. Carefully hiding her iPhone, make up and multiple over nick naks. Then we placed her bag back and carried on with our work.

We then left Biology with her staying behind trying to find her stuff, I heard she stayed around an hour behind trying to search.

My high school guidance counselor (there was only one) was a complete fucking idiot, and actually told everyone not to bother with college because we ""couldn't afford it.""  He brought military recruiters on campus constantly, with the strong implication that that would be our only ticket out of town, but we never had (nor attended) ONE college fair.  Even the ""career fairs"" were an absolute joke -- I swear to God, the only people who showed up to those things were the local merchants, manicurists, etc.  No professionals whatsoever.

Thankfully, one of the teachers finally broke down and organized an assembly regarding financial aid.  We heard words like ""Pell grant"" and ""FAFSA"" for the first time in our lives.  We were absolutely stunned; it was all we talked about for weeks.  That was absolutely the reason that many of us went to college, and I will be forever grateful.

I studied Elementary Education, but that didn't work out for me as there are STILL no jobs in my area to this day.  I got a job at a private company in the education industry, and I'm very happy there.  My husband also grew up poor, and he studied Biology.

At the end of the semester I realized what I'd done and spoke with the professor. He told me the only way I'd pass was if I did every programming assignment from the semester coursework, did all of the components of the midterm project that had been broken into team projects, and passed the final exam.

I marathon'd the next four days. In some places I made strategic decisions to trade a few of the more elegant loops and recursious in favor of sleeping in fifteen minute blocks. My girlfriend at the time, a true rockstar, would type out repetitive lines for me while I slept.  That last day I turned it all in (ugly though it was), including having put together all the project components and compiled, and I managed to ace the final exam.

leak_proof,"I was about 10 years old. Father died suddenly  a few years before, which was a trigger for an older brother's schizophrenia. One day, our mother was working, he had a troubling episode. He decided to to kill us. Me with his hands, and then him with a knife. I struggled to to get away. He kept swinging with his hands, then the knife. Fuck, the soulless anger in his eyes is what will be forever burned into my mind. I finally get a bit of an upper hand when I started to swing a bat. I was able to get him out of the house until the cops could show up.  After they nearly kill him in the struggle they take him away. I remember a chaotic scene that felt like it took an eternity to play out, but was more startled by hoe quickly all that chaos descended into silence, then into me crying in the kitchen, alone, for while. After are bit I realized, well I don't remember what I realized. I stopped crying and just got up. Cleaned the house up a little. Then walked over to a friend's house. We played some video games (atari 2600 and pitfall for those in r/gaming) and I listened to him complain about the KD his mom made not being cheesy enough.  I lost faith that day. Faith in a lot of things.

EDIT: Grammar and spelling.

EDIT 2: AFTERMATH: My mother never really knew what went on that day, as I never really told her. She did well, and despite all that crap raised the rest of us, got us through university and one to our lives. My brother in the story ended up institutionalized after this and bounced in and out of hospitals, switched between his meds and heroin, he finally lost his battle with addiction either accidental or intentional a few years ago when they found him OD'd. I lost one brother to suicide a few years after the death of my father because he couldn't handle the switch from our great family life one day to schizophrenia fueled chaos the next. 

That day changed me but I seemed to have turn out relativity fine.  Finished university, found and married a great woman and have a chain of successful small business that keep me busy. No kids, too afraid to pass along the crazy gene but have a noisy house full of animals. I work hard, have someone that loves and am I wake up day a little happier than the last.

This makes it almost impossible for us to get a rent...

Man, you are not supposed to leave a couple with a baby in the street...we haven't missed any rent payment or anything else...

Things are hard, and seem that they are going to get harder...We'll solve this, surely, but I hate that we are so stressed out...life isn't fair...we where really good tenants, we took care of the garden and keep everything beautifully organized in the house

745pm,"I used to think life was unfair: I was born in a nuclear family in the true church of God, while others struggled in unbelief.  Other kids had divorced parents (or, oh my god, just a single parent holy shit, poor kids with their whore parents).  I got to have the Spirit and was baptized at eight, other kids didn't get my blessings.  I once mentioned this to my mom: that I seemed unfairly advantaged.  She told me I'd suffer for my beliefs and be persecuted.  

Now I look back and laugh and laugh and laugh, while smoking my weed and wearing my heathen sleeveless shirts.  I think of that smug little bastard, convinced she had the one truth, and I feel humor and sorrow and rage and sometimes just exhaustion.  Because we can't truly evaluate whether life is fair or unfair, not while we're living it.  Not when our perspectives are so skewed.  ",null,0,cdpq8iq,1rpv5h,AskReddit,new,2
whatsthatinmyfridge,"When I was 16 years old. I grew up without a father, and my only father figure walked out of my life when I was 8. Had a terrible relationship with my mom, and was generally just very unloved. Managed to convince myself that none of it bothered me, until one summer it all came to the surface and I couldn't push it down anymore. I knew nothing about my father, and suddenly I wanted nothing more than to find out who he was and why he wasn't with me. I had this picture of him in my head as this really great guy who was just waiting for me to reach out to him. After a lot of fighting and months of begging for information, my mom finally told me the truth: that he walked out on her before I was born, got married, moved out of state and told her to never let me contact him because I was just a mistake that he wanted to forget. I was crushed. I decided to try and contact my father figure, who I hadn't seen in 8 years. Found out he had turned into a wife beating son of a bitch who I was better off without. After that, I tried to reach out to the people around me for some source of comfort, but no one cared. My friends were all too selfish and immature to even try to help, and my mom was emotionally unavailable and actually became very verbally abusive during that time. I remember sitting on a curb near my house at 3 am one summer night, realizing I had no one who really loved me and everyone had walked out on me even though I had done nothing to deserve it.

I should have known something was up when she assumed we were moving in the moment we brought up the idea. Looking back on it she was really forceful about us living together. She said she hated a dirty house, didnt party, didnt drink, blah blah and all that. On paper she sounded great. (Im a college student and she has been out of highschool for a few years but decided on an assistant manager job at arbys) Every night she would party and drink with lots of people till 6 am. The house was always trashed! Like her clothes and underwear spread about the living room, tons of actual trash and food wrappers scattered around the house. Her room had about 2 feet of clothes and garbage. She NEVER cleaned and the bathroom looked atrocious when she got done with it. She fucked this guy all over the place, leaving me locked out of the bathroom and even apartment for hours at a time. Once, at 3 am, she burst into my room because she wanted to introduce me to the people she met in the parking lot of a bar! after a few months of this (and my grades suffering from lack of sleep and study time) I pleaded with my landlords, showed them pictures, invited them over, and got my friends to verify that this chick was a nightmare. I was willing to rent a one bedroom from them (they said I couldnt afford it though....). When she caught wind that I was trying to move out she started getting really bitchy. Telling the landlords I was breaking things, preventing her from eating by destroying the stove (I took the top off to clean it), and then full on attacked me one night. The cops where called.

Fast forward a year, Im living with 2 new people after having got away from that psycho after she attacked me. My 2 roommates are getting ready to move out forcing me to either find a new roommate or leave as well. So I chose to leave. My ,previously nice, landlords refuse to send me my deposite for 4 months.

You also have to consider the changes in her behaviour.  If you are indeed the catalyst for her quitting, and she decides to stop solely because of you, you can expect to get a fair amount of stress / quitter-rage taken out on you.

The guy and his girlfriend disappeared and soonafter we heard loud sex noises, moaning, headboard slamming against wall, etc. The blonde and I laughed about it and she put her hand on my leg and said ""They sound like they're having fun...I'm jealous"".

I nervously took her hand off my leg and said yea it was weird and I should probably get to bed, anyway.

So, I live literally right next door but she gets up and asks if she can walk me home and I was like ""sure"" and then she follows me in and is sitting on my bed undressing while I brush my teeth, etc. She is in her bra and panties laying on my bed -- it's a twin-size (small) bed so I climb over her and squish myself against the wall and fall asleep.

Even drunk, I don't know what the fuck I was or wasn't thinking. Could I have been THAT drunk, tired, and oblivious? The thing is that the girl was pretty damn cute AND hot but I wasn't dating her and she was a friend so I somehow didn't process all of the obvious signals. I remember having a pretty bad hangover the next morning and driving her back to her place and as she was getting out she sorta grabbed my head and pulled me in for a kiss on the cheek and told me I was a nice guy.

I did find out later that she was quite promiscuous so she was probably just hoping for another notch on her headboard but goddamn did I miss out. I tell myself she probably had an STD to make it seem like I dodged a bullet instead of just a wild night of hot sex. I still have a picture of all four of us at the club/bar that night.",null,5,cdpo6tn,1rpufd,AskReddit,new,20

LovetoGoRound,"TL;DR Was in a long distance relationship and convinced myself that when he came back/sex would make magic would happen. I noped the hell out of there at the last possible moment. 




A few months before he came back he started to stop communicating with me. Our Skype's were him playing video games and answering my conversations attempts with one word answers or nods...""So it's okay"" I thought, ""when we see each other, it will be great."" 


Then it started to weigh on me. I was sending him care packages, letters, doing strip/shower teases, texting/calling/Skyping him first, no effort on his side. I talked to him and asked if he could send me a letter. He said no. He didn't have the money. I thought that was werid...he was living with his aunt a few states away... ""It's all good."" I thought, ""I suppose I understand,""


A little bit more times goes by and I talk to him about it again. I told him I wasn't happy. He wasn't doing anything for me, no texts no calls, no letters, wouldn't let me get to know his aunt or cousins. ( By now I had given up on our Skype conversations, it was now just two hours of silence everyday.) and I was feeling like I was single and showing affection to a stranger. He told me I was being selfish, that I knew how he felt. ""No problem."" I thought, ""I am being selfish. Just wait.""


About a month before he came back I was at my wits end. I was so done I had his stuff already packed. I told him I wasn't happy again. I was sorry, but wanted it to end. He yelled at me through text and Skype for hours. He told me if I had a problem, I should've talked to him about it. That I was just 'giving up' on our relationship/not trying hard enough. That I didn't love him. He asked who the other guy was, he said he 'knew' I was cheating. ""I'm overreacting,"" I thought. ""I wasn't trying enough. When he comes up it will be magical"" We agreed to go on a break until he came back.


During that month, I felt so relaxed. I thought it was just because I was working myself up. When he came back...I felt nothing.At all. I thought, ""It would come back. Just wait."" Then when I was on my back, naked, I looked up at him. He wasn't even wearing a condom. He had said he didn't want it the first time and that it didn't matter, we were going to be together forever. 


Then it snapped into place in my mind. That he wasn't wearing a condom. That I didn't want to risk having a kid with him. That he wasn't showing any affection until he got to touch me physically. That he wouldn't listen to me. That I wasn't in love with him anymore, etc..... All the common sense I should have had before was overwhelming.

I was a delusional piece of shit.  I should have been murdered on the spot.  Looking back, I cannot believe how fucking stupid I was.  On a good day, I am maybe a low 3.  What the fuck was I expecting?

Honestly, it ended up working out quite well.  I would feel shitty knowing that some fatty woke up regretting how stupid she was.

I had a second chance at age 24.  Regular girl shows interest.   I did nothing.  Later learned that everyone around told her how stupid she was and asked her why she would want to fuck an ugly piece of shit loser like me.  I think that this was another situation where my stopping it prevented someone from really fucking up their life.

Two opportunities in 30 years is not great, but it could possibly be worse.  The real problem is that ugly people do not like other ugly people.

AdminWhore,"I grew up in East Central Florida near the beach. We saw tourists all the time and usually didn't think much of them. They were important to our local economy so we always treated them well while making fun of them behind their backs.

I was in my early twenties heading home from work when I saw a station wagon broken down on the highway at the end of my street. I lived a few houses down so I parked in my driveway and walked back to the highway where the broken car was parked. It was a couple in their early 30s and two children 8 and 10 years old. The car had a blown radiator hose that the guy had tried fixing with duct tape but it was still leaking. I talked with them for a while and learned they were from the Chicago area on vacation heading to Miami to visit family.

It was getting late on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't a very nice neighborhood so I helped Luis push the car down the street to my driveway and invited them in. Isabella was a little nervous at first because I had long hair and a beard and was still dirty from work (she told me that later). They came inside and my house was clean and comfortable. They were going to call a taxi and go to a motel until the morning when the parts stores opened. I invited them to stay in my guest room and offered to drive them to the parts store in the morning.  They were polite and tried to refuse saying it was too much but I insisted and they gladly accepted. They were already tired and hungry.

We ordered some pizzas and I brought out some cold beer. The kids went to sleep in the guest room and I let Luis and Bella have my bed while I bunked on the couch. In the morning we fixed the car and they were on their way. I really liked them but I didn't think I would ever hear from them again. I was wrong.

This was 25 years ago and I still talk to them regularly. They have sent me Christmas cards every year. We exchanged letters and later emails and facebook over the years.  They have returned to Florida and always stop and visit. My wife loves them too and we are like family. The children have always called me Uncle AdminWhore and I have been to their graduations and weddings. Luis' mom, wouldn't leave Florida to be near her children in Chicago but we did talk her into moving up the cost from Miami. She lived in a retirement home in my town until she died. I visited her and she taught me to speak Spanish, she was Cuban. 

tl;dr a little kindness to strangers leads to lifelong family friendship.",null,0,cdpphpl,1rpu1g,AskReddit,new,2

TDot1980,"I'm sure lots of people will say it, but coffee. Specifically, coffee beans that are being ground, and coffee that is brewing. Bonus points if it's a frosty winter Saturday morning and the wood stove is on. 

Related to that: cedar. No smell reminds me of home more than that. I recently split a whole bunch of cedar kindling for the aforementioned wood stove and it was slightly damp - bringing it inside to dry out instantly filled the whole house with that awesome scent.
