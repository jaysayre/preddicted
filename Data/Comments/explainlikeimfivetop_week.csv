QuickSpore,"Because ""realism"" wasn't necessarily the goal. If you look at medieval European Christian art, one thing you will notice is that individuals are all different sizes. Why? The Romans and Greeks were capable of using perspective. And so were the Italian renaissance painters. So why would a 10th century painter screw up and paint a picture where Christ is twice the size of the Apostles and four times the size of some Roman guard. The answer in this case was because the painter wouldn't be trying to recreate a realistic rendition of the scene. He would be trying to create an interpretive version of the scene. And in that time and place, the size of a person represents power and majesty of the individual.

It is a relatively rare idea that art is supposed to be a reproduction of the world as it is. Even today I would say various forms of abstract and impressionist art are more common than ""realistic"" art.

And that was true historically as well. We have Egyptian art both statues and drawn that is petty realistic. But most the art we see from Egypt isn't. Why? Because it was traditional. There was all sorts of meaning attached to various poses and styles. Left foot forward meant one thing, right foot another. One eye visible also meant something different than two eyes visible. So following that convention communicates meaning to the viewer.

And as a final thought, most artists weren't very good. Professional artists have been fairly rare in history. It is significant that we can name a lot of the painters who were working in Italy in the 1400s. There weren't that many. A lot of the art we have from Egypt and the like were done by untrained priests and the like. If you were to bury all the ""art"" produced this year, most of it would be pictionary style doodles.

Schnutzel,"**Stack overflow**

Whenever you call a function, memory for that function is allocated in a place called the call stack. When the function completes its run, that memory is released. A stack overflow happens if too many functions are called, and there's not enough room in the stack (which has a hard size limit) to allocate more memory.

How can this happen? Look at the following code for example:

    int foo() {
        return foo();
    }

When you execute foo() for the first time, memory for it is allocated on the stack. But then the function calls itself - so memory is allocated again. The 2nd invocation of the function calls itself a 3rd time - and so on, to infinity (and beyond). Eventually the stack will run out of memory and the program will crash.",null,3,cdnm8mi,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,18
Schnutzel,"**Buffer overflow**

A buffer overflow when you try to write data into a buffer (an array), and the data exceeds the size of the array. For example:

    char buffer[8];
    scanf(""%s"", buffer);

The function scanf reads a string from the user into the buffer, which is 8 bytes long. However, scanf doesn't limit how many characters will be read - it will read until it's done (until a whitespace character is reached). So what happens if the user enters ""helloworld""? The first 8 bytes are written into the buffer, but the rest are written just outside the boundaries of the array.

Now one of three things can happen:

1. The overwritten memory can be unimportant, and nothing bad will happen (for example, the memory could have been used previously in the function but not anymore).
2. The program is not allowed to write to this memory, so it will report an error (and probably crash).
3. The worst case is that the memory being overwritten is important, but the program continues running. This allows the user to change parts of the memory they shouldn't normally have access to, which is a security flaw (thanks /u/BrQQQ for expanding on this!).",null,3,cdnmsqz,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

MEaster,"Buffer Overflow: Any random piece of data has a certain size. For example, an ASCII character is 1 byte. So if you have a string of 10 characters, you would need 10 bytes to store it. A buffer overflow would be when you write data past the end of this string overwriting other data.

Stack overflows are a bit more complicated. Firstly, a stack is a way of storing a list of data. It's what's known as a last-in-first-out list. Basically think of it as a stack of plates. You add data to the list by putting it on top of the stack, and then remove data by taking it off the top.

Another thing to explain is that in programming your code will generally be separated into subroutines. A subroutine will generally be things you want to do multiple times without having to rewrite it every time.

When a program enters a subroutine, it needs to keep track of where it came from so it can return. It does this by adding the current address to the stack before entering the subroutine. If you keep going into subroutines without returning the stack gets bigger.

In an operating system such as Windows, I believe each program has its own stack of limited size. If the operating system detects that the stack is full when the program tries to add something to it, then it will halt the program with a ""stack overflow"" error to prevent the program from causing problems.",null,1,cdnmnhf,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
RandomRobot,"The two can be combined or independent, depending on the context. A buffer overflow is very common in the C/C++ languages. It just means that you try to fit more data into a buffer than what it can holds. In those languages, you can access memory directly, so a string can be shown as 

    char myString[10];

If you try to copy more than 10 chars into it, then it will overflow. A stack overflow means that the data was on the stack when it overflowed, like in the previous example. However if you dynamically allocate memory, that memory will be on the heap, a large chunk of RAM that your program has access to. 

    char* myString = new char[10];

This string will be stored on the heap so when you overflow it, it will not be a stack overflow but a heap overflow, which is handled slightly differently by the program.

Overflowing the stack is especially bad since the program stores a lot of useful addresses on the stack, such as return addresses. If you carefully craft your 10+x chars, then you can potentially control the execution of the program. If your buffer was large enough, say... char[1000], then you could embed assembly code in the buffer and control the return address to execute the buffer. Those assembly codes are usually called shellcodes, because what an attacker want(ed, back in the days), was to get a shell, or a command line to the infected computer. There are whole books dedicated to this, how to write them and how to detect them.

Another way to generate a stack overflow is to call too many functions. The stack is a limited place, with around 1M (depending on tons of factors, such as your OS, your language, your compiler...). Recursion is a common mistake to generate a stack overflow like this.

    void func(){
      func();
    }

Those kinds of overflow are not as dangerous as the previous ones, first because they are easy to detect, even by just reading the code. The first execution will also crash fast. Secondly, the first kind of buffer overflow is more tricky to detect and an overflown buffer might not cause any problem to the execution of the program, while leading an attacker to complete control of your machine.

There is a very good tutorial about buffer overflows and how to execute arbitrary code with it called [Smashing the stack for fun and profit, by Aleph One](http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=49&amp;id=14).

Modern OS such as Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 have built in protections against those attacks, since they are so dangerous and difficult to avoid. A common protection is a canary on the stack. It means that the OS puts a special, magic value at strategic places on the stack. After some instructions, the OS checks if the magic value has changed. If it has, then the stack was smashed and some kind of error is returned to the user.

There are other kinds of attacks that are directed toward the heap overflows, but they are more difficult to execute properly.",null,0,cdnv0ez,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
kyz,"The implications:

""The stack"" is some memory that keeps track of where you are in the computer program. Every time you call another function, it saves your current state on the stack, and where to come back to.

The called function runs, and when it finishes, it restores the state to before you made the call (stored on the stack) and jumps back to just after the call instruction (also saved on the stack).

If you *run out* of stack, the program simply has to stop running. Where can you store the details of the next function call? Nowhere, you're outta space! The OS has to abort the program.

However, there's something worse. Imagine you take input from the user, and put it into space located *on the stack*. What if the user tricks you into putting more data there than there is space for?

... it means that the end user gets to control what's on your stack. They get to overwrite it with whatever they like. They now control the *state* of your program. They get to control *where your program will go to* once the next function returns.

If it's easy enough to guess *where* the stack is (if it's at a predictable location, like it used to be before [address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) was promulgated), you can tell the program to jump to... the stack data itself, which is something you, the attacker, have control of thanks to the buffer overflow. This is called **[smashing the stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smashing_the_stack)** (for fun and profit). The stack data which is actually code is called ""[shellcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode)"".

So now you have *complete* control of the program. Just from supplying input to a program, you have made it start running your own code, and you get to take on the privileges it had and access the resources it has.

One fix against this (as well as ASLR and not writing exploitable code) is to mark the stack memory as ""[No eXecute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit)"", which means that if the CPU is told to run code on the stack, it will immediately end your program.

A sociopath is one who is affected with a personality disorder marked by antisocial behavior. A psychopath is a person with an antisocial personality disorder, manifested in aggressive, perverted, criminal, or amoral behavior without empathy or remorse. The two might sound the same to some, however the differences between sociopaths and psychopaths are very real.

Characteristics of a sociopath are as followed :

    Sociopaths are very charming.
    Sociopaths can be extremely manipulative and will try to con you whenever possible.
    Sociopaths feel that they are entitled to everything.
    Sociopaths will lie continuously to get what they want. They can even sometimes manipulate a lie detector.
    Sociopaths have no remorse, shame or guilt.
    Sociopaths will show love and happiness only when it serves their purpose. None of the feelings are genuine.
    Sociopaths have no room for love in their life.
    Sociopaths need to have excitement in their lives or live on the edge.
    Sociopaths have lack of empathy hen their victims suffer pain that they have caused.
    Sociopaths believe that they are all mightier than tho, there is no concern on how their behavior impacts others.
    Sociopaths usually have a long history of juvenile delinquency as well as behavior problems.
    Sociopaths will never take blame for anything they have done to anyone no matter if it is family or friend.
    Sociopaths have many sexual partners and tend to act out many sexual acts.
    Sociopaths rarely stay in one place for a long time (home/work).
    Sociopaths will change themselves if they know it will keep them from being found out.

Characteristics of a psychopath are as followed:

    Psychopaths use superficial charm to lure their victims.
    Psychopaths are extremely self-centered.
    Psychopaths must always do something to keep themselves from boredom.
    Psychopaths are very deceptive and tend to lie continuously.
    Psychopaths show no remorse of guilt towards their victims.
    Psychopaths are very predatory and usually will live off other people.
    Psychopaths have many sexual partners in their lifetime.
    Psychopaths are very impulsive with their lifestyle.
    Psychopaths are always blaming other people for their actions.
    Psychopaths never have a realistic view of their lives. (king of the world or from another planet)
    Psychopaths always want psychological gratification in sexual and criminal activities.
    Psychopaths tend to try suicide, rarely succeeding.

devodeevs,"Like one user said above, the DSM-IV does not list a diagnosis/criteria for ""psychopathy"". Antisocial Personality Disorder is the real disorder and most similar match to psychopathy. Additionally, see the Hare checklist for psychopathy here: http://www.arkancide.com/psychopathy.html 
This is not included in the DSM but was created as a test for psychopathy. Each criterion gets a score from 0-2 and all are added up to determine psychopathy.

Additionally, the following is a direct excerpt from an interview I did with Dr. Peter Langman for a research paper of mine about active shooters (Cho, James Holmes, Columbine shooters). He is the author of ""Why Kids Kill"" and is a leading expert on school shooters. He has an interesting perspective.

I asked:
Psychopathy has not been included in the DSM-IV. If you were to include psychopathy as a personality disorder in the new DSM-V, what would the criteria be? 

It's hard to say. In some ways, psychopathy seems like an extreme version of narcissistic personality disorder. One thing I might add as a possible criterion would be sadism, though this is not one of the traits Robert Hare includes in the Psychopathy Check List. Possible criteria might be extreme narcissism; disregard for rules, laws, social norms, the feelings of others, etc.; lack of guilt/remorse; meeting own needs at the expense of others; inability to engage in mutual relationships. Violence and criminal behavior would not be necessary for the diagnosis, but are often part of the picture.

The word ""psychopath"" tends to be more clearly defined in accordance with [Dr. Hare's checklist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_Psychopathy_Checklist), while ""sociopath"" is more up for grabs, so, while both words can be used differently by different groups, sociopathy tends to be the one more liable to a given groups own interpretation. There is no official definition for ""sociopath"" while there (kind of) is an official definition for psychopath, laid out by Robert Hare. 

Different groups will make their own distinctions but these distinctions are not official or universally accepted. A common one is to say that psychopathy is rooted in abnormalities of the brain while sociopathy is rooted in environmental causes. Sometimes a field or group will prefer one term and simply not use or define the other term. More often than not the terms can be and are used interchangeably.

While we're at it, sometimes both terms are used to refer to someone with Anti-social Personality Disorder, though this disorder is not synonymous with psychopathy in the sense that Robert Hare conceived it.

OrangeCrack,"A cell phone is actually a radio -- an extremely sophisticated radio, but a radio nonetheless. 

Before cell phones, trucks would talk to each other using CBs, however, this was limited to the number of people that could talk at the same time due to the  range and the fact these typically only had about 25 channels. 

The genius of the cellular system is the division of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously.

In a typical analog cell-phone system in the United States, the cell-phone carrier receives about 800 frequencies to use across the city. The carrier chops up the city into cells. Each cell is typically sized at about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers).

Because cell phones and base stations use low-power transmitters, the same frequencies can be reused in non-adjacent cells. 

Here are the basics:

 - As you drive through the city areas are divided into cells
 - The cells read a unique ID on your phone to identify you and what carrier you are with.
 - If your ID matches that of the tower, you will be considered in your home network.
 -  Along with your ID, your phone also transmits a registration request, and the cell tower keeps track of your phone's location in a database -- this way, the tower knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone.
 - The cell tower gets the call, and it tries to find you. It looks in its database to see which cell you are in.
 - The cell tower picks a frequency pair that your phone will use in that cell to take the call.
 - The cell tower communicates with your phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use, and once your phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected. Now, you are talking by two-way radio to a friend.
 - As you move toward the edge of your cell, your cell's base station notes that your signal strength is diminishing. Meanwhile, the base station in the cell you are moving toward (which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies, not just its own one-seventh) sees your phone's signal strength increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each other through the cell tower, and at some point, your phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies. This hand off switches your phone to the new cell.

tl;dr - Your phone acts as a radio and cell towers communicate with your phone and each other to automatically transfer your call.",null,1,cdnjtsw,1rid4r,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

afcagroo,"When a CPU reads an instruction, it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer. It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips ""Give me the information at this address"". It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus - high voltage means 1, low voltage means 0. The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion. It toggles some control pins to say ""Here ya go"" and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the 1s and 0s corresponding to that binary data. The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory. (This description is actually vastly simplified, but hopefully gets the idea across.)  
  
Similarly, the CPU (or other devices) can move data/instructions from the HDD into DRAM, or to/from network interface chips, etc. One thing asks for data stored in a particular set of locations, the other thing says ""OK, here it is"" and sends it, and the first thing (sometimes) says ""Thanks, got it!"". Or, something says ""I'm going to send you some information to store/work on"" and a similar handshaking goes on.  
  
All of this communication is built up in layers. The lowest layer that I described above, where voltages change to represent something, is called Layer 1, the physical layer.  Sometimes a ""1"" is sent via a high voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage simultaneously on two different wires.  There are lots of different ways to do it, and some are better for some uses than others.   
   
Higher layers define the protocol for decoding that information and deciding what it means and how to use it.   

These generic layers are described in the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). But there are various different bus protocols (SATA, PCIe, Ethernet, etc.), and to understand any one of them you'd need to read up on its specifics.   
  
Processors tend to have their own proprietary or semi-proprietary bus protocols for some things; this has been a recurring issue for companies like AMD who are trying to compete with the 500 pound gorilla in PCs, Intel. For other things (like DRAM) they tend to use protocols that the industry has agreed upon (like DDR3).  
   
Wireless communication adds a bit more complexity. Since things aren't connected with wires, information must be sent by modulating a radio signal. There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
One simple way is to use signalling. You can pulse the light on and off like [Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code, you can transmit information.  This is actually done in some fiber optic systems. (They don't use Morse code, and it is much much faster than a human could do. But it's the same general idea.) This technique isn't really used with radio broadcasts, though. 
  
Another way is to *modulate* the signal.  If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.    ",null,0,cdnjdst,1ricgj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
lumpy_potato,"Depends. Are we talking wired or wireless?

Wired, its all just electrical signals representing binary digits, 0 and 1.

Lets say I have a chip that has 1 input and two outputs. The two outputs go to a red light and a green light.

When the input is off (0, no current) the red light stays on. When the input is on (1, current) the red light turns off and the green light turns on.

Electronics, when you get down to it, are a lot of red-light-green-light sort of operations, turning things on and off until you get the required output from a particular input.

With wireless, its the same thing, only you use some form of wireless medium - e.g. radio waves. You take your binary 0s and 1s and transmit it via radio, the same way you transmit music from an antenna to your car radio.

The receiver picks up the signal, decodes it, and turns it back into electrical 1s and 0s.

TheRockefellers,"There are about a million ways of scoring tennis, but I'm assuming you're talking about what you see in the pros. Here's the big picture:

To win a tennis match, you must:

* Win a majority of the **sets** (best of 3 for women, best of 5 for men);

* To win a **set**, you must be the first to win **6 games**, and you must win by two; or if both sides are tied at 6 games each, they play a **tiebreaker** (a specific type of game) to win the set;

* To win a **game**, you must win four (or more) points, and **you must win by two points.**

Now, as for game scoring:

* 0 points = love

* 1 point = 15 (or sometimes called ""5"")

* 2 points = 30

* 3 points = 40

* A tie at 3 points or more = deuce

If both players reach deuce, we kind of stop keeping track of the total number of points, since all that matters at this point is winning by 2.  So at this time, you abandon your numbers. Instead, the score is:

* Deuce, if the players are tied (as noted above)

* ""Ad in"" or ""advantage in"" if the **server** has one more point than the receiver (in which case the server wins the game if he wins the next point)

* ""Ad out"" or ""advantage out"" if the **receiver** has one more point than the server(in which case the receiver wins the game if he wins the next point)

Also, before each point serve, the score will be announced. The order of the numbers matters; the first is the server's score, and the second is the receiver's.  So if you hear ""30-15,"" you know that the server has two points to the receiver's one.

So here's an example of a single game being scored between S (who's serving) and R:

* Game starts at 0 (love) all
* S wins the point; 15-0
* S wins the point; 30-0
* R wins the point; 30-15
* R wins the point; 30 all
* R wins the point; 30-40
* S wins the point; deuce
* S wins the point; Ad-In or Advantage S
* R wins the point; deuce
* R wins the point; Ad-Out or Advantage R
* R wins the point; R wins the game

Also within these rules there are a few aberrations.  For example, in Wimbledon, there is no tiebreaker in the final set of a match. You have to win by two games. This can result in some loooong matches, like the championship a few years ago, which lasted something like 11 hours.

sloecrush,"LOVE = 0 points

15 = 1 point

30 = 2 points

40 = 3 points

DEUCE = when both players reach 40, then one must score 2 points in a row

ADVANTAGE _________ = that player has to score one more point to win the game


when a game is won, they start back at love. one must win a certain number of games within a set, a certain number of sets to win a match.

TurtleHerder_,"Tennis is broken down into 3 components; These are points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games(usually 6), and games consist of points. It takes 4 points to win a game. The points however, have different names.
0 points= love
1 point=15
2 points=30
3 points=40
4 points=60
Once a player reaches 4 points, the game is over, unless the game was tied at 3 points a piece beforehand(ex:40-40). This occurance is referred to as 'deuce'. In this case you can only win this game by becoming 2 points ahead of them. Once a game reaches 'deuce', it stays in deuce until the 2 point margin is reached.
An example of an in-progress game score would be:
Player A has 3 points and Player has 2 points. Therefore, Game score=(A)40-(B)30.
If the game is tied, the score is followed by 'up'. Ex:15-up

Overall tennis matches are usually played best of 3(women) and best of 5(men) sets. In order to win a set, the player must win 6 games by at least a 2 game margin. Ex. 6-4.

Consider every human farting,. Or even,.

So what we want to do is eliminate things that can change the environment. Pets produce many environmental waste just as making pencils do. The idea behind it is to eliminate as much as we can slowly over time. Pets do not produce that much of a concern to the ecosphere as coal burning does. If we changed green house emissions,. Suddenly we need to learn how to clean up these landfills. If we learn how to get rid of landfill waste, suddenly we need to learn how to incorporate our society and cities from being invasive to other species. The list will always go on. Someday we might get to pets, and if we ever get to that point, it just means that pets will be the number 1 on the list of changing our environment in a way we don't want.

Remember that climate change and environmental impact isn't necessary black and white.

The only difference is the antenna that's broadcasting and relaying the signal is in space, so it can hit a much, much wider area with little to no interruption. GPS uses a similar technology.

DrCeratops,"Police officers only enforce a portion of all laws. Only federal law enforcement can enforce federal law. Federal law enforcement officers cannot enforce state/town/city ordinances or laws. The opposite is true for local officers and federal laws. Additionally, most police officers enforce only criminal (statutory) laws, which is a small portion of the law as a whole. 

The laws that are enforced are usually agency and division specific. This means that the San Francisco Police direct the majority of their patrols to fight San Francisco-specific crime, whereas the California Highway Patrol focus on the highways that run through San Francisco and California, and the BART Police focus on crime occurring on the transportation systems of the San Francisco/Bay Area. Furthermore, different divisions of different agencies have different focuses. Examples are drug enforcement units, gang units, alcohol licensing units, etc. Individuals of those divisions will know their specific areas better than they would other laws.

For the most part you only need to identify that a crime has or is occurring. For example, if you see someone snatching a purse and running away, you don't need to know the specifics of the law that was broken to respond, you know that a law was broken (don't get me wrong, you SHOULD). You can stop that individual/deal with the situation, and look up the most-specific charge afterwards.

restricteddata,"[The same question came up on here a day or two ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rf3m3/eli5_why_can_some_countries_decide_who_can_and/); here's what I wrote there:

In the early 1960s, the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb. Maoist China had just set one off, and was considered a pretty looney ""rogue state"" at the time (Cultural Revolution and all that), and was a mutual enemy to both. Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism, there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future, as opposed to the five that then existed (US, USSR, UK, France, China). They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence (e.g. once China has nukes, you can't threaten China with nukes without being threatened back), and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to all-out nuclear war (which neither the US or the USSR wanted).

But the problem is that they didn't want to give up their own nukes. They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation. Once a country has nukes, a whole new (potentially stabilizing) political order emerges. They didn't want to give that up, they just wanted to stop _new_ political orders (which they saw as destabilizing) from cropping up elsewhere. 

The countries without nukes, of course, were like, wait, you guys get nukes, but we don't? Lame. So they made the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) include sections that said that the so-called Nuclear States (the ones that already had them) would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well. This is Article VI, which states:

&gt; Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.

Well that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding. All of them are willing to say, ""sure, we'll get rid of our nukes if everyone else does"" but they all know that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So why would a non-nuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is? Not so much because of the disarmament clause, but more because the NPT also says that non-nuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of ""peaceful"" nuclear energy as well. So they get help with reactors and things like that, as long as they agree to safeguards that won't let them weaponize any of it. It's also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region — if everyone in, say, South America agrees to not get the bomb (and this is enforced by means of the NPT), then that means you don't have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get one.

In practice things have always been messier than that. For one reason, not everybody signed the treaty. There were _many_ non-signatories/non-ratifiers until the end of the Cold War. Among them were two of the named nuclear states (France and China, both of whom did help other states proliferate), and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear (Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa), as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear (i.e. Egypt, Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil).

rsdancey,"After WWII ended, the United States thought that there were only two options.  Either nuclear weapons needed to be turned over to an international agency for use only in the enforcement of collective security, or there would be unlimited proliferation leading in short order to a nuclear Third World War.

The civilian benefits of nuclear technology were overstated.  People thought that nuclear power generation would replace conventional power generation very quickly.  The potential of nuclear medicine was just being investigated but hopes were high.  So most countries wanted access to nuclear technology.

The problem is that nuclear reactors using uranium, the easiest and first technology available, produce plutonium as they operate.  That plutonium can be removed from spent fuel and reprocessed to make nuclear weapons.  There is no good way to allow unlimited nuclear power generation without creating a nuclear weapon proliferation risk.

Once the Soviet Union developed its own nuclear weapon, it was no longer possible for the US to imagine giving up its own weapons to an international body.  In the end, an international treaty was developed that traded the right of a country to operate nuclear reactors for the enforcement of rules that prohibited the development of nuclear weapons.  This treaty called on the powers that had nuclear weapons as of the date it came into force to eliminate those weapons ""as fast as possible"" so that eventually no nation would have nuclear arms.  Those countries were the US, the USSR, the UK, France and China.  Coincidentally, those countries are also the veto-wielding permananent members of the UN Security Council which, via the language of the nuclear weapon / nuclear power treaty serves as the arbiter and enforcer of that treaty.

A small number of countries have never signed the treaty, or have withdrawn from it, which is how India, Pakistan, North Korea and Isreal have built their weapons programs.  Technically they should face crippling economic sanctions and potentially military action to force them to comply with the treaty even though they are not signatories, but practically the decision has been made to enforce those penalties ad hoc or not at all.

The problem with the treaty is the danger of dual-use.  A country can remain within the limits of the treaty while preparing itself to make nuclear weapons.  It can create enriched uranium or extract plutonium up to a limit.  It can conduct research on the triggers and controlled explosions used in nuclear weapons.  And then it can break the treaty and ""dash"" for a weapon, trying to get the work done before it faces international consequences.  North Korea shows that once you have nukes you probably can't be forced to give them up.  This is why Iran is so worrisome.  They are following the classic path to use the legal limits of the treaty to position themselves for a quick sprint to a bomb.  In fact they have repeatedly violated the treaty,and been caught, which reinforces the world opinion that they are planning to make bombs.",null,1,cdnkqx7,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

upvoter222,"You can probably find a more technical definition elsewhere, but basically, intentional grounding is a penalty committed when a passer (generally the quarterback) throws an incomplete pass to avoid being sacked (tackled behind where the play started).  There are specific rules dictating what qualifies as intentional grounding.

For example, it's not intentional grounding if the incomplete pass was headed towards an eligible receiver.  In other words, even if it's really obvious that the QB threw the ball knowing it would bounce or end up out of bounds, it's still legal if there's a receiver nearby.  Throwing near an eligible receiver is only required if the QB is in the ""pocket"".  The pocket, in ELI5-terms, can be thought of as the part of the field directly behind the linemen or big blockers up front.  

If the QB is outside the pocket (ie. scrambling around the field), he does not have to throw the ball near a receiver.  However, the ball has to be thrown beyond the line of scrimmage, further forward than where the ball was snapped.  

If a player is penalized for intentional grounding, the offense moves back either to the location of the throw or 10 yards backward, whichever is longer.  There is also a loss of down associated with this penalty, so if you intentionally ground the ball on 1st and 10, it can become 2nd and 20.  Also note that although it looks like it should be called, the rules do allow a QB to immediately spike the ball without a penalty to stop the clock.

rupert1920,"There are two factors that affect the formation of frost: temperature and humidity.

Water and ice are in constant equilibrium with water vapour in the air. A cup of water can evaporate if, at the given temperature, the air above it can carry more water vapour than it currently does - in technical terms, when the vapour pressure of the water is lower than the equilibrium vapour pressure. Likewise, if, at a given temperature, the air is holding more water than it should be, then water will condense on a cold surface.

There is little limit on how much can actually condense onto a surface - as long as it is cold, and there is an abundance of moisture. However, in the _absence_ of a replenishing source of moisture, there can be little or no condensation. For example, if you bring out a cool shot glass into a hot summer day, you'll notice condensation build up over time. If you put a normal glass over the shotglass, such that there is no air circulation, there may be limited condensation - condensation only occurs as long as there is excess moisture in the air.

So in an enclosed garage, even with no thermal insulation, simply limiting the amount of air reduce how much frost can build up.

Now, to address the other point: temperature. Even a completely uninsulated garage can retain _some_ heat. All objects emit some form of thermal radiation - usually in the infrared range. This emitted radiation can be absorbed by other objects. A car, for example, can emit radiation that is absorbed by the ground. The ground, in turn, also emits radiation to the car. This means two objects in close proximity can maintain a thermal equilibrium.

If you park outside, however, any radiation emitted to, say, the house on the other side of the road, will be dispersed due to the [inverse square law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square_law) - it's harder to maintain equilibrium. Any radiation emitted to, say, the night sky, is guaranteed to pretty much never return. That's a net _loss_ in energy.

This means that, simply by providing four sides and a roof, you can retain _some_ amount of heat longer than if you parked outside. This is one reason cars parked in sheds with no door can have frost build-up only on sides where it's exposed (especially at the turn of the season, when it isn't really _that_ cold to develop frost elsewhere).",null,0,cdnjxwi,1ri0xe,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

GentlePandoran,"It's all about the ""dew point"" which is the temperature at which dew will form on grass and bushes...and your car left outside. So for example maybe it's 50 degrees outside overnight...but the dew point is 53 degrees. This means that your car will get wet from dew at 53 degrees. But if it's 50 degrees outside and the dew point is 40 degrees, you car will NOT get wet overnight. Neither will the grass nor bushes be wet. 

Dew point is a humidity factor. The monsoon season in Phoenix, Arizona, for example, is calculated strictly on the dew point. Once it reaches a certain number, monsoon season has arrived...and will stay until that number goes back down, indicating that monsoon rains could arrive on any given day. 

Just like how high humidity will make your cold drink sweat and leave water rings, dew points high enough will make your car outside wet. It's that simple.

Check your local weather station for the dew point temperature. That way you'll know if your car is going to get wet at night or not.

I think further medical research is required. In Africa, RCTs were run on black African men to determine the efficacy of the amputation of the foreskin in reductions in HIV/AIDS. Obviously, RCTs could not be done on white western men for ethical reasons! 

So it's imperative that urgent RCTs be performed on black African women, in order that they too might enjoy the potential benefits that men gain from circumcision. Once again, it's not ethical to run these RCTs on white western women of course.

If the research is positive (hopefully), then perhaps WHO will recommend female circumcision along with male circumcision.

Like male circumcision, there are plenty of peer reviewed studies that show female circumcision is not a barrier to sexual orgasm and enjoyment. Some studies show that orgasm and enjoyment are reduced; and some show no effect.

You'll often come across members of the medical community saying that FGM has no ""health"" benefits, and if women have their clitoris amputated, then their sex life comes to an end. Then they say that MGM has lots of ""health"" benefits and that men's sex life is not affected.

But it's a myth that many women who have suffered FGM are unhappy and cannot have great sex lives. That's why they queue up to have their daughters' circumcised. Plus there are many so-called potential ""health benefits"" - such as a 50% reduction in HIV/AIDS.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris

The visible part - the glans clitoris - is only a small part of the whole clitoris. So when a woman suffers partial or total amputation of the external clitoris when undergoing FGM, only a small part of her clitoris is removed. Thus she often can enjoy a full and satisfying sex life.

Throne3d,"Speaking from past experience, braces which are not removable do not really seem to have sharp points on the individual brackets (the metal pieces glued to the teeth), except for on those brackets where elastic bands could be required (in my case it was the third tooth from the middle on both sides, on both the top and bottom of the mouth).

The wire, however, which is attached to / threaded through these brackets, is made of some sort of memory alloy which (when bent away from its ""set"" position) will try to bend back to what it was ""set"" to (the 'correct' shape of the mouth / layout of the teeth).

Sometimes the wire is not cut enough towards the back of the mouth where it pokes out at the end of the brackets, and is (usually) able to cut the inside of the mouth. If the gum scrapes along it (while chewing or speaking, for example), it is likely to damage the inner lining of the cheek. 

Alternatively, as the teeth move into position, the wire may end moving around in the braces (as it is not fixed into position, from what I can tell, but instead is kept close to the brackets by being enclosed). This could cause it to be fine when the orthodontist first puts the wire in, but then get worse as you go along (until the next time the braces are 'tightened' / rewired).

Oh, and as /u/Sunfried has mentioned - there are two main types of pain with braces, in my experience. A sort of ache which is usually worse just after them being rewired (and for a day or two afterwards), and the cutting pain which the ends of the wire cause.

For example, after the 3rd tooth, all my bracers have hooks which are damned sharp. Those are used at a later stage in order to correct the whole jaw. Rubber bands are put on those hooks in order to exert pressure and correct the jaw.

To be honest, to say that no one has come up with a solution to the problem is bull crap. You just didn't research on the matter enough. When I did put my bracers, I was allowed to choose from multiple designs. I chose titanium, mini bracers which resemble the classic ones - just smaller. However, there were all sorts of other materials and designs. There was these ones made of some kind of a ceramic material, which was the same color as the teeth and the manifacturer claimed that they are way smoother. The most interesting ones where a type of bracers that were glued to the inside of your mouth, rather than the outside. Initially, I though of getting these, but my dentist told me that the classic design is the most efficient.

If your little girl suffers from the bracers, there is another clever solution - dental wax. You can get it from every drug store/pharmacy etc. It is a bit like chewing gum, but more dense and hard. You just take a bit from the dental wax, roll it into a ball and stick it to the the places that cause pain to your little girl. It's purpose is actually to smoothen the bracers so they dont tear the inside of your poor girl's mouth. This clever thing saved from countless of sleepless nights.

The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth, like others have noted. However, they also have to be cut to fit her mouth— sometimes if the wire is too long, they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain. This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire, bending the tips of the wire, or using dental wax as others have suggested. I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself- it's a few cents to them, free to you, and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter. 


As to why it's metal, there are several other statements that essentially address the issue. The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth, yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire. Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheap—there simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility, cost, etc. Unfortunately, cutting metal leads to sharp edges, unless it's treated with something to smooth out the edge. As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out, they don't do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut.

rule_Britania,"Both UDP and TCP are protocols that sit just above the IP layer. To put this in context you need to look at the OSI stack: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model. But essentially each layer wraps the one above it with some more information such as where it is meant to be going, how big it is etc.

To really understand what is happening here, you need to know at the most basic level what an IP address is and what a port is. So an IP address is your internet facing address. Forgetting lots of clever tricks where people/computers can share IP addresses (c.f. NAT, LAN), every computer has a unique address. But within each computer there are lots of processes running. This is where port numbers come in. The operating system needs to know which process to send the data to, and that is signified by the port number. Now IP has no concept of ports, so you need a protocol on top of that to contain the port information. This is UDP.

So the UDP header literally contains a 'source' port and a 'destination' port. The other two fields which are required are 'length', to tell the computer where this packet ends and the next begins. And a checksum just to add some level of reliability about the port numbers not being corrupt.

So UDP is the most basic way of sending data between processes across a network. TCP adds a LOT of other things such as congestion control, flow control and reliability; all of which UDP doesn't have.

TCP is very concerned about the integrity of the data sent. UDP not so much - as long as it gets there, even if you lose some data on the way, its not that big of a deal.

Think of it like this - you have some data that goes out over the internet. It gets split up into packets 1-20.

With TCP, you have to wait until you get all 1-20 packets - if 19 goes missing, you request it again, until you have it. Then you put 1-20 in order, and voila, there is your data.

With UDP, you can be missing packages 10-15, who gives a shit. I have 1-9 and 16-20, lets put together what we can and ask for the next batch.

TCP is very good when data integrity matters - file transfers, for instance - a missing packet or two can cause data corruption.

UDP is very good when speed matters - video, voice, etc. Losing a few frames to packet loss doesn't matter. What does matter is not wasting time waiting for those lost packets to arrive, or requesting them again. Who cares? Get what data you can, the user is more concerned with the voice/video happening with minimal lag, rather than to be super smooth.

What GABA does is effectively paralyze your body, or at the very least, your brains ability to move muscles. This occurs during REM sleep when you're dreaming; it's to prevent you from acting out your dreams, your body expends next to no energy in this state and consumes very little oxygen. This is only one reason why you don't fall off the bed though. REM sleep, when you're actually dreaming, only happens in 90 minuet intervals and only lasts a precious few minutes. So that dream you had where you were skate boarding down a big hill that lasted for hours, only took up a few moments of your actual time. 

There are 5 stages to sleep. N-REM 1, N-REM 2, N-REM 3, N-REM 2 again, and REM. During this cycle, outside of REM, your body and mind are effectively awake. You're not aware of your surroundings, but you're aware enough to know when there's an edge near you, or a predator, and you move away. Incidentally, if you ever get the feeling like you're falling when you're going to sleep, this occurs in N-REM 2 where ""sleep spindles"" happen.

i_accidently_reddit,"To understand this, we need to look at the history of writing in the west.

In the modern day western world, we use the Latin alphabet. The Romans however first wrote in Greek.

But maybe you know, just how much of a chip the Romans had on their shoulder about not being seen as as smart and as cultivated as the Greeks. So while Greek still was lingua franca in the Roman Empire, they got really obsessed with their own culture and language and tried very hard to make Latin the dominant language in the Mediterranean.

And of course, developing a own typography goes a long way in setting the two languages apart. This led to what we now know as the Latin alphabet, excluding J, W and U, and all upper case.

Seeing however, that it is quite tedious to write all those big capital letters all the time, the written language evolved into what is called a uncial script.

All the letters are still majuscules, but the beginning of a sentence or a important wort is capitalized. so essentially its smaller capital letters, if that makes sense?

Now this is were the fun part starts: typographers are a weird bunch of people, they are both artists and geometers. Back then, every written text was basically a piece of art, with the capitalised letters being carefully ornated, trying to reflect the tenor of the writing. And the typographer himself knows how the properties of some letters within the text, impact the whole synthesis of his art work.

And seeing that he has some sort of artistic freedom, he just cant allow a A, H or R to destroy the natural flow of text he is trying to convey.

Fun fact on the side: there are Latin papyri dating back to around the turn of the eras, that include lower case letters for the before mentioned a, h or r.

So from there on, it is basically just years and years (two thousand and counting) of improving on the given letters. And this is still happening, for example the upper case S used to have two lower case letters, "" s  "" and "" ſ "" which we got rid of basically just recently, in the beginning of 20th century. Or the english ""th"" used to be the a rune called thorn and fell out of favour in the middle ages.

Now repeat that over hundreds of words and all you have are hundreds of different rectangles where the only difference is their letter length. It all comes down to word recognition based on something called ""shape contrast"". 

For example the words ""PENNY"" and ""PENCIL"" are hard to differentiate quickly when they're all caps. However, ""Penny"" and ""Pencil"" are much easier due to the shape contrast of ascenders and descenders.

After van Gogh: [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autumn_Rhythm.jpg) is also considered art.

ELY20 (explain like you're 20):
Before van Gogh, what mattered was the subject. The painting had to look like the object it was supposed to represent. An artist was only good when creating a variation on a subject matter.
After van Gogh, the intent of the artist became more important. The painting no longer had to represent a specific object. Van Gogh is part of a larger move towards abstraction where the final painting is only the end-product of a longer process. The [Starry Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) is a picture of a starry night and the way van Gogh felt before that scene, both at the same time. That is why the psychological aspect is so important in understanding his paintings. It would take the work of other great artists before full abstraction became recognized as a form of art.

TedTschopp,"TL;DR:  Van Gogh is considered good because he tricks you into thinking you are seeing a painting of a flower, when in reality you are looking at abstract brush strokes.

Let's take his [Irises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gogh,_Vincent_van_-_Irises_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) painting.  The reason he is so considered to be so good is that the painting above generates inside of people the impression of seeing a field of Irises while not actually using all the forms and colors of an actual purple [Irises](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BWtpA40ghG4/TaNyV4qcyCI/AAAAAAAAASk/6-5q4Rq2hHY/s1600/purple_irises.jpg).   

To see where this started; painters at one point were basically cameras and someone like Martin Johnson Heade produced a painting called [Birds and flowers](http://www.painting-analysis.com/oiseaux300.jpg).  Then people like Monet started to question this dogma with paintings like [Nympheas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nympheas_71293_3.jpg).  When Van Gogh and other painters at his time came around they pushed these questions harder and with more rigor than those before.  Following Van Gogh people like Picasso pushed this idea even further [Flowers in a Grey Jug and Wine-Glass with Spoon](http://www.artgalleryabc.com/images/stories/P/Picasso/picasso232.JPG).  In all of these images you get the idea and feeling of a flower and that is what an artist does.  Its not their job to reproduce a flower as it is seen.  Their job is to make you -feel- like you saw THE FLOWER.

Silent letters can happen because the way people spoke a word changed and the way it was spelled didn't (if you think about how hard it was, in older times, to make new copies of all the existing books, you can probably appreciate why people didn't make new copies of all their books every time the pronunciation of a word changed).

Or they can happen because two words got shoved together (Wikipedia's example is ""cupboard"", which literally started as ""cup board"", but as one word started to run together until the 'p' was silent).

And so on and so forth; silent letters usually tell us something about the history of the word and the language it appears in, though exactly *what* they tell may require some digging.

As for two-letter combinations (digraphs), commonly it's because there wasn't one letter that exactly had the sound.

'Phone' is a good example: in ancient Greek the letter ɸ (phi) represented a sound that was like 'p', but ""aspirated"" (breathy -- as you make the 'p' sound, also breathe out so that the breath also makes a sound). There wasn't anything in the Latin alphabet corresponding to that sound, so 'ph' was chosen for transcribing Greek words.

But the sound of the Greek ɸ evolved to where, in modern Greek, it's close enough in sound to be interchangeable with the Latin alphabet's 'f'. So now we are still pronouncing 'ph' the way the Greek ɸ is pronounced, even though that sound no longer matches the 'ph' originally used to transcribe ɸ.",null,0,cdne2cq,1rhuzt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

Fairleee,"The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history - it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures, because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing - this universally agreed thing is called a standard. There are a number of different standards, and sometimes we don't have a single one. Consider something like transferring data between devices. The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer, but it isn't the only one - however, because it is so popular, most devices will have a USB port.

In terms of distance, these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do - basically, if we didn't have a standard system of measurement for length, then mass production of components couldn't exist, which would mean that we wouldn't be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform way.

The meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length. This is similar to the celsius system of temperature, which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system. However, the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough, or constant enough, to be fully acceptable. So, part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant. To measure time, a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom - I can't remember details off the top of my head. For distance, the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain (incredibly tiny) period of time.

As for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere, yes, there is! There is a prototype meter (kept in France, I believe), and a number of almost identical (with the tiniest, tiniest variations, and the variations of which are recorded) meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards. So basically, precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter. Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these, and so on, and so on. 

So, a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate, but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing. However, if you are doing a job that requires a very, very, very high degree of accuracy (such as precision engineering), then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration. And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the world.

It is true that more men fall victim to fatal heart attacks than women, but the disparity is not a big as most people think.  Some factors that influence this difference include eating and lifestyle habits between men and women, the size of the individual (often times bigger people require more effort from the heart to push blood and thus more fatigue and ware), size and composition of arteries where larger arteries found in men are more susceptible to atherosclerosis, inflammation and blockage. When it comes to symptoms, women posses a much larger tolerance to pain.

You describe correctly the ""classical"" symptoms of a sudden heart attacks that people are taught to recognise to facilitate early medical treatment, however these symptoms will not always be the case. Heart attacks can vary in duration and severity, which will alter how someone will react. 
Heart attacks are caused by the heart not getting enough oxygen to itself, so parts begin to suffocate and die. 
Because the heart attack your step mum suffered from was not sudden and quick in duration, the symptoms she experienced were perhaps less intense, but prolonged.

Up until the K-T extinction event, one could have easily asked ""Why does evolution in the long run seem to favor larger animals?"".

This was a period from roughly ~400 million years ago to 65 million years ago during which animals pretty much kept getting bigger. That's over 300 million years worth of evolution, a much longer trend than the reversal in the last 65 million years.

Using the same principle I described you can see that the new animal has only 4 times the surface area of the smaller animal. So you have more animal and less area for heat to escape from. This is good if you are in a cold climate. (Also women, who are in general smaller than men tend to get colder easier because of this effect).

At this time, the animals that are best adapted to the old environment, will suddenly lose all of their advantages and either die outright or be displaced by something else.

Why porting Android to a device is a hassle is because it's not as simple as just compiling it against a certain version of the OS. Pretty much all of your time is spent making the kernel work properly with the new version of the OS. This can be hard since some of the code and features are proprietary and require either authorization or custom modifications from the companies that manufacture or design a component (like the GPU or WLAN chipset) for the device to even boot or support a new feature in the OS. Even if somehow all the pieces fall into place, and all the companies submitted brand new code with all the required modifications (or gave their code for Google to modify) it would still require extensive testing and polishing for a general release. So, basically, there is no incentive to support the device anymore, and doing it through the proper channels would be problematic and require money and developer time.

josh4rim,"**Jaw Impact**

A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin around. This quick motion of causes trauma to the brain that knocks the recipient out leaving him unconscious. Points on the jaw that are especially vulnerable to knockouts are the sides of the chin, and where the jaw is attaches to the skull.

**Acceleration and Deceleration**

When the jaw is punched, the head quickly accelerates around. After a fraction of a second, it quickly decelerates as muscles, tendons, and bones prevent the head from spinning any further. The brain inside the skull is floating in fluid. It accelerates slower than the rest of the head. This forces it to crash into the inside of the skull when the head stops.


**Brain Trauma
**
When the brain slams into the inside of the skull, it suffers trauma. It then bounces off the inside of the skull and slams into the opposite side. This causes even more trauma. Depending on the force of the punch, this can happen several times before the brain comes to rest inside the skull.

**Nervous System Response**

The trauma to the brain stimulates an overwhelming number of neurotransmitters to fire at the same time. This essentially overloads the nervous system sending it into a state of temporary paralysis. The person who is hit in the jaw loses consciousness and his muscles relax. The injured person falls to the ground with no memory of being hit.

**Recovery**

A person who is knocked out by a punch to the jaw suffers a severe concussion. It can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes to regain consciousness. It all depends on the severity of the brain trauma. In mild cases, the person who is knocked out can shake off the punch with little more than a headache. In severe cases, brain trauma from a knockout punch to the jaw can cause cerebral bleeding and death.

The best way your brain can do this, is to turn off as much of the brain as it can as to avoid damage to active parts - sort of like how you can drop a hard drive when it's off and it can be fine but when you turn it on the slightest drop can really mess it up.  
It's a bad analogy but you get the point I assume.  
This is how brain transplants are possible without damaging someone's brain.  
This isn't the only reason however, as the brain also perceives you getting hit as a threat that you could possibly make worse by acting out of fear or knee-jerk reaction.  
So your brain hits the wall of your skull, decides ""If I'm working too hard while this keeps happening it can cause serious damage so I'm going on standby until I feel safe.""  
This is why some people can pass out from being frightened, as they perceive a threat and the brain wants you to just relax and stay still, that is what it feels is the safest.

School, Movies, Sitcoms, Religions, Youtube, Fraternaties, and everywhere else you go, the mind is treated like a shake-toy.

Children are encouraged to hit the soccer ball with their head.  Kids put their heads in hard plastic spheres and hit it against others as the crowd cheers.  Take your jet engine and wrap it with some padding and throw it off a one story building. Your brain has the consistency of jello and your skull has the consistency of stone.  If I take your brain and pour it into a square bowl, it will take the shape of that bowl.  Vibrating your head will cause ripples and vibrations in that jello.  Shake hard enough and you get scarring, blood clots that expand and push and leak between the modules to cause destruction of neurons.

Getting knocked out causes undiagnosed subdural hematomas which is when blood leaks out of the arteries to flood the neurons and it suffocates a sub-net of your mind as scabbing occurs to stop the leak.  The brain being the most remarkable instrument on the planet can remap old functionality onto new hardware in an instant.  Normally scarring occurs anywhere along the edges of your mind, and your dedicated employees of yours (the 30 million layers of hierarchical hidden markov models) disappear.  Car accidents.  Getting punched.  Hitting your head on the ice.  Contact sports, falling out of the crib cracking your skull open.  Being ""Knocked out"" or a having a concussion.  If your brain experiences a shock of more than 7 G's, you may get brain damage.  The brain can re-map functionality (quite quickly) to other parts of the brain, it will heal itself, but you will be running your hardware system with fewer resources.

noptotsch,"Basically, a person knocked out is saving energy for primary body function by blocking functions strictly unnecessary to survival. It's physically processing a (huge) blow (to that person). This can be mentally, coming from a shock or otherwise difficult context of input to your brain, this can be physically as a reaction to a huge slam, bloodloss or otherwise. The result of knockout is in any case a physical reaction where the body physically switches back to survival mode by disabling secondary physical body functions such as seeing, smelling, moving. Sometimes the body already does this to prevent further damage by say assessing and processing any mental or physical (most often sudden) blow to its perception of reality (you can get knock out as shock, no physical blow recieved here), so this can happen as a precaution where physically your body doesn't necessarily needs to shutdown these secondary functions. 

BTW, going more directly into your question, assuming 'trend game' is something like people kneeling down and suddenly stand up to faint; this is like physically draining the oxygen from your head, people sometimes do it by kicking each other in the lungs or stomach too, by suddenly standing up your brain notices decrease of oxygen in bloodflow and shuts down to save the energy for primary function, sort of survival reflex.

PRATFO,"I don't know about any of the explanations that the brain ""shuts down"" for protective reasons, I just don't see the adaptive benefit to this unless you're arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult. This simply is not the case, if anything, the blood flow is increased following impact. This is the basis of second-impact syndrome. When there is concussion, brain function is altered, resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time. Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate. As a result of this dilation, there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edema.

As to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness, I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement. There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal. The details probably aren't worth going into. But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries. This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness, likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants, such as the Moro reflex, which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change. This reflex originates in the pons. 

ELI5: Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem, where the arousal network is. This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed, this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem, this is called the fencing response.

SoWhatIfImChristian,"Just like a lot of the posts here have explained, it has to do with either you brain receiving trauma or damage, an overload of sensors or insufficient oxygen levels reaching the brain. 

Whether it be getting hit on the jaw, being in a car crash, etc, all of this causes a fast acceleration to your head. Your brain is suspended in fluid and there is nothing else that keeps it apart from the skull. When sudden acceleration or deceleration happens, it will cause the brain to smash against the skull. This will cause trauma or damage and result in being ""knocked out.""

Another way can be when your brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters. Whether it be pain, flashing lights (epilepsy), and so on, if the brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters it will overload and shut down for it's own safety. 

In the case of an oxygen deficiency, do people remember the ""game"" where people used to play by choking each other until they pass out? In order for the brain to function, it needs a continuous stream of oxygen being . When oxygen is cut off, it results in cerebral hypoxia. When you get choked either by someone else, a belt, a rope or anything, it cuts off the blood supply to your head. The oxygen is carried through your blood, thus it results in cerebral hypoxia.

It makes the most sense to sensible people to buy 10 $5 cables before every dropping $100 for a cable that works just as well, even if that $100 cable has a warranty for eternity or something. But Monster knows that, with some powerful marketing to some gullible communities that derive status from using brand-name products, they will sell a small number of high-margin cables.

It's just like anything else (headphones, smartphones, shoes, purses, all clothing, that can mark prices to the ceiling for a brand name without any proportional increase in performance).  Some people really want you to know that they paid $100 for a cable.

ShingamiOfSmarm,"To reduce it to the 5 year old level, 2 reasons-
First and foremost, Almost all connections used nowadays are digital.  coaxial cable use an analog signal, but that's usually just to carry a digital signal over long distances (IE, to your cable box).
The difference there is analog acts like a wave.  It weakens the further it travels and the worse the medium.     if it gets weak, the end result is fuzzy.
Digital, though, is just 1s and 0s.  Literally. A series of on states and off states.
If that comes through weaker, it's still just 1s and s.  
So, with digital, it's an all or nothing thing, so, signal quality does not matter as much.            
Secondly,  and this one is why people get so about it, is that all those quality enhancements on monster cables? They are complete lies.  Gold plating does nothing to enhance signal, and almost nothing to enhance the connection.  If they used gold the whole way through, it would, but it would also make the cables heavy and far too expensive to be profitable.     
The extra rubber around the outside? it does nothing for the signal.  Just makes the wires more physically durable.    
Those fancy connector heads? all for show.  They do not enhance signal at all.        
In short, monster cable has always lied about why monster cable was better; In modern times, even if they're promises were true, they'd be irrelevant, because the way we send signals does not care about strength much anymore.          
Oh, and the 200 monster cable is not only indistinguishable in quality from a 4 dollar one-

According to Monster Inc. they learned that high frequency and low frequency signals travel though the cable at slightly different speeds. They created a special type of wrapping for the cables, thicker gauge wire in the center, and thinner gauge but more tightly wrapped on the outside. Basically it slows the high frequency sounds down because they wind up having to travel farther. I've done a side by side comparison with analogue Monster audio cables and regular audio cables, and there was a very noticeable improvement.

JohnSmith1800,"Your airway (trachea) and food ""pipe"" (esophagus) run parallel to each other down your neck. The problem arises because of an evolutionary fluke, the esophagus is behind the trachea. This means that in order for food to get down it, it has to pass over the trachea's opening. If it goes down there, it can obstruct your airway, and you choke (to death is optional).

Normally you don't choke. This is because of a handy flap of tissue at the top back of the trachea, which flops down and covers the opening when you swallow. Most of the time this works and you don't choke, occasionally it doesn't. When it doesn't, the food will undergo one of a few possible outcomes.

It'll usually be expelled by coughing; The lining of the trachea is very sensitive to foreign objects.  For very small particles (or water) it'll pass down into the lungs. Here it will usually be destroyed by macrophages (little cells that absorb stuff, a lot of them hang out in the lungs for just this purpose). Option 3 is that it doesn't come out at all. This may or may not be fatal. For example, bones from meat can lodge in an airway and not actually kill you (although you're at high risk of infection).

afcagroo,"There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.   
   
To broadcast a radio signal, we make an antenna that will resonate at the frequency we want to send. This is done mainly by controlling its length, so that as a wave travels down to the end and bounces back, it does so in a way that provides constructive interference (rather than destructive). The wave in the antenna creates a field that propagates out into space as an electromagnetic wave.  When it hits an antenna of the proper length, it induces a wave in it, and again constructive interference helps to keep it strong enough to be amplified and demodulated.  
  
Electrical current doesn't follow the path of least resistance.  That is an oversimplified saying that is not accurate.  Electrical current follows *all* possible paths, with more current going where there is less resistance.  
  
But in an antenna, there generally isn't a lot of current flow, because there's no place for the current to go. What happens is that the electric *field* propagates down the conductor.

During the classical era, most music was commissioned by people of influence. Nobility, the church, etc would hire the famous Then, the distribution of this music is not like it is today. There were no recordings, so the only way to actually HEAR the music of the time was to hear it performed.

Today, the face of the music is of the performer, because that's what we all can see. It's distributed via TV, radio, and mp3s. We hear the one artist's performance, not one song performed by the local musicians in each town.

maestro2005,"Okay so, nobody here is right.  Not even doovidooves with his 110 upvotes.  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording, and ""classical"" versus ""modern"" isn't the right way to break things down.

First, some terminology.  I'm going to refer to it as ""Classical"" versus ""Popular"".  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music (e.g. Gregorian chant), certain types of Renaissance music (motets, madrigals, etc.), the Baroque period, the Classical period, the Romantic period, and modern periods that we don't quite have the historical context to classify yet.  It continues to be written today.

Popular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created, which today involves the rock combo with guitars, basses, drum sets, keyboards, etc., but includes folk music all the way back.  It actually predates Classical.

Popular music has always been meant to be easily imitable.  In the days before recording, it was meant to be played/sung by amateur musicians in the home, or around the campfire, or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be.  It's simpler music, not that impressive in its composition, so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer.  And usually, there aren't that many performers, which makes it simpler still.

Classical music is not meant to be easily imitated.  The forms are longer and more complicated, and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master.  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits.  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor.  We marvel at the composer's ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece.  We still marvel at the performers, but we marvel more at the composer.  Many people can both write and play Popular music.  Few can play Classical music, and even fewer can write it.

Recording and distribution has changed things a bit.  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular (we do still use that but not exclusively), we can record the world's best Popular musicians and distribute that recording.  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction (see: Metal).

And Classical music has certainly leveraged catchiness to become popular (see: Mozart operas).  So the lines have always been a bit blurry and may have gotten blurrier recently.  But that's the basic distinction.",null,5,cdnlzvj,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,39
49ersFaithfulForLife,"Commercialized music is more about marketing an image and selling an identity than it is about the music itself. It's easier to take a good-looking singer, stylize them and build a brand around their face and name, than it is to do with the songwriters who may have a less marketable image. In some cases, especially in hip hop, the producer's name may be well-known and liked enough that they'll make a point to associate it with the album, but this is an exception to the rule.

For the most part, the music industry doesn't want you to be consciously aware of the fact that the majority of the music you hear isn't written by the performers, but by marketers in suits and ties applying a formula fine-tuned to maximize the likelihood they'll get your fifteen dollars for the album. That doesn't look as good. Yeah, most consumers know or have been told this is the case, but it's not something the consciously think about every time they listen to a song.

Bob Dylan was the first major artist to really cross this bridge--a number of artists popularized his work (e.g. Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--Blowin' in the Wind, The Byrds--Mr Tambourine Man, Jimi Hendrix--All Along the Watchtower) but there was no mistaking how powerful an artist Dylan was once you heard him (with all this non-commercial idiosyncrasies) perform his own compositions.

It's simple, the composer of the classical piece is of course the one to have his name associated with the piece, he/she wrote it. 

The popular artist may not have written the song, but they are performing it, they are the artist and it is on their album. It *does* say on albums who wrote the song. But you know it by the artist who performed it and it appears on their album. For example, it wouldn't make sense to say, ""Thriller"" by Rod Temperton, because it was ""made popular"" by Michael Jackson. Thriller is a part of Michael Jackson's catalogue because it was written specifically ""for him."" He performed it on his album. 

Imagine saying, I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Burt Bacharach. That doesn't make very much sense, but ""I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Dionne Warwick makes sense because she is the performer. Stating the composer tells nothing about the particular version of the song for popular music, where on the other hand: I 'm going to listen to ""Moonlight Sonata"" the performer is not as important because each version will be the exact same rendition of the piece written by Beethoven, who also made it popular.

Classical music has no lyrics, and therefore the only person who stands out is the conductor (someone who doesn't actually play or write the music, rather, interpenetrates between the two). Currently, the main focus is the singer, and therefore they get the credit. Each singer also brings their own interpretation and emotion to the composition, unlike in classical music (or at least to a lesser extent). This means that actual composition it the focus.

2:
If you heard music by Mozart, you never actually heard Mozart play because he couldn't/didn't tour around with his music, it was sent to different orchestras. Each performance was in essence, the same song Mozart wrote, but he had nothing to do with that particular performance. Now we have recordings and easy travel so if you hear one of Katy Perry's songs, chances are it's her singing, not someone else.

3:
Classical music is much longer (generally) and complex than modern music. This means that the composition of the piece is far more important than it is now.

There's even a subreddit for it here: [/r/frisson](http://www.reddit.com/r/frisson)

Frisson is a fear response. You can read about its link to music [here](http://www.thesandb.com/article/science-links-music-to-goose-bumps.html).
This article states that the reasoning behind the ""fear response"" is the ear responding to the ""threat""--aka something similar to the pitch of a scream.

But, now, *what I want to know* is why we feel frisson when we listen to a moving speech, recall a memory, look at a beauty scene etc (something that doesn't necessarily involve a pitch.)

My only guess is that I think, in general, fear is not just overwhelming feelings of being scared, but the basic feeling intended to help you identify change (and thus orient yourself to your surroundings to avoid possible danger.) Perhaps beautiful things can be so striking to us that it fires off a ""noticeable change in the environment"" signal. Even though it's not something that can threaten us, it's something that affects us/causes us to hyper focus our attention so much (and usually so suddenly) that it triggers the same response.

Granite_Maggie,"The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise. Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.

Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.

Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.",null,21,cdnb1pa,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,66

""Among the many potential environmental triggers for T1D, diet has been considered a significant contributing factor [7], [22]. Of the various dietary factors, gluten warrants special mention because epidemiological data suggest that early exposure of infants to cereals containing gluten may increase the risk of T1D.  Rodent studies have supported this claim [24]. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how dietary gluten could facilitate the development of T1D. In the current study, we explored whether alterations in the gut microflora could potentially explain the pro-diabetogenic properties of dietary gluten.""


Celiac is a life threatening response to gluten.  However there isn't much science investigating the responses that aren't as pressing.  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance, which is characterized by a host of symptoms including ""bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain. It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo, among many others."" (from the wiki for gluten sensitivity).  ""Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food."" (from the celiac wiki) The response to gluten obviously falls somewhere on a spectrum, while a lot of the symptoms and pathology of those with celiac and gluten intolerance are the same.

To address your question.. Why do people go on a gluten free diet?  Well, there is obviously a pile of evidence indicating that its consumption correlates with a host of negative health outcomes.  To which part of that pile any one person pays attention may vary, and they may only have heard that such research exists and not done any investigation personally.

So..there's tons of studies for this, and tons against it.  I dont work with autisic kids but my son is autistic and we do things with the autism society here in my town, so i know MANY special needs kids and their parents that are advocates of this theory, and say it helps.

Apparently due to the creation of genetically modified crops of wheat to make the wheat more resistant to pests and the fact that this heartier strain of wheat has essentially spread everywhere it is the only wheat available. Hence you're hearing about more people who can't properly digest what was a staple food for thousands of years. Though gluten is in other things such as rye, oats, and maltodextrin (which may be a wheat product) so I'm not terribly sure how those fit into the hearty wheat theory.

legowife,"As a diet (as in a way you eat to lose weight) it's a fad. Replacing non-gluten free foods with gluten free foods has no garuntee to make you lose weight. One caveat however is that if you do not replace wheat bread and other gluten products with a comparable gluten free product (which are often higher in calories and sugar) then the likelyhood is that you will have actually entered into a low/lower carb diet than you were eating previously and maybe even a lower calorie diet purely because you are avoiding foods with gluten and haven't replaced them with something else. Low carb diets do have a great track record for weight loss. Whether it is a healthy method or not is a matter of some debate.

On the flip side, the gluten free diet (as in what you eat to live and sustain yourself long term) is imperative for people with Celiacs who are directly allergic to it, and some other conditions like crohns which are deeply irritated by the gluten protein, and it can also be beneficial for those who have or suspect they may have other digestive sensitivities as they work with their doctor to eliminate possible causes.

In no case is purchasing a gluten free product a necessity for eating gluten free as the number of foods that are naturally gluten free is enormous, but it does make the transition easier for some.

One additional note is that the fda recently ruled on how much gluten something could contain and still be called gluten free which is one reason(among many others including taking advantage of the fad) why gf stickers and labels have begun to get slapped onto everything even products that one should assume are gf by nature.

Human beings are far from the most physically powerful animals. A human living alone in the wild is putting himself at great risk and has a statistically lower chance of surviving. So, our evolutionary survival strategy is cooperation. One human in the wild might be weak, but 150 humans? The chances of survival drastically increase. Throughout history we have seen countless examples of the society that cooperates more out competing societies that focus on the individual. It's how the Romans were able to defeat the Gauls so easily. A single roman soldier couldn't hope to defeat a single Gaul warrior. But put two or more of those discipined Romans together, and something happens.  They become stronger than two individuals. They become a synergy: where the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Thus, the people who have a natural inclination to cooperate with each other are more likely to survive and pass those traits to their offspring. Now to your question. 

In order to survive and thrive, a stable home is needed. Our ancestors survived due to a stable home and family unit. The desire for a stable and lasting home was passed down to us.

MistaSchlong,"Ok, so you know about digital devices.  Think about a binary switch: something that just turns on and off.  That's what a neuron does: it just turns on and off.  At the end of a neuron, there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too.  These signals are made of molecules, and we call these molecules neurotransmitters.  We won't need to talk about these neurotransmitters, but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them, they're really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn on.

OK, your brain is made of neurons.  (It's also made of other types of cells, but the most simple, straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail.)  ""Knowledge,"" is stored in these neurons.  Now, because a neuron can only, essentially, turn on and off, the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easier.

Making the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms.  You can make the neuron more ""sensitive"" to neurotransmitters.  (This can, for instance, happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor.)  Likewise, you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing ""sensitivity"" to neurotransmitters.

Note: you may have heard of the term Action Potential.  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns on.

Now, knowing that a neuron can turn on and off, and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off, I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar.  Chords are made up of notes, and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings.  Basically turning them on or keeping them off.

However, and this is the key, with just a few chords, you can play millions of different songs.  It's just about how the chords are played; the timing, the tempo, the coordination.  Similarly, the firing of neurons, on and off, in combination, generates recall of stored knowledge.  And knowledge is stored in how easily or difficult these neurons are fired on and off.",null,0,cdnep8v,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

airor,"The memories are stored in the pattern of sequences your neurons fire throughout your brain.  

A single neuron will tend to fire at a rate determined by the neurons attached to it, so groups (cortical columns) of neurons tend to fire at the same time and at a steady rate.  This rate can be influenced by other groups of neurons firing at nearly the same rate such that the two groups start to synchronize.  Patterns form as the different rates compete for synchronization throughout your brain.  

Some of your neurons are directly connected and influenced by sensory input and tend to sync to that input.  Due to the feedback of all the other neuron groups the input can be predicted: the pattern is recognized and other groups start performing the pattern that is the expected future sequence of input.  The brain is built to allow for many layers of this pattern recognition dance, each layer ""predicting"" the future output by simply repeating the patterns that occurred the previous times it received that input.

When the pattern is 'confirmed' and the input really does follow the expectation, the two groups stay in synchronization and new connections are made to strengthen that pattern.  When dissonance occurs and the input does not match with a group, the connections to that group weaken.  So in effect your brain evolves the connections between neuron groups that correctly predict the future.

How is that a stored memory?  There are areas of your brain that can 'fake' sensory input into the system and let it perform it's dance.  This ability gives us the power to imagine situations and remember previous input.  The feedback and the flurry of patterns that emerge as we 'think' is horrendously complex and not well understood because we can't reproduce how it actually works.

DeweyCheatemHowe,"The expense comes from legal fees and expert fees. 

Once the state declares it's intention to seek the death penalty, a defendant will automatically be appointed not only an attorney (assuming he's indigent), but probably a couple attorneys as well as a mitigation investigator. That person will go back to the defendants roots and dug up everything they can from the persons life that would help sway a jury to recommend life. There will likely be a sanity commission to determine whether he is competent to stand trial, consisting of several doctors. 

The state is also hiring experts, and will be spending extra man hours to ensure everything goes exactly right so a later court has no reason to reverse. Same thing goes for the trial court. 

So all that happens before trial. Day one of trial starts an exhausting version of the standard jury selection. Before the normal process starts, each juror may need to be media qualified (have they been biased by prior coverage of the case), and will need to be death qualified (whether they could vote for death under some set if facts or are they too against the death penalty to consider). Only then can the attorneys start regular jury selection. 

Trial will probably run 1-2 weeks. If guilty, then the jury comes back and hears testimony about the mitigating an aggravating factors (this is where that investigators work becomes relevant). Then they will vote on life/death. 

If death, (at least in my state) the defendant gets an auto appeal to the state Supreme Court. He will be appointed a different attorney for this, who will have to learn the case, go through the whole deal. Defendant argues anything and everything that he says went wrong from the moment the crime happened. 

If affirmed, he can petition the US Supreme Court to hear his case. Unlikely here. Then he starts state post conviction. New attorney, goes back to arguing constitutional challenges in the same court he was convicted. If affirmed, back to state Supreme Court and the petitioning the US Supremes.

 If he hasn't managed a new trial yet, he will file a petition for habeas corpus in fed district court, again arguing constitutional issues. If affirmed, he can go to the appellate court, and then petition the US Supreme Ct again. 

Only when the supremes deny his petition or affirm does his conviction become ""final."" Meanwhile, this whole time he's been housed in an ultra secure area of the prison by himself, rather than in the GP. 

Every appeal (except US Supreme Ct and maybe US Appeals) are of right. He gets them regardless, and taxpayers are paying his attorneys and fees (think of all the copies, for instance). If any court finds a a significant error, process restarts. Also, it's in the defendants best interest to fight to delay all of these, waiting for new rulings, new facts, or just more days on earth. 

Most defendants will then file some sort of 1983 claim alleging that the method of execution is unconstitutional. Usually some interest group pays his fees here, but the people still pay the state and the federal judge that'll hear it. 

Overall, it's not hard to see how the costs pile up.

AshRandom,"The claim that is so often trotted out, is that there are a tremendous number of man-hours spent by lawyers and judges during the appeals process. While this claim is true for a single event, it's not as meaningful as one might imagine, especially when the total ledger is examined. 

A death sentence trial, with appeals, when totaled up in number of days averages around 1500, as compared to about 500 days for a life sentence. Three times as much. But the kicker is, recidivism. Yes. Recidivism! The term used to describe a failure, the failure to reform criminals, who serve their time and go free, only to end up back in jail as repeat offenders. The recidivism rate in the U.S. within three years of being released is over 70% in every state. [B.J.S. Bureau of Justice Recidivism Statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=17) 

Combine a multitude of trials, for a multitude of crimes, with the additional cost of medical care, feeding, housing and guarding felons for decades during their terms, and suddenly executing criminals comes out as a bargain. With the overwhelmingly obvious, sparkle covered bonus prize of zero additional victims. 

The big question of course, is should we allow the state to have the power to kill people. The answer to that question, has absolutely nothing to do with cost. It is a question of human rights.

Brelya,"The death penalty in most states results in a bifurcated trial where the same jury (most of the time) sit through two ""trials"". The first is the guilt phase where they decided whether to convict a person.  The second is the penalty phase where the State and defense counsel each present relevant evidence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances so that finally the jury may decide whether that particular defendant should get the death penalty.

Defense counsel should invest a lot of time in looking for mitigating information prior to the case even going to trial because if convincing enough and if in the right place, the State may waive seeking the death penalty.

In some states the decision to impose death is then automatically reviewed by the State's supreme court for a proportionality review. They decide whether this person truly deserves the penalty in light of every other defendant that has received it.

During this time, appeals and post-conviction motions run wild. The defendant can assert many claims such as : ineffective assistance of counsel, unfair trial, etc. There are many avenues to have not only state courts but federal courts to review the case and claims the defendant might have. In every instance the State most likely will defend their position.

The prosecution (State) is financed by the state government and where the defendant is being represented by public defenders, that is also financed by the state government.

It is a long and arduous process but it costs money because **death is different**. It is a lot more sensitive and dangerous to put someone's life on the line without making sure the process is fair. That includes hiring of many experts on both sides to help prove/disprove the case.",null,0,cdneepo,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
benofepmn,"After a lengthy jury trial with two phases, one for guilt and one for punishment, that results in a death sentence, the defendant has a lot of due process rights to exhaust before he can get executed. First, is a direct appeal to the state's high court. After the conviction is affirmed, the defendant can then ask for postconviction relief such as a writ of habeas corpus. When that is denied, he can appeal. If the denial is affirmed on appeal, his state remedies are exhausted, but he still can't get executed. 

Now, he can go to federal court and ask for habeas corpus relief. When that is denied, he can appeal. Then he can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. When they choose not to hear the case, the defendant often tries desperate measures such as contesting the method of execution or claiming that there is newly discovered evidence that warrants a new trial.

All these appeals and due process take time. Transcripts of proceedings need to be ordered and created. Briefs need to be researched and written. Oral arguments are heard. The courts' written decisions need to be researched and written. This results in these appeals taking years.

Lizzipp,"Because if you want to kill someone, you've got to be *really really certain* they're guilty. An innocent person who was sentenced to life in prison could come out twenty years later when DNA evidence shows they were innocent, or the guilty party comes forward, or they could successfully appeal. That's not *ideal*, of course, but the point is it's not irreversible, where the death penalty is. If someone's been sentenced to death, you want to get all your appealing done *before* the sentence is carried out, and you have to delay it for as long as possible to ensure no one is going to come forward with new evidence that could potentially re-open the case, and also you *want* to delay it for as long as possible - you're going to demand every single appeal and retrial and whatever you can because at the end of all that you're going to die. You're going to be the biggest pain in the arse you possibly could.

Add to this the fact that the death penalty isn't legal in most countries, and in the ones that it is which are also a functioning democracy (the US) it's only legal in a handful of places. Say you commit your crime in Texas and flee to the UK, even if you're arrested in the UK you've got to be extradited back to Texas with is an extremely lengthy and therefore expensive process. The touchy nature of the subject is a real hindrance, since lots of countries believe the death penalty is immoral and may refuse to extradite someone if they believe they would face execution, in the same way they do for potential torture victims.

Also, ""life in prison"" is not always *life* in prison. Where I'm from, ""life in prison"" more often means 25-30 years although you can be sentenced to a ""whole life order"", which means there's no possibility of parole. It can easily take fifteen, twenty, thirty years on death row before the actual execution, maybe even more. So although the cost of an execution itself is pretty low, you're already adding that to what's essentially a life sentence, and that's before you take into account the cost of thirty year's worth of legal work.

poppop_n_theattic,"The level of judicial process to execute someone is much higher than for a life sentence, for three main reasons.  First, you cannot take back an execution.  Second, the public wants to believe that we only execute guilty people.  Third, the Supreme Court has said that only certain crimes and criminals are eligible for execution under the 8th Amendment, so there are additional legal issues in death cases that are not present in life-sentence cases.  The result is a very expensive legal process that usually goes on for years.  This is all aggravated by the fact that states often appoint lawyers who are inexperienced, underfunded, and in over their heads to represent capital defendants in their initial trials.  This leads to subsequent challenges that the trial was unfair due to inadequacy of counsel.

If you have a Death Penalty case, they will automatically get an appeal ($2M), and will probably take at least 10 years before execution.  So your cost to house is less ($500k).  So you are looking at $2.5M as a starting figure vice the the initial $2M.

MisterFiftyFifty,"The Cuban Missile Crisis began, basically, as a combined result of two things: the Cuban Revolution that had happened fairly recently (1959), and NATO missiles that were placed in Turkey. 

The Cuban Revolution overthrew a particularly brutal dictator, Fulgencio Batista, who was backed by the U.S. basically because he was anti-communist. Once this happened, the Soviet Union saw a great opportunity for an ally: a communist nation led by a widely popular and charismatic leader (Fidel Castro) on the front doorstep of your arch-nemesis.

The missiles in Turkey were widely believed to be pointed at the heart of Soviet Russia, as Turkey is in a strategically valuable spot for doing so with ICBMs. The Soviets needed a counterbalance to this, and they saw it in the form of Cuba. 

What went down in a nutshell is that the U.S. noticed these huge missiles 90 miles from their coast, and through diplomatic maneuvering (and a naval blockade of Cuba) by President Kennedy and his entourage, convinced the Soviets to back off and remove the missiles in exchange for the missiles in Turkey being removed (they were later replaced by nuclear submarines anyways). No one wanted a nuclear war, despite the large amount of dick measuring that went on in the Cold War.


I'm not exactly sure what you mean in how the Cuban Missile Crisis connected into Vietnam. Vietnam was a completely different situation, and *official* involvement did not start until 1964, two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis. While the latter was more of a direct threat to America itself, Vietnam was somewhat more of a political gamble to stop the spread of communism, as had been done in Korea (though only halfway). As far as I know, Fidel in Cuba had little interest in Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh was more concerned with reuniting his country, though I'm sure they would have rooted for each other.",null,0,cdnbvj8,1rhek9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

For starters, Spielberg doesn't always write his own stuff. So the first thing he does is look for inspiration. Then he gets together with a writer to come up with a treatment. He takes the treatment to the studios and tries to sell it.

Assuming the studios want it, they'll ""greenlight"" it ... that is, draw up contracts, assign a budget, and agree on certain dates (like start of production, completion of principle photography, target release date, ect). They'll usually have ""notes"" or suggestions, like asking him to work with a particular writer or using the film as a vehicle for a star they have under a multi-film contract.

Once the contracts are signed, pre-production starts. This is where the script gets hashed out completely. At the same time, people are sent out to scout locations. Sometimes they plan of filming on location, other times they just take pictures to build the sets somewhere else. They start working on wardrobe concepts and set dressings and all that jazz.

Once the script is pretty close to finished, Spielberg give his shortlist for actors to the casting agent, and they see if any are available. If not, they move down the list and/or hold open casting sessions. Meanwhile, he starts storyboarding the script and comparing it to the location info that his team gathered up.

Once the actors are set, they agree on a date to start working, and then begin actually building all the sets and securing the rights to film in the locations they've chosen. They also hire a studio to start early work on special effects, like the big space battle and the alien ships or whatever.

They will bring the actors in for costume fittings, promotional shots, and script readings. They might walk through the sets and talk about the scenes that will go on there, and spend a little time getting to know areas that they're supposed to be familiar with.

The big day comes. They have the sets looking just the way they want, the actors are in their trailers, the script is good and the actors are satisfied, craft services have snacks out for everyone, the lighting department has everything perfect, the camera crew are set, it's the start of principle photography.

This is the easy part. You have a list of shots that need to be completed. They're usually organized for convenience, rather than the order they'll appear on the screen. Like if you have three scenes in a particular house that all take place at different times in the movie, they'll all be filmed in the same general time-frame, with wardrobe and lighting and set changes as necessary.

There's also a second and sometimes a third team of actors and directors working on things like tracking shots (where you can't see the actors close enough to notice it's really their stunt double) and insert shots (like a close-up of Batman grabbing something off his utility belt) where it doesn't really matter whose hand it is.

Once all the shots are ""in the can"" they move on to editing all the footage together into a film. The actors are free to go work on other projects. Now Spielberg is in a little room with his editor, a screen, and a tool for cutting and splicing film. They look for the best takes, and the best lengths for each scene. It's usually around this time that scoring and special effects work begins. (Some bigger FX-heavy movies, they send the scenes for special effects as soon as they have the actor's parts shot, instead of dumping the whole film on them at once.)


So he has FX shots coming in on a regular basis, he has the composer coming in to look at scenes and get a feel for things, and then returning with music, which he adds to the scenes. If necessary, he'll bring the actors back to shoot new scenes or record new dialogue. Maybe the wind was muffling the mic, maybe he decided he needs a scene where someone else builds a mashed potato mountain, stuff like that.

Once he has the cut he likes, he shows it to the studio. The contract will determine who has the final say in the film's edit. Spielberg has a lot of clout, so he generally will get his own way. Some films go to test at this point, where they bring in an audience and gauge their reaction. This might result in new edits or other changes, and it can also take them back to reshooting scenes again if necessary.

Once the studio, the audience, the director, the producer, the editor, the composer, and everyone else is happy, they create a master print of the finished product. This is usually the version of the film that gets screened at festivals and such. 

Around this time is when director and actor commentary gets recorded, usually at some festival or other promotional event.

Then the studio takes the master and uses it to print the copies that get sent out to theaters. This is generally about the time TV advertising starts. The promo shots were probably already released, but they'll use some of those to make posters and print ads and whatnot. 

The studio has a deal with theater chains, where they get a certain cut of ticket sales (on a sliding scale, the more recent the film, the higher the cut the studio takes). They send out the films, the people pour in, they buy lots of popcorn and snacks that the theaters actually use to stay in business, and the reviews start.

Meanwhile they use a copy of the master to get the DVD/Bluray production going. They slap in the commentary and other special features and schedule a release date.",null,0,cdn9iwx,1rh9u2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

C47man,"The reason we have airspeed and groundspeed is because they serve different purposes. For an airplane to gain lift (fly) it has to move through the air at a certain speed so that the wings will work. To make sure we are at that speed and not coming close to falling below it, we measure airspeed. This is how fast the plane is moving through the air. If air never moved anywhere and stayed in the same place all the time, then airspeed and groundspeed would be the same thing. However, air also moves! We all know that. We call it wind! The airplane is a part of the air mass in the same way that a fish is a part of the water mass. A fish can swim through the water at a certain speed *relative to the water*, but if that water is itself moving with respect to the earth, then fish's speed with respect to the earth is *also* changed the same amount. So if our airplane (a sky-fish!) in the air is flying north at 50mph through the air, and the air itself is moving 10mph *south* relative to the earth, then we have two speeds happening to our aircraft. We are going north at 50mph through air, but only 40mph over the ground, because the air itself is pulling us back as we move forward!

Groundspeed allows us to calculate how long it will take us to arrive at a given destination, and is particularly important so we can make calculations for fuel consumption. Our airspeed is important because the plane will behave differently in the air depending on its speed. Too fast and we could stress or damage the airframe. Too slow and we risk losing lift and ""stalling"", which is basically falling out of the sky (don't worry, we can recover from those easily!).",null,1,cdn8ayt,1rh898,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

justthisoncenomore,"There are two reasons why moving things ""with your mind"" without assistance, some kind of augmentation, or a physical connection is ""impossible"".

1.) There is no mechanism.  In order for something to move, some kind of force has to act on it.  Visualizing something moving doesn't itself create a force, and there's no known way, other than moving your arms/legs/robotic prosthesis, or ordering someone to move theirs, to jump that gap.  

2.) It takes energy.  Even if you had a mechanism, unless you're violating the conservation of energy, you'd need to somehow transfer energy to the object to be moved/manipulated. This might seem trivial if it's just moving a pencil, but if you want to be able to lift a 200 lbs person, or a 10,000 lbs boulder, you'd need to expend at least the number of calories that would be required to move it through normal action.

Many Ukranians see entry into the EU as a step forward in economy, job creation, mobility, development, etc.  This is because several postsoviet states, including the baltic states and Poland, have experienced growth and prosperity over the past couple decades because of the EU.  Things like increased foreign investment to develop infrastructure and create jobs and better chances for emigration would directly affect the standard of living for the individual.

Ukraine is a major postsoviet state.  It is contiguous with russia.  Russia is attempting to create a regional organization cum economic bloc comparative with the EU to compete with it and increase its influence.  However, being part of this is not well thought of in Ukraine, well, in most postsoviet states because Russians, who dominated the soviet governments, badly mismanaged nationalisms and resource distribution under the soviet system.  For non-russians, the soviet system was, in a simplified analogy, simply a new imperialism.  As well, Western Europe has more capital for investment and more opportunities to offer.

If Russia cannot convince the Ukraine to join its regional organization, it basically means the organization will be geographically fragmented and, well, not very sensible.  Russian politicians have put political pressure on the Ukraine to join their bloc rather than the EU by threatening to renegotiate their gas sales, which the Ukrainian energy infrastructure is dependent upon.

When you're tired you have less energy to go around and you become more aware of how much energy it takes your eyes to see. It's easy to underestimate how sophisticated our vision can be. From scanning the words to this answer to adjusting for the distance of your computer screen and the light it emits, your eyes do a LOT of work that goes for the most part unnoticed. 

To rest your eyes, close them gently and cover them with the palms of your hands, cupped to cover them without squishing but still giving them a break in the darkness. Also, it is easier for eyes to diverge (look far away) than converge (look closely), so when doing a lot of reading take frequent breaks to look out the window or across the room. Deep breathing to relax is also helpful, as sometimes we tense up when concentrating and don't realize it.

Alkaven5,"Joseph Kony is a real person, and he's pretty obviously done some terrible things, so the idea of stopping Kony is a good one. However, the viral video publicizing his actions and the charity behind it were majorly flawed. 

Kony leads the Lord's Resistance Army, a violent religious group that is known for creating thousands of child soldiers and child prostitutes and for breaking apart many more families. Unfortunately, we don't know too much more than that. Because he's a criminal and on the run, the facts about Kony are mysterious and questionable. For example, did he create 60,000 child soldiers, or 30,000, or far less? What countries did he operate in and when? Kony was rumored to be dead multiple times, although he's actually still alive--he might be about to surrender to the Central African Republic government, but even that is questionable.

However, the video about Kony 2012 didn't address any of this uncertainty and used outdated and exaggerated information to convey its message. One of the largest flaws was the focus on Uganda; while Kony has spent quite some time in Uganda, he hasn't been there in years, and has instead spent his time in various African countries. Essentially, the video was far more propaganda piece than it was documentary. Furthermore, the charity funding isn't very good quality; few enough of the donations went to stopping Kony or helping his victims.

Kony 2012 brought JK to the public's attention, but the poor quality of the messenger caused the movement to flop. People who had never heard of the issue watched the video and became passionate about stopping Kony; when they learned that they had been misled, they dropped the cause entirely (to be fair, it's a foreign political issue that the average American can't do much about anyway.) So, the general public now feels quite sour about the issue.

Another common use is to save hardware costs by having one computer do jobs you might ordinarily spread across multiple computers.

allahsnackbars,"The computer is essentially a small device called the CPU (Central Processing Unit) plus other devices which the CPU can communicate with. Since those peripheral devices are optional, we'll discuss the simplest emulation possible and then I'll explain how it can grow to become more complex.

So it all starts with _just_ emulating (there are a lot of ways to sandbox object code it doesn't _have_ to be emulation but the general process is the same) a CPU. The CPU is a device which retrieves a series of _instructions_ from a source and responds to those instructions. Instructions can be a series of statements (done in order) like so:


Add 5 to x


add y to x


subtract 6 from y


Where X &amp; Y are small sections of memory inside of the CPU. In a real CPU (the x86\x64 architecture) these instructions are a lot more complex and there are also many more complex instructions.


These instructions and encoded into a series of bits and then stored in a location (usually the RAM) where they are read from by the CPU. The CPU uses a series of logical hardware gates (and, or, xor etc...) to decode these instructions and perform their respective task.


To emulate the CPU, one does the exact same thing, except rather than using a physical CPU, they are using a program which reads a series of bits, decodes them as instructions and executes them in a sandboxed environment (emulating also the temporary storage locations X &amp; Y.)


Now that the CPU has been emulated, and as the CPU is the device which reaches out and communicates with the peripheral devices (USB interfaces, SATA\IDE (storage), VGA (video) the communication with the emulated CPU can also itself be emulated.


This results in emulated RAM, etc.

lumpy_potato,"OK, so you are you.

You can, at any given point in time, imagine a box. You might paint this box pink with white stripes.

Now, you decide to imagine several boxes, all pink with white stripes. You can imagine as many such boxes as you can remember at a time. The more complex the boxes get, the harder it might be to remember them all and keep them all out there at the same time.

A VM works in roughly the same way - you have one physical machine, one set of physical hardware. The VM Software works to create a 'virtual' machine, that lives in its own little sandbox and accesses a portion of the hardware you have. You might have a quad core CPU and 16 GB of RAM. You could then set up a VM sandbox with 1 core and 4GB of RAM. You could do 4 of those sitting side by side without any issue at all.

Your example is very common - you have a physical server, and rather than trying to set up multiple booted OS's on that server, you virtualize - now instead of needing one server per OS, you just use VM to do it instead. This is easier, and management can make life easy as well - I can set up a base image (the pink box with stripes) and just start new VM instances with that pink box, and know it will look like all the other pink striped boxes.

Depending on how its configured, you could have multiple users remoting into multiple virtual machines. You could *also* remote into the physical machine. A sysadmin would likely have control over the physical machines *and* virtual machines, while the users might only have access to one or more virtual machines at any given time.

What I've used VMs for personally is I have a stock Ubuntu image I have through VMWorkstation. When I need to do web work, I spin up a new VM to play with. Once I have it stable, I save that down as a new 'baseline' image. Now if I ever needed to re-create that baseline apache build, I just create a new VM machine from that image.

If I need to mess around with something, I just clone from my existing VM Machine, fuck with it, and if I break it, its no big deal, I still have my original setup safe in an image.

Depending on my hardware, I might be able to run many VMs at the same time. Maybe I can only run a few of them at the same time. There is a lot more to VMs as far as hardware configuration that I'm not familiar with, but if you are interested check out /r/sysadmin or /r/techsupport and see if the guys there can shed more technical light on VMs.",null,1,cdn3kxd,1rgtek,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

sir_sri,"&gt; I've read that you need to do a SEO and make back ends? 

What *YOU* need is to find a company in your area that does SEO, and pay them to do it for you.

So a couple of things to keep in mind:  any time SEO actually works it means the search algorithm is defective.  So you're gaming the system only until someone fixes the algorithm.  That said, you gotta do what you gotta do, and Google specifically makes a defect in its search algorithm - called adwords, and they're happy to sell you access.

The SEO company is going to do a few things, they're going to follow a guide like this one (not mine)

http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/05/12/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-google-adwords/

and they're going to buy a bunch of adwords for your business with your money.  Basically this is a competitive bidding process, if you're competitors are doing the same thing you're going to be stuck in a bidding war.  Sorry to say.  There are a few minor things that need to happen here too, your website will need to be properly configured to be easily searchable by google and have the right keywords in it.  

The second thing that's going to happen, and this is really what you need a SEO for, is you're going to start getting reviews of your business, you're going to need mentions in blogs etc.  Fairly basically this is the bread and butter of SEO.  Making shit up.  How many yelp reviews does your business have?  Whatever it is, multiply it by 10.  Lots of people had 4-5 star experiences at your business.  It doesn't matter if you sell coffee that smells like sewage, dozens or hundreds of people love it.  

The next thing that needs to happen is that you're going to do advertising beyond just 'google'.  Probably this is obvious enough, but if such things exist you're going to want to have your site featured on 'meta' sites.  Things like a local business association - you're now a member and you have your webpage linked.  You have a facebook page, a twitter page an instagram page etc. that are all full of keywords and that point to your main website.  The more legitimate places host ads for your site, the more google will see things pointing at your site the higher you will rank.  

The reason I recommend finding a local company is that it's important to have someone you can meet face to face with, that knows the local geography, terminology and your competitors.  If people in your area do searches based on neighbourhood names or street names or something else you need to know that, and a local outfit is more likely to be better at that than some random company in another state/province/country that doesn't know anything about your area or your business.

Currently, there is nothing that can't air on broadcast television. The networks are expected to check themselves and if they go too far from what a common person would find offensive, the network may lose advertisers or face FCC fines. The networks push the limits when they feel it is safe to do so. For example, the TV show Friends had been wanting to say ""vagina"" in the show, but the network censors, for the first few years didn't allow it. After a few years and many scripts trying to slip the word in, the censors decided to allow the word.

The party in general, particular politicians who need it.  He could be at the point of starting to raise money for his presidential library, but more than likely he's just doing a party fundraiser.


&gt;Who pays for

The line between politicking and doing ones job as an elected official is not trivial to draw.  The US has rules about what can and cannot be paid for, but ultimately if a politician flies to the other side of the country, gives a speech and talks to a bunch of legislators and then has a dinner where everyone at the dinner just happened to spend 1000 dollars a plate to be in the same room how much of the travel costs etc belong to whom?

For the president, security is basically with him whatever he's up to.  There's no way around it, and there's no reasonable way to expect him to pay for those sorts of costs.  But then not a lot of people get that level of protection either, and it's one of the 'perks' of the job.  ",null,0,cdn4o4n,1rgqg2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

sir_sri,"&gt;Are they just not even trying to pay their taxes?

Well sometimes that's the case. 

The thing is, as others have pointed out, being rich is actually quite complicated.  Most rich people build up to the process, you own a local store, then you own 2 stores, then 5, then 50, then 500.  Or you invest in one place, then 10 then 100 or whatever.  Or you just own one business and that's it for your career.  

Athletes, celebrities and lottery winners all have a problem, athletes particularly because you are at a young age with no experience with money handed a fortune.  You don't know what to do with it and you don't even know who to ask.  So you try and hire accountants and lawyers and the problem is you don't have the skills to know the good ones from the bad.  Most americans can't do their taxes coming out of highschool for a 30k a year job, when it's 3 million earned in lots of places with all sorts of complexity you basically hire an accountant, follow their advice and hope you don't fuck it up.  Assuming you know enough to even do that. 

Wesley Snipes got himself an advisor who didn't believe income tax was legal - which as you can imagine the IRS does not agree with.  So Snipes was in a world of trouble.  

Now in the case of athletes they are in the worst of it, because your career doesn't usually gradually slide into oblivion, you make 10 million dollars one year, and 0 the next, or you get injured part way through, cannot play anymore, and suddenly your lifestyle that expected making  X million dollars before you retire at age 30 now has you trying to make do with 15% of X.  Or 2% of X or whatever.  And you're boned.  

Actors can just keep working, even if you get less money you at least can make something by doing more movies and commercials and you can make bad movies or take your clothes off, do stage work etc.  

Lottery winners and athletes though, they have no idea what to do.  The guy at H&amp;R block you pay 40 bucks to do your taxes isn't going to talk to you if you have millions in income.  So you need advisors and you have very poor prospects for long term income.  

Add to that divorces, failed business ventures, theft by crooked advisors and well, you get the idea.  When you have a lot of money and you get a pet project (think 38 studios) that you hope will keep you going for years and it fails suddenly you can't pay your bills and part of that ends up being taxes.

Snafu_Coaxer_2013,"A lot of these answers ignore the fact that that profit rarely translates into the ability to takeover other companies if you're a listed, public company. Spyker, for example, bought Saab (briefly), despite Spyker being a tiny company.

The reasoning is completely economic. If your cars are cheaper and you sell more, you're going to have bigger facilities and spend more on things like research. Lamborghini (if they were independent) aren't going to have the scale to effectively invest in R&amp;D without outsourcing it. But R&amp;D can be pretty much equally used by all car marques (i.e. it would be more efficient for Volkswagen and Lamborghini to share research as their research needs aren't all that different).

So a company with a lot of facilities like Volkswagen or BMW is going to be able to make better, cheaper cars than a company like Lamborghini. But that's not why people buy Lamborghini's, they buy them for the name and values of the brand: they buy them because they want a sports car with the character of a Lamborghini. So if Volkswagen made a car to compete with Lamborghini, it might be faster and more efficient and cheaper, but it likely won't make much of a dent in Lamborghini's sales. If Lamborghini makes a good car, it will probably cut in to Ferrari's sales, however.

So from that, logically, If Volkswagen bought Lamborghini, Lamborghini would better compete with Ferrari, and Volkswagen itself wouldn't lose any sales because their brand doesn't compete in the same markets as Lamborghini. So Lamborghini makes better cars, and Volkswagen gets more market coverage for their entire portfolio. ",null,0,cdn9hhs,1rgppg,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

However, unions can allow easier access to striking, which can massively damage a business, because the union wants to gain some sort of benefit to its members.

thatssoright,"Unions in the United States came about as a response to some particularly harsh working conditions that workers were subjected to back in the late 1800's-early 1900's when the industrial revolution was getting into full swing. Mostly manufacturing and labor intensive jobs. Workers were treated as interchangeable. In some cases they were paid in  Company Money that could only be used in company stores. Essentially, you belonged to the company. Labor Unions began as a natural response. The individual may be interchangeable, but the workforce as a whole is not. This led to some very bloody confrontations before the US government eventually stepped in and the existence of a labor unions and protections were added. Other countries have their own similar stories with somewhat equivalent time-frames.

The pros of having a union - In theory, all workers are treated equally and fairly. The company makes an agreement with the employees and the union is supposed to safeguard that agreement. Things like working hours, overtime, work conditions, training, disciplinary measures, layoffs and terminations are all usually spelled out in a legally binding contract. In some of the skilled trade professions (Electrical, Plumbing, etc) being Union Certified used to mean you were current on your training, and generally knew what you are doing.

The Cons - Everyone is treated and viewed exactly the same, regardless of how hard or well they work. The pay scale is the same for everyone in the same job title as you and the only way to earn more money is to work whatever overtime is offered. EVERYTHING is based on seniority. If there is training available but not everyone can attend at once, better hope you have high enough seniority. Volunteers for overtime? Better hope you have been there long enough. Layoffs? Better hope you aren't one of the low guys on the totem pole. Job opens up in another department? Not yours if the the guy who sleeps half the day and can barely do his job puts in for it and has even one day more seniority than you.


I am a bit biased against unions. I worked in one for 3 years and then worked along side that same union for the next 12. From what I could tell, they do nothing but push mediocrity. I regularly heard union stewards tell people to stop working so hard because it made others look bad. When companies started outsourcing, the response was to show the company just how good an idea that was by organizing work stoppages on a regular basis. Most unions have become just as bad as the big businesses they rally against. They protect their own interests and not the interests of their members.

Having said that, I am mildly surprised (and I think it speaks to the mindset of most unions) that non-government union membership hasn't started to go up in the last 5 years with how large corporations have been treating the employee base. ",null,0,cdn7qun,1rgngc,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

eideid,"First off, your definition of species is a lie which continues to be repeated, particularly by high-school science teachers. There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. Most organisms aren't sexual and even then, there are countless examples of organisms which can and sometimes even do interbreed with fertile offspring, but their populations are generally separate enough that we treat them as separate species (for an example, look at polar bears and northern grizzly bears).

In paleontology, the general rule is, ""Is there another thing out there which has been discovered which would be difficult to distinguish from this thing that I just discovered?"". If we were to find modern dogs in the ancient archaeological record, we would think they were all separate species, but we currently think of them as all members of a single species. There have been fairly recent reports of skull analyses which might call into question how many early hominid species there really were.

DoggoneCat,"While I agree with eideid's comments, I'm going to take a little different approach, starting first with extant species. Where eideid says, 
&gt; ""There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. ""

I would say that there are several acceptable definitions of species, and all are rather context dependent. If two species are asexual but closely related, how do we determine if they are species or subspecies (races or breeds in some contexts, but not others)? What about two groups of organisms that appear nearly identical but are separated (say on different continents)? They can't (naturally) interbreed. There are literally dozens of scenarios we could suggest to snag someone stuck on a simple definition. So, we use morphology, behavior, and increasingly, genetics, to test hypotheses about the relationships between extant species. I don't know that I'd call the decision-makers, ""high prestige scientific committees"". A single author, publishing a convincing set of evidence may decide to split a previously single species into 2 or more. If her argument is sound, and the data support it, ""consensus"" in the scientific community may simply be that other authors cite the work and accept the argument. Some taxa have a richer history of committee decision however. Birds have long had a devoted following, and there are numerous large and prestigious organizations which have committees that review the literature on taxonomy and vote on what the official relationship will be. So each year, the American Ornithologists Union publishes an update to their official checklist based on the decisions of the committee. 

When we consider extinct species we have much less data to go on, both quantitatively (the number of fossilized examples of a putative species) and qualitatively (the different types of evidence). There are no behavior observations, though we might make some inferences. There may be no usable genetic material. There are rarely skin, or feathers... anything to compare looks. We might only be left with a partial skeleton. At that point, paleontologists measure, and compare, and hunt for more fossils and do the best they can to make informed decisions. Often, someone coming along 10-100 years later, having much more data at hand, will revise those initial findings to a greater or lesser degree. It is messy, and somewhat subjective, but the idea is to apply any and all new, relevant information and to try and let the data suggest the most parsimonious answer - that is, the simplest answer is generally the most likely unless you have data to the contrary.

""Dr. Serrador and team recruited 13 healthy adult volunteers. They were asked to sip ice-cold water through a straw, so that the liquid would hit their upper palate. Blood flow in their brain was monitored using a transcranial Doppler test.

They found that the sensation of brain freeze appears to be caused by a dramatic and sudden increase in blood flow through the brain's anterior cerebral artery. As soon as the artery constricted, the brain-freeze pain sensation wore off.

eideid,"There are several things in effect here, but the biggest one is an issue of surface area to volume ratio. If you have a cube with sides of length 1, then its volume is 1 and its surface area is 6 with a surface area to volume ratio of 6 (ignoring units). Now imagine a cube with sides of length 2 with volume of 8 and a surface area of 24, giving it a surface area to volume ratio of 3. The bigger things get, the lower the surface area to volume ratio gets.

This has a large impact on how well the energy from changes in momentum is felt. Relatively more mass for a similar area of surface structure means it takes less of a change of momentum to reach the surface structure's breaking point. This explains many characteristics we find amazing regarding small creatures, such as the immense strength of ants compared to their body weight. It also means that they can have chitenous armor all over their body and still be agile. It is also why smaller animals have a much easier time surviving falls from great heights, or why it is so difficult to injure a flying insect with your hand.

An additional issue is that this surface area to volume ratio means that your hand swinging toward a flying insect which is going to cause a lot of wind has a greater impact on your target which is going to further cushion the impact of your hand.

matingslinkys,"One of the issues with anti-depressants is the order in which they can treat the symptoms of depression. Depression comes with a whole grab bag of symptoms, and they are all linked but separate in a complicated mess that is different for each person, and can respond differently to medication in each person.

Often one of the most significant things that can affect a person with depression is a lack of motivation, an overwhelming lethargy that leaves them unable to perform sometimes even the most basic of tasks. This is the reason that the advice ""just snap out of it, get up and do something"" is so useless to folks with depression. The illness cruelly takes that option away, by filling a person with leaden thoughts and an inability to even contemplate taking the next few steps in their recovery. I have worked with people who have sat soiled on a sofa until someone physically moved them to the bathroom to clean up, people who have not eaten in days being unable to summon up the energy to see the point in getting something to eat. 

This lethargy and lack of motivation is linked, but separate to any suicidal ideation. People may have suicidal thoughts, or they may not, or they may develop suicidal thoughts only when in the very depths of a depression, when the lethargy has already kicked in. Sometimes a person may entertain the idea of killing themselves, but be unable to summon up the energy to put together a plan to do so (after all, many suicide methods require some sort of supplies, which means getting dressed, leaving the house, and interacting with people to purchase things, or may require the effort of driving to somewhere or other such activities. Sometimes even just the effort of making a decision and coming up with a plan to kill yourself is just too much to overcome).  

Now, here's why people suffering from depression should always have someone to help keep an eye on them when they start a course of medication. Sometimes with modern anti-depressants the first symptom that reacts to treatment is the lethargy. All of a sudden the person who was unable to leave the same position on a sofa, or in a bed, for days on end is able to get up in the morning, or to summon up the energy to have a shower, or to go out to the shops...

You can see how this is the start of a positive recovery for many people; however sometimes the suicidal ideation does not go away at the same time. So what happens is that a person is still very much in a place where they wish to end their life, but now they have more energy and motivation. And therin lies the rub. 

I must stress that this is not the case for every person with depression, perhaps not even for most people with depression, everyone is an individual, and everyone reacts to both depression and treatment in different ways. Antidepressants are without a doubt good things that help many many people to recover, but sometimes they come with a risk that needs to be managed, and that's why they put those warning on the packet.

**TL:DR**    Sometimes Antidepressants can give a suicidal person the energy to notice their suicidal feelings (and sometimes act  on them) by bringing them out of a lethargic state in which they may not even have realised they felt that way. ",null,0,cdn1zrg,1rgj2f,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7

ZenDragon,"This might not seem intuitive, but in the case of antidepressants, a person with depression may have passive thoughts of suicide but insufficient energy/motivation to actually go through with it. When antidepressants are suddenly introduced, a number of things can happen. It may give them just enough drive and energy to actually carry out their suicide plan. It might not react well with their body and make them feel even worse, prompting more thoughts of suicide. Some antidepressants are possible to OD on, giving the person a new convenient way to kill themselves. Someone starting on antidepressants for the first time may have only recently come to the conclusion that they have a mental health issue. Becoming conscious of it may make them feel even more pathetic or hopeless. For these reasons it's very important to monitor a person starting a new antidepressant drug, or if you are taking one yourself, to frequently tell people how you are feeling and not hesitate to talk to your doctor if they aren't working out for you.

Skarjo,"As a guy currently living in Japan and who did so to try and understand some very particular aspects of Japanese culture (namely, Japanese folklore and horror) I think there's a few reasons.

Primarily, cultures all over the world are very different. But often they are very obviously different in aesthetics, social constructs, social behaviours etc. So, when these cultures, which are very obviously far removed from standard western-centric views of the world, start having weird traditions then it's not very shocking.

Japan, however, on the very surface, often looks very familiar. The architecture of their big cities, the absolute basics of the school system, the absolute basics of the working world seem very familiar. Not to mention that Japan, over the last 50 years, has adopted and modified many foreign brands and images meaning that, on the surface, Japan can feel very familiar.

However, it absolutely isn't. It's entire social mentality is extremely different to what you may expect from a Western mentality. As such, its social norms can produce seemingly absurd things.

To answer, let's just pick a number, say 686. Let's rewrite this in a slightly different form. 

6(1+99)+8(1+9)+6=686

Now we distribute:

6+6(99)+8+8(9)+6=686

let's rearrange again:

6(99)+8(9)+6+8+6=686

Any number multiplied by a number that is divisible by 3, is also divisible by 3. (eg. 4(3)=12 is divisible by 3). This means that our first 2 terms are divisible by 3, since the 9s are divisible by 3. This means that if the sum of the last 3 terms is divisible by 3, the whole number is divisible by 3.

ie) if 6+8+6 is divisible by 3, 686 is divisible by 3. in this case 6+8+6=20, which is not divisible by 3. 

Example 2)

7(1+99)+5(1+9)+3
=7(99)+5(9)+7+5+3
7(99) is divisible by 3
5(9) is divisible by 3

andgiveayeLL,"So, the goal of interpreting a statute is to figure out what Congress intended.  You want to know what the legislature wanted to prohibit, or incentivize, or regulate.  

Scalia, like every other judge and justice in the country, thinks that we should look to the text of the law to figure that out.  This is always the starting point.

But, most judges think that if there is something in the text that isn't clear, we can look to other sources to help resolve that ambiguity when all of the tools we have to interpret just the text itself fail.  These judges are willing to look at things like legislative history (what does the committee report for the bill that led to the creation of the statute say about the ambiguity?).  Some but not all judges will also try to use their own common sense and experience to reconstruct the purpose of the statute, drawing from as many sources as possible.

Scalia, however, thinks that we should stick just to the text.  He says that the answer is in the text and nowhere else.  He will not look to legislative history 99% of the time (he has done it twice to my knowledge).  He will not engage in some inquiry into the overall purpose of the statute as he reconstructs it.  All he cares to look at is the text itself, plus a dictionary (but he likes to use old dictionaries, like Webster's Second instead of Webster's Third).

Basically, he is a textualist, who tries to figure out the intent of the legislature through the text alone.  There are lots of tools to interpret text that he uses (just like all other judges).  These are called the ""canons of statutory interpretation"".  I'll walk you through an easy one

One straightforward canon of interpretation is called ""noscitur a sociis.""  That means ""a word is known by the company it keeps.""  This canon tells us that we are going to look at words around an ambiguous word in a group of words to try to make some sense out of it.  So in the list, ""No person shall possess: cotton candy, Skittles, ice cream, or treats,"" the word ""treats"" is ambiguous.  What if to me, salad is a treat.  Am I forbidden from possessing salad? No, because just using the text, we can figure out that the legislature did not intend to prohibit salad.  All the other items in the list are sweet things that are bad for you in large quantity.  Salad isn't like that.  So it's not a ""treat"" for the purposes of this law.  

Scalia uses tools like these to figure out ambiguities in language of statutes.  So does every other judge.  The difference is that Scalia prefers to stop with just the text.  But if there is an ambiguity that this tool and other tools like it cannot resolve, most judges will look to other sources.

Destroyers and frigates are small ships (commonly called escorts), typically meant to keep enemies from harassing the big ships. Currently they are interchangeable, but destroyers used to be the smaller of the two, and focused on anti-submarine warfare, while frigates could bring down larger ships when operating in packs. Also, frigates and destroyers could operate alone, due to their small size and higher maneuverability.

Battleships (along with cruisers, battlecruisers, and dreadnoughts) are what are known as capital ships, and are meant to provide a boat load (pun intended) of firepower. One-on-one, they can outshoot any other ship other than enemy capital ships. The largest ones typically served as the chief admiral's ship, and almost always operated in fleets with smaller ships because of their slower speed. In addition, they often served ended up being statements of nationalistic pride (particularly the Yamato, the Bismark, and the Missouri during and after WWII).

Larger capital ships have largely been replaced with aircraft carriers (which are also capital ships), as aircraft are much more useful in combat that the main guns of a battleship.

* Corvettes/Sloops/Brigantines/etc. - There are also a lot of little ships with various roles running around.

As ships developed and got armor, bigger guns, and power plants things changed.

* Battleships - These were the biggest nastiest ships in the various navies.
* Cruisers - These replaced frigates. Faster than anything they can't outshoot and nastier than anything they can't outrun. While the battleships clumped together for big battles, the cruisers were running around doing most of the ""work.""
* Destroyers - When torpedoes were invented they changed the game, now a small boat could carry a weapon that could sink a Battleship. So these ""Torpedo Boat Destroyers"" would screen the fleet from anything little. They had a lot of small guns (couldn't hurt a Cruiser) to blow up little boats.

By WWII this was largely still the same.

* Battleships - Still the same.
* Cruisers - Still the same, but most now carried torpedoes for an extra punch.
* Destroyers - Mostly these had become the Torpedo Boats, with a dozen torpedoes they could pack a big punch in a small size. And because they were smaller and cheaper they picked up a lot of new jobs. They were given sonar sets and sent sub hunting. They were given radar sets and were back on the far edges of the fleet looking for other ships, and more importantly planes.
* Frigates - These were smaller Destroyers, usually dedicated to a single purpose. An anti-sub frigate for example was pretty much a sitting duck to a surface ship or an air attack.
* Carriers - These were the new big kid on the block. Able to find and sink ships before the other ships knew they were there, they completely changed warfare.

In the post WWII era things have changed somewhat

* Battleships - These are now obsolete. Only the US operated them for very long. In the days of missiles bug guns are of limited value. As this moment. There are none operating.
* Cruiser - This is a bigger destroyer. Only the US and Russia have Cruisers any more.
* Destroyer - This is the main ship now. Capable of dealing with any threat, they are large (much larger than the WWII destroyers) ships and form the core of almost all fleets.
* Frigates - These are still the Destroyers' little brothers. Less capable and usually dedicated to a single purpose.
* Carriers - There are a lot of different types carriers out there. The US is the only one who runs the massive super carriers. But both the US and other fleets operate smaller carriers for Helos and small planes that don't need runways.",null,0,cdnf0av,1rgfxj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart) of Robin Hood fame and one of the most celebrated kings of English history participated in the third crusade. He drained the royal coffers and depleted the English defensive army, navy, and labor force to go fight in the holy land. Richard eventually died and his brother John became king and in his efforts to raise funds in order to pay mercenaries to defend the realm from France and Burgundy he started a civil war which led to the Magna Carta.

The Teutonic Order was a collective Germanic army which was supposed to be preparing to fight in the crusades, but ended up doing most of their fighting around the south-eastern baltic with the Prussians, Lithuanians, and Livonians (modern-day Latvia and Estonia). When they finished with their war, they ended up just ruling the place until a Polish/Lithuanian alliance finally had enough of it a few centuries later.

For the average person, the crusades was just one more reason the local nobility might call on them to fight and die or surrender up more of their agricultural production. It was nice for Europeans that the actual fighting of the crusades was happening away from their homes, as it meant fewer armies coming through and actually directly harming them, but war of any sort is a hardship born most by the poor.",null,0,cdmztx5,1rgei6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8

Optical systems can be incredibly complicated and are subject to produce very bad results from errors of very small magnitude (i.e. your eye is a millimeter to long or short). Source: Optical Engineering Student... yeah it's tough, and it's amazing that anything has evolved eyesight at all.

~~~~~

Why our eyesight is worse than, say, an eagle's?
An eagle depends more heavily on its eyesight for survival (scanning the ground far below for prey while flying by at great speed), therefore over the evolution of the species of eagles we are familiar with, a genetic mutation that resulted in better eyesight almost always resulted in a better chance to survive and reproduce. 

In humans on the other hand, at a certain quality of eyesight (roughly that which we currently possess) an improvement in eyesight no longer improved chances for survival; we already saw well enough to run and hunt on foot. Therefore, genetic mutations resulting in better eyesight- even though they were just as likely to happen and most likely did happen- were not made ubiquitous in our species by natural selection.",null,0,cdo52zt,1rgb09,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

Why do we have serious bee allergies? Assuming it is hereditary, it gets passed down because we have epi-pens and medicine that allows people with this allergy to live beyond a bee sting and pass the trait down. If we didn't have this, people would get stung by bees before having the chance to reproduce. Not that I wish for this to happen AT ALL, but if all people with bee allergies just died, it's likely that this allergy would be largely eradicated from humanity. Worth it? Probably not.

Likewise, if we were nomads had to hunt for our food to survive, people with nearsightedness would be toast. They'd die before having the chance to pass their traits down. Now glasses and modern society allow people to live with eye problems and pass those traits down. If everyone who needed glasses (a LOT of people) suddenly died, the human race would be more ""fit"" (in the Darwinian sense of the word) and basically better off. But it doesn't matter because quality of life if you have money is basically the same. And we can't kill hundreds of millions of people.

The other thing is with old people. As life expectancy grows, the organs tire and grow weaker, which is why more old people need glasses. So that's the other element.

* Nuclear reactors as nuclear thermal rockets. This has been [studied extensively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA). Basically you run a propellant (i.e. hydrogen) through a hot reactor. It can be made to work, it's just very expensive and it is very heavy. There are a lot of proposed ways to do this, but all basically work in a similar way.

* Nuclear reactors as electricity sources, to power e.g. ion engines. [This too has been studied quite a lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Prometheus). Again, heavy and expensive, but probably not a bad choice though for spacecraft meant to go pretty far in space. This is the sort of thing you'd use for an in-space thruster as opposed to a rocket.

* Radioactive decay to power electric sources ([RTGs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator)). The are pretty good for providing compact electrical sources. They _are_ used extensively for things like the Mars rovers or satellites. Basically they are radioactive materials that are very hot, and that heat can be converted to electricity. Apparently the idea of using these as heat sources in rockets has been studied, but generally they have just been used to power apparatus (or ion engines) of things that have already been launched into space.

* Exploding nuclear bombs. [Also quite studied](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)). Downside is you have to make and blow up a lot of atomic bombs to make it work. Politically not very feasible. Expensive. Up-side is that it is one of the few really feasible ways to get big ships to go really fast over long distances.

Why don't we do any of these except for RTGs? It's probably not so much that any of the other designs are infeasible (except maybe the exploding atomic bombs one, for political reasons), other than the fact that they are expensive (though all space travel sort of is). 

It's more likely the case that _nobody is at all interested in building long-range, heavy-duty spacecraft_. That is, the space-faring nations built up a space infrastructure around liquid fuel rockets, trying to achieve tasks that are pretty easily achieved through liquid fuel rockets — putting up satellites, for example. You don't need nuclear rockets to put a satellite, or even the Space Shuttle, in space and you probably don't get many advantages out of doing so — certainly no advantages worth the cost of switching systems for. 

The place you get the real advantages are if you are talking about craft that is meant to travel really long distances or with really heavy weights.

Nuclear energy doesn't create any exhaust, so it wouldn't be suitable.

Aside from that, nuclear power requires a lot of weight (to cool the reactor and contain the radiation), and it's incredibly difficult (ie. expensive) to get that much weight into space. (This is probably the same reason we don't have nuclear powered aircraft.)

StupidHockeyPlayer,"&gt; As a type of road, a boulevard (often abbreviated Blvd) is usually a wide, multi-lane arterial thoroughfare, divided with a median down the center, and ""roads"" along each side designed as slow travel and parking lanes and for bicycle and pedestrian usage, often with an above-average quality of landscaping and scenery. 

&gt;A street is a public thoroughfare in the built environment. It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. ... The word ""street"" is still sometimes used colloquially as a synonym for ""road"", but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction.

&gt;Traditionally, an avenue is a straight road with a line of trees or large shrubs running along each side, which is used, as its French source venir (""to come"") indicates, to emphasize the ""coming to,"" or arrival at a landscape or architectural feature. ... In US and Canadian urban or suburban settings, ""avenue"" is often simply a street name used to differentiate some streets from others, along with ""way"", ""road"", etc. Thus a community might have a ""Maple Avenue"" and a ""Maple Street"" to avoid confusion between addresses. In some cities in the United States (most notably in Manhattan, New York City), there is a convention that ""avenues"" run in a north-south direction, while ""streets"" run in an east-west direction, or vice versa. 

&gt;The word lane has several meanings, including and especially: 
1. a narrow road or street, usually lacking a shoulder or a median; this is typically applied to roads in the countryside, but can also be applied to urban streets or areas that used to be streets, such as Drury Lane in London, the Brighton Lanes, or the Cathedral Lanes in Coventry. 
2. a portion of a paved road which is intended for a single line of vehicles and is marked by white or yellow lines. 

&gt;In Northern America and Australia, the term also may refer to rear access roads which act as a secondary vehicular network in cities and towns. Large cities in the U.S. states of Nevada and Texas tend to apply the term to many arterial roads. &gt;

MaximumAldwyn,"Raw speed and raw capacity are valid measures of a computer, but not the only measures one must use to guage 'overall speed' or 'seat of your pants' speed.  There are many different speeds within a computer.

Prior to [Solid State Drives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive), hard disk technology really hadn't been changing in it's fundamental workings.  Sure, you can cram more stuff onto a disk, but the way it accessed it was, more or less, the same: a spinning platter with heads on top of it.

The speed of those disks, for most all home PC models, remained the same as well for many years: 7200rpm.  This creates what is called a 'bottleneck' - An area of slowness where things get backed up.

if your CPU can process eleventy billion things every single second, but is still being fed its data from the exact same hard disk as a CPU that can only process 42 million things a second, you won't really see a noticeable difference in speed by simply by watching it. This is because by the time the next chunk of data is retrieved from disk, both CPUs have already been sitting around waiting for it. Sure, the faster CPU had been waiting 'longer', but they were both still waiting; sitting there doing nothing

Much like a chain is is only as strong as its weakest link, a computer is only as fast as its slowest component, and that has most often been the hard disk (taking cd/dvd drives out of question, since those are not used as a core component of a computer, and one can easily use a computer without one).  There are other bottlenecks inside that magical computer-box, but the the hard drive speed is a good one to illustrate the point.",null,1,cdmwtpr,1rg5st,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3
Northwait,"There are a few causes for dropping performance. Using your computer generates lots of activity on storage, deleting and creating small files, and eventually your file system gets fragmented. 

Fragmentation is best thought of in a non-fragmented state. Imagine your 20 page term paper printed out but in a nice neat stack. If you need to read it, you look for the stack and you have it all there. Now imagine your paper is split up into a few pages over here, a few pages over there. Then, to read your paper, you have to go and fetch all of the pages from the many places it's held in order to look at it.

Keeping your system updated will cause that to happen with system files. When your computer was freshly built with an os installed, all the code it executes to do daily things is roughly located close to each other, near the same spots on your hard drive. If one of those libraries gets updated, it was to download and install the new one before removing the old one, and now you have fragmentation BETWEEN files and not just regular files. Think about your term paper and some of the research books. If all the stuff you checked out from the library is nearby while you're doing your citations, it's pretty quick. If you had to make a trip to a different library for each citation, it's going to get awful slow.

Then there are updates themselves. Newer, updated versions of your software might have security fixes, but they also tend to have more features or take some advancements in technology (cpu speed, memory, etc) for granted. On the surface, Word 2013 doesn't do anything for your term paper that Word 2010 couldn't, but it has new features and the code simply does more stuff when you're editing and working on your paper. Now multiply this for the hundred or so programs running on your machine at any given time (check your task manager and select ""show processes from all users"") and you can imagine how the system performance degrades over time despite being exactly the same as it was.

As time has passed, the rate at which technology improves has increased. We built better tools to make better things, which allowed us to make better tools.

But the main thing that's fueled this massive boom in tech in recent years (like 1970 til now) is the integrated circuit, and the fact that [the number of transistors double about every two years](http://www.mstech.com/nh-it-blog.php?show=171).

sir_sri,"&gt;Why has technology developed so quickly in the last 10 years in comparison to the last 100 years?Explained

The short answer is that it hasn't.

new technologies come out and there's a period of exceptionally rapid growth where it goes from a parlour trick to a major technology, and then it settles into a long period of slow progress.

Aircraft went from from a rickety pile of wood that was more likely to kill you than get you from point A to point B to a something actively used in serious combat in about 12 years.  20 years later and you had aircraft that sort of looked like today's commercial aircraft, though with propellers rather than jets.  Then jets caught on and there was another burst of development and then... we've had 40-50 years of progress but not rapid leaps and bounds.  

Metal ships are something similar, the first iron ships started showing up around the 1840's (with varying degrees of metal-steam-wood-sail).  By 1860 there was a ~9500 tonne ironclad sea going warship, HMS Warrior.  She's still afloat at Portsmouth in the UK if you ever go there.  By 1912 (Titanic) the biggest ships were almost 60 000 tonnes.  That's absolutely huge progress, but since today we regularly build ships over 100k it doesn't seem like such a big deal.  But that was tremendously rapid progress, especially considering how long it takes to build huge ships and make ports and for them.  

The first hot air balloon was basically a death trap.  Within 10 years they were dropping bombs with it, eventually they were the size of an aircraft carrier and could carry a couple of dozen passengers across oceans.  Then they were replaced by heavier than air aircraft. 



What happens is that engineering and innovation catch up to science.  The underlying principles of most of what goes on in microprocessors is E&amp;M and Quantum mechanics, we've had those understood pretty well for the better part of 70 years, but the microprocessor didn't really take off until the 1970's.  So it's rapidly catching up to the limits of our understanding of the science, and in 20 years or we'll probably start to hit a wall where you cannot make a microprocessor based on traditional semiconductor physics work any better.  Someone will figure out how to build a quantum computer we'll have a race to reach the limits with that, and then it will be slow marginal improvements for a while. 

Certainly things like the printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, the internet all speed up communication and speed up development, and there are a lot more people alive than there were at any previous point in history (word pop in 1800 was about 1 billion for the first time, by 1900 it was like 1.6 by 2000 it was about 6 billion. ) so there are a lot more scientists doing a lot more science with much better tools.  

But technology tends to go through spurts and things we think of as unchanged for ages started out as some ridiculous magic trick or gimmick then someone had a revelation about what you could do, and that rapidly progressed to something, and then did very little for a while.  

One of the common questions here is why do batteries suck and microprocessors increase so rapidly.  Well between 1800 and 1900 batteries went from being a misunderstood lab experiment to an actual technology people understood and could use.  Basically from the first battery in 1800 until the mid 1830's no one had a clue what was going on.  Then someone figured it out, made better batteries, that actually worked and could be improved on reliably.  By 1860 we had lead acid batteries, which are still in use in cars and the technology basically went unchanged from 1860 until 1970.   From 1800 to 1860 there were huge advances, and then many decades of very incremental progress.  Expect something similar with lots of the tech you see as so incredibly awesome from the last 10 years.

It has to do with the way that your hand (in this case, but, if it was another body part, similiar results would be seen--however, the palm of your hand has ALOT of nerves) is more rigid when it is cold. This makes it LESS flexible, and MORE prone to superficial injury....even without frost nip setting in. In the event that actual frost nip set in, this would be even more sensitive, as you have tiny crystals beginning to form in your cells, like little shards of glass......and, smacking them, rubbing them, or scraping them would be like SMACKING, RUBBING, or SCRAPING your neutral temperature hand against shards of glass.

When it is cold, your nerves are VERY sensitive to the temperature, as it ISNT numb yet, and still....blood flow is slowed down tremendously. In fact, your body has begun ""vaso-constricting"" all it's blood flow AWAY from your hands and feet, then the arms and legs, resulting in nerves being pressed upon by the less suple skin and vascular tissues.

(think of it like this....your hand swells---you cant get a RING off your finger. SO, you get told to run your hand under cold water---really cold water for about 15 minutes. The ring should slide right off...if not, you may need to run hot water JUST on the metal ring for 1 minute to re-expand the metal.

Whwn a room is completely closed, heat starts building up slowly due to micro organisms and their anaerobic respiration, and if there are humans or other creatures in the enclosed space. Eventually, the room becomes warmer than the outdoors( this always happens regardless of outside temperature, it is based on air convection and the amount of people in relation to the space they occupy, I.e. a small minibus with little openings and few people will get warm as fast as a larger closed room with 100 people inside.)

When you are cold and you enter the room, your body rushes to replenish the expended heat and starts absorbing heat from the room.

Entropius,"The **Weak Force** is what's responsible for radioactive decay in atoms.  The force has 3 carrier particles, W^+ bosons, W^– bosons, and Z bosons (kinda like how photons are the carrier particle for electromagnetism).  Their electric charges are (respectively) positive, negative, and neutral.  The force's range is pretty limited because the W and Z bosons are massive particles (unlike electromagnetism which has great range because photons are massless).

The **Strong Force** (not to be confused with Strong Nuclear Force), is what holds Quarks together, and quarks are what make up protons and neutrons.  The carrier particle is the Gluon.  The force's range is infinite.  Also, while this may sound extremely weird, it actually gets *stronger* (not weaker) with distance.  If you pull 2 quarks far enough apart, the energy required to do so is so great it will result in you spontaneously creating new quarks.   For this reason, it's impossible to ever see a single quark existing by itself.  Also, the Strong Force has charges, but unlike Electric charges that are always + or –, the Strong Force has 3 charges:  Red, Green, Blue.  These “*color charges*” have absolutely nothing to do with real world colors, physicists just named the charges after colors because the way it worked reminded them of how colors work.

The **Strong Nuclear Force** (not to be confused with the Strong Force), is what holds neutrons and protons together in an atom's nucleus.  The Strong Nuclear Force is also known as the Residual Strong Force.  The most simplified way to understand it is like this:  The Strong force between quarks in a proton or neutron “*leaks*” out, and that is what binds a neutron to a neutron, or a proton to a proton, or a neutron to a proton.  This force is NOT infinitely ranged like the raw Strong Force is.

I struggle with the same thing but I can give you my limited understanding. 

You know about gravity and electromagnetic force, right? Those forces are pretty well understood and apply very well to the things around us. The problem is, when you look at a smaller, quantum scale, we notice things happening that gravity and electromagnetic forces don't explain. The strong and weak forces are what govern the very small.

Strong force: So you get the whole atomic nucleus made up of protons and neutrons, surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons, right? So what holds the positive protons in a nucleus together (positively charged so should repel right?) in a particular element together? What holds the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons? Well, the answer to this is the strong force. And we don't really know WHY it exists, but we do know that it does exist. Quarks are held together by gluons, which was once explained to me as ""springs"", meaning they keep them together, but as the quarks are pulled apart, the gluons resist much like a spring would. Trying to pull apart particles held together by the strong force requires a lot of energy and also produces a lot of energy, and this binding force is used for nuclear fission.

Weak force: Weak force is also a quantum phenomenon that works over a longer period of time. It is what is responsible for radioactive decay of an element and also the energy that is released by fusion (which occurs naturally in our sun). I don't know much past this other than the force carrier is the W and Z boson. It is the force used to explain how fusion and radioactive decay occur.

One way that bitcoins ARE different than those currencies (among many) is that the price of the coins is moving wildly up (and down) recently.  So it seems like a very good investment.  But the price (now somewhere around $700) could just s easily be $50 tomorrow. ",null,2,cdmttfd,1rfwfe,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

strOkePlays,"Oh god... this is almost not an ELI5 concept, because you must have the concepts of math and logic available, and no amount of simplifying will change that....

With that said, here goes. There are two main kinds of encryption: symmetric, and asymmetric.

Everyone knows *symmetric*; if you put a password on a Word document, that's symmetric encryption. The password encrypts it, the same password decrypts it. Useful, but vulnerable to a lot of things, including someone else finding out the password.

Asymmetric, which public key encryption is the best-known example, doesn't use a password. It uses *keys*. The relationship between the keys is simple and straightforward: they do the opposite of each other.

There are two things you want to do to a document: *encrypt* it, or make it unreadable, and *decrypt* it, or make it readable again. In symmetric encryption, the ""password"" does both tasks. In public key encryption, you have two keys, and each does one at a time, and **only one at a time**, of those operations. If you use Key A to encrypt a document, you can't use Key A to *decrypt* it, it won't work. You can only use Key B to decrypt it. And vice versa; if you encrypt with Key B, then only Key A will decrypt. **Never ever ever can you use just one key to do both things.**

So smart people worked out that if you keep one of the keys secret, or *Private*, and expose the other key to everyone, or *Public*, you can accomplish two cool things:

* You can invite people to send you secret things. They encrypt with your Public key, and the encrypted file is safe. The public key can't do *both* things at once... if you use it to encrypt, it's useless to decrypt. So any sneaky spy bastards can steal the encrypted file but they can't decrypt it, only the other key, the Private key, can do that.

* You can send out messages encrypted with your private key. The message is NOT secret, because the public key is... public. Anyone can decrypt it. But that public key can *only* decrypt things coded by the private key, so they know it's from you. And remember, it can't do both things! If they change your message and try to encode it again, with the public key, well, that public key can't then decode it (it can never do both things), so everyone knows it's *not* from you. This is the basis for **electronic signature**.

Now, as for ""how does it actually work,"" there are two answers: logic and math. The logic answer is, there are some problems that are very easy to solve, but very hard to *unsolve*; we call these one-way functions. The simplest, classic case is prime factoring (there's a fantastic little algebra equation that lets you do a cool trick with prime numbers). It's very easy to multiply 67 x 107 and get 7169. But because 67 and 107 are prime numbers, they are the ONLY numbers that divide evenly into 7169. It's challenging for a human to look at 7169 and realize it's 67 x 107. It's even challenging for a computer, though computers are so fast they'd brute-force it instantly.

When you start looking at numbers like 8080031, and wondering what two numbers it factors into, it gets daunting for a human, though a computer still doesn't care. Where the computer cares is when the number looks like 77546620056920588113012600033948388271650013, and you have to figure out what two numbers it factors into, even computers start sweating. And numbers get much bigger than that.

Even so, we're getting too good at teaching computers to do it, and quantum computers will practically spit out the answer, so we are finding other one-way functions...elliptic curves, for instance, are very promising.

As far as the logistics, the use of the private key ensures that:

Regular people call it ""take the remainder"". The mathematical equation 7 mod 3 = 1 just means that 7 divided by 3 equals 2 with a remainder of 1.

sp31415926535,"Imagine that you (I'm gonna call you Bob) and I (Hi, I'm Alice!) want to talk to each other securely, so that if there's someone else is listening to everything we say (call her Eve), she can't understand what we're saying to each other.

For this to happen, we'll need a [shared secret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret) - a piece of information that only you and I know. If we had such a secret, we could use it as a password for a regular, symmetric encryption algorithm (say, [AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)) and encrypt everything that we say. Now, if Eve can hear everything we say to each other, how can we come up with such a shared secret?

Here's one easy way ([Merkle's puzzles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%27s_Puzzles)).

I (Alice) create a million short messages, along the lines of

* Password number 1 is cat

* Password number 2 is dog

...

* Password number 123 is kitty

...

* Password number 1,000,000 is rabbit

I then generate a million random passwords. I'm gonna use short passwords though, say, no longer than 10 letters each (you'll see why!). I encrypt each message with a different password, then throw away the passwords, and send all these encrypted messages to you in random order.

You, Bob, pick one message at random. Pick any message you like. Knowing that my password is short, you can [brute force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)... well, just try all 10-letter passwords and decrypt the message you picked. You call me over the phone, and tell me - hey, Alice, I've happened to pick message number 123, so use password number 123. And now we have a shared secret! We both know to use kitty as the password, because I have the original list of passwords, and you've read of the messages I've sent you.

Eve would have to break about half a million messages before she stumbles upon the message number 123, so she has to do a lot more work than you did. Hopefully, she can't do it quickly enough and by the time she's done with it, we're done talking and enough time has passed so that the topic of our conversation is no
longer a secret.

Easy, right? Now, this isn't an algorithm that people use in practice (you can read about [Diffie-Hellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), [RSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29), etc. if you want), but I hope it illustrates the concept well enough. In any case, there must be something that is easy for you to do knowing only something that you know (your private key), but hard to do for anyone who doesn't know your private key.

Listing the things that cost in the production of the book we have:

2) Cost to publish 

   a) set costs - building a publishing factory the first time

   b) marginal costs - cost per book.

On the other hand you have the potential return which is simply (price per book) * (copies sold).

The answer to this particular question has more to do with the second half of the equation than the first half.  Specifically, when you take a look at copies sold, one of the implied questions is, how big is the market.  If the market is all literary adults, then corresponding, you may be able to drop the price of the book in order to capture a greater % of the market and increase your overall return.  On the other hand if your market is parents that can afford a book that will keep their toddler occupied for a little bit of time, your absolute numbers are much smaller and so you need to increase your price to compensate.  Interestingly enough, this is also the reason why school texts are expensive, limited market size + potential for recirculation/reselling of previously bought texts means you have to increase the price per book or risk going out of business due to a losing strategy.

lumpy_potato,"So typically there are two kinds of accounts you open at a bank:

1. Checking Account - this is where you store money you plan to spend. You will at minimum have a Checkbook that links to this checking account, and typically a Debit Card. The Debit Card is the one you use at ATMs to withdraw money. The checkbook lets you write checks that eventually result in money being withdrawn from your account.
2. Savings Account - this is where you store money you don't plan to spend. There is usually some small amount of interest you gain on the amount in your savings. Think of it as a 'safe spot' that is a little safer than under the mattress.

Now, depending on where you go, a Checking Account has some requirements - they will have packages that vary depending on how much you have in the account.

Lets take a look at [Value Checking](https://www.wellsfargo.com/checking/value/) from Wells Fargo

So they have a 7$ a month fee and a minimum $50 deposit to open it up. To waive the monthly fee, you need one of the two:

* $1,500 minimum daily balance, or
* $500 in direct deposit per month

So lets say that works for you - you go into Wells Fargo and ask to open up a Value Checking account. You have cash on hand, lets say $250.

You will need at minimum:  

* Drivers license or state ID (Photo ID is a must)
* Social Security Number

You will at first talk to a Teller, who will then get you to a Banker - sometimes they have a desk just for new accounts.

Anyways, you do some paperwork, they run some checks, and usually within a few hours, you have your bank account! A debit card will take a few days to arrive, typically, but some banks can issue them on the spot. 

Now, you have your checking account and a checkbook. Ask for a Direct Deposit worksheet or form - it will have info you will give to your employer, who can set up Direct Deposit for you. If you get that $500 in per month, bingo! No more monthly fee.

That's the basics - depending on how much you are storing, what banks are available, and what sort of advantages they provide, you might want to shop around and see what works best for you.

The Blockchain is a big list of which addresses hold what balances. Each block hereby represents a set of updates to be made to the balances. By following the blockchain from the Genesis Block and applying all transactions that were validated in each block in the correct order, you arrive at the current status quo.

Each block contains:

A timestamp

The hash of the previous block as a reference (except the Genesis Block)

At least one transaction: The coinbase transaction and any other that were validated

The Merkle Root

The block's own hash

Difficulty statement

**As many miners compete to find the next block, often there will be more than one valid next block discovered. This is resolved as soon as one of the two forks progresses to a greater length, at which any client that receives the newest block knows to discard the shorter fork. These discarded blocks are referred to as orphaned blocks.**

When a transaction is submitted to the network, it is passed on peer to peer by all clients. Upon discovery miners will put it on their list of transactions that they want to verify and update the Merkle Root.

TheRockefellers,"The ""wildcat offense"" is an offensive formation in (American) football.  It's a single-wing formation, meaning that (most of) the linemen and backs line up on one side of the center.  In the wildcat formation, the ball is snapped (usually) to a running back, usually to rush the ball with an option to pass. The QB lines up at a different position, or may not even be present at all. In some trickier iterations of the wildcats, the ball may be snapped to any one of 2-3 players, which keeps the defense on its toes.

One of the big advantages of the wildcat is that it effectively gives you more men on a rushing play. In a typical running play, the QB receives the snap and hands it off to the running back, then just kind of watches (instead of blocking). By snapping to the RB directly, you cut the QB out of the equation, and have more boots on the ground to block (or if the RB elects to pass, you have another receiver).",null,0,cdmrq6m,1rfnrq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6

People often mix up Serotonin (the feel good hormone) with Dopamine (the reward hormone) and it should be noted that they are two distinct, different chemicals with different effects.

First, Netanyahu's domestic political situation is dependent on him being seen as hardline on Iran.  He has staked his reputation on this position and so, *whatever deal was agreed to*, he has to appear more hardline than that.  So, even if he actually thinks that this is a good deal, or a step along the way to a good deal (good in terms of what Iran would eventually accept), he has to publicly appear ""pissed off"", using OP's language.  

Second, there is the international audience.  The P5+1 negotiators (from the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany) will be able to get a better deal from Iran if they can point to a hardline Israel stance and say to Iran, ""Look, look at the pressure we are under here.  If you don't want Israel to reject the deal (and maybe unilaterally bomb your nuclear facilities), you are going to have to give a better deal"".  The P5+1 negotiators also seem more reasonable and moderate next to a hardline Israel.  

In addition to strategic incentives, there is a thing called ""fundamental attribution error"".  Briefly, this is a psychological phenomenon that all humans are subject to to some extent, where you think that you are a good person and forced to do bad things by your environment, but other people do bad things because they are bad people.  So, even though Israelis trust themselves to only use their nuclear weapons defensively, they think that Iran would use nuclear weapons offensively, even if that means effectively committing suicide (through nuclear retaliation).  This means that they are far more concerned about *ensuring* Iran doesn't have nuclear weapon capabilities than is reasonable/rational.  

These are the most basic and plausible explanations for why Israel is pissed off with the Iran Nuke deal.  There are other possibilities but they are more complicated.",null,36,cdmr9r4,1rfnff,explainlikeimfive,top_week,176

shawnaroo,"Israel didn't want a deal as much as they wanted total capitulation from Iran. So not only did Israel not get what they wanted, but they were also very vocal about what they wanted, and the US ignored them and made a deal anyways. Israel not getting what they wanted from the US in regards to an issue like Iran is very unusual, and so they're likely just as upset about that as they are the actual terms of the deal.

On a more personal level, the Israel Prime Minister (Netanyahu) has generally campaigned on the idea that Iran is an imminent existential threat that can never be reasoned with,  and that his leadership is the only hope that Israel has of surviving. Any deal that potentially reduces the threat from Iran could hurt him politically.

Those opposed to a Iran gave up some of the bargaining power.  Currently, there are economic sanctions (penalties) against Iran to pressure the country.  The recent deal agrees to reduce the existing sanctions and to avoid creating new ones.  In exchange, some feel Iran's not doing much, so the US is surrendering its position of power for very little.

Concern that Iran will continue to make efforts to develop nuclear weapons despite the deal.

Issues relating to Israel's involvement in the negotiations.  Specifically, negotiations existed for months before anyone from Israel was informed.  Israel wants its views considered when negotiations with Iran take place.

Interpretations on what the deal says about Iran's nuclear future.  Israel doesn't just want nuclear progress halted.  It wants development stopped completely.  According to the Iranians involved in the deal, the agreement strongly implies that recognition that the country has a right to nuclear capabilities.  This is directly against the views of Israel.  

Limitations on what Israel can do.  In the past, Israel has made unilateral strikes against perceived nuclear threats.

So, when people refer to Obama as black, this is what they're talking about: he looks black, *and this is relevant because it affects how he grew up.* When people refer to him as half-black, they're giving more credence to his specific family tree; both are, in a sense, correct.

DavidLieberMintz,"I'm seeing a lot of jokes and people referencing the ""one drop rule."" Race cannot be determined biologically. There is no gene for black, white or Asian etc. There are, however, genes for the pigment of your skin, the color of your eyes, how curly or straight your hair is and on and on and on. It is the combination of all these physical attributes that we as a society use to invent and reinvent race.

Obama is considered black because that is the racial group he chose to identify with. Given the time and place he was raised, I'd say he didn't have much of a choice. But the key concept here is that race is something made up by people. YOU have just as much a say in your race as society dictates.

Consider the following.
Bob is a teenage boy who's father is black and mother is Puerto Rican. Bob and his parents live in a major US city. If the neighborhood Bob grew up in is predominately Hispanic, he will most likely identify with that group because he sees himself as Hispanic. Whether he looks more Hispanic or more African American certainly plays a role in making his race, but it is not the determining factor. What if Bob grew up in a black neighborhood? What if Bob grew up the wealthy suburbs? You can understand how this might change how Bob sees himself.

This will probably get buried, but I hope it helps you understand where race comes from!

If anything, though, I would consider myself black (after biracial, of course) due to my complexion. I may not be a dark chocolate brown but... I'm brown *enough* that I have encountered racism multiple times in my life--even though I'm not considered ""fully black.""

If I were to look at Barack, not knowing his heritage, I would see a black male. This, I think, speaks for what he was able to accomplish in a white-male dominated political arena.

Let's start with Fair Use 101.  Fair Use is an exception to copyright law that basically says you're allowed to use copyrighted materials as long as what you're doing falls within the Fair Use guidelines.

Why is the Daily Show allowed to do it?:
Fair Use specifically allows for others to use copyrighted works for ""criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research.""  11 U.S.C. Sec. 107.  If the Daily Show had to use five words to describe itself, I'm pretty sure the majority of those words would be in the description of fair use.

Why is Led Zeppelin so hard to find on Spotify even though radio stations play it constantly?:
This really isn't a fair use question.  The radio stations likely have a contract with whomever owns the rights to the Led Zeppelin songs whereas Spotify does not.

How does Girl Talk get away with what he does?
The simple answer to the Girl Talk question is that he hasn't been sued yet.  I don't know enough about fair use law to comment on why, exactly, he hasn't been sued.  

What he is doing may or may not be fair use and, until he is actually sued, we will not know the answer to that question.

_watching,"One thing to remember OP is that SCOTUS cases aren't always that simple. The justices don't work by going, ""does this fit what the party says is our political agenda? Welp I'm voting such and such a way then.""

How a justice decides is generally informed by their interpretation of the Constitution. You can read the opinions of justices on cases to see how they interpret it.

Generally speaking, as I understand it but don't my word for it please read up on your own on this, justices either have a ""strict constructionist"" interpretation (a restricted reading, basically 'go by exactly what the paper says') or a more loose interpretation that tries to find intent behind the document.

Of course, one could say one interpetation is more liberal or conservative, and this is what the president will care about when appointing a justice - does their interpretation back up my politics?

Of course, this interpretation business is heavily influenced by personal beliefs that also form political beliefs. I just want to point out this stuff. It's not like the justices are political entities like Congress members are. For instance, Scalia is very conservative, but was a fierce defender of video games as free speech. 

This is really rambly...

BrooklynLaw,"Generally, ""conservative"" opinions limit the federal government's power while ""liberal"" opinions expand the power of the federal government.  ""Conservative"" opinions interpret the Constitution literally and derive meaning by looking at the intent of the people that wrote it.  ""Liberal"" opinions generally treat the Constitution as more of a living document with a meaning that changes as the country changes.  

The Obamacare decision is a good example.  The question was whether the government had the constitutional authority to enact and implement the federal regulation of the national healthcare system.  The decision, which upheld the bulk of Obamacare, was seen by some as an expansion of the traditional role of government, and was thus considered a ""liberal"" decision.  Another example, the District of Columbia vs. Heller case, looked at the extent of the federal government's power to regulate private gun ownership.  The court found that the existing gun laws were beyond what the constitution allowed, and thus reigned in the power of the government.  In determining what the Second Amendment meant, they looked to what the founding fathers understood the Second Amendment to mean at the time they wrote it.  This decision was widely seen as a ""conservative"" decision.  

There are many exceptions, like the case Gonzales v. Raich, which dealt with the federal government's regulation of private marijuana production.

One of these is the aggregation of platelets that will eventually lead to a clot, which is what you are seeing in these slow-to-heal cuts. There aren't enough DAMPs out to help aggregate the clot. Another part is that these DAMPs cause the muscle rings around the entrances to capillary beds to constrict, shutting off blood flow.

Before compilers and assemblers people would use punch cards or even manually flip switches on the computer to enter the binary ones and zeros that they wanted the computer to run.

in other words whatever ones and zeros the compiler would have spit out, assuming it actually existed, the programmer used to have to enter into the computer manually to program the computer.

They realized this sucks so they made very small and simple assemblers and compilers by hand. Manually entering ones and zeros in that when ran by the computer would act as an assembler. Once they had that they could use the assembler to write a more advanced compiler and so on.

The best way to understand it is if you were to write your own compiler today. How do I compile it and get it to run if I haven't written my compiler yet? Simple use an older compiler that already exists like gcc or something to write your compiler.

Once your new more advanced compiler is up and running and well developed you may decide to stop using gcc or whatever you're using to compile your compiler with and say well hey, my compiler has come far enough it can compile its own code now.

BrooklynLaw,"When the United States was made, there was a lot of differences between the states, as there still is today.  So in order to preserve those differences, the Constitution made a list of things that would be controlled on a federal (national) basis, and let the states make up the rules for everything else. The federal government is, in theory, a limited government, with all of its powers spelled out in the Constitution.  Any power not described in the Constitution is reserved to the states.  

For instance, the Constitution says that the federal government can declare war against another country.  Alabama cannot declare war because this ability is specifically given to the federal government under the Constitution.  Conversely, the Constitution does not list, in the powers of the federal government, the ability to generally police the population for crimes.  This is why you have 50 different rape laws and no federal definition of rape.  Alabama may have a different age of consent than what Maine wants.  There are tons of differences, but the fact that the federal government cannot do whatever it wants is the reason why there are 50 state constitutions with state legislatures making different laws.  This is also the reason why some federal laws are occasionally declared ""unconstitutional,"" because the Constitution specifically limits Congress's power to make laws in certain areas.  

The preservation of limited federal powers to the benefit of the states is to make the states experimental labs for different policies.  New York has much harsher gun laws than Florida, and policy makers can look at the results of those different laws in deciding how to move forward.  

The wikipedia article is very focused on the specific cases that expanded and contracted the dual federalism principle, and this could be confusing.  But all you need to know is that the Constitution spells out the federal government's legislative powers, which are limited, and anything not spelled out in the Constitution could then be legislated by the states or the people.  One more thing, the supremacy clause is important because it says that federal laws trump state or local laws.  So in areas where the federal government can legislate, if a state makes a conflicting law, the federal law trumps the state law.  A state is allowed to make supplementary laws that go beyond what a federal law says so long as it is not in conflict.  For instance, the United States congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect certain minority groups.  Many states have their own civil rights laws that mirror the federal law, but also include additional protected groups.  This is fine so long as it doesn't conflict with a federal law or the constitution.  

If you have more questions about the actual cases in the Wikipedia article let me know.  The cases are pretty interesting in learning how we got from a very, very limited government to a much less limited one today, but if you are just interested in the basic concepts, the article could definitely be confusing.

The ELI5 answer is that two things are going on: the people with illegal jobs are settling their disputes the only way you can when you can't sue someone or call the cops (the first book I mentioned), and the people with legal jobs are suffering from PTSD and other stress-related breakdowns (the second book).

**Illegal dispute settlement:** Let's say that a friend or business partner or a family member of yours gets shot, or robbed, and you think you know who did it. The problem is, you can't go to the cops, because the reason you know is that you're involved in some illegal business, because that's the only job you can get that pays enough to feed your kids, whether it's doing illegal oil changes in the alley or pimping or running an uninspected, unlicensed catering firm or dealing drugs, and if the cops investigate your story, you're going to jail and your kids starve. So what are you going to do, let the guy who did this to your friend get away with it?

**Breakdowns:** Even the people who do have legal jobs are working way more hours than you can imagine, at jobs that don't pay enough to afford transportation, let alone health care or child care. As were their parents, which means that they're doing this despite having had to raise themselves. They and their families have also typically had to spend at least some time couch surfing, which means leaving their kids with lots of unfamiliar adults, which means that disproportionately large numbers of them were molested, raped, and/or tortured as children. Probably somewhere between a third and half of the working poor in America have PTSD or an even more severe mental disorder, for which they cannot obtain any legal treatment at all. The only treatment available to them, if they pursue even that much, is to try to treat their own symptoms with illegal narcotics, and that never goes well, and exposes their kids to even more risk, making the next generation's PTSD even worse. There is basically no way to raise healthy children in a working poor environment, not without at least some help from people who are much luckier in their circumstances and a lot of luck yourself.

That doesn't mean they need slightly enriched uranium (they don't really need enriched uranium at all), that doesn't mean they need plutonium etc.  Which would be for nuclear weapons.

For example, I was on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs for a year and quitting was difficult, withdrawal was a bitch. But I don't have cravings for these drugs as they don't create psychological rewards for me personally (although anti-anxiety drugs like benzos can be extremely addicting).

Iirc cigarettes target the reward centers of your brain, so cessation of smoking will cause jitters, anxiety, frustration, and other manifestations from lack of nicotine (the addictive chemical in cigarettes). 

For long term heavy drug users (such as alcoholics/heroine addicts) you form a physical dependency to the drug. Basically, your body gets used to having the chemical compound in the blood and tissues, and reaches homeostasis (a natural balance) with the chemical and your body systems. This is when you lose enjoyment of the drug and just use it to not feel terrible. Withdrawal symptoms occur when you use a drug for a long time, your body gets used to the drug, then your remove it. 

Picture it this way. Lets just say in general drugs turn on or turn off parts of your body. When you take the drug for a long time, parts of your body are turned off or on (such as opiates and pain receptors). When you remove the drug, the part that was previously turned off turns back on (and even can turn ""hyper""-on) and the parts that were turned on can turn off. It throws your entire body into a frenzy and you get very sick.

thepatman,"&gt; it seems to me overkill that police officers use handguns with high capacity clips, while being trained to ""aim for center mass"" in order to quickly kill their opponent.

Let's correct this misunderstanding first: police officers do not 'shoot to kill' - they shoot to eliminate the threat.  

Your scenario starts with a misunderstanding of technology and the applicability of less-than-lethal(LTL) force.  First, most LTL options aren't disabling - which means that the threat still remains.  A person who is pepper-sprayed or maced still has their weapon, and can still fire with good accuracy.  Tasers **may be** disabling, but also may not be.  Often, people can take two or three shots from a taser and can still function.

For nearly all LTL methods, the deploying person must be quite close.  Pepper spray, mace and batons all require the officer to be within three to six feet of their opponent to deploy.  That's far too close for comfort when the other person has a gun.

Police officers are(usually) cleared to shoot when the subject displays the ability to use deadly force(gun, knife, et cetera) **and** the intention to use it.  Once someone with a gun indicates they're going to use it, by pointing it at the officer, reaching for it, or whatever, the officer isn't taking a chance that pepper spray or a taser are going to disable him.  They need to use the fastest, most effective disabling weapon - a gun.  It is far, far more likely that the gun will disable him than anything else.

sterlingphoenix,"As others have mentioned, police do often carry non-lethal means.

But when they fire a gun, when they pull a trigger, the mentality has to be ""I am trying to kill someone"". Why? Because pulling a trigger is the ultimate extreme measure. It is absolutely not to be taken lightly. You don't shoot a gun to disarm a person, or scare someone, or hurt them ""just a bit"". Guns are lethal, and they should be thought of as such. And avoided whenever possible.

Now, as to why we're seeing a lot of reports of police shooting people (sometimes excessively), well, there are a few factors to that. 

First, there's the whole thing where the news isn't going to report ""Police today did not shoot a suspect"". I'm pretty sure there are dozens of non-lethal police interactions a day. Or hour. Or minute, depending on where you live. I read the police blotter for where I live and there's occasionally a chase, but that's it (and yes, I am in the US).  

Second, yeah, there does seem to be a rise in the ""shoot first, ask questions later"" mentality. 

But the thing about that is, being a police officer is *dangerous*. If they go into a dangerous situation, they're going to react to it that way and be ready to defend themselves. I don't know that we want to send police into those kind of situations and train them that it's better for them to get killed by a maniac than to shoot someone they perceive as a threat. And police officers probably feel threatened a *lot*.

I'm no expert, but one argument I have frequently heard against wider use of non-lethal defenses, is that cops who have tasers &amp; pepper spray tend to over-do it, perhaps not giving those weapons due respect because they're not viewed as ""lethal.""  However, I don't think I've ever heard that argument posited from the point of view of *replacing* guns with tasers, only in the context of what has actually happened when cops carry them *in addition to firearms.*  Personally, I think police would take their tasers more seriously if they are trained with the perspective that the taser (or pepper spray or whatever) *is* their gun, and should be respected like a gun.

barryspencer,"Well, it's difficult for me to explain what a migraine is without violating the ELI5 rule that we aren't supposed to express an opinion or argue a point of view. Trouble is, I'm the only person with my view of migraine.

My view: migraine is caffeine withdrawal headache.

Migraine / caffeine withdrawal headache is caused by adaptation to caffeine followed by abrupt withdrawal from caffeine. 

Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors. The nervous system adapts to caffeine by becoming more sensitive to adenosine. When caffeine is abruptly withdrawn, the caffeine-adapted person is left excessively sensitive to adenosine, and as a result the adenosine system malfunctions. Excessive adenosine receptor activation causes the headache and other symptoms of migraine / caffeine withdrawal headache.

Adenosine is a neurochemical that performs many functions. It dilates blood vessels in the head and neck. It also causes pain peripherally (outside the central nervous system): a tiny drop of adenosine placed on the skin causes a red spot (due to vascular dilation) and localized pain.

What causes migraine-related photophobia and phonophobia:

Adenosine is released from neurons (nerve cells). The major sensory apparatus of the head (retinas, olfactory bulbs, vestibular apparatus and semicircular canals, lips, dorsal surface of the tongue, and tooth pulp) contain dense concentrations of sensory neurons. During a migraine, those densely-packed neurons emit adenosine. Excessive intercellular (between cells) adenosine causes sensory neurons to malfunction. That's what causes the sensory disturbances associated with migraine.

A migraine doesn't ""achieve"" anything. The human nervous system resists plant toxins by various methods including neurochemically adapting to a toxin best it can. Caffeine is a plant alkaloid neurotoxin some plants make because it interferes with the normal functioning of the nervous systems of insects and thereby protects the plant by inhibiting the ability of insects to eat the plant. Humans who consume caffeine adapt to caffeine by becoming more sensitive to adenosine. That adaptation allows us to function fairly normally despite the interfering presence of caffeine. Unfortunately that same adaptation also renders us susceptible to withdrawal symptoms when caffeine is abruptly withdrawn. Nearly everybody uses caffeine, a headache-causing drug. Not surprisingly, therefore, humankind is plagued by headaches called primary headaches, including the severe headaches called migraines.",null,0,cdmurnf,1rfc7z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

AmonDhan,"&gt; And how the heck do we even measure how long a 'second' is??

Originally it was 1/86400 of the length of the day. But the problem with this definition is that the length of the day is not very stable. It can change [by an earthquake](http://www.space.com/11115-japan-earthquake-shortened-earth-days.html) and gets a little slower on average every year by the ocean tides. The length of the day has increased 2 hours in the last 600 million years.

As you can imagine, physicists do not like a unit of measure that changes every year, so they redefined the second so that it does not depend on the rotation of the earth. The definition changed over time, but it is now defined measuring some properties of the caesium 133 atom.

This new definition was used to establish Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). And this is the time most clocks and computers try to sync to. As the new second definition is not in sync with the Earth rotation, it happens that the UTC clocks and the solar clocks get slowly different readings. Once every 6 months this error is measured and when this error is more than 0.5 seconds, a second is added or subtracted to UTC at midnight. These are called leap seconds.

(2).  There are also many crimes which exist only on the state level.  There is no federal law which governs (for instance) murder or rape if done within a state.

There are feral hives of Africianzed bees in central Miami, being 30ft up in a palm tree until someone goes over and kicks the tree repeatedly they aren't a problem. 

Africainzed bees are the same species as European honeybees just a different subspecies. Without lab tests they are indistinguishable from European bees. And since they breed freely with European bees our Europeans bees have almost all picked up African traits. 
The Africanized bees are more defensive not more aggressive. They defend the hive with more bees and are more likely to follow an attacker a longer distance once aroused. They also tend to nest in places that Europeans won't which causes more disturbances. European bees like tree cavities. Africanized ones will nest in the ground, like in the water meter, they will nest in electrical transformers or any cavity big enough to hold them with a small entrance. This means that people are more likely to find them, and accidentally disturb them than European bees. Imagine being an electrical worker in a cherry picker opening an box on a pole and finding a nest of bees. It doesn't really matter if they are Africanized or not if you cant get away. But its more likely he will find Africanized ones in an unexpected place like that.

Africanized bees also tend to swarm more. This means they form new hives more often and maintain smaller hives making the possible nesting locations larger. They are also willing to abscond, just pickup and leave a bad nest site and relocate, so it is more likely that they are found in an unusual place they just moved into.

-the shortening of the telomers (a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromatid); after every cell division the telomers becomes shorter, when all telomer nucleotid sequences are ""consumed"", the DNA gets damaged and no cell division/ or malfunction of the cell is possible.

afcagroo,"At the lowest level (almost), it runs due to the actions of transistors. Transistors in digital logic circuits are used mostly as switches. You want the transistors to be either all the way OFF (no current flow) or all the way ON (lots of current flow). And you can use the output of one transistor to control the input of other transistors, so you can construct a complicated circuit by wiring them up in certain ways.  

Using just a few transistors, you can build very simple logic circuits to implement binary digital logic (called ""Boolean"" logic after the guy who invented it).   
  
For example, imagine a light bulb hooked up to a battery through a switch. Switch on, light on; switch off, light off. Now imagine that there are two switches in a row, A and B. The light is only on if A and B are both in the on position. This is what a digital logic AND gate does! If you hook the switches up differently, you can just as easily make an OR gate (A OR B turns on the light). Label a switch backwards and you have a NOT gate.  
  
It turns out that you can build any digital logic function with a combination of just a few simple circuit types, such as AND/OR/NOT (you can actually do everything with just one, but no one really does that). By combining those simple circuits, more complicated circuits can be made (such as an adder, a multiplexer, etc.). You can use those circuits to make even more complicated ones. Like a CPU.  

It's like if you had a bunch of little Lego blocks, and you could use those to make larger Lego blocks, and you could then use those to make even larger Lego blocks, and so on. Today's integrated circuits use more than a billion transistors to make something that is very complex, but it is built up out of very simple things. Transistors are great for building these things because they are small, fast, reliable, cheap, and don't use a lot of power. These are all important properties when you are trying to make something that uses a billion or more devices.  
  
After you've built a bunch of different chips and put them into ""packages"", you solder those packages onto a Printed Circuit Board (such as a PC motherboard). The PCB has copper traces on it that act like flat wires to connect things together. (It is cheaper, simpler, better performance, and more reliable to use a PCB to do this rather than a bunch of individual wires.) It even has many layers, and connection vias going between layers or clear to the other side of the PCB. So now you can connect up different chips that do different functions, like CPU, memory, graphics, etc.  

They ""talk"" to each other via the traces on the PCB according to certain pre-determined rules, called ""protocols"". Kind of like the circuits, these protocols are built up in layers, with the lowest level protocol defining what signals mean ""0"" and what signals mean ""1"". These protocols get pretty complicated, and allow the different components to pass very complex information back and forth.   

The different parts of the PC have different functions, with the CPU acting kind of as the main brain and control center. It gets program instructions and data sent from the hard disc to the memory and then to it, manipulates the data as dictated by the stream of instructions, and sends data out to where it is needed. But the CPU does what it does according to the digital logic that has been built into it. 
  
  
  
Now that everything can pass binary information around and do things with it, what remains are ways to represent information, and describing how to do things to it. The latter is where programming comes into the picture...programs describe, eventually at the binary level, how to manipulate information that is in digital form.  

And pretty much everything can be digitized, more or less. A sound can be measured very very rapidly, turning its waveform into a series of numbers. An image can be represented as many rows and columns of tiny dots, each one having a color and intensity, and each of those colors and intensities represented by numbers. And numbers can be represented in binary so that digital logic can do things with it...transform it, transmit it, etc. ",null,4,cdmn634,1rf8u9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,66
mkautzm,"It's a lot, a lot, a lot of complicated steps.

So in Computer Science, there is this concept called 'abstraction', which is basically saying, 'you can ignore the details of how stuff under you works, and just know it works'.

By posting on Reddit, you are engaging in this because you don't really know how a computer goes from binary (1s and 0s) to a full, feature rich website.  And that's OK.  You don't have to know.  You just need to know that typing stuff in a box and hitting 'post' makes text show up.  That's abstraction.

So, it's well known that computers speak natively only in 1s and 0s, which would more accurately be described as a switch (on and off) instead of a 1 or a 0, but that's splitting hairs.  Know that each 1 or 0 is a 'bit' of data

So if your entire number system included just 1 and 0, how would you represent 2?  how about 20?  200?  What about the letter 'a'?  The long story really, really short is we ended up the byte system, and while bytes have historically been made up of 16, 14, 12 and 32 bits, today, they are almost universally always 8.

So a byte (8 bits of data) representing the value of '0' would look like this:  00000000.  '1' would look like this: 00000001.  '2' would look like so:  00000010.  And 3':  00000011.  And so on...

So, a byte being 8 bits gives us room to express 256 different *things*, and this is the foundation of basically everything.  A really common system to represent different *things* is ASCII.  In ASCII, each value represents a character and a complete table can be found here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters

----

A small aside here.  A lot of older games, especially NES games had a bunch of items that only every went up to 255.  This because it was stored as single byte in memory (or an 8 bit variable.  It's the same thing).  0 to 255 makes up the whole 256 values you can have, and going any higher is impossible.  That's the significance of that number.  

In more modern games, when numbers are really buggy, you might see a number like 4,294,967,295 or -4,294,967,295.  That's the upper and lower bounds of a 32-bit variable, so when you see whacky numbers around that, it's usually a result of an overflow error of some kind.

----

ASCII is about the 4th layer up from pure hardware in the really thick, onion that is computing.  Eventually, you develop programs where we say, 'Hey, the first 2 bytes of this document are going to represent what color shit is going to be!' and then we can say, 'Hey!  The first 6 bytes of this file is going to describe the font size, the color, and the distance between new lines!'.

This happens over and over again, adding new layers of complexity over the next 40 years, and we eventually end up with the shitstorm that is what we have today, and it's all possible because of abstraction.

Programmers generally don't know shit about computer hardware, because they don't need to.  You generally only know as little as you need to about your domain because knowing about every layer of computing simply isn't possible.  Hell, they generally don't know much about the specific layer they are working on.  I'm a .NET developer and I can tell you fuckall about how memory is managed in a computer, outside of the very basics of it because I don't have to worry about it.  Or if I want to generate a random number, I just say Random.Next(0, 100) and I know I'll get a number between 0 and 100.  I have no idea what is actually happening to get that number though.

Abstraction.  It's fuckin great.

mredding,"/u/afcagroo has the best answer here, but I just wanted to add that to be clear, a computer has no concept of a zero or a one, this is just an analogy for the flow of current or the lack thereof.

Computer programmers and computer scientists are less interested in talking about the flow of electricty or not, and it's too hard to be that pedantic.

We use the idea of zero and one for more than the flow of electricty or not, we use it to refer to a transistor emitting current or not, whether capicators (fundimental electrical components most often used to physically construct RAM) hold a charge or not, magnetic media (hard drives) being north or south pole, and more... All these things can be spoken of as either a zero or one, and what's physically going on is hardly the point when we discuss computation.

captainskybeard,"It starts with the CPU. At this point, the ""logic"" is still hardware based - very tiny physical circuits that can transform data in a very basic way - multiply or add and subtract, for example.

The ""language"" the CPU speaks is a little different for each family of CPU. For example, it's different between 32 and 64 bit CPUs, mobile vs desktop, etc.

A computer program at its most basic level is said to be in assembly language, the language of the CPU. This is very difficult to read for humans. It is a series of these simple instructions we talked about earlier. Yet, every single application, game, and kind of program eventually boils down to assembly language.

We make assembly language by taking a high level programming language and running through a compiler. A compiler is nothing more than a very complex translator - translating from high level coding to machine instructions (assembly). A high level programming language like c++ for example, will be readable by humans and use things like if/else constructors, for loops, etc.

These are layers of abstraction. They go up yet higher, you can have a very high level language like Python for example, that deals even less with the low level system.

Really the highest level of abstraction is the user interface, with a GUI being the ultimate level of abstraction.

dts316,"At very bottom, like others have mentioned, you have circuit board with transistors with ""0"" as OFF (low current) or ""1"" as ON (high current).  Using this as a building block 0001 could represent numeric value of ""1"".
This is what CPU or machine understands, and hence machine language.

All CPU's come with set of instructions in the form of architect's machine code (machine language).  For example, set of instructions might consist of: 0001 as ""1"", 0010 as ""2"", 0011 as ""3"" and 1100 as ""+"" (addition) then 1100 0001 0010 would translate to ""add"" ""1"" and ""2"".  Which would output 0011, value of ""3"". 

However, this becomes unbelievably unreadable as you try to program more sophisticated programs.  So, low-level languages came.  Think, ""Assembly"" in early days of computer programming.  It's close to machine language but it bridges machine language with human readability by using mnemonic codes.  For example, instead of writing 1100 for addition you simply type ""add"".  And when Assembly language ""assembles"" it translates the word ""add"" to 1100 for you.  Now you have ""add 0001 0010"".  Low-level languages have whole set of operations.  I can explain more about different operations and symbols but I believe it would be beyond the scope of this. 

So, using the assembly or other low-level languages to bridge between machine and human readability, Operating Systems are made.  Microsoft Windows uses some assembly language for very low-level programming and C/C++ for higher level.  Once you have OS running you can begin programming in higher-level programming, such as C/C++ or Java, for more sophisticated programs like web browser or microsoft word.

Why do we use binary? 

Because that's all a computer can understand at the lowest level.

Well, machines at the lowest level can only understand on and off (electrical current present or not present).  So we have to represent everything in binary to a computer.

A civil war in some other part of the world arguably *should* be of more interest to the general public, but hearing about some local issue which could affect them gets higher ratings.  

So, a lot of news focuses on local issues, rather than global ones and tackles shallow issues or gore, which attract attention and viewers.  More viewers equals more money, which keep the networks going.

sir_sri,"Print Journalism is being eviscerated by bloggers and web savvy amateurs who can put stuff out faster if not more accurately.  This is not entirely bad - journalists don't know a lot about most topics and bloggers who are actual experts and don't try and reduce concepts to a 6th grade level end up being better than journalists on the whole.

But as was pointed out, journalism in TV/Radio etc. is much different.  For several centuries almost all journalism was Print.  Then along come radio and TV.  TV journalism worked well in the past because it was necessarily condensed and there were rules about 'fairness' in the US or the BBC in the UK.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine  is a summary of the US rules.

BBC still exists and it still going - as an arms length government agency it goes through periods of bias but ultimately they succeed because they first and foremost must report the truth, or parliament will rake them over the coals.  

The end of Fairness doctrine in the US has meant that rather than neutral independent journalists news now can have activists and advocates and pundits.  These are  people who present opinions in the style of a journalist.  

Where BBC can send people all around the world to do serious stories about countries americans  never heard of the big 24 hour US cable news networks aren't going to spend money on that.  They're chasing money, so 2-3 hours a day worth of news got spread into 24 hours of repetition and filler.  

Enter the Internet.  The internet undercut everything about journalism.   Traditional print media, which tries to sell ads on print and basically distilled news into a once every 24 hours or once a week type segments was crushed by instant reporting and experts (and non experts) who would weigh in on any topic for free.  Sort of like reddit. 

Big cable news networks have agreements with huge masses of local stations, but they're all too slow for the internet.  Packing equipment into a van and driving somewhere can take an hour, on the internet the first vulture gets the best meat, meaning a citizen journalist with a cell phone camera is going to win.   

The internet also provides essentially unlimited space for all manner of ideas - even things that are complete nonsense.  There's no way to enforce any sort of quality standards on the internet.

Real journalism takes time, not always very much, but in an era of instant gratification 24 hour news filling air time with speculation and babble, and the internet rapidly undercutting print the opportunities for serious journalism as a paid profession are seriously weakened.  Some of that is good quite honestly - being able to collect and organize actually serious experts on topics who can say serious things is a huge boon to humanity, adding a journalist filter to that made everyone worse off.  But most of the time you need journalists to figure out who the actual experts are, and to do serious reporting on serious issues, unfortunately that isn't as good for the bottom line as screaming stupid people filling air time.

lumpy_potato,"Part of the problem is that there are many different types of journalism. 

The older forms of journalism - long form journalism like Gay Talese, Tom Wolfe, Capote, etc. are harder to get into. The atlantic or Harpers or the New Yorker don't have the same reach they do today as they used to before the internet was ubiquitous. Getting published is hard because you have a smaller number of such publications, and fewer people willing to read an entire long-essay or book to get what they could get from USA Today in 800 words. 

Furthermore, what people look for in news has changed - news articles have to be fast in order to keep up in the internet era, so artistic or descriptive investigations are replaced by fast releases with skimmed details and quick-and-dirty pieces.

This is not to say that all articles are like this, but if you look at the media scramble that happens after any major disaster, you can see that the type of 'journalism' that most people see is very slap-dash. Print now fix later kind of stuff, which for someone really interested in Journalism is a big turn off. So now you want to write news articles, but not *that kind* of news article, which puts you at a disadvantage because *someone else will do it*.

That said, where long-form journalism doesn't see the distribution it used to, now there are new forms of journalism - technology writers, game writing, independent blogs, video journalism, live streamers - many of whom are taking advantage of new technologies to provide a different kind of 'news.'

the hard part is monetizing this - its not easy to make money on articles in the internet era. Ad clicks are not guaranteed, and paid ad space only comes with a certain level of readership that is not easy to come across. A newspaper could be run with an editor, a few writers, and a few people to help distribute. You didn't need to shell out thousands of dollars to web developers and engineers and network administrators to keep a website running with large amounts of viewers.

We discussed this issue heavily in the Literary Journalism classes I took (B.A. LitJ here) - a big part of modern journalism is adaptation - news print is hard to get into, but a niche writer might be able to find a position at an independent magazine, a blog, or an web magazine/news site and make a good living that way.",null,0,cdmmzv8,1rf6fx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

OrangeCrack,"There are many different methods for dating things and usually more than one is required before scientist will confidently declare that they are certain that the age of something is within a specific range. (Don't read past here if you are happy with the tl;dr version)

Here is a list of different dating methods:

Absolute methods

Absolute dating methods rely on using some physical property of an object or sample to calculate its age. Examples are:

Radiocarbon dating - for dating organic materials

Dendrochronology - for dating trees, and objects made from wood, but also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates

Thermoluminescence dating - for dating inorganic material including ceramics

Optically stimulated luminescence or optical dating for archaeological applications

Potassium–argon dating - for dating fossilized hominid remains

Numismatics - many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record

Archaeomagnetic dating - Clay lined fire hearths take on a magnetic moment pointing to the North Pole each time they are fired and then cool. The position of the North Pole for the last time the fire hearth was used can be determined and compared to charts of known locations and dates

Lead Corrosion Dating.

Amino acid dating

Obsidian hydration dating - a geochemical method of determining age in either absolute or relative terms of an artifact made of obsidian
Rehydroxylation dating - for dating ceramic materials

Relative methods

Relative or indirect methods tend to use associations built from the archaeological body of knowledge. An example is seriation. Ultimately, relative dating relies on tying into absolute dating with reference to the present. One example of this is dendrochronology which uses a process of tying floating chronologies of tree rings together by cross referencing a body of work.

In practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of stratigraphic relationships.

Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers

Paleomagnetism: the polarity of the Earth changes at a knowable rate. This polarity is stored within rocks; through this the rock can be dated.
Tephrochronology: volcanic ash has its own signature for each eruption. In a sedimentary sequence the associated material within the ash layer can be dated, giving a date for the eruption. If this ash is found anywhere else in the world, a date will already be known (bearing in mind transportation time).

Oxygen isotope chronostratigraphy: this is based on the climatic stages displayed in SPECMAP relating to different cold and warm stages experienced in deep time; for example, point 5.5 in the SPECMAP chronology describes the peak of the last interglacial 125,000 years ago.

Colbolt,"There are lots of methods to date fossils but the two main ones are radiometric dating and carbon dating. Carbon dating is only useful for carbon based objects such as shells or trees and can only be used to date objects up to 50,000 years due to it's half life. Carbon dating uses C14 isotopes, half life is the time taken for the isotopes to decay, we can work out the remaining amount of C14 isotopes left thus giving the age.

Radiometric dating is mainly for fossils because it's very accurate and can date objects that are millions of years old due to it's half life. I believe it uses U/Pb isotope ratios due to their massive half life and U can be vary common is bodies of rocks.

I believe dating water uses 016/18 isotope ratios and these can be correlated to various events.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an ""Internet-standard protocol for managing devices on IP networks"". Devices that typically support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and more. It is used mostly in network management systems to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.

A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold.

There are different ways you can incorporate gold into a currency: 

- In the gold specie standard the monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin, but other coins may be made of less valuable metal.

- The gold exchange standard usually does not involve the circulation of gold coins. The main feature of the gold exchange standard is that the government guarantees a fixed exchange rate to the currency of another country that uses a gold standard (specie or bullion), regardless of what type of notes or coins are used as a means of exchange. This creates a de facto gold standard, where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself. 

- Finally, the gold bullion standard is a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but the authorities agree to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for currency.

youcanreachardy,"While factors like those listed by others here do affect the price, it's generally going by the price at which the company can purchase the petrol for. When they're able to get it for cheaper, they get a better profit for offering it at a higher price, but can lower it to compete better with regional competitors (like the guy down the street). Larger chains might get a better deal, depending on where they're getting their supply from, so they get more play room with their profit margins and are able to drop prices when needed to get ahead of the local competition. 

Location also plays a factor. In my city here, there are a few stations (Domo, mostly) who have locations on major routes, and operate a very bare bones operation, but generally offer a much lower price than any other store in the city, since their traffic is much higher. 

But in the end, it all depends on what price they can acquire the gas for. ",null,0,cdmqc38,1rews6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
Johnhaven,"The cost of fuel at the pump is determined by the price the gas station buys it for. Which, generally, is determined on a daily basis. The gas station owner buys their fuel from a distributor, marks it up a modest amount (seriously, this is usually only a few cents a gallon) and resells it. The gas station across the street that is a few pennies more isn't necessarily trying to make more money from their fuel, they simply may have purchased their fuel at a price that necessitates the resale price at what you see at the pump. 

Gas stations do not change their price of fuel based on market fluctuations, they change their price of fuel based on market fluctuations that are passed along to them when they fill their in ground tanks so they can't make adjustments to fluctuations until the next time they buy fuel. If fuel dropped ten cents in the last week, they may be able to skim a few pennies per gallon off the top but they still need to charge at least what they paid for the fuel to recoup costs until the next fill up at which time they would pay a much lower price and then pass that savings along to you. 

Contrary to public opinion, higher gas prices actually lead to less profit for gas station owners. As prices rise, consumers become more scrutinizing of prices at competing stations than they normally would so station owners have to cut prices to compete with each other leading to smaller profit margins per gallon than they would otherwise see. This type of pricing is why you don't see ""gas stations"" anymore. Now, you see other retail establishments that also sell fuel - the fuel is just a loss leader to sell other things.

Kanye West also revolutionized a new style of recording music where he would make a ""skeleton beat"", have the rapper record over the skeleton beat, and then add in more effects and instruments to compliment the rapper.

BrooklynLaw,"In a nutshell, the producer is the person who creates and composes the elements of the song that you remember most, i.e., the melody and overall sound of the song, the ""hook"" or chorus, the beat, etc.  There are a lot of great rappers out there who don't have good music to rap over.  Kanye West may not be the best rapper out there, but his songs sound good (to most people), and they sound good because he produced them.  He's produced lots of songs for other rappers, like Jay-Z.  

If you were more interested in the role of a rap producer in general, basically most producers will start off with either a sample of music or a general drum beat and build a song around it.  A sample is a snippet from another artist's song that is altered in a way to incorporate it into a new original song.  Take Kanye's song ""Gold Digger,"" he started with a sample of Ray Charles's ""I Got a Woman"" and incorporated it into the song by looping it and laying it over a beat.  He created the drum beat in a similar fashion, using sampled drum sounds, but he likely didn't sample those himself.  Many producers can buy large batches of drum sounds as well as other instrument sounds from independent sample libraries.  If you gave 100 music producers the same sample from Ray Charles ""I Got a Woman,"" they may end up making 100 very different songs, of which, chances are, you'd end up liking Kanye West's the most.  Just like giving 100 chefs the same ingredients, chances are the best chef will create the tastiest meal.

In the context of electronic music, pop music and rap music - a producer's role is far greater: often develops beats, layering sounds, playing instruments or even *writing the song*. 

Look at someone like Deadmau5. When he's in the studio, he is not a DJ. He's not playing records, he's *making* records. He's writing songs from scratch, mixing, mastering, creating sounds, playing synths, programming drum machines and rhythms, recording, etc, etc. He's a *producer* in the studio, but a DJ on the stage. 

Kanye is similar. His ability to mix, master and engineer sound is highly technical and impressive.

They bundled all these risky mortgages together and then sold them under the assumption that statistically the majority of the people with mortgages would be repay them and make the owner some money. Nothing illegal here, a risky investment but risks aren't illegal. What happened was that credit rating agencies started rating these bundled mortgages as AAA, meaning the safest of the safest investment which was complete bullshit. This high rating led to many individuals, retirement plans, businesses, etc all investing in these plans under the assumption that they were safe.

In 2008 prices stopped going up.  New home sales slowed.  Interest-only loans started to mature, but now the homes weren't worth as much as projected.  People started to default on loans, increasing the supply of homes.  House prices dropped.  Banks were more cautious about who they loaned money to.

rixross,"Banker's bundled mortgages together and sold them to investors (these were called mortgage backed securities, or MBSs). The rating agencies rated them AAA (the same rating as bonds issued by the US Government), due to the fact that each MBS has mortgages from all over the country. The models that the rating agencies used assumed that there would not be a general decline in home prices across the country. 

It's actually more complicated than that, because what the bankers really did was bundle together hundreds of mortgages and then they separated it into different securities in a process called ""traunching"". In essence the security was split into several layers, all the losses would be born by the riskiest layer first, then the second riskiest layer, then the third, etc. In order for the final layer to have any losses every single other layer would have to be wiped out. Those layers were rated AAA by the rating agencies, even if the underlying mortgages were crap (for instance if the owner of the house doesn't even have a job).

The problem was that everyone assumed these securities were safe, so banks would hold them as ""Capital"" or the cushion used to absorb possible losses. These securities turned out to be pretty much worthless, and many banks found themselves essentially bankrupt. 

There is even more to this, as AIG and other banks sold ""Credit Default Swaps"" on these traunches of mortgage. This was essentially insurance that said ""If the homeowner doesn't pay you, I will"". The sellers of this ""insurance"" had to pay up and nearly went bankrupt (or would have if the government didn't bail them out.

The question is, however, why did all this happen? Some people would blame it on greed, but that would be like blaming an airplane crash on gravity (can't claim that analogy as my own). In my opinion, it was the housing bubble that caused the crisis, as banks and potential home buyers thought that prices could never go down and therefore all the investments described above were extremely safe.

There are lots of different branches of economics, Austrian, Keynesian, Mainstream, Post-Keynesian, Chicago, Marxist, even Feminist economics, and depending on the model you use you will get a different answer to the question.


Basically banks gave people lots of loans to buy houses. The price of houses kept going up so people bought houses as an investment (i'll buy it for $10 today and sell it for $15 next year, and use the $5 I made to pay back the loans). One day the market crashed, and houses that were worth $10 one day were all the sudden worth $5. Since some people were counting on making money later from their houses (which kept going up in value) to pay back the loans, when the market crashed they couldn't pay back the loans, and all the money the banks loaned out basically disappeared. This crash which really hurt the banks eventually hurt the stock market, and then hurt the whole economy. 

That's about as simple and objective as I can make it.

Throwcrastinator,"While I would want to elaborate on the background of nuclear proliferation in Iran (Assassination of Mohammed Mosadegh, Bushehr, Natanz etc.), that would take quite a while, and frankly, I'm lazy. So lets make this quick.

&gt;1) Why are we scared of Iran's nuclear operations? Even if they create a nuclear weapon, it seems to me extremely unlikely that they will be dropping the bomb on countries? Does the world seriously consider that Iran might drop a nuke on a western country?

Well, you are right, It would be highly unlikely that Iran would even dare announce that it is creating nukes, more than actually use them. Such an announcement would only invite more sanctions, wrecking their economy, 

and as far as usage is concerned, I doubt ANY nation would want to even CONSIDER using nuclear weapons, as nuking any other country is plain suicide, and WILL warrant retaliation from either the said nation, or any of it's allies. This was the basis of the cold war, the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. (Google it if you wanna know more)

Now the point is, Iran making nuclear weapons will most definitely spark a nuclear arms race in the middle east, which is something which the P5+1 does not want. Considering the Israel-Palestine situation, and much more recently, the situation in Syria, it is safe to say that the region is unstable. If Iran were to enrich weapon grade uranium, well, chaos would ensue.

Moreover, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, or the IRGC, the national guard of Iran, has several links with Hezbollah, Hamas, Jabhat Al Nusra, and various other 'terrorist' outfits and non state actors in the regions. While nation states wouldn't bother using these weapons, the western world sees a real threat in nuclear terrorism. Iran could potentially supply these groups with weapons grade uranium and wreak havoc. 

Furthermore, Iran is setting a dangerous precedent to other countries, in possibly violating parts of the NPT, which could worry the P5.

&gt; 2) The recent nuclear deal from what I understand is to delay Iran's nuclear operations for six months in return for removing sanctions. How is this a historic deal? They will be at ""it"" again in six months. I guess I do not understand how this is beneficial in the long run. Six months seems like nothing.

It's historic because, in the years since 1979, this is the closest we have got to, in getting Iran to quit their nuclear program, and this is a much better result than the failed six party talks with North Korea. This is beneficial for both Iran and the world, because
i) Lesser economic troubles for Iran, due to the removal of sanctions
ii) Gives the P5+1 more breathing space, and of course, more time to engage in talks.

In the long run, these six months could mean more talks with Iran, which could result in better relations with Iran and the west, and seeing that diplomacy is one of the weaker departments of our current dealings with the Middle East, this could be extremely beneficial. 
With this, one could be more confident of the complete removal of sanctions on Iran, which would mean a lot to both Iran and countries (like Germany) involved in trade with Iran.

garrettj100,"OK, if you want a visual way of looking at this problem, imagine you're starting out in a x,y grid at 0,0.  And now imagine there's a circle inscribed around the origin (0,0) with radius = 1.  That's called the *Unit Circle*.

Now, let's take it a little further.  Imagine that you've got a horizontal line going from 0,0 up toward 1,0.  That line defines a created from the angle it forms with the y-axis.

When it's at 0 degrees, then it's a horizontal line and you're not defining a triangle rather than just a horizontal line.  But as you increase that angle θ (imagine the minute hand sweeping **backwards** across a clock face) you define a triangle.

The *hypotenuse* of that triangle is the line emerging from (0.0) at angle θ.

The *adjacent* side of that triangle is the x-axis, going exactly as far to the right as the hypotenuse goes.

The *opposite* side of that triangle is a vertical line, dropping down from where the hypotenuse hits the edge of the circle.

Here's a diagram of what I'm talking about:

http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa09/Rosonet/EMAT%206690/essay2/rosonet_unitcircle2.gif

Now, it's pretty easy to see what the sine, cosine, and tangent functions do.  They calculate out the ratios between the opposite and adjacent sides relative to the hypotenuse, but in this example, the hypotenuse is conveniently stuck at exactly 1, so you can see the opposite and adjacent sides of the triangle growing and shrinking.

There's also a ""shorthand"" way to remember the values of the sine and cosine functions at important angles:

* sin(0°) = (0/4)^0.5 = 0
* sin(30°) = (1/4)^0.5 = 1/2
* sin(45°) = (2/4)^05 = 2^0.5 /2
* sin(60°) = (3/4)^0.5 = 3^0.5 /2
* sin(90°) = (4/4)^0.5 = 1

These values are part of the continuous function, sin(x):

http://i.stack.imgur.com/ghCG1.gif

________________________

* cos(0°) = (4/4)^0.5 = 1
* cos(30°) = (3/4)^0.5 = 3^0.5 /2
* cos(45°) = (2/4)^05 = 2^0.5 /2
* cos(60°) =  (1/4)^0.5 = 1/2
* cos(90°) = (0/4)^0.5 = 0

Here, for cosin(x)

http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/cos-graph_clip_image003.gif

This last image is **particularly** valuable, as it's showing the values of cos(x) as they relate to the vertical value of the triangle's *adjacent* side in the circle.  I couldn't find a corresponding image for sin(x).  If I had, it would've probably had to have the graph of sin(x) above or below (instead of to the left/right) of the circle.

________________________________


There's one last thing to keep in mind.  Often, sin, cos, and tan values aren't shown for 30°, 60°, 90°, etc...  Instead they're shown for values like π/6, π/2, or π.  Why?  Because there are two commonly used *units* for measuring angles.  The first is degrees.  But sometimes people use a unit called *radians*.  The reason they use radians?  Because radians work out such that an entire circle is 2*π radians.  Why?  Because for a unit circle, that just so happens to work out as the circumference of the full circle as well.  It's not an accident.  The idea is you can trivially determine the circumference of the arc defined by an angle by expressing it in radians.",null,10,cdmhdui,1reilz,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

Fairleee,"The default position for humanity on any topic is, 'do nothing'. If there is a particular problem that needs to be tackled, you need to somehow motivate enough humans that, instead of defaulting to doing nothing, they do something. We can see this on a micro-level. I'm sure a lot of kids don't want to go to school; they'd rather stay at home (this is the 'do nothing' option). The aim is to get them to go to school, i.e., 'do something'. So, how do you do this? A combination of carrot and stick: you promise them both long and short term benefits that going to school offers (long term includes better jobs and therefore standard of living resulting from an education, short term includes seeing their friends, being offered activities that they enjoy such as music, sport or drama etc.), and have both long and short term 'punishments' in place if they don't go (missing out on education harms their future education and career prospects, repeated absence increases likelihood of social services getting involved, absence results in discipline from parents in whatever form - being grounded etc.). The end result is, the kids are motivated to go to school because doing something will yield a net positive result (both in terms of rewards and by not being punished) compared to doing nothing.

When it comes to climate change, the science is agreed that humanity is having an effect on the climate, and this effect will likely to be detrimental to humanity (of course we aren't going to destroy the planet, but we can make it far, far harder for humans to live on). But, as with anything, our default position is, 'do nothing'. So, we need politicians, business leaders, societal leaders, religious leaders etc. to take a stance, that something needs to be done, in order to motivate us to do something rather than do nothing. Unfortunately, the things we need to do are pretty hard - it would involve massive reductions in the amount of fossil fuels we use, widespread curbing of CO2 emissions by factories and vehicles, major investment in green technologies. Furthermore, we aren't likely to see the benefit from this for some time, so it is hard to motivate people with promises of future benefits without some short-term, immediate benefits. Of course the benefits will be there - less air pollution, better designed cities, disruptive technological development etc., but this is years down the line. In the meantime, there will be a cost to pay. You know how much we like to buy cheap things? Put in place carbon reduction requirements for business, and those cheap things will get a lot more expensive.

However, these issues are not insurmountable, if we have a consistent message from society's leaders that they are necessary. Unfortunately, there is entrenched opposition to this, from people who are benefitting from the status-quo and don't want to see it changed (looking at you, Big Oil). They are responsible for putting out two messages; firstly, that there is not sufficient evidence that the problem exists (which isn't true), and secondly, that the cost of it will massively outweigh the benefits. They use a number of techniques, including exploiting people's well-known propensity for conspiratorial thinking by suggesting that all academics are part of some shadowy plot designed to pull the wool over the world's eyes in order to continue receiving funding (FYI, the amount of funding that goes into climate change research is nothing compared to the oil industry's annual revenues). People who oppose the human cause of climate change don't try to disprove human-caused climate change, and don't need to - besides, they can't. But, by muddying the waters, by insisting on the need for further research, that the evidence isn't there, that models climate researchers users have some flaws, the general public does not have the education they need on climate change, and therefore there is not enough impetus to do something. Because the people aren't demanding that something be done, politicians, business leaders etc. don't need to do something. Yes, there are calls to do something by a number of groups, and some things are being done (Germany for example is massively investing in green energy), but there isn't sufficient will to carry through on a broad enough scale to make the changes that are needed.

rearviewclouds,"The short answer is no.

The longer answer is way longer than this post, but it starts something like this: 

You hit the nail on the head with one of the reasons - transplant surgery is ""major"" - there are risks involved with all elements of the surgery:   anaesthetic, the laparotomy  (i.e. it is 'open' surgery), and the surgery is technically difficult and fiddly. 

To be allowed to donate your kidney in the first place, you must be in sufficiently good renal (and otherwise) health to operate on just the one - essentially, you are pretty much perfectly healthy, just with one kidney. Thus there is no need to subject a ""healthy"" person to the risks of a major operation/anaesthetic and the challenges of post op recovery (infections, blood clots, pneumonia etc etc)  


Another big reason is that organs need a blood supply to survive, and decay starts as soon as the blood supply is lost.  In transplant surgery there are strict time limits for taking organs out of a 'donor' and being put into a 'recipient'. Sooner is better. 

After a certain time, the organs undergo irreversible changes that mean they won't be able to usefully operate, even if they were put back in another person.   Organs are put on ice until they are ready to be plugged into the donor, which limits the rate of decay of the organs, but damage from a lack of blood supply is always inevitable. (Google things like ""cold ischemic time"" and ""warm ischemic time"" for further details.)

Essentially, most of the donors are patients in ICU environments who are 'brain dead'.  They are on 'life support' which means that machines have taken over the job of keeping the airway open and providing oxygen/nutrition to the body. Blood is still pumping around their body, getting to the organs (kidneys, liver, heart, lungs etc) - but not the brain.  

So the kidneys are still alive and working, and are suitable to be put into someone else. During the transplant retrieval operation, this blood supply is cut and the organs are removed. Ultimately, the donor dies during the donation surgery. Clearly, this is a huge thing to consider for the donor's loved ones - one of the many reasons organ donation is such a complex area. 

(The other main scenario is a 'live donor' situation such as you are talking about - where the donor has an operation to retrieve the organ,  thus normal blood supply is maintained right until the operation to donate)

So... in our scenario - it would be technically possible to get your kidney back, if the person you gave it to became brain dead in an ICU type environment. 

But you would be doing fine without it.

(Organ transplantation is a huge and complex topic - this is only the beginning of the explanation. The ethical/spiritual side is also fascinating)

[source - work in a transplant centre] ",null,10,cdmi3a5,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,30
anubis_of_q,"Unfortunately no.  When your kidney goes into the recipient, their body immediately starts attacking it.  Doctors do some testing to help reduce the amount of damage host does to the donor kidney (HLA typing), but it doesn't check for everything, which is why transplant patients are placed on immunosuppressive medications (medications that reduces the immune system of the host). 

Those drugs are also toxic to the kidneys as well.  So its a balance between drug toxicity and immunosuppression.  Thus, the kidneys will undergo damage, and over a period of years will become dysfunctional (people with transplants do not return to normal life-expectancy, it is just temporarily elongated).  Longterm causes of mortality of people who undergo transplantation will be that they either die of the infections secondary to immunosuppression, diseases secondary to the cause of the original disease requiring the transplant, or kidney failure from drug or host damage.  

so in the end the risk of the surgery does not outweigh getting the kidney back.  You would be hardpressed to find a surgeon who would be willing to do the surgery.  

Now i do remember an article published awhile back that stated that a transplanted kidney was retransplanted into another patient who needed it (not back to the donor), because the cause of death was irrelevant to the kidney itself.

It is estimated that only 1–4% of the total number of people dying in hospitals and about 10% of those dying in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) die in the situation known as “brain death”](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-011-0201-8_20) [...]

ProSaint,"I have absolutely no expertise on health issues but the kidney functions as a Mason jar of sorts that is a place your urine passes through before it goes to the bladder. The kidney takes any left over nutrients and gives them to any homeless bloodcells that pass through it.

All the homeless cells have to find a new home-usually your pancreas for males. If you're a female, they go to your pancreas too. If you get that kidney back and the gallbladder hasn't let all the homeless cells out, you will have an over abundance of vagrants in your body begging all your other organs for a dollar.

lmckl1,"Hey reddit. I work for organ transplant. Although it is not outside the realm of possibility for this to happen, if you were in need of a kidney you would likely receive one from another donor. There are a few points to take into consideration:

-The kidney you donated will likely be in rough shape from years of anti-rejection medications and other meds the recipient is likely on.
-How functional is your own remaining kidney? If you're fine and don't need a transplant, they are not going to do it. It is no small surgery.
-Speaking of surgery. Do you want another one. Many living kidney donors end up having complications after their donation such as large hernias under their incision site. When receiving a kidney, it is attached to your abdominal aorta, so you would have an incision site at your belt line.
-What did the recipient die from? If they died from renal failure, you probably don't want that kidney back.

I can only think of one organ donor that I've seen that has also been a recipient- but their heart was going for transplant, so that's probably why. Typically post transplant patients screen out medically for organ donation.

MCHaker,"A credit card isn't actually a necessity, though it is usually one of the first things that come to mind when people think about credit in general. There are a lot of ways to build your credit, from paying bills on time, leasing a car or renting a home from an agency that reports to credit bureaus. As you mentioned, though, the initial step while purchasing or leasing something is usually a credit check. Another good way to build credit is to take out loans for which you have the assets/cash on hand to immediately pay back. It is good to have a somewhat substantial payment history, but you can pay them back right away (just be sure there are no early repayment fees). 

I believe you are asking why is having credit better than having no credit history at all, while assuming that if you have no credit history you are not living beyond your means and can afford what you want to purchase. The problem with that is that businesses, such as banks, have no way of knowing whether or not it is actually you that is the responsible party funding your lifestyle. Many people rely on parents or whoever for money, so giving a mortgage (for example) to someone who is perhaps relying on someone else for money (or at least can't prove a reliable track record for making payments on time) would be an irresponsible business practice and would almost surely result in financial loss. In summary, if you can afford what you want to buy, and that object is a house, buy the house out right and do not take a mortgage out. That shows that you can't afford the house, but you can afford a mortgage. I would break it down more, but I'm on a phone and that's pretty much the gist of it.",null,0,cdmf4zn,1ree66,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

biblicallove,"Cable and cell phone bills might affect your credit score minimally--for example if you're paying off a cell phone in installments (like how T-Mobile does now). If anything, they'd affect your score more if you missed a payment than if you make all of them on time.  

If you don't want a credit card, paying off student loans or a car loan can help build credit. Having no credit history doesn't give a creditor the idea that you don't buy things you can't afford.  Lenders for mortgages might examine your expenses to income ratio and that's going to be a clear indicator of that anyway.

Having a credit card doesn't mean that you live beyond your means.  They can provide liquidity and opportunity costs when used properly.  A BAD example is using a credit card to buy a huge TV because it's on sale--that's not helpful at all.  

But for a good example, I keep very little savings in a liquid account.  Most of my savings are in ETFs or Mutual Funds.  So that way I theoretically can earn a good return on my savings as opposed to the ridiculously low interest the banks pay.  If I have a major unplanned expense (car needs new tires?) I will usually just charge it to my card and pay it off in the same month when I get my next paycheck.  If there's a major difference in what I can come up with from my check, then I'll withdraw money from my stocks.  

Keeping a running balance on a credit card is only a good plan if it's a lower interest rate than you'd get from something like a home equity loan or some other non-revolving account.  Life does have a way of coming up with huge, necessary expenses at terrible times--and sometimes you might just need to have a credit card to pay for it.

police-ical,"Wires are a common analogy for neurons, the main cells of your brain (and the rest of your nervous system.) It's a fair comparison: neurons are long and thin, rapidly conduct electricity to carry signals, and even have a coating of insulation.

Neurons communicate with other neurons at points called synapses, where they almost but don't quite touch. Instead, one neuron sends chemicals called neurotransmitters to the next neuron; different chemicals make the next neuron more or less likely to keep the signal going.

Whereas most body cells divide to make more of themselves, neurons mostly only come from neural stem cells. By adulthood, your brain has (almost) all the cells it will ever have. As a result, you can't rely solely on making new neurons to make new memories, learn new things, change your emotions, and such.

Synapses, on the other hand, can be made or eliminated (and strengthened or weakened) throughout your entire life. This process of changing the connections between brain cells is what ""rewiring"" broadly describes. In that sense, rewiring happens anytime you learn anything, make a new memory, or even use an old memory; it happens every minute of the day. People commonly use ""rewiring"" to mean something more like ""changing my patterns of thinking or behavior in the long term,"" which is obviously a little harder than making a new memory, but still very much possible. We'd have given up on cognitive-behavioral therapy a long time ago if it weren't.

Big picture: Given that you have maybe one hundred billion neurons, each with thousands of synapses, the total number of connections is likely in the hundreds of trillions.

Anyway, what you can do in this case is to break the memory into parts, like movie clips, and in between clips, imagine a moment that is strongly positive: like locking eyes with a loved one or your puppy, so you get a little oxytocin.

They can. Why aren't we just using normal CPUs?

Well, we have been, according to [this](http://www.micron.com/~/media/Documents/Products/Other%20Documents/automata_processing_technical_paper.pdf).

&gt;though good results using simulated NFA have been reported in some situations [8].

They also give the reason for creating a hardware implementation, which is that it works better in pretty much every way.

&gt;We have created an architecture purpose-built for direct implementation of NFA which achieves significantly improved processing efficiency, capacity, expressiveness and computational power. We also expect dramatic improvements in cost and power consumption compared to other approaches from the silicon implementation, in fabrication at the time of writing.

It works better because it allows calculations for an automaton to be done completely in parallel, whereas a CPU has to do all the calculations in series. This makes the calculation of the result of large grids much faster.",null,0,cdmgpyi,1rec5o,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

The force acts on everything on Earth and on the moon, but land and other solids are not noticeably affected by the force.

That's less than $1500/month for a single person, and just under $2500/month for a household of three.

I live in Brooklyn and have made about $800/month for the last six months while stupidly trying to save a failing company.

**How people get by:**

* Roommates. Even if you aren't poor, if you aren't *rich* you probably have roommates. If you tried to rent alone you're unlikely to find anything, even an illegal windowless basement apartment in the outer boroughs that floods when it rains, for less than $1000/month. Get three or four rent-paying adults together, and the cost per individual starts to go down. If you don't know anyone in NYC you could move in with, check Craigslist room-share ads.
* Every room can be a bedroom. My boyfriend and his roommate shared a one bedroom; my boyfriend had the bedroom, his roommate's mattress was in the kitchen, which was the only other room they had. My apartment is officially a 3 bedroom with a basement; we subdivided the basement with curtains and turned it into two more bedrooms.
* Think small. When I first got here, for $500/month I slept in a 6ftx9ft windowless room that was legally classified as a closet.
* Think alternatives to conventional apartments. A friend of mine really wanted to live in Manhattan, and not have roommates. For $650 he rents a small dorm-style room with shared bathroom and kitchen in a building otherwise mostly populated by elderly Chinese immigrants.
* A lot of artists also rent ""studio space"" that isn't legally zoned for housing, then ""secretly"" sleep there. But they have to be pretty discrete, can't have a visible bed or anything that obvious. I've known some who set up lofted ""storage space"" that hides a futon mat behind rows of paint buckets. Bathroom is down the hall, and there is no kitchen or shower, so get a hot plate and a gym membership so you can shower there.
* Forget Manhattan; the outer boroughs are much cheaper. Average commute is 45 minutes; bring a book. 
* Debt. I racked up a lot of credit card debt when I first moved here, buying stuff like food and toilet paper and my train card. Recently I went a bit further into credit card debt, sold my car, borrowed money from relatives, and finally had to cash out what little retirement savings I had. Hopefully I'll find a new job before that runs out.

Luckycharms323,"The Federal Reserve (Fed) is actually not a United States entity.  The Fed board of governors represent the private banks in each of their 12 different regions.  The Fed essentially operates as any other business except their assets (dollars) get printed any time they wish.  With these assets they buy certain liabilities such as treasury bills (foreign and domestic), gold, and lately, mortgaged backed securities. Once purchased these become part of their balance sheet.  

The Fed has two main objectives - to stabilize interest rates and keep unemployment low.  There is debate whether any thing they can do has any effect in the short term.  However in the long term, there is evidence that they can pull off these objectives.

Your question is rather open ended and the topic is very deep, but I assume you are asking because of the the qualitative easing programs that have been going on since the start of the financial crisis.  The Fed's balance sheet has quadrupled since the beginning of the financial crisis.  This is unheard of in the history of the Fed.  The two main liabilities that have been purchased with all this printed money have been mortgaged backed securities and US treasury bills.  The reason that these two liabilities were purchased is to maintain low interest rates of US t-bill and get toxic housing assets of the balance sheet os the banks.  The reason that inflation has not exploded is because, although this money is out there in the economy, it is not being used for many everyday transactions yet.

There is much debate about what would happen if some of the liabilities default but as we have never seen an inflated Fed like we do today it is impossible to say what the actual consequences would be.  I believe not much would change and they would just print more money and buy more liabilities.

Ray229harris,"I workin a meat department so i can partly explain this question to the best of my knowledge. 

A cow is like a human. We are both pretty much bones, muscles, and fat. 

The more a muscle gets used, the tougher the meat is. So if someone was gonna eat a human, arm meat would be pretty chewy. So would leg and thigh meat. 

Since the animal's legs and neck muscles do the most work, they are the toughest/chewiest/least tender

The butt of the cow (known as the round) is the fairly cheap cause cow rumps are hard and muscly and have little fat so the meat is tougher. 

Ribeyes on the other hand come from the upper rib cage area, which does not support much of the cow's weight, so they are perfect. A little bit of fat (intramuscular fat aka marbling) and tender soft meat makes this a delicious easy to eat cut of meat. 


So long story short, the more tender the meat, the more expensive. The tougher it is, the cheaper it is.

On top of that, there is the ability for a phone to record audio.  Cell phones typically receive audio through a tiny hole in their framing.  As you can imagine, a tiny hole cannot record the same quality of sound as a high-end microphone.  

Lastly, there's playback.  Like the phone's microphone, the speakers are also sub-par.  If you've ever listened to music on a smart phone, you can tell the quality is obviously no where near the quality you'd get from a good sound system.

When we switched to digital transmission, the same sort of standards were retained. This reduced the amount of information needed to transmit the audio, getting more calls over the same, expensive data connections. 

Now, of course, this nickle-and-diming makes no sense - connections are cheap and fast.

The number of people who need transition-related care is far smaller than the number of people who need dental work, and the consequences of not being able to transition are incredibly severe, so part of it is about getting maximum return for minimum expense. That said, it's very common for provincial law to make it as difficult as possible for trans people to transition, meaning that even fewer people can access those services. (For example, my home province covers several specialist services that aren't available there... but those procedures have to be performed in-province to be eligible for coverage.)

Trans people are a small, stigmatized minority group that the general public doesn't understand, so even if a group of us gets together to pool our scanty resources and do something about the situation, public backlash is usually so extreme that provincial gov't will throw us under the bus to appeal to their non-trans constituents who are yapping about our ""lifestyle choices"". To government, it's win-win: we're officially covered by provincial health (so the province looks good on paper from a human rights perspective) but in practice, it's incredibly difficult to get care (so as little funding as possible actually goes towards helping us and the uneducated voters don't get their shorts in a twist).

sir_sri,"&gt;What exactly is incest? 

Different cultures and societies define it slightly differently - but it's basically when you have sex with a close relative (importantly, when you have children with them).  In most of the world that would be relations closer than first cousins, but first cousins is ok.  (So parent and child or siblings or half siblings).  

&gt;How do the first 2 humans and their immediate descendants mate?

The first two 'humans' were a parent and child, and there's no reason to think they had children with each other.   

Some biologists would probably get annoyed at my terminology here, it's been a while - basically population groups can interbreed and not produce offspring at all, produce fertile offspring, or not.   Modern humans are far enough removed from any of our primate relations that we can't produce offspring at all (nor can people and Cats even though we are both mammals). But human population groups gradually evolved and the point of what counts as a modern 'human' is somewhat arbitrary, one day a child was born that was a modern human, but looked pretty much the same as mom and dad, and that child had children with someone who was of the same species as mom and dad, but that child was also across the threshold for being human, and they kept having children with other members of the overall tribe - and a few generations and everyone is a 'human' and not what immediately preceded but looked a lot like humans.  

About 200 000 years ago the 'parent' species of modern humans existed - Homo Sapiens http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Homo_sapiens, modern humans are a subspecies of that, so if any of them existed we could likely have fertile offspring with them, though they seem to have been replaced somewhere between 200 000 and 90 000 years ago by modern Homo Sapiens Sapiens (yes the repeated sapiens is deliberate, and yes, that's us).  Somewhere in there or contemporary to Homo Sapiens where Neanderthals - who might be the same subspecies or might not.  

If you were living at the time you wouldn't have know the 'first human' as being necessarily particularly distinct - evolution is a slow gradual process involving large populations and propagating genes through those populations (or eliminating genes from those populations).  Some future anthropologist could look at you and say you mark the first line of a New species as separate from your parents - where we draw lines for historical species is somewhat arbitrary and it's not like we have fossil records for every human like thing that has ever lived, so there's no clear break of 'one generation is this another generation that' it's more of a 'this fossil from 40k years ago is enough different from the one from 160k years ago that we call them different'.

Thus, any supernatural power is ""breaking the rules,"" and thus would only come from a force that doesn't care about the rules and is thus evil. Since they think that spirits are not bound by human limitations and are thus never in morally grey areas, but either ""pure"" good or evil, they consider the concept of ""real"" magic to be toying with insanely evil forces whose evil far surpasses that of any humans, and is thus dangerous to even humor the concept. They consider fiction that glorifies ""witchcraft"" then to be opening the doorway to kids getting into it. (even if they think it's a game, and not real.) 

This is further exaggerated with the advent of new religions like wiccanism or some forms of neopaganism, where some practitioners call themselves ""witches,"" and pretend to have a link to historical witches, and be a similar belief system. Since historically witch was a name for people seen as evil and utilizing evil forces, some Christians now think that those people are indirectly playing with the same forces, and thus at severe risk. They think that even in fiction it makes no sense for magic to be ""good,"" so kids will get into it. Like magic, want to play games about ""magic"" and might when they are older get into darker things which are in over their heads.

Note that they don't all necessarily think witchcraft is ""real."" (In fact, for most of the middle ages it was considered heretical to believe in witchcraft. Peasants did anyways.) Some of them think it's less about real dark forces, and more simply about kids getting into odd cultish philosophies.

The big difference now though, is that in QM nothing is certain. Our world is now based on probabilities. What is the likeliness of finding an atom at a certain energy or a wave penetrating a barrier?

One of the key principle of QM is the uncertainty principle. The more precisely we measure one aspect of a particle (like its velocity) the less certain we can be of another aspect (like location). Think of it like this. If I want to measure the location of something, I'm have to see it. How do I see something? I shine a light on it and observe it. Now if I shine a light on a car, it won't do much to the speed of the car, will it? And my measurement of the cars location is very large, say on the order of inches. Now the flip side. I shine a light on an electron to see where it is. Well I saw it, but now the photons (particles that make up light) hit the electron and off it speeds. I no longer know it's speed. Thats because I have to measure its location to a lot more precision, say microns, so my knowledge of its speed must be larger.

There's your intravascular space full of blood and its constituents. Then your extra vascular space which is basically everything else. When you burn your finger on the frying pan and you get that fluid filled blister, it is basically fluids from your IVS that migrates out in response to the injury. Google transudate and exudate for more info on why fluids from the IVS might seep through the blood vessels to the other side. 

The two compartments are separate. So you aren't just filled with blood. In acute inflammation for example, your white blood cells must respond to the injury or pathogen. So lets say you get a splinter  your WBCs will want to eliminate the threat. But they are in the IVS so they actually migrate to the walls of the blood vessel and squeeze out of the vessel through the cells of the vessel wall to reach the EVS. 

Now for what is between your organs. Your lungs are covered by a double layered membrane called pleura. And it's double layered so it has a potential space between the layers filled with a fluid. It's to reduce friction. To imagine how it's double layered, imagine a balloon that you blow up. Then you press on side of the balloon until you reach the other side. That's sorts how the lung bud develops. It pushes into the balloon and eventually the balloon is just a double layered membrane surrounding it. Between your lungs is the mediastinum which has its subdivisions. Basically the heart and its pericardium etc, the trachea, oesophagus, various nerves (vagus, phrenic etc) reside between your lungs. 

The GIT is a little more complicated. But it also has a similar concept like the pleura but its called the peritoneum.  Interesting fact: the peritoneum is completely closed in males but in females it just goes around the uterus and is incomplete lower down. If the peritoneum covered the entire female reproductive system, then the baby would have to bust thru that on its way out. So technically you could blow into a vagina and air would seep into the peritoneal cavity. It's not as crude as that but p there are procedure involving introducing air or fluids to check for leaks, if I'm nit wrong.

All parts of your body have proteins, and without them, you could not function. What gives these proteins their abilities is their unique shape. Proteins are really one long chain of amino acids bent in various shapes depending on the order of the aminos. At certain extremes, pH extremes, and other situations, these proteins unwind back into their original shapes. At this point they are useless.



In most mammals, proteins much sooner when in contact with heat than with cold. The 20 degree change is enough to ruin those proteins so your body responds.

Thaimeancurry,"History and politics grad here: WW2 has been broken down into a very simple story that is easy to tell to kids. Most wars or genocides are very complicated. Both sides have arguments, both sides caused it to some degree, no one is completely innocent. Often the winners are more in the wrong than the losers. But with WW2, the losing side was completely and utterly wiped out and erased from existence. Because the war is painted as everyone verses Nazis rather than Germany, which still exists and has people and feelings, there is no need to tell the story anything other than black and white.
(Just to clarify, I am by NO MEANS defending nazis, simply that their annihilation makes the basic story a simple one to tell compared even to WW1)

So the basic story of WW2 is simple for school kids to understand: Hitler and the nazis try to take over the world because they are evil. The basic story of the holocaust is simple too compared to other genocides. Hitler tried to wipe out an entire race of people just because he didn't like their faces essentially. In other genocides I've studied, while the actions are no less horrific, the details are murkier. There is usually a civil war or some other huge internal upheaval in the country. There is a lot of violence and death and destruction other than the genocide, and it can be hard for observers to tell what exactly happened. The holocaust was also very coldly organised. People were singled out for a particular reason, rounded up, imprisoned, starved and murdered on a massive scale. Life was more or less as normal for the rest of the population while Jews were stripped of everything. Compare that to the Khmer Rouge which was trying to purge 'subversive elements', and essentially picked victims on random whims and slaughtered masses. People still don't really understand what happened there. 

The final reason is the nature of the victims. Jews have always lived all around the world. The trait that singled them out for murder is shared by many people in many places. In other genocides this isn't the case, the people picked are very localised, and don't really live anywhere else. How many Tutsis do you know? Or intellectual Cambodians? Or Bosniaks? How many of them are middle class Americans? Not many I'd guess. The holocaust is remembered because it was relevant to powerful groups who wanted it remembered. A genocide that happens to middle class white westerners makes more of an impact on the world than one that happens to Africans or Muslims.

People were disposed of in mass quantities because they were seen as inferior and sub-human.  Sure, there have been many genocides throughout history, but nothing happened on the scale of the holocaust.  6 million (or more) people were exterminated because a small group of powerful people decided they shouldn't continue living.  On top of that, the Nazis couldn't get rid of the Jews quick enough, so they invented ways to kill them more quickly, cheaply, and efficiently.  Many people argue that Stalin killed more people and should be talked about more in regards to his evils, but while he may have caused more death and suffering, nothing was as systematic and deliberate than Hitler's holocaust.  The American school system probably wants to highlight the fact that so many people died because a small group came into power, under the will of the governed, and caused so much destruction.

Professor_Snuggles,"If you have bad vision (i.e. need glasses or something) then this works by restricting the directions from which light can enter your eye.

In a healthy eye light coming in from a particular direction will be bent by the lens so that it focuses on a specific point on the retina. That's the colour/intensity you perceive coming from that direction. Do that all over the place and you have yourself an image.

In someone with near/far-sightedness the focus point of that light is either in front of or behind the retina. The part that hits the retina from some direction is a small blob of light. This blob overlaps with those from nearby directions, so one spot on the retina sees light from a whole region of space, leading to blur.

If you squint (or better: make a small pinhole with your fingers), then you're restricting the light to hit your eye in a very thin cone, which reduces the level of ""blobbing"" and gives you better resolution.",null,0,cdmbn1z,1rdt9q,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

Scenario_Editor,"[Wiki section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_solar_cells#Cell_temperature)

So your run of the mill solar panel works because the electrons in the silicon are separated into two layers. There is a bottom layer of electrons with the silicon itself (the valence band), a layer of no electrons (band gap) and a top layer of electrons that move around (conduction band). A photovoltaic cell works be having a photon (light particle) come in and give its energy to an electron in the lower layer so that it can jump from the inner layer over the layer of nothing and into the top layer where the electron can move around and essentially create a current. [This is also why silicon  is called a semi conductor, because it conducts in some situation and insulates in others]. 

Now, that band gap (the layer of nothing) is partially dependent on temperature. Temperature is sort of like the average energy of all the electrons, the majority of which are in the lower valence band. A higher temperature means that they will have a bit more energy and the band gap will be smaller, so you'll get more current out of your cell which is good.

 Bandgap has its fingers in many pies though, and changing the temperature is changing the bandgap. Changing the bandgap will change the highest possible voltage that the circuit can have. Higher temperatures end up having lower maximum voltages

[This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:I-V_Curve_T.png) pretty much explains what happens with temperature. Higher temperatures mean higher current and lower maximum voltage. The voltage rapidly decreases though, so you can think of it as either on or off, and so you'd generally want higher temperatures. At any rate, the effect is fairly marginal.

diMario,"It is a bit different than that. In normal physics, when you don't measure something you don't know the value of whatever it was that you did not measure.

When you *do* decide to measure the value (you *observe the system*) you find one single value. You deduce that it did have that particular value all along, even at the time when you hadn't measured it yet. Furthermore, when you repeat the measurement you expect to find that exact same value, no matter how often you measure it. Within tolerances of accuracy.

In quantum physics, this is not the case. You can make measurements, and each time you measure something the outcome can be one of several possible values. The first measurement yields 3, the second and third measurement yield 7, and the fourth measurement yields 3 again. You cannot know in advance what value will be measured, only that it will be one of several distinct values that follow a certain statistical distribution.

This phenomenon is explained by assuming that before the measurement, the quantum physical system has *several different values for the same quantity at the same time*. In quantum physic speak we say that the system can be in different states at the same time. We do not know what state it is in until we make a measurement (observe the system) and as we make more measurements, we will find different values grouped according to some statistical distribution.

Now, the experiment involving Schr&amp;ouml;dingers cat says that a certain elementary particle has or has not decayed during a certain time. If it has, the cat is poisoned, if it hasn't, the cat lives. Because it is a quantum physical system, we say that the two states (decayed particle/not decayed) both exist at the same time for the system. This translates into the cat being both dead and alive at the same time prior to the measurement. Only after observing the system, one would find that the cat is either dead or alive.

However, it would degrade rather quickly for other reasons. Space is a harsh place. Without an protective atmosphere, one half gets the full force of the sun's heat while the other is in bitter cold. This is the same sort of reason that Africa is very hot while Antarctica is very cold; but magnified to even more extreme levels. This is why most satellites are wrapped up in that shiny foil looking stuff (a space blanket). They are very good at reflecting heat. They bounce heat from the sun back away into space and bounce your own heat back in towards you; this helps keep the satellite a constant temperature instead of swinging all over the place.

daveisnotafk,"TFSA's and RRSP's do have similarities, and differences (I assume you're Canadian)

Let's talk about RRSP's:

RRSP stands for Registered Retirement Savings Plan. Basically, these are more or less savings funds that you set up before you retire, in hopes of creating an income stream for yourself in the future (thus by, converting it to a RRIF 'income fund'). How it works is that you are taking money out of your earnings and putting it away until you retire. Any money you put away then gets 'deducted' from how much you earn in a year. So for example, say you made $30,000 this year, and you've put $10,000 into your RRSP. The government will tax your income as if you've only made $20,000. Pretty neat huh? By doing that, you have the opportunity to put money into an investment (free of taxes), allowing it to grow (yet again, free of taxes) until you retire. Once you hit a certain age ( I believe it's 71 ), you're essentially 'too old' to maintain an RRSP, so you'd have to move your funds into what's called an RRIF (registered retirement income fund). Once you have your RRIF, you can start withdrawing the money you've saved all your life... and pay tax on those withdrawls. 

So if you can deduct so much money from your income tax, doesn't it make sense to put away .. 80% of your annual income in an RRSP so you can enjoy awesome tax breaks? Nope! Doesn't work quite like that. Every year, the government sets a limit as to how much you can put away in your RRSP. It's about ~18k-21k (double confirm with your bank, or financial advisor) CAD or up to 18% of your income. Now, not everyone can afford to put away that much money, so the money that they didn't put away the year before, carries away to the next year. So say if the limit last year was $8000, and you put away $5000; you still have $3000 limit that can carry forward to next year. If the limit next year is $9500, you can put up to $9500 plus your previous year's left over limit... total $12500. 

If it's your first time buying a home, you can take up to $10,000 from your RRSP in a program set up called the ""home buyer's plan"". It allows you to take a tax-free loan from your RRSP's as long as you pay it back within 10 years. This helps you put towards a down payment on a home for yourself. 

If you're in a bind and you need money right away, any money you take out from an RRSP will get taxed as added income. So say if you needed cash, and you took $10,000 out of your RRSP, and your annual income is $30,000; you will be taxed on $40,000 worth of income (nasty!). 

RRSP's are good because they can help you reduce your tax rate if you contribute enough. 


TFSA's

TFSA's are a new 'invention' that allows you to invest pre-taxed dollars, allowing it to grow tax-free. There's no limit as to how much you can put, because the money you put in has already been taxed.

How has the money been taxed already? Simple. When you file your annual income taxes, any income you make is subject to your marginal tax rate (the rate at which you pay taxes based on your income level). 

The government is allowing you to deposit money, and letting it grow tax free. The cool part about this is that since you've already paid your taxes, the withdrawls are tax free. 

What about the fees for managing a TFSA? Most banks have what's called ""zero load"" or.. ""no fee"" accounts that you can open. They are no fee, and also offer low interest rates. If you go with a higher end fund with another fund company, you may be charged a DSC (deferred sales charge) based on the provisioning of the fund, for a set term, before it becomes 'free'. In the sense of a bank though, it's pretty much zero fees. There's other things to consider too, such as MER's (management expense ratios) if you're going with a fund that requires a higher degree of management, but like I said, if it's at a bank, it's not likely you'll incur those expenses. 

Last thing to note, RRSP's and TFSA's are not some ""off the shelf"" product you can just go out and buy. Most people are mislead to believe that you just go ""get an RRSP"" or ""get a TFSA"". It doesn't work like that. 

RRSP's and TFSA's are merely CONTRACTS WITH RULES THAT YOU FOLLOW. A financial institution, be it a bank, or investment firm can offer RRSP or TFSA's on ANY of their funds.. be it a savings/chequing account.. a bond, a GIC, money market fund, mutual fund, ... virtually anything. 

For example: 

Person A's RRSP is based on a GIC. 
Person B's RRSP is based on a mutual fund.

1) To have immigration, a country must have a higher living standard, wealth, opportunity, etc. than the country the immigrants are coming from. For many Asian countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia, Bangladesh, the -stans, etc, that isn't the case.

2) The richer countries tend to have strict immigrant laws or limited opportunities for Immigrants. Japan, while wealthy, is very racist and has strict laws against immigrants, so immigration isn't very large. China has a population issues of its own and has limited room for immigrants outside of certain cities such as Hong Kong, where immigrants are usually domestic servants. South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are similar to Hong Kong in that that immigrants don't have much opportunity beyond domestic servants (edit: This does not include already rich individuals immigrating to Singapore and other locations to avoid taxes).

sir_sri,"&gt; but asian counties have stayed asian why is that?

Define 'asian'.   China has been the most populous country for several thousand years (depending on how you count india), people don't move there, people move from there.  And they have ended up in a lot of  places.  

China (well parts of it) along with Korea did have problems with Japanese 'immigrants' - in the sense that the Japanese moved in and tried to massacre people  and take over, and Japan and Russia and China clashed over territories in northern China for a while, but Japan was late to the colonization game.  

India is an artificial construct by the british (as is Pakistan and Bangladesh)- the various predecessor states had movements of people and religion and in many cases at the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.  And they had a mass migration with the partition of india that packed up a huge chuck of hindu's and muslims and shuffled them all around.  

But generally you don't immigrate to places that have a lot of people already - that sort of defeats the purpose.  Vietnam, Malaysia the Philippines etc. have all had chinese immigrants (some more recent than others) but there's not a whole lot lot of it.  

And that's kind of it.  Japan didn't really become a power capable of colonizing until the 1860's - and they invaded China and Korea (and left after WW2).  Up until 1820 or so basically the entire world except china and south east asia was under the thumb of one imperial power or another.  After the Napoleonic wars Spain lost control of central and south america, but then the Europeans started making moves on Asia - the Asian powers never really had the chance for a lot of immigration, as the europeans were usually not letting them in, and there was no where you'd want to go in south east asia - except malaysia that needed labour for tea and then rubber.  

To have migration you need to be rich enough to leave, but poor enough that you don't want to stay - and need to have somewhere that will take you.  Chinese workers and Japanese were able to move with very unpleasant restrictions in the mid 1800's but they were not really full citizens most places they could go.  Everyone else was either too poor to leave, under the thumb of a colonial power or not welcome.  And most of the time that applied to Japanese and Chinese as well.

That, and of course after WWII, they wanted to strongly divert from anything that seemed like a racist policy.

Also worth noting - I don't think anything would have flavor without water.  If your tongue was completely dry, would you taste anything if you were to sprinkle salt, sugar, cinnamon, etc. on it?  I haven't tried it...but I'd assume not, since little to no dry chemicals would react with the nerve receptors in your taste buds.  More generally, I'd say that (most) all interesting chemistry takes place in aqueous environments, i.e. when reacting chemicals are dissolved in water.

Like others have said, you can get different flavors in tap / bottled waters because of what's dissolved in them, but there isn't much flavor to pure deionized H20.

So you probably will find soda to taste better than water, since it tastes really sweet. Your brain hasn't really caught on to the idea that sugar is everywhere, since that's a very recent change. Therefore, soda is a jackpot. Drink it - all of it. You might not find another source of energy like this for a long time.

Water is nice and all, but you probably aren't that thirsty. If you're not thirsty and there's plenty of water available, you won't see any reason to drink more.

However, even today, many people who give up sugary treats report that even water starts tasting sweet. So maybe water really did taste sweet to our ancestors. That said, I think the sweetness of good water is still pretty subtle.

Maybe the premise of your question is off. Is it true that we acquire a taste for the things we need? I mean, look at this list:

* Water - no taste
* Air - no taste
* Protein - no taste (Most of the flavor in meats comes from fats, blood content, etc. Pure protein powder tastes like nothing.)
* Carbs - often no taste (like refined flour)

Ultra-valuable food items like sugar and fat have tastes, but they're kind of one-note. Although we still crave them, nobody would say that olive oil is a more intense taste than say, oranges.

This suggests that taste and odor are guides to getting the rarer elements and vitamins we need, as well as avoiding the stuff that is bad for us. And because humans are weird, we've decided that some plants' chemical weapons against us are ""spice"".

Same could be said of production companies for things like HD DVD vs BlueRay or VHS vs BetaMax.  Some company who ""prints"" movies ends up investing in one or the other and when a winner is declared the companies on the losing side lose on their investments and can't afford to re-tool, and thus go out of business.  With stuff becoming more and more digital this isn't really a problem anymore though.  I'm not sure how much different it is to burn an HD DVD rather than a BluRay and the other way around.

You also see it with rental companies like movie stores.  With the ability to get just about anything online via Hulu, Netflix or On Demand there is no real use for the Blockbusters of the world.  Same could be said of libraries for print media.  If you can download the ebook on your iPad or Kindle then why would you bother going to the library for borrowing a book?

From a customer point of view it's a similar story.  How would you like it if you invested several hundred dollars in a nice turntable and VCR only for them to be replaced by CD's and DVD's?  Now you can't buy vinyls and VHS tapes anymore so you re-invest in a CD/DVD player.  Ok cool, now DVD's are getting phased out for BluRay and Digital Streaming.  So *now* you need to *re-re-invest* in a BluRay player along with a computer with a good internet connection or media-box to stream online stuff.  Now that you've got all this shiny new equipment nothing uses component, composite or coaxial but instead HDMI.  Now you need to replace your perfectly functioning TV with a newer one that can support the new peripherals and to actually gain use of the HD picture.

So from a consumer perspective it's a constant tech arms race to be up to date with whatever the new supported format is and being able to actually use it.  You need to keep buying and replacing otherwise perfectly functioning hardware because now it's obsolete and you can't use it with new stuff.

From a consumer point of view this should be leveling out pretty quick.

sir_sri,"&gt;I heard that the fabricators that Intel uses to create their processors are top secret, but is that keeping foreign companies left behind to play catch up?

Intel is basically one fabrication process ahead of everyone else in the industry, including AMD which is sort of a US company (they are based in the US, publicly traded but a major interest is owned by Abu Dhabi).  

In the history of computing equipment IBM, which has been around since before computers, was the big dog.  They bought any 'business machines' that seemed to be useful to them, including european ones.  As time went on and you had branching of the industry most of it went to US companies closely connected to IBM (not necessarily allies but competitors too).  Where IBM owned the business market Microsoft (which got its start working for IBM), and Intel made stuff for IBM computers.  Then someone came up with the idea of an IBM clone (I'm being vague that's a whole history tale unto itself) but Intel and MS took off, AMD formed to compete with Intel and Nvidia hit it big when 3DFx imploded. 

Prior to the 1960's there were some big microelectronics companies in Japan (that still exist in one way or another), as well as smaller ones in the US.  Siemens, the german megacorporation has always been involved in some ways but they seemed to leave the integrated circuit business mostly to other people.  

So that's kind of it.  IBM bought local because they could rapidly develop with other local oufits.  Taiwan particularly has picked  up a LOT of high quality manufacturing of semiconductors, but the big guys for a Long time were Intel and AMD's manufacturing (what is now Globalfoundries) which are mostly US and Europe.  The east asian stuff all came later.

Ideally, your first credit card is one that you will use every month, and will pay off entirely every month, to build credit. You don't want to incur the interest fees, so you need to pay the bill in full (this also keeps you from spending beyond your means). Also, if there is an annual fee on the card, you don't want it.

You may want to talk to your bank about a secured credit card to get you started. In this scenario, you give the bank a deposit (the security) for the card and after while  they'll give it back.

Also, a lot of them offer extended returns/accidental damage policies, so look into that (and this means, use the card to buy your electronics and breakables).

Like others have said, treat it as a debit card and don't spend more than you can pay. You have to choose the right card for your spending habits in order to get the most out of it. ",null,1,cdm639g,1rdcew,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3
brazendynamic,"Use it for whatever you want, but pay it off. I use mine fairly regularly, but also try to keep the balance low or at $0 because of interest rates. 

When you're looking for a credit card to get, look for something with no interest for the first year. That way you're not paying interest in your first year and can get used to having the card and understanding how credit works. It's NOT free money. Don't let yourself look at it like that. You have to pay for it all eventually, and it will destroy your credit if you don't. Don't just pay the minimum every month, either. Especially once the interest kicks in. Then you're just paying the interest, will never get the balance down, and you're ultimately digging yourself into a hole. Occasionally, sure. Some months suck and you can only afford the minimum. But always do your best to go higher if you leave a balance. Trust me. I ruined my amazing credit because I was poor and relied on credit cards, but then I couldn't always afford to pay them.

Don't pay an annual fee for a card. There are PLENTY of free ones out there. I've had both Chase Freedom and Chase Slate cards which are free and were interest free for the first year. I got rid of my Slate card when I paid it off, but still have the Freedom card. It accumulates points that I can redeem for tons of stuff, depending on the point balance. Personally, I like that.

It really depends on what you want. The Freedom card is great for just a credit card. You get the card plus the point system. Some cards offer different rewards, whether it's for flights or trips or what have you. I recommend going with a really basic one for your very first card, but it's up to you and what you like/need. You can often find comparison sites that'll tell you interest rates, any rewards, annual fees, etc. bankrate.com has a comparison tool, so does nerdwallet.com, and countless others. Or pick a company (Chase, Capital One, etc) and you can often look at what all of their cards offer.

The big thing is paying it on time and keeping the balance low. I learned that the hard way, and you probably will too. Once you have to pay interest, that balance will go up fast. Miss a payment? The missed payment fee can be ugly.",null,0,cdm6ess,1rdcew,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

TardisDyskinesia,"I guess there are two things you want to think about. The type of card and your limit. 

**Type of Card**
The standard is a Cash Rewards card. You should probably go with one that has no Annual fee. I graduated in May and got a Cash Rewards card from my bank with 1% back on all purchases. I've never heard of less than that %-age, but you can do better. I got a Costco membership and the American Express that they have gives me 3% on Gas, 2% on Restaurants, and 1% on everything else.

**Limit**
I started out with a limit of $500, but once I started getting paychecks, this was way too low. You don't want to max out your credit card, so try to get a limit that is higher than what you earn in a month, maybe twice what you earn. It's actually better for your score to use a lower percentage of your available credit, so you should probably go as high as you can. If your bank won't let you go higher, you can try to get another card.

Once you have a card, you can start putting whatever you need to on it. Keep track of your balances, make sure you don't overspend, and pay the bills every month. It's simple.

**Other tips**
I manage all of my accounts with Mint.com. It's a lot easier to log in one place and see how I'm doing financially. It also tells me when my bills are due, so it's much easier to keep track. Never miss a payment.

TimeTravellerSmith,"Golden rule with credit cards is **PAY THEM OFF COMPLETELY AND ON TIME EVERY MONTH**.  Especially if it's your first card (I'm assuming your a recent HS/College grad).

You can also (but was not recommended by my bank manager who I sat down with when I applied for my first card) set it up such that the CC bill is auto deducted from your checking account, essentially making it operate exactly like a debit card.  He didn't recommend it because it's a control issue, it might withdraw at a bad time of the month or withdraw an incorrect amount, or if you *are* planning on not paying the card off because of an emergency expenditure then you'll overdraw your checking account.

Usage wise use it like you would a debit card but be mindful (like when people here say use it for utilities) that you don't max it out by mistake.  For example by the time you pay for groceries, household supplies, etc you might be pushing the $400 mark in a month and when you suddenly throw in another $200-300 in utilities you'll be pushing the max.  Just be careful and work out a budget, then keep track of how much you spend.  Make a simple spreadsheet in Excel or something and when you buy something, keep the receipts somewhere and once a week tally everything up into the spreadsheet to make sure you're within budget.

Also, if you can try to find something with rewards like cash back so you can get 2-5% back on things like gas or groceries or general spending.

If you are in attack mode, say a lunge, then you have ""right of way"" if there are simultaneous touches. If your opponent does a parry/repost, then he has taken the attack away from you and (s)he has the right away.

In foil, the first to extend toward the opponent has right of way until the opponent takes right of way by parrying and *immediately* making an offensive move (a parry-riposte, which tends to be hard-wired into foilists from the get-go). If there's a double-touch or any continuation of attacks resulting in simultaneous or near-simultaneous touches, then the tie is broken by which fencer has right of way.

Homeopathic remedies are solutions that have been diluted to such an extreme that they contain not a single molecule of the supposed active ingredient. Now the original homeopaths knew very little about atoms and molecules (and hence that their dilution practices are somewhat extreme), but 'modern' homeopaths have attempted to solve this by proposing 'water memory', which always reminds me of a line from [Tim Minchin's *Storm*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U): ""*[sarcastically]* Water has memory! And while it's memory of a long-lost drop of onion juice is infinite, it seems to forget all the poo it's had in it.""

AmerigoVesa,"Homeopathy was invented when what we consider to be real medicine was just getting started. Back then, most things that a ""doctor"" did for you would kill you. Homeopathy became popular because it did not hurt you, and you might get better anyway if you let things run their course. It is based on the idea that something which mimicked the symptoms of a disease could cure it. For example, if eating a certain kind of toad caused a person to break out in hives and develop a fever, that would be the thing which cured a disease that had the symptoms of fever and hives. But the new thing here was that it wasn't the thing itself that did the cure, it was the energy of the thing. That is why you had to put the thing in water, shake it a special way, then keep diluting it: the water ""remembered"" the thing, and that is what cured you. What you had left by the time all the diluting and shaking was over was basically pure water. This would ""cure"" you only in the sense that it would keep you away from a doctor long enough for a disease to run its course so maybe you could survive.

Do not confuse herbal medicine and homeopathy. While there are a lot of problems with so called herbal remedies, they are at the very least based on the idea that some active ingredient in a plant or whatever could counter act a disease. A good example of this is willow bark, which led to aspirin. Homeopathy, by its very nature can not work that way, because it has been diluted past the point where any of the original ingredient is left. ",null,1,cdm2etc,1rd99h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

Quetzalcoatls,"The US emerged from the Second World War as one of two global superpowers. The war devastated much of Western Europe and the US  tasked itself with rebuilding the continent. The Soviet Union, former ally of the US, sought to spread Communism throughout the world and soon become the chief economic, political, and military rival of the United States. This is a period known as the Cold War. In order to stop the advancement of communism the United States adopted a policy of containment and worked both diplomatically and militarily to prevent its spread. 

Since the fall of the USSR the US has shifted its focus to removing regimes that destabilize world markets, terrorism, or preventing genocide/mass killings. Additionally the US, like most developed nations, now field a professional military (no conscripts). This means that wars and police actions more often than not do not directly effect the population which limits how much people really care.

sir_sri,"In WW1 the US was a natural strategic competitor to Britain and much of the population was german or Irish so they didn't even like Britain.  

So in WW1 the US stayed out as long as it could because it was playing both sides.  The Royal Navy dominated the oceans of the word, so trade meant going to the UK or France (or allies) - in return for money, that way, while they were bleeding themselves fighting germany, and the US could still buy technology and that sort of thing from Germany without needing much direct physical trade.  

Then Germany made clear just how far they were willing to go to win - that included being willing to Ally with Mexico against the US and roll the US back to the pre 1848 borders.  They were also willing to shoot anything that might be shipping arms to the UK.  That wasn't acceptable so the US got involved, because if it didn't americans were going to get killed selling stuff, and if the Germans won there could conceivably be a massive extremely powerful and dangerous german army liberating a huge portion of the western/south western US.  

In WW2 the situation was similar but different.  The US had massive financial interests in germany (including significant loans to the german government and banks), and largely (correctly) felt that France had to some degree brought this upon themselves.  The problem was that germany was sinking US ships (even when  the US was neutral), and Japan was threatening US interests in the Pacific - although the Japan/China thing could easily have gone the other way and China allied with Germany and Japan on the allied side.  Most of the western countries didn't really like the soviets and so given the choice letting the germans and soviets beat the hell out of each other seemed  like it wasn't such a bad plan.  Particularly for the US who could scavenge the remnants of the british and French empires at the end of it.  

In both cases the US was involved whether it wanted to be or not.

Then came the end of the war and the breakup of british and French Empires.  The soviets were happy to communist up any state willing to join them, which left a problem for the US.  The US needs customers and resources, and the soviets where going to eat up future customers  and supplies of resources.  If it hadn't been involved in the world it would have essentially handed most of the worlds supply of oil and rubber, and potential customers for cars and aircraft to the soviets.  That would have been problematic. 

And so it is today.  The US is big and rich,and depends on large swathes of the world to buy its cars an computers and airplanes, and other swathes of the world to make it cheap socks and sell it oil and whatever else it needs/wants.  

The relative balance of power in the world has changed too.  In 1950 the US was the third or 4th largest country (depending on how you count the Soviet union) but it only had about 3x the population of the UK or France.  Today that's more like 6.  So the relative state of the world means that the US is  proportionally much larger than it was compared to other developed powers - some of the poor countries have grown a great deal faster than the US (pakistan, bangladesh, brazil, lots  of africa), but  they are not yet capable of securing trade lanes or defending other countries.   And therein lies the problem, the US very much depends on stability in the world, so does most everyone else, but now the US is so big it pretty much has to be involved because the list of options  to do it without the US is quite limited.  Europe aims to challenge the US as a global power, while at the same time being an ally - that would let the US take on a lesser more cooperative role, but unfortunately the EU can't organize  itself out of a paper bag .  


&gt;more often than not when their presence was neither needed nor ultimately helpful.

While that was true in Iraq, round 2, that was an exception rather than a rule.  The US has been needed in a lot of conflicts, Korea, somalia, vietnam, Iraq round 1/Kuwait, Columbia, the Balkans etc.  Even if you (correctly) think the way the US handled some of those things was utter incompetence and made things worse it had legitimate interest in trying to be there.  Trying to do the right thing is a lot easier than actually doing the right thing.  

There are also lots of places the US has been needed where it hasn't gone, most notably Syria, where it appears Assad and his Iranian and Russian backers are going to win.  That lack of intervention may be based on the (probably correct) assessment that the US would just fuck it up, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have served US interests to have had the FSA take over 2 years ago.

However, back then, we didn't have this large force ready and waiting.  U.S. leaders realized that a draft would be a disaster unless the war had popular support. The common working man doesn't want to be thrust into the trenches unless there's a really good reason.

When WWI broke out, public opinion was against getting involved in the war. European nations had been trying to destroy each other for hundreds of years, why should we spend our resources and sacrifice our young men just because they can't get along? (Not saying I agree with this argument!)

Less than 30 years later WWII breaks out. Now, WWI was really, really ugly.  At the time it was called the Great War and it shocked the conscience of the world. It's no surprise some Americans didn't want to get involved. There is even a retarded school of thought that says we shouldn't get involved because Hitler is not really that bad! If you don't believe me look up Charles Lindbergh and ""America First.""

So WWII happens, and America emerges as the premier superpower.  Europe and Japan had been brought to their knees and America was almost totally untouched.

AnteChronos,"&gt;What is Settlers of Catan (besides being a board game)

There is no ""besides being a board game"".  All it is is a board game.


&gt;and why is it so good?

It follows a specific design philosophy associated with [German-style board games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game).  In a broad sense, this includes things like a total lack of player elimination (so no one has to sit around bored for an hour while everyone else keeps playing), both public and hidden scoring criteria (so no one is the obvious loser until the very end when you tally the score), randomized board configurations (allowing for greater replay value), a greater emphasis on strategy over luck, and less emphasis on direct player conflict.",null,7,cdm0sa8,1rd5ld,explainlikeimfive,top_week,36
Taken4GrantD,"Gives a unique gameplay, with the exception of the robber, a piece that lets you steal a resource and block a tile, all competition is passive, you can't hurt your opponents, you can only really get in their way.  Much of the game is weighing you options, is this a good position or is it just in theory?  Would I be better off with more resources or more trading options? In this way its easy to pick up, but high level decisions are extremely subjective.

People_Are_People,"As a huge Catan fan I just want to add a few points to why I think it separates itself from other games.

1) I think game perfectly balances luck and skill in a way that keeps everyone involved. Your strategy can only put you so far ahead because you do not know what resources you will end up getting. Unlike hardcore strategy games a beginner who understands the rules will not be put so far behind a seasoned player that they cannot win.

2) You are involved in every single turn. Games like monopoly and risk can be hated because when you are not moving you are basically sitting around. In Catan you have the possibility of benefits and there is ""action"" on every move. This keeps everyone involved in the game which prevents the ""whose turn is it I don't even know"" problem.

3)It always is progressing towards the end. Everyone knows the monopoly game where money is just being pushed around in no end in sight. In Catan unless there is a super high fluke in low percentage numbers or robbers, the resources are always progressing towards the end goal so there is never any dreaded board game purgatory. 

4) Because of the changing layout and randomness of the board every game can be different so every game could have different successful strategy. 

Seriously I could prob go on and on with other reasons these were the first few I thought of. If you have never played give it a shot if you can. I fell in love after the first time. If you are playing with friends, ask them to honestly give you some advice on where you should put your first cities and strategies so you have a decent chance.

blandrice123,"You begin with two settlements on an island gameboard, lush with rich forests, wheat fields, deep mines, quarries, and tracts of grazing land.  By roll of the dice, luck and strategy dictate what resources you receive each turn and, therefore, the infrastructure of your empire. Perhaps you will gather the brick and wood necessary to build long, impressive roads between settlements, or the eclectic variety of resources needed to raise a large and fearsome army.  Maybe you will expand your empire, creating new settlements- all of these bring you closer to victory. 
But beware the others who inhabit the island gameboard with their own budding empire states.  They seek the same goal as you: to settle the wild island of Catan and dominate its resources.  Despite this competition, you must often seek to forge alliances and open trades- a stack of wood for a bundle of wool or some brick for the wheat to feed your people.  Alliances beget rivalry, and treachery is always underfoot.  In a single turn a once-close ally can trade to you the ore you need to upgrade your settlement, only to turn around and build a road through what you thought was your territory, effectively destroying your well planned strategy.

About gathering resources, trading and expanding on the same island with limited space but with no moving entities besides one single ""barbarian/pirate/robber"" that can be teleported by everyone. The lack of movement on the game map, besides expanding roads villages and cities, saves a lot of time playing a civilization-like game that is spend on free trading.

Hexagonal tiles give one of 5 different resource types when their number is rolled in a turn. numbers are rolled with two w6, making 7 most common and some tiles worse. But 7 is a bad stealing/blockading event against the greediest players, limiting fast expansion. resources are gained by players cities on tile corners. cities of a player must be connected by roads on tile borders. a city/village usually has 2 or 3 ressource gaining tiles next to it. resources buy expansions or options/upgrades/structures but they are very resource specific, forcing to trade or wait. this gives each resource type various specific optional uses. the maps border usually has evenly spread npc-trading-posts that give one of any for 2 speficit resources, or 1 of any for 3 of any (of the same) resources. but borders have no resource-gaining tile. each turn allows to trade with the active player.  the game is a race for the best spots.

The luck of the dice is countered by trade embargoes.

What made the game explode is its combustibility and modifyability, adding other victory conditions like building world wonders or having a few moving entities per player.

Enchanted_Bunny,"It is a board game in which each player builds up an ""empire"" of sorts made of roads, settlements, and cities until one player reaches 10 victory points and ends the game. 

Why is it so good? Let's compare it with a more standard American game: monopoly. Think about what happens when you play monopoly. It starts off okay. Then one person gets eliminated. Then another person gets eliminated. Now only two of the four players have any stake in the game'a outcome. The two eliminated players have the choice of staying at the table and spectating or going off and doing their own thing. The two person slug fest can last for hours and a lot of the time the game is just given up on. It's no surprise really as the game in its original iteration (the landlords game) was designed specifically *not* to be fun. It was meant to be a teaching tool of the folly of capitalism. 

Contrast this with settlers of catan. The German style board game design philosophy that catan follows is designed to keep all players engaged in play until the game ends. Catan specifically has several different methods and strategies that can lead to victory. So if for example you just aren't getting the materials you need to build that road or city you need to score points, you can buy developments cards, or if you roll a 7 you can steal cards from someone else.

yellowsquare,"In the US at least, the reason why monetary compensation is not offered for whole blood donation is because money is too good of a reason to donate. Many studies were conducted, and long story short, intravenous drug users were donating blood to get drug money. The American Red Cross and other blood centers around the country do not want intravenous drug users to donate their blood because of the very high risk of those people having undiagnosed hepatitis or HIV.

Plasma centers (like Biolife and CSL) are allowed to offer monetary compensation because they use that plasma primarily for research purposes, and isn't put into patients' bodies (usually). Some parts of the plasma can be used for medical purposes, but that's after being highly processed and screened.

Now the next question you might ask is why don't blood centers just screen all the blood that's donated so they can still pay money? The answer is they do, but the national blood centers have decided to take this extra step to ward off potential high risk donors in order to build redundancy and (therefore security) in the field of blood banking. 

Taking someone's blood and putting it into someone else's body is a dangerous process, and the entire system from donor to recipient is layered with redundancy in an attempt to make the process as safe as possible for recipients.

The notion that plasma is used ""mostly"" or ""usually"" for research is misguided.  Next time you're in a CSL center count the beds, count the chairs in the waiting room, do some multiplication.  That one company collects millions of liters of plasma every year.  Nobody is doing that much research.  The primary driver for increasing collections is the manufacture of Intravenous Immunoglobulin.  It's a great therapy for the people who need it, and it costs a fortune currently.  Plasma also makes therapies for burn victims, hemophiliacs/other blood disorders, fibrinogen ""glue"" used in surgery, lots of stuff.  Many types of vaccines are manufactured from plasma also.  These are all for-profit pharmaceutical products.  (Good products that are important therapies for the people who receive them, not boner-pills, but not 'research' either.)

There are some specialty facilities around that do perform mostly targeted collections for research purposes or reagent manufacture, so you weren't necessarily lied to if someone told you a particular donation was for research.


On the actual question, there are many additional rules applied to plasma donors that are not applied to volunteer whole blood donors that are part of the quality control system approved/inspected by the FDA and add safety to the compensated donation process.  If a whole blood donation center wanted to jump through all these additional hoops, they could most likely be licensed to perform compensated collections as well.

1) You must have a permanent home address within a defined area (generally 50-60 miles) of the facility.  Your address must not be on a list of known long-stay motels, flop houses, half-way houses, missions, etc.

2) There is a nation wide list of every person who has ever had a positive HIV/Hepatitis test in any plasma clinic that is checked.

3) You must donate twice, so there are two sets of viral test results.  If you only ever donate once, that bottle goes right to the incinerator.  This is why you get paid more for your second visit!

4) Plasma donors must have annual physicals by an actual doctor or approved substitute.

5) Plasma collection facilities must report their positive test result rates to the national association.  They face audits and corrective action if they exceed normal levels for the population.  This incentivizes them to do a good job screening and not let in questionable donors to make more money.

6) Plasma clinics are required to share information with all the other plasma clinics in their area about who is donating when, to stop them from donating more often than allowed.  This is more to protect the donor, but it does identify and eliminate people who are desperate to score cash quickly.

2.The electrons in atoms populate atomic orbitals, and the way they fill these orbitals depends on the aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principle.

3.When the electrons populate the orbitals in such a way that there are unpaired electrons left over. As in some of the electrons don't have their spin of +1/2 or -1/2 negated, then the material is paramagnetic.

bigfish42,"There's been a ton of research on this, and there are at least five big drivers: Waste, Price Insensitivity, Technology, Market Pressures, and Regulation. 

Something like 30% of our health spending is pure waste. Well, worse than pure waste because of the risk of negative outcomes (hospital acquired infections, death, etc.). This can be from all kinds of things, from outright fraud to doctors and systems simply covering their butts, to doctors agreeing to treatments that patients asked for so they don't lose their future business. 

If you understand supply/demand models, I hope that you know a bit about price sensitivity. There is an assumption of a downward sloping demand for healthcare services with respect to price paid (higher cost -&gt; less demand for it). The trouble is that the payor is not the same as the recipient of the service, and neither is the one who makes the recommendation. Here, the one that recommends the treatment is often the one who gets paid for doing things (the doc), the one who pays often just gets a bill for what has been done (the insurer), and the one who receives the service (the patient) just pays their copay - a cost that has little to do with the total price of the service. 

A huge driver of costs is the ""arms race"" of the latest technology. This has all kinds of drivers that are worth diving into - like our current patent and approvals process - but I'll leave that for the inevitable flood of comments. The consequence is that doctors and health system spend a massive amount of money on new technology that patients demand that has little (if any) positive effect on outcomes.

In terms of market structure, there is massive fragmentation among providers. And they are the ones who have to buy supplies. Since there isn't one big purchaser of supplies (including meds, devices, durable medical supplies, etc.) and there are just a few major players for specialized (and patented) supplies, the providers have little bargaining power to keep costs of supplies down. The higher costs from less market power get passed on to customers. Additionally, consumers - patients - don't have any real power, except through their insurers, to keep costs down. (But if there exists a patients' union, let me know!)

Finally, regulation. It costs a lot of money to comply with all of the regulations. This goes from staffing (doctor training is massively expensive and heavily regulated), to job designation (there is generally a very well-defined scope where an individual can practice), to required emergency care (see EMTALA) driving up the cost of bad debts, and even to requirements related to safety. These all cost a lot of money, and those costs all get factored in when the providers set their prices. With the general price insensitivity, and lack of customer power, these costs generally go straight through to increase the cost of care.

It's messy, but those are the top 5 IMO.

Ahrius,"A few reasons: ER/COBRA, Malpractice and Medicare.

Basically, every so often, the government decides that the reimbursement rate (what the Dr. takes home) goes down by 20%. Once this happens, ALL the other insurances follow the same practice.

In the USA, medicine is the ONLY profession that gets a GOVERNMENT MANDATED PAY CUT. As a result, doctors may try to compensate by ordering a more expensive test or doing an extra procedure, because:
a) he's trying to be thorough for the sake of friends/family
b) he's trying to be thorough so if something happens, he can't be blamed
c) he's trying to put food on his table because the gov keeps cutting his pay

Malpractice is another huge issue - a physician's work can and will result in death sometimes. The family wants to blame someone because that's more comforting than accepting that there was nothing else that could be done. Doctor's get sued left and right and if there happens to be a guilty verdict involved, that doctor's career is over. Sure, we pay insurance to cover this and technically it's alright, but no hospital will ever hire that doctor again. Since death is involved, the verdict's tend to be high in number, so malpractice charges a lot. As a result, things cost more because doctor's have bigger bills to pay.

Finally COBRA law - if you walk into an ER, you cannot be denied because of poverty. So you get treated. Something as small as a cold or requiring a multi-million dollar procedure, you get treated. But who eats the cost?

The hospital.

The cost of running/maintaining machines, ordering tests, buying materials, etc. all goes to the hospital and they have to front the bill. That's why there's an issue with illegal immigrants. Many illegal immigrants who do hazardous labor jobs get into accidents and go to the ER. Illegal immigrants also have no insurance (because they're illegal), so they visit the ER for everything. 

Essentially, hospitals pay for illegals to have free health care. The hospital then passes that cost on to the insurance companies by raising the prices of their procedures. The insurance then raises your premium to pay for the new prices. 

TL;DR - Malpractice, COBRA, and MEDICARE make it hard to be a doctor.

dvfw,"1. **Licensing** - Medical schools, pharmacies and hospitals are heavily licensed. This drastically reduces supply of doctors and hospitals, while demand increases, leading to higher prices. It also reduces competition leading to the same result.
2. **Regulations** - Burdening businesses with regulations forces them to increase the costs of their goods, and often kills smaller competitors, contributing further to monopolies. An example is the FDA. After the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the FDA Act were singed in 1962, and by 1976, the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated $24 million, 10 to 20 times as much as in the early 1960's, while development times had climbed from a couple of years to the better part of a decade. These amendments also caused longer production times, causing many deaths by making consumers have to wait for new drugs. Prior to the Kefauver-Harris Bill of 1962, the average time from the filing of an IND to approval was seven months. By 1967, however, the average time to approval had increased to thirty months. Time to approval continued to rise through the late 1970s, when on average a successful drug took more than ten years to get approved. In the late 1980s and 1990s, times to approval decreased somewhat, but are still eight years on average, far higher than in the 1960s.
3. **Subsidies** - The US has heavily subsidized the sick - with, for example, Medicare and Medicaid - by providing them special benefits when they are sick. Subsidies create more of whatever is being subsidized. This encourages carelessness and dependency on government, as opposed to responsibility and self-ownership. Also, corn syrup, a leading cause of obesity, is subsidized heavily. The worse health problems that result, cause more demand for health care, and higher costs.
4. **Employer-provided insurance** - When insurance is paid for by someone else - in this case, the employers - customers are not likely to shop around for the best deals, and they will overuse health services. This increase in demand leads to higher costs.
5. **Patents** - Patents basically grant a monopoly on the production of a certain patented drug. Monopolies, as everyone knows, lead to higher prices.",null,0,cdmfbtn,1rd0ud,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

nwob,"There are a few components to this question.  Substances used in nuclear fuel are *radioactive*, which means that they are unstable and their atoms gradually break down over time into lighter elements and other particles.

When they do this, some of their mass is changed straight into energy.  The famous equation E=mc^2 describes this relationship.  For every gram difference between the starting materials and the end materials in a nuclear reaction, 8.98755179 × 10^13 joules are produced.  That's apparently about a seventh of the energy the average hurricane releases in a second, which, if you consider the size of a hurricane, is quite a lot. It's also the energy equivalent of eating 92 million mars bars.

They do by releasing three different types of radiation - alpha, beta and gamma.  Alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons, and are the same as the nucleus of a helium atom (don't worry about that specifically, but I'm including it for completeness), beta particles are electrons, and gamma radiation is high frequency electromagnetic rays, similar to visible light but much higher in energy.

Alpha, beta and gamma radiation are called *ionising*, and it's this property that makes them dangerous.  These tiny ionising particles can penetrate into our bodies and disrupt our cells (most notably our DNA), damaging them and potentially triggering cell death or cancer.  Alpha particles are the most damaging but can't get through your skin.  Beta particles sit somewhere in the middle, and gamma particles are lowest energy but most penetrating.  We're all constantly exposed to a small amount of background radiation, but in concentrated doses it can lead to massive cell death, and prolonged exposure generally leads to cancer.",null,0,cdlyvp0,1rcyn9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
Hiddencamper,"Nuclear engineer here

In nuclear fission, we split uranium atoms. When the atoms split, they break apart and release energy (which we use for boiling water to steam. We then use the steam to make electricity).

Fission occurs when a neutron hits a uranium atom. When we split the atom, we get more neutrons out to continue the reaction. (This is why it is called a chain reaction).

The split uranium atom becomes 2 random smaller atoms. These smaller atoms are usually radioactive. Some of them are so radioactive that as they give off radiation, they heat up everything around them, similar to a microwave.

The split atoms are so radioactive that they are dangerous for humans. They need to be constantly shielded. Also, they are so radioactive that they give off heat, meaning that we need to keep cooling the reactor even after we shut it down, otherwise this heat due to the radioactive waste breaking down will melt the core.",null,0,cdm055c,1rcyn9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

&gt;The now-famous Democratic donkey was first associated with Democrat Andrew Jackson's 1828 presidential campaign. His opponents called him a jackass (a donkey), and Jackson decided to use the image of the strong-willed animal on his campaign posters. Later, cartoonist Thomas Nast used the Democratic donkey in newspaper cartoons and made the symbol famous.

&gt;Nast invented another famous symbol—the Republican elephant. In a cartoon that appeared in Harper's Weekly in 1874, Nast drew a donkey clothed in lion's skin, scaring away all the animals at the zoo. One of those animals, the elephant, was labeled “The Republican Vote.” That's all it took for the elephant to become associated with the Republican Party.

The US tends to go through fairly long cycles of major political alignments. It's political structure heavily favors two national parties which are each a coalition of various interests. To hold such diverse interests together, an important tactic is focusing less on what unites the party and more on why the opposing party would ruin everything, making party defection a scary prospect for coalition members.

The US trajectory has been tending toward policies of social permissiveness combined with economic non-intervention since the end of World War II. The most recent major political realignment occurred beginning in the mid-1960s and finalizing, roughly, with the election of Ronald Regan in 1980. Since then, both parties have been pushing their agenda where it agrees with the national trend and reluctantly retreating in areas which are in opposition to it.

An ""econimically liberal, socially conservative"" party would be economically interventionist (against the trend) and socially impermissive (also against the trend). Non-hispanic Catholics in the US are not a terribly reliable voting block, with a great many being much more socially permissive or economically non-interventionist than official church doctrine.

bloonail,"Metal, as with the other objects in your surroundings will tend to achieve the temperature of the ambient air. There are some subtle differences. Things that have a light cover that are exposed to infra red light, even in small amounts - will tend to be bit warmer. Just at the surface. This is because the fabric both obsorbs infra-red and insulates it from the deeper material. Its difficult to measure but a thermal camera would show that.

Its maybe more interesting to point out what happens when you touch an insulator, fabric, wood or tile that's a few degrees colder, Lets says 20 Celcius versus 33 for your feet. In that case the surface reflects back heat, your skin mostly doesn't touch the object and only a few points in the surface of the tile, kinda speckled, will immediately become the temperature of your skiN. You'd heat the a tile a floor just a bit walking on it - a high speed thermal camera following your walk should show the whorls of your footprints on the surface for a few seconds afterwards. If you rested in one spot you'd quickly feel warmer under your feet.

With metal the same walk would bit by bit cool your foot in a very small layer. This would feel cold because the surface of your skin would be matching the 20 Celcius floor as you walked. You are heating a greater volume of the metal floor because its a conductor. A thermal camera will show your feet barely heating the surface of the floor. Your steps would disappear quickly behind your feet as you walked. The floor may reflect in the infra-red back at your foot but that's more than compensat4d for by the heat you've lost through conduction. you can lose or gain heat only through radiation, conduction and mass transfer. Only the first two matter in this case.

Sitting on a good insulating chair for a while, or on something that's been exposed to infra red light, even just a bit, like by a lamp, will feel warm, even if the chair is mostly 20 C because your body will quickly heat the surface up to your body temperature, and then warm it further because the chair cannot dissipate the heat your body is generating.

MockRocDoc,"As someone else here said, the simple answer is that the roughness prevents enough surface contact to make a strong mechanical bond, but there is also a deeper reason.  Before getting to wood I will say that this does happen with some solid materials under the right conditions.  Copper can 'friction weld' to itself.  Well polished metals can do this much more easily because of the type of bonds they form.  

Wood is a composite of strong bonds and weaker bonds.  If you could sweep away the weak bonds you might be able to create strong bonds in their place.  Think of firing ceramics.  The water holds the clay together, but if you heat it you drive the water out and eventually form strong bonds between the clay particles.  There is more to it than that but it is a reasonable example.

I can be a little more specific about the bonds and why this is so difficult with wood.  The strongest bonds in the wood are likely chains of carbon which have hydrogen on the sides of the chain.  Hydrogen weakly bonds to water which also weakly bonds to itself.  It would take a lot of energy to strip the water and hydrogen out which is mostly why this won't happen.

marmelukes,"First off they're solids. Solids exist in a mostly or completely rigid state and they don't have a lot of free energy, so they're not good at forming new bonds quickly.

Second, they're biological. Biological bonds are not energetically favorable. Your body expends serious amounts of energy to grow or even just maintain their form. When you no longer have the energy to fight this entropy you're dead, and you begin to decompose. Decomposition is your chemical bonds breaking apart, bit by bit.

Therefore, two pieces of dead wood can not fuse without some sort of goofy process taking place. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's not normal.

Liquids can only fuse because they are less rigid and have more free energy to form new bonds. In water for instance the H2O is constantly making and breaking bonds. Forming H30 and H0 and switching back.

Two pieces of wood wouldn't bond together because the molecules of the two pieces of wood aren't bonded together.

When you put two pieces of wood on top of each other, they don't have this energy and there's no good way to bring it together with that. Glue, epoxy, etc. allow adhesive energy almost anywhere you want it, because rather than a complex process like a tree growing, glue etc. can form adhesive bonds by little more than sitting there.

This universe is made of tiny things called atoms.
Atoms are made of even tinier stuff.
Some atoms are positively charged, some are negatively charged, and some are neutral. 
When you rub two objects together, you're actually rubbing off some of the negatively charged stuff from one object to the other. 
This is is called ""static electricity"" because the electrons [negative] aren't really moving, they're just being sort of brushed off.
Negatively charged atoms always wants to stick to positively charged atoms.
Neutral atoms always want to be left alone.
Because all things are made of atoms, and some atoms are positive and some atoms are negative, you end up with clumps of atoms called molecules. 
Molecules exist in three main states.
&gt;Solid
&gt;Liquid
&gt;Gas

Gasses have a lot of energy stored inside them, [valence] so much energy that molecules are flying and bouncing around everywhere. It's easy to mix gasses because there's so much room and chaos between molecules. 

&gt;Liquids are much harder to mix together because the molecules in liquids have less energy than the molecules in gasses and there's not much space for the molecules to move around. Some liquids like oil and water will absolutely refuse to mix together because they repel eachother, and water is heavier than oil.

Solids rarely ever want to mix with other solids. In fact it's incredibly difficult for a solid to mix with anything because the molecules in a solid aren't moving at all. The molecules are at such a low level of energy that they sit around hugging eachother like me and Jess on Sundays. 

Because wood is a solid, it's hard to mix it with more wood.
However, it's easy to excite the wood fibers on the surface of a piece of wood, and get it to stick to another piece of wood with static electricity. 
&gt;OR you could even use some semi-liquid molecules in a higher state of energy called glue, to raise the fibers on the surfaces of two pieces of wood and get them stuck together and wrapped in a solid once the glue dries.

panzerkampfwagen,"The BEF (British Expeditionary Force) was holding its own but the French forces to their south fell back.  This put the BEF in danger of being surrounded and cut off so they had to fall back.  They fell back to Dunkirk where over 300k British soldiers were rescued, minus their heavy equipment, by a flotilla of navy and civilian ships. The saving of so many troops enabled the UK to remain in the fight but the loss of so much heavy equipment meant that they were a bit more lightly armed than they wanted to be for a while.  

Goering, commander of the Luftwaffe (Air Force), stated that his aircraft could destroy the British at Dunkirk, so Hitler ordered the Heer (army) to hold.  His Wehrmacht (military) commanders had been worried that the Heer was being overextended and was in danger of being cut off if the French or British launched a counter attack so Goering's boast provided a needed excuse to get the Heer to stop and regroup. The RAF (Royal Air Force) fought the Luftwaffe in the skies over Dunkirk and prevented them from destroying the BEF.  However, a lot of the fighting took place in cloud cover and so the soldiers on the ground thought they were being mercilessly attacked by the Luftwaffe and believed that the RAF did nothing to help them.

The push forced these Northern forces back and, in order to save the BEF it was ordered to fall back on the Channel ports and evacuate - of these Dunkirk was the only port open which the BEF, together with parts of the French army, fell back on. It was about this stage that non-combatants and non-essentials were evacuated.

When this happened the Belgians (until their surrender) and the BEF held the right flank and the French most of the rest of the line. This then got smaller and the French army took over more of the line to hold it.

The evacuation took place mostly from a jetty on the port which was suitable for large warships to get into. Men also went on the beaches and even up to their necks in water - this leads to the famous little ships of Dunkirk which does what it says on the tin: small ships, crewed by civilians from all over the South coast of Britain including London picked up men off the beaches and sailed them either to waiting warships or back to England often under air attack. 

Towards the end of the evacuation French troops were also evacuated in part because most of the BEF had gone and also for political reasons. 

For reasons unknown to this day Hitler halted his Panzers and left the job to Goering and the Luftwaffe. The RAF's home squadrons - which were desperately needed for the inevitable defence of Britain - fought to keep the German planes from the beaches but because of both cloud cover and the need to shoot the bombers down before the reached the beach (for obvious reasons) meant this battle went largely unseen by the troops leading to accusations of the RAF not helping. Of course some ships were sunk

On June 4th the remnants of Dunkirk surrendered, most of the troops captured were French but approximately 330,000 British and French troops made it safely to England to continue the fight.

MasterAdkins,"From http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/04/how-dick-came-to-be-short-for-richard/ 

How Dick became a nickname for Richard is known and is one of those “knee bone connected to the thigh bone” type progressions, somewhat similar to how the word ‘soccer’ came about.  Due to people having to write everything by hand, shortened versions of Richard were common, such as ‘Ric’ or ‘Rich’.  This in turn gave rise to nicknames like ‘Richie’, ‘Rick’, and ‘Ricket’, among others.  People also used to like to use rhyming names; thus, someone who was nicknamed Rich might further be nicknamed Hitch.  Thus, Richard -&gt; Ric -&gt; Rick gave rise to nicknames like Dick and Hick around the early 13th century.

While few today call Richards ‘Hick’, the nickname ‘Dick’ has stuck around, and of course has come to mean many other things as well.  Its persistence as associated with Richard is probably in part because around the 16th century Dick started to be synonymous with ‘man’, ‘lad’, or ‘fellow’, sort of a general name for any ‘Tom, Dick, or Francis” (which by the way appears in Shakespeare’s Henry IV, written in the late 16th century, with Dick at this point firmly established as an “every man” name).  It may well be that this association with ‘man’ is in turn how ‘dick’ eventually came to mean ‘penis’.",null,68,cdlz6oi,1rcjuo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,502

It gets paid through the fees and interest it charges, but a substantial portion of this has to be used to cover debt which turns out to be bad. In order to do this, it has to maintain a fund of cash (or cash-like) assets which the bank draws on when debts it has underwritten are not repaid by the debtor. If a bank writes way too many debts which fail, this fund can be exhausted and the bank becomes insolvent.

The predominant view of regulation prior to the recent financial crisis has been dubbed 'micro-prudential' in that it cared about ensuring that each bank was stable independently with the belief that a bunch of individually sound banks would result in a sound banking sector as a whole. A major factor in the severity of this financial crisis was that more mainstream banks began using methods of shifting risk around such as credit default swaps which made their individual books each look very good, but which made the banking system as a whole more vulnerable to failure.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"Detachment (more commonly called, non-attachment) is a very important quality in many Eastern spiritual and religious traditions (as well as under many Ancient Greek and Roman philosophical schools).  Many people believe that it's an absolute necessity if you want to maintain happiness, peace of mind, tranquility, and physical, mental, and emotional health.  Many people spend years studying it, meditating on it, and practicing it.  But I don't think it requires all of that for everyone.  

If you want to learn detachment/non-attachment, start with reading the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Zen works and commentaries, the Vedas and commentaries, Seneca, Cicero, and Marcus Aurelius.  Those will get you started and lead you yo further useful study.  

The word ""emotion"" derives its meaning from the Greek word that means ""disturbance,"" and many people think that emotions are hellish disturbances to remove. Entire cultures throughout the centuries have focused on this as one of their primary life objectives and most valuable life achievements.  

Please note that words are very limiting in many (all?) cases and are just symbols for real underlying things.  So, many people would define love and joy as emotions, but most who practice detachment/non-attachment would say that true love and actual joy are fundamental qualities of just existing in your true essential nature and they have no opposites and, therefore, they are not emotions.

Everything listed there can be obtained free in the public domain, and I like libravox free audio books for consuming classical literature in down times like driving or exercise.

But like any human trait, it is both a strength and a weakness. I am able to remain impartial and clear headed when everyone around me is in emotional distress, but if I am in emotional distress I am often unaware of it. I process EVERYTHING with logic.  And I am a good listener, I am unselfish and I care deeply about the well being of others...but I don't FEEL things, or at least not often.

You want to achieve emotional detachment, to some extent. I want to achieve emotional attachment, to some extent. My son is so sensitive and open to the feelings of other people. He has an enormous heart and a wild spirit that is at once his greatest strength, though some day it may cause him great pain. and I am jealous because I don't know how that feels.

Learn to harness your emotions to do good. It won't be easy, and it will hurt, but pain is part of life. Better to work with the tools you own then try to change those tools into ones that you don't. It's natural to feel jealous of other people's natural abilities when we see them use them well.

Black singers tend to have particular muscle groups that are stronger or are used more/differently, and this creates certain colours in the voice. These same muscle groups also impact on your speaking voice. Im not going to say thats genetic, i have absolutely no idea. I guess it could easily be like how a family of loud talkers use more diaphragm support and then their kids would have that too because they had more practice at it.

 These singers also more often have a 'thicker chord setting' that sounds beefy. Different harmonic partials, a darker or warmer tone etc. This is what gives that strong sound. Yes, other not-black singers can do this and sometimes will do it naturally or can learn to do it. And yes, there are of course black singers that have different voices.

However, the theorem doesn't strictly apply: only part of your head (for most people--Chewbacca is an exception) is covered with hair.

Hair whorls, also known as crowns, swirls, trichoglyphs, or cowlicks, can be either clockwise or counterclockwise in direction of growth.
Hair whorls on the head (parietal whorls) have been studied by some behaviorists. Most people have clockwise scalp hair-whorls. Parietal whorls which are considered to be normal scalp patterns could be a single whorl or double whorls. Cases of triple parietal whorls are less common but do not necessarily indicate abnormality.[citation needed]
Amar J. S. Klar conducted research to see if there was a genetic link between handedness and hair-whorl direction. He found that 8.4% of right handed people and 45% of left handed people have counterclockwise hair-whorls. His research indicates that a single gene may control both handedness and hair-whorl direction.[1]
Another result concerning handedness of the progeny of discordant monozygotic twins suggests that lefties are one gene apart from righties. Together, these results suggest (1) that a single gene controls handedness, whorl orientation, and twin concordance and discordance and (2) that neuronal and visceral (internal organs) forms of bilateral asymmetry are coded by separate sets of genetic pathways.

Basically greater volatility means greater option value, if you consider that risk in an option is one way (you've paid for the option no chance of loosing money) then it makes sense because you want the chance of great moves into the money to increase.

Socialism was this intermediate stage, and it is generally communism-lite. In it, workers use collective power in government and the workplace to control and direct the means of production and to ensure that everyone's needs were met and ensure the redistribution of wealth which would abolish the economic elite.

Where communism and socialism are based on the premise of fundamental human equality, national socialism, as the term was used by the fascists in places like 1930s Germany, was based on a premise of the superiority of certain people over others.

Basically, the telomerase prevents DNA from getting lost, by taking up the spaces at the end of the strands with non-encoding material. 

Telomerase can also be used to replace lost sections, but as cells divide over and over again, those strands of telomerase get shorter and shorter, and the shorter strands of telomerase at the end of your DNA mean that stuff that *does* contain encoded instructions gets lost, and larger and larger sections of your divided DNA are filled with stuff that doesn't do anything except fill in the gaps.

Now stem cells can fit in and start the whole process fresh, because they're brand new and they can become anything. But once they pick a definite type of cell to become, they also begin the mitosis process and eventually decay themselves.

You're probably thinking of cancer as just ""mutations"" and if cells divide at around the same rate, why would mutations crop up in such a shorter amount of time in dogs compared to humans? While mutations are part of the development of many types of cancer, how your body handles those mutations is equally important.


Yes, older = more likely to develop cancer. But it's helpful to think of older not in terms of the number of years lived, but in what stage of the expected lifespan you're in. If you're a human, that means after 50 or so your chances of developing cancer are going to be highest. If you're a dog, that means after 10. What exactly governs the lifespan of a species? Why dog dogs enter old age at 10 and humans at 60? Lots of theories. One possibility has to do with the individual capacity of species to repair it's own DNA. If you have a stronger genetic capacity for DNA repair, you will be able to mitigate the damage that accumulates that leads to aging changes. You can think of humans as simply having a 6 or 7-fold better genetic capacity for DNA repair compared to dogs.

OK, really, it's just a data type. It's not scary, so if your professor has been making it sound really scary it's not. It's only hard to deal with if you don't think like the computer.

Technically a pointer is just a 32 bit unsigned integer. (Or 64 bit unsigned integer if you're compiling for a 64 bit machine.) All it is is some number.

What's special about pointers is what we do with them and how the language will interpret it. A pointer is an address in memory. 

When you run a program the OS will allot it some memory in which to copy its instructions and to otherwise work with. The way the OS keeps track of memory so it only allots memory to one thing at a time - and the way low-level languages work with memory too - is by addressing it. The first byte of memory is 1, the second byte is 2, etc. until the last byte of memory is addressed. If you'r using a 32 bit OS with maxed out RAM that would make the last address 2^32

So now you know what a pointer is - an integer that's meant to correspond to a place in memory.

How we use them is a bit more complex, but it's not that hard if you just always think of it like the computer. The computer just has a huge stack of 'drawers' it can put stuff in. Each drawer is a byte. If you tell the computer 'put this in that address' it'll simply go to that address and copy the byte over. If you ask it to copy a 32 bit integer (4 bytes) to an address the first 8 bits go in the address, and the next 8 bits into the next bytes, etc. until it's copied everything. It's really simple, it's just not how humans tend to think of things. We try to bring common sense and other assumptions into how we think. Computers don't. 

In C/C++ you can get the address of things with the &amp; operator and ask the computer to read from memory with the * operator. (Often called the dereference operator because we often say a pointer references a point in memory, so dereferencing is finding what's actually there in the memory.)

    int a = 10;
    int* b = &amp;a;
    *b = 9;
    cout &lt;&lt; a;

That would print 9. The computer is told by us that b is the address of a, and to make what's at the address b points to 9. The computer isn't aware that we modified a because it doesn't think that much, it only understand that a is an integer that it put at some address it's kept a record of. When we ask it to print a it looks up where it put a in the memory, reads the memory location and finds a 9.

Here's something to be careful about:

    int a = 10;
    int* b = a;

That's bad. That doesn't mean 'b is a pointer to a', that means 'b is a pointer to the address 10'. This is bad because you have no guarantees that the OS has allotted the program the address 10 and so if you try to ask your program to modify what's at the address 10 and it has not been given access to it by the OS the OS will complain and will kill your program for attempting to violate memory. (This is usually called a segmentation fault. Segmentation fault almost always means you messed up with your pointers somewhere.)

Similarly be careful of this:

    int a = 10;
    int* b = &amp;a;
    b = 9;

Same as above, you're saying to make b point to the address 9, not to make what b points to 9. 

Also something you may not have heard but it's true - there's no real difference between an array and a pointer. When I say

    int[10] a;

a is an integer pointer. The program will give it enough room to store 10 integers rather than 1, but nonetheless a is just a pointer to the first byte of the first integer.

eideid,"At a very basic level, computer programs have to interact with memory. C++ is a rather low-level programming language by today's standards and it lets you (requires even) interact with memory in a very basic way.

When you initialize a variable you are telling the computer to set aside a specific amount of memory in a specific place for the program to store and retrieve information. This variable begins at a memory address which is represented as a number and it goes to a memory address dependent on the size of the type of data you are storing in it. When you reference this variable, you are really referencing this space in memory.

Now let's take it up a bit and talk about arrays. In C variants, arrays have to be declared with a fixed length and each element of an array must have the same kind of data. When you create an array of size N with a data type which takes up M bits, you get a chunk of memory N * M bits long. Let's say you want the third element of the array, we can calculate it by taking the address of the beginning of then skipping past the first 2 values, or 2 * M bits. This is (essentially) why arrays in this language start with index 0, since the first element is the address of the array and skip the first 0 * M bits.

Pointers are simply these memory addresses in a form which you can manipulate with your code. Instead of relying on the compiler to do it all behind the scenes, you can use pointers to play with the memory directly.

One reason you might see pointers very early is when passing arrays into functions. Most of the time we don't want variables we send to functions to get edited by the function without our knowing about it. If I were to just send the memory address of a variable to a function and that function changed the contents at that memory address, it might cause problems. C++ handles this by copying the value of the variable into a new memory space just for the function to play with, which makes programmers happy. This, however, can be a problem when dealing with large data structures. We don't necessarily want to copy a big pile of data just to do some trivial evaluation of it, so when you pass an array, instead of copying the whole thing, you just send a pointer to where the array already lives and hopefully you or whomever wrote that function is going to be nice and not mess it up for you.",null,0,cdlnkwr,1rbx7c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

OldWolf2,"A pointer is a way to refer to another variable. (There are several ways to refer to other variables, a pointer is one of them).

You point it at a variable you are interested in, and then you can access that other variable via the pointer.

One situation where this is useful is if you have some code that you want to be able to run multiple times on different variables.  Then you could make that code accept a pointer, and then you don't have to write out 10 different copies of the same code, just copy-pasting in a variable name.

kouhoutek,"A pointer is a variable type that holds an address of another variable.

That is the technically correct and completely useless answer.  The real question is why the heck would you want something like that.  *That* question is more easily answered by looking at the problem that pointers solve.

Let's say you need to write a program that reads numbers from a file, sorts them, and prints them out.  The first thing you probably want to do is store them in an array, declared like this:

    int numbers[1000];

This presents a big problem, because the storage for numbers will be allocated statically.  This means your program will always reserve enough space for 1000 ints.  If your list has 20 elements, you are wasting space, and if it has 1001, your program fails.

The answer is to allocate memory *dynamically*, that is, let the program decide how much it needs while it is running, not beforehand.  For this, it is nice to have pointers:

    int *numbers;

That creates variable that can hold the address of a int.  It hasn't been initialized yet, so it is kind of useless, so let's take care of that:

    n = get_number_of_elements(""file.txt"");
    numbers = new int [n];

get_number_of_elements() is just some function you wrote to figure how how many numbers were in the file.  Once you know that, you can use new to ask your computer to set aside enough memory to hold n ints.  It returns the address of this memory in the form of a pointer, and you can use that pointer to access that memory:

    *number = 7;                  // Store 7 in the first location
    *(number + sizeof(int)) = 16; // Store 16 in the second location
    number[2] = 99;               // Cleaner notation

I'll try to explain how DNA 'knows' what to do through a real life example. The easiest example I can think of is a small section of DNA frequently found in E. coli called the lac operon.

So imagine a coil of DNA. Now only think of one of those 'strips'. The lac operon will look somewhat like this:

    ======TATAAAAAGCGATTGATGGCGCTGCATGCTAAGCTGACTCTTTAAGCGATGACATCGATCT======

This is what it is like, functionally:

    ======[PROMOTER]==[OPERATOR]==[REAL INFORMATION]================[THE END]=====    

Now that ISN'T the real thing - I don't have the real thing [memorized or anything](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/443015-i-don-t-need-to-know-everything-i-just-need-to). The real thing is longer and umm... not that but it's a good idea of what I would generally look like (the '=' is just other DNA code).

The lac operon is responsible for making enzymes that process lactose, a sugar found in milk. To make it simple, let's pretend that there is just one enzyme that helps process lactose and that enzyme's name is MILKY. Now, MILKY isn't needed if there is no lactose. And he IS needed when there IS lactose. So DNA does a clever thing.

In a normal state there is a small protein (essentially a bouncer at a club) that sticks to an area of the DNA called the [OPERATOR]. The name isn't important. What is important is that because this fat bastard is sitting in the way, the DNA can't be read (imagine the DNA is read in a linear manner). If you can't read it, you can't make it.

So what happens when lactose is present? The lactose (actually its metabolite... but just think lactose) actually sticks to the fat bastard bouncer. When lactose sticks to it, the fat bastard bouncer lets go of the DNA. Now the DNA can be read.

With that area exposed, a constantly floating protein (let's call him the AGENT) binds to the beginning part of the lac operon section of the DNA (the AGENT is chemically made to bind there - he fits like a key). With the AGENT bound to the promoting area [PROMOTER], he calls his friend the READER. The READER moves across and reads the DNA and while doing so is writing a translation of it, almost like translating it from one language to another. Except for READER he translates DNA into RNA.

Once a copy of the RNA is made this moves to another part of the cell (not body, just inside the cell) to be made into a protein. The name of the protein? Albert Einstein. Sorry couldn't resist. The resulting protein is MILKY. And with MILKY here, he can eat up all the lactose and poop out stuff that the cell can readily use.

That's pretty much how most stuff in the cell or any organism is made off of DNA. If it's something that we always need, then there is no fat bastard bouncer blocking that bit of the DNA. Or this regulation could work in reverse, where it's always made until something comes which sticks to a different fat bastard bouncer and instead of making it let go, makes it stick to the DNA.

Hope that helps.

DNA is read by structures which copy sections and release bits of RNA which float around and then interact with structures in the cell which build new proteins which then float around and interact with other structures. In fact, most of biology is molecules floating around until they interact with something to cause something else to happen.

The really cool part is how different parts of DNA are read depending on the circumstances in the organism. There are molecules which will attach to the DNA which suppress or enhance different sections. Suppressed sections won't be copied as much, if at all, while enhanced sections will be copied much more often. In complex multicellular organisms, this results in different sorts of cells having different bits turned on and off and those differences affect which proteins get created and interact from one cell to the next. There are also feedback loops where a section of DNA gets activated, resulting in the production of something, which results in some activity which creates a new molecule which goes and turns off the section of DNA which was activated in the first place.

TimeTravellerSmith,"Basically what happens is that people can only contribute so much when they donate to political elections for obvious reasons.  It prevents single rich people from buying politicians via financing their election.

Enter the Super PAC, which is essentially an account that's run by someone and anyone can donate any amount of money *anonymously* and then the PAC can use the funds however they like towards elections.  They can buy ads supporting or against a candidate, run rallies, whatever.  So they can indirectly fund any politician they like with the caveat that ""they aren't supposed to work directly with them"".  Meaning that they can't go up to their candidate and ask ""what would you like us to do?""  Which creates obvious problems.  

Essentially, behind closed doors, a rich businessman or company can come up to a politician and his buddy who runs a PAC.  The buddy can run campaigns in different districts ""without consulting the politician"" to support them, while the businessman finances it ""anonymously.  Which means that the three can collude behind closed doors to get a politician in office and then the politician can do what they do best and give their donors perks once they're in office.

Example:

Politician is running for election, supports offshore drilling.  Buddy opens up a PAC and says it's going to support whichever politician will be best for ""local economy"", which really translates to whoever wants to do offshore drilling, which translates to ""I'm going to support my friend who happens to be a candidate"".  Rich oil company steps in and says ""well I support the guy who's going to let me drill offshore"" but can only donate a limited amount of money directly to the candidate.  So the three gather behind closed doors and the oil company says ""I'll donate millions to the PAC if you work for me in office (as in, allow drilling, lift sanctions, get tax breaks, etc)"".  To which the politician says ""no problem"" and the buddy running the PAC says ""give me your money and I'll work on some great ads"".

Extrmcouchsurfer,The purpose of oil is to lubricate and aid in keeping engine parts cooler.  It forms a thin barrier around things like bearings to prevent excess friction.

NightMaestro,"Imagine the inside of your engines piston boar. Inside this giant cylinder the piston will go back and fourth thousands of times in a minute. On a molecular level you will see the surface of this boar have very jagged ridges because steel isnt perfectly smooth. As the piston goes up and down these pieces of metal will keep catching these ridges on a molecular level over and over and produce a lot of friction. This happens in all moving parts of the engine. To reduce this friction we use oil to fill gaps where the metal surfaces would otherwise grind up against eachother and subsequently melt all of these pieces of metal together through heat.

You cant keep other molucules out of the oil, thats just not possible, so after a while the oil will be mixed with other contaminates that dirty up the oil. After so many contaminates get into your oil, those molucular ridges wont fill with the almost friction free oil moluciles anymore, instead you will have dirt or metal shavings fill and create friction.

Now, you have to understand what the oil is doing inside of the engine. It's being pumped around making sure all the bearings, rings, seals, and everything else are being properly lubricated. With the engine running, at any time, you are producing heat. The heat breaks down the additives inside of the base stock oil and can effect the performance of the oil. (And yes, the breaking down of oil can also effect the viscosity, however very slightly.) The oil can no longer properly protect your engine against sludge, oxidation, rust, and the lubrication of the oil will no longer be as effective as new oil. Also, on an added note, burned gases inside the engine also go into the oil, contaminating the oil and further lessening the effectiveness of the oil.

voucher420,"There are several reasons to change your oil. Even if you hardly drive, you should change your oil every three months. Why? The best reason is to remove the water being built up by taking short trips. Condensation will form on the cold metal parts overnight. Normally, it isn't much &amp; it evaporates &amp; gets sucked thru your engine once it's fully warmed up &amp; been driven for some time. Constant short trips never let the engine reach operating temperatures. The water builds up &amp; creates sludge. It can sometimes be mistaken for a blown head gasket. 

Oil additives break down over time &amp; wear out. If you drive a lot (long commutes, half hour or longer), you can go longer between oil changes. You don't have to worry about water contamination as much as people who take short trips &amp; can go five to ten thousand miles between oil changes (use synthetic to go up to fifteen thousand miles between oil changes). 

Most places recommend three thousand miles to help cover their asses. It's normal for engines to consume up to a quart of oil every one thousand miles. In a five quart system, that only leaves two quarts in the engine of ""key &amp; fuel"" drivers. If you check your oil frequently &amp; top it off when it gets down a quart, you can go much further between oil changes. Your engine runs cooler &amp; the oil is less likely to get burned. 

The other reason the three month/three thousand mile oil change is a good idea is for the inspection. Take your car to a real shop for oil changes. A good shop will inspect your car from top to bottom, check tire pressure, change your oil, &amp; suggest other maintenance items you may have neglected in that time. 

TL;DR: Change your oil every three months or three thousand miles unless you keep up on fluid levels &amp; tire pressure. Use the guide in your owners manual for specifications based on your driving style. ",null,1,cdlotzn,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

As good as oil is, a bit of wear still occurs. Microscopic pieces of metal start to build up in the oil, making it not work so well.

Also, oil breaks down with heat. In oil, there are molecules that are bound together, but when it gets hot, those molecules break down and become a less effective lubricant.

When the oil becomes broken down and/or dirty, the metal parts in the engine scrape together a little more and wear faster. A 30$ oil change every few months is a lot better than a destroyed engine due to lack of lubrication.",null,0,cdloz90,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
mysticalone,"Many changes occur to the fresh oil you put into the car. Additives added to the oil are used up and the oil can no longer provide the same performance as fresh oil. As the additives break down, friction between metals increase and will contaminate the oil with metal particles. The tight spaces that rely on the oil and additives will now contain abrasives from the metal particles further worsening the performance and degrading the health of the engine.

If you have ever seasoned a pan, you may have noticed a stickiness from the oil when heating the pan. Similar reaction occurs over time with motor oil and with other contaminants such as moisture, dirt, coolant, motor oil becomes sludge. Oil filters can only remove so much until the filter is overcome with particles and can no longer effectively filter the oil.

With age, stress, and other factors, the engine may be leaking very small amounts of coolant that can react with the oil. Small amounts are ""ok"" however, over time the total amount in the oil increases and potentially causing harm to the motor same as motor oil.

Similar to oil in fast food restaurants. Oil will break down and become darker and thicker. Some owners will filter their used frying oil to save money, however, not everything is removed.

LIPCSB,"The basic premise is that the Doctor is an alien (species: Time Lord) who travels around in a spaceship/time-machine called the ""TARDIS.""  The TARDIS is bigger on the inside and has a camouflage circuit that's been jammed to ""London Police Box, 1950s"" since the first episode.  He tends to be accompanied by ""companions,"" people who travel with the Doctor on his adventures.  

The show began in 1963 and, thus far, 12 men have played the Doctor.  This is explained in-universe by Time Lords growing a new body when they die.  The show went off the air in 1989.  There was an attempt to revive it in 1996 with an American-made television movie, but that didn't get the green-light for a full series.  It was successfully revived in 2005 with the Ninth Doctor, played by Christopher Eccleston.  

It was a cult show in Britain for many years, aimed mostly at younger audiences but having a strong following among science fiction fans, but the revival has brought it a more mainstream popularity.  

I'd recommend getting started with Eccleston's episodes--Series 1, which aired in 2005.  Watch the modern series, then go back to the older stuff.  There's no need to slog through every episode (which is impossible anyway, given that a good many were destroyed in the old days of non-ubiquitous recording), just pick up a story or two (stories are several episodes long, though) from each Doctor.  And give the TV movie a look--it's not perfect, but the 8th Doctor's acting is very good.  Eric Roberts as ""The Master""...your mileage may vary.

kcnovember,"The show started in 1963 and continued through to 1989 when it was canceled. This is dubbed ""Classic Who."" In 1996, there was an ill-fated TV movie that failed to revive the series. Then, it was finally remade in 2005, it proved a big hit, and that is the show we see today. The series from 2005 to present is dubbed ""New Who"" by some fans.

The synopsis: ""The Doctor"" is an alien called a ""time-lord"" who travels through space and time in a blue box that's ""bigger on the inside."" Along the way, he makes friends (usually female and human, but not always,) solves complex problems, saves planets and galaxies from destruction, but he never gets the girl in the end. This time-lord has many enemies, but he has many friends to help him. Finally, he doesn't die. As a time-lord, he regenerates into another physical form. He looks different and has a different personality, but he retains the memories of his past regenerations.

The show is about how creativity, resourcefulness, friendship, intellect, passion, and a strong belief in oneself can overcome practically any obstacle. The Doctor almost never uses a weapon against an enemy. If he does, it's usually used indirectly, such as using a gun to shoot a machine to stop a plot instead of shooting the evil mastermind behind the plot. His chief tool is a sonic screwdriver which can open locks and scan bio-organisms and computer systems.

The show is very British, and sometimes it helps to have an interest in British culture and history, but it's not crucial. 

To start watching, try ""Blink"" from Series Three (2007) of the rebooted series. It's widely considered the best episode ever made in the show's entire history. It requires no prior knowledge of the show. If you don't like that episode, chances are the show is not for you.

If you like ""Blink,"" then you can binge-watch starting with Series One, with Christopher Eccleston as The Doctor, then to Series Two thru Four with David Tennant in the role, and finally with Matt Smith in the role from Series Five to Seven. Along the way, check out episodes of the Classic show as it suits you. Many fans have different opinions about every Doctor, so look around the Internet for ""Best Of"" lists to see what would be a good episode to watch in Classic Who.

In order to watch the 50th Anniversary Special, ""Day of the Doctor,"" you'd have to watch Matt Smith's run to understand it. If you only watch Matt Smith's run, you won't understand some of the references made about David Tennant's Doctor in that episode.

Risar,"This is a very short version. 

  The Doctor (the primary character) is a timelord, an ancient species of alien which live for thousands of years through a biotech process called regeneration. This allows The Doctor to survive otherwise fatal events, but the process causes physical changes.

  The series is oriented around The Doctors adventures in time and space usually using his stolen time ship which is a TARDIS (time and relative dimension in space). You see the Doctor is a bit of a misfit. In addition to his rebel streak it's important to note that Timelords choose their title, so The Doctor views himself as a healer of sorts.

  Accordingly the show is a bit quirky / odd, and has a magic ""go anywhere, do anything"" mechanic in the TARDIS. So The Doctor may be in Ancient Rome or future London, some alien ship or planet. He often picks up interesting partners in crime to travel with him as he goes. So the entire show has a rotating cast essentially, with overarching themes and arcs spanning multiple seasons.

The Doctor is a character so complex in his history, created from so many poignant but small moments buried in the genre fiction of his show, that simple descriptions of him can't help but make him sound unbelievable.

I still get chills every time I see his speech when he confronted the Atraxi.

But, I'll try to do him justice here.

Basic Premise:

The Doctor is an alien that has a time-traveling phone booth. He frequently takes ""companions"" with him on his travels. Companions are just people he meets up with and travels with. They're like his friends.

He is a devout pacifist (though he has his bad days), and generally thinks of very clever ways to get out of problems. He spends his time saving the universe. Literally.

Here are the Doctor's ""powers:""

1) He has a ""sonic screwdriver."" It is the ultimate MacGuffin. It works when the story needs it to, and doesn't when the story needs it to not work.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin

2) When he speaks, others listen. He is frequently cornered by enemies with superior weapons, but then he starts talking at them. By the time he's done talking, he's outsmarted them.

3) He's wicked smart. He thinks of ""technobabble"" solutions to problems sometimes, but the best stories are when he thinks of creative solutions that you could have thought up.

4) He's a master of Venusian aikido (space martial arts). No shit. You'll probably never see this though. It was really only used by the Third Doctor.

http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor

5) He can ""regenerate."" Thought up as a way to continue the show when William Hartnell (the First Doctor) wanted to retire, it has now become a staple of the show. When Time Lords (the ""race"" of the Doctor) are killed, they can undergo a complete cellular regenerate that brings them back to life. However, they end up looking different (i.e. being played by another actor). This change is more than just skin deep though. They can change skin colors or even genders. Also, their memories become a bit muddled, and other significant changes can occur, such as no longer liking a favorite kind of food.

In the fandom, whenever the Doctor undergoes a regeneration, it's a HUGE DEAL!

Currently, the Doctor is in his 11th incarnation (sort of). That's why Matt Smith (the actor currently playing the Doctor) is generally referred to as the Eleventh Doctor.

About the Show:

The British refer to what American's call a ""season"" as a ""series,"" so that can get pretty confusing. I'll use the American version for this write up, so when I say a ""season,"" I'm taking about a single string of episodes aired typically during a single calendar year.

There are basically three different ""eras"" that make up Doctor Who. Most people in America refer to these as the different ""series"" of the show.

""Original Series"" - Aired from 1963 to 1989 and had a ""movie"" that aired in 1996. The original series was mainly characterized by by ""serials."" Two to five episodes that made up a single ""story arch.""

""2005 Series"" - Aired from 2005 to 2010. This is when the show relaunched after being canceled 15 years earlier. The budget for the show was still very small (comparatively), and is often considered cheesy or unwatchable by younger audiences.

""Steven Moffat Series"" - Started in 2010 and running up to today. Named after the current ""show runner"" or ""head writer"" for the show. Marked by a noticeable increase in budget. All episodes are now broadcast in high definition. Still using the same actor, Matt Smith, as the Doctor.

Where to Start:

You're going to get lots of different answers for this. I'm just going to give you the ""easiest"" place to start for what is probably ""the average viewer.""

Start with the episode, ""The Eleventh Hour."" It's generally considered ""Season 5"" (or ""Series 5"" if you're British) of the 2005 series (though fans often make a distinction and think of it as the first episode of the Steven Moffat Series). Calling it the 2005 series distinguishes it from the original 1963 to 1989 run (and the movie made in 1996).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_5_.282010.29

Each season of the 2005 Doctor Who is comprised of ""episodic"" episodes as well as ""serial"" episodes. Episodic episodes are stand-alone pieces. Like one-off shows that don't much connect to any of the other shows. Serial episodes are ones that have interconnected stories (though they may not have occurred ""in order""). Usually, the first and last episodes of each season are connected, and sometimes one or two other episodes in the middle of the season. These form the ""seasonal story arch.""

If you enjoy the first few episodes of Season 5 and want to watch the older stuff, jump back to ""Season 1"" with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor. Again, this is Season 1 of the 2005 Series.

If you have a hard time watching that, but just want to see ""the best episodes"" so you can keep up with Doctor Who talk, then I'd recommend these:

""The Empty Child""
""The Doctor Dances""
""Human Nature""
""The Family of Blood""
""Blink""
""Silence in the Library""
""Forest of the Dead""

Those are pretty much the best ones from 2005 to 2010.

Everything from 2010 on should be pretty ""easy to enjoy"" for modern audiences.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that love Doctor Who so much that they want everyone to love it. I certainly love it. However, it's not really ""for everyone."" Lots of people don't like the more childish or cheesy parts of the show, and that's fine. If you don't like it, don't try to force yourself to like it.

However, if you can get into it, it is certainly one of the best shows ever made.

brandoncordell,"/u/LIPCSB explained the show very well, so I will give you my opinion on where to start.

There are three episodes, one from each of the three Doctors that have appeared since the reincarnation of the show, that I use when showing someone the show for the first time.

Season 1, Episode 9 ""The Empty Child"" (This is a 2-part arch. Episode 10 is named ""The Doctor Dances"")     
Season 3, Episode 10 ""Blink""    
Season 5, Episode 10 ""Vincent and the Doctor""

They won't get you too much into the history of the show, but they'll give you a good idea of what the show is about and give you a preview of how each of the modern Doctor's acts.

hifigi,"The Fourth Doctor is really where Classic Doctor Who hit its stride, so if you want to really *understand* the culture of the show it's a great place to start. The classic format had shorter weekly episodes (about 25 minutes each) but longer story arcs (usually four episodes per arc), so each classic serial lasts roughly 100 minutes, or the length of an average movie. However, since this is a serial format, each episode has a basic three act structure and most episodes end with a cliffhanger. The action and plot are therefore more fast-paced and often a bit more goofy than modern Who. Prepare to suspend your disbelief!

I now present a breakdown of the best serials (opinion alert!) for each season of the Fourth Doctor:

S12 - ""Genesis of the Daleks"" On planet Skaro, two human-like races are caught in the middle of a planetary war. A scientist for the Kaled race has developed a terrible technology that will transform his people into mindless exterminating Daleks, and the Doctor has been ordered to eliminate them before they ever exist.

S13 - ""Pyramids of Mars"" In a Victorian Gothic mansion, strange things are afoot. The master of the house, away in Egypt, has been replaced by a sinister Egyptian. Cloth-wrapped Mummies roam the grounds, killing people. Beneath a pyramid, the last of the Osirians — Sutekh the Destroyer — waits to be freed, to at long last bring his gift of death to all who live.

S14 - ""The Face of Evil"" The Doctor arrives on a planet where two tribes, the savage Sevateem and the technically brilliant Tesh, are at war. He meets Leela, an exile from the Sevateem, and discovers that their god of evil is apparently himself.

S15 - ""The Invasion of Time"" The Doctor, showing signs of erratic behavior, travels to his home planet of Gallifrey and proclaims himself President due to a legal technicality. His strange behavior continues as he tries to access the Matrix, the heart of all Time Lord knowledge. Meanwhile Gallifrey comes under attack from not one but two enemy forces.

S16 - ""The Key to Time"" If you've made it this far, you should watch the entire 16th season. It's one massive story told through an episodic Hero's Quest structure.

S17 - ""Destiny of the Daleks"" The Doctor and a newly-regenerated Romana arrive on Skaro to find that the Daleks are using explosive charges and a group of humanoid slave workers to mine the planet in search of their creator, Davros.

S18 - ""Logopolis"" The Doctor goes to Logopolis to repair the TARDIS's chameleon circuit, not knowing that a shadowy watcher is spying on him. His old enemy the Master has plans of his own for the planet of mathematicians, Logopolis, and a plan that could spell doom for the entire universe.

Note: Episode synopses for ""Pyramids of Mars"", ""Face of Evil"", ""Destiny of the Daleks"", &amp; ""Logopolis"" are taken verbatim from tardis.wikia.com, all other descriptions are my own.",null,2,cdlmnpt,1rbmab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

I would recommend that you watch ""blink""  it is not the first episode (maybe in the third season?) but you don't need much background before you watch it (that video before this should do) and it doesn't give much away.  If you like that I would recommend that you start with Eccleston (First season from reboot) and move on from there.  I consider myself a huge fan and I have not seen all the classic who episodes.

Warskull,"The main character is ""The Doctor"" a super-genius alien who can solve pretty much any problem.

He has access to a time machine which can essentially teleport anywhere in time and space and uses this time machine to go on grand adventures.

He takes along a companion which a vast majority of the time is a young attractive female.  Most of the time the premise is him showing off cool things to the companion.

It is really more fantasy than hard science fiction.  Pretty much every rule can be broken and stuff is only loosely explained at times.  It is ultimately an excuse to go on adventures, have crazy villains, and fantastic stuff happening.

I would just start at the beginning of the 2005 series.  Quality will go up and down between episodes because they feature a variety of writers and each episode can be a one off premise.

LostNoob,"I've literally been watching doctor who all my life (well since I was like 5 or something, a good few years before the revived show at least) and I honestly can't think of a way to explain the show without it sounding dumb and goofy, well it is dumb and goofy, that's part of it's charm.

It seems I got to this thread a bit too late to bother going into too much detail as many have already described the show already.

But one thing that doesn't seem to well explained in the thread is what does he do and why?
Well, in the early series, all that was know about him was that he's on the run from his own people, and we later learn, it's because he stole a Tardis.

He stole the Tardis too see the universe, but the tardis was faulty and he would often end up somewhere he didn't intend to, the early series revolved around him getting his two companions back home (whom he practically kidnapped to stop them from talking about what they had seen)

The basic plot of the classic episodes was the tardis would land, the doctor and his companions would go looking around and get separated from the Tardis and they would have to get back to the Tardis, in fact most the time, he wouldn't even consider saving the day unless it meant them getting out of their.

By the end of the first Doctors run, he had become a bit more like what we have today, he would save the day, even if he was able to get back in the Tardis.
One thing I should note is that continuity in the early series isn't exactly solid.
For example one episode the doctor is over 700 the next he's only 500 or so, it's more down to the production team really.
(the modern series keeps up with continuity a lot better)

As for where to start, the beginning, Unearthly Child, it sets up the show quite well, though the three episodes after it are a bit dull, the story after that makes up for it (the introduction of the Daleks) the first 3 storeys are available on dvd with the beginning box set (btw in the classic series each story has around 4 episodes sometimes 6)
Keep in mind that it was made 50 years ago, and the budget was terrible, even in 1963 and enjoy
Anyway, a lot of the early episodes have gone missing (BBC wiping the tapes to save money) but from 1970 onwards, you'll be able to watch every episode, or just pick a few from each doctor that appeal to you, the continuity in the old series isn't that great anyway, so you can jump into just about any episode and understand what's happening.

(Did I say I was't going to go into too much detail? uhhh sorry, that happens)

Polaritical,"Don't let the super devoted fans fool you: Doctor Who is just a silly little show about a time traveling alien.

I think people get scared off because the super devoted fans give an impression that show is much more serious and detail oriented than it really is. This is not Lost. You don't have to go back over episodes and poor over details. In fact, you can pretty much watch any episode and catch on pretty quickly. Some of the companion related side plot plot might be lost, but the show is mainly episodic and focuses on one particular problem and plot each episode.

Doctor Who is a beloved british tv show that follows the antics of a time lord (a type of alien species that looks similar to humans) traveling through space and time with various companions.

Think of it kind of like a sci-fi version of Scooby Doo. Every week there's some new mystery or problem and it's up to the doctor and his loyal companion at the time to solve it. He sort of acts as an intergalactic police officer running around and keeping everything from hitting the fan. But instead of the mystery mobile, the Doctor has the TARDIS.

The TARDIS is basically a super high tech spaceship that also acts as a time machine. It helps with the adventures by doing nifty things like allowing the Doctor and his companion to understand whatever alien language is being spoken where they are (which addresses the issue that so bothered fans of District 9 who didn't understand how the heck people and aliens were communicating with each other in completely different languages). It also has a camouflage function which got stuck on an old phone booth. Nifty disguise back when the show first aired that was kept because it was part of tradition, but now is pretty funny when you see an old phone booth just appear in a modern London street.

The show started and did pretty well and then ran into the same problem that a lot of shows run into: an actor didn't want to do the show anymore. Think about Three's Company when Chrissy left or the Office when they had to right Michael off. Except this was THE main guy. They couldn't just write in a new character and take off with that plot line. He was the LAST timelord. There was no one they could write about without changing the entire premise of the show (look how well that turned out when Scrubs tried it)

They wanted to continue the show, so they had to think of a way to keep the character of the Doctor going but have a new actor. They could do like That 70s show did with Laurie or Bewitched did with Darren and simply get a new actor and not address it. But they had something those shows didn't: the doctor was an alien! So they just wrote into the show that sometimes a doctor regenerates. Which basically involves them taking a new human form.

And that's how the show has had a string of actors that have been able to play the same part throughout the show. 

Doctor Who can pretty much be split into two sections: the original run and the modern revival.

The original run was more of a Saturday morning type kids show that was aimed at the kind of kids who thought sci-fi was awesome. The modern series tried to expand the appeal to a wider audience (and did so quite successfully) with an expanded budget and better special effects.

If you're just getting into the show, start with the modern series. You can start with Eccleston which was the first series in the modern run. David Tennant is widely considered to be the most popular and loved Doctor, so if you start with Eccleston and aren't a huge fan I'd recommend switching to Tennant before you write off the whole show.

The show is hugely popular now and popular with a wider audience. This can be seen as both good and bad. You'll see that in the modern series, especially with Matt Smith, the show suddenly starts going to America a lot which is largely because the show now has a large American following. There's also some negative views of Doctor Who 'fan girls' who think that the doctor is 'like super dreamy and cute'. Some fans think that show show shifted somewhat to appeal to those type of fans by including a lot of opportunities to make the Doctor look like a hunk despite it not really being in vein with the original show.

If you're someone who's a bit skeptical about all this alien crap, I'd recommend watching the episode ""Blink"". It's completely different than all the other episodes and barely even features the Doctor. But it really highlights the clever writing of the show and can be a good way to ease people who aren't usually fans of science fiction into it. It's a lot less cheesy than some episodes (at first, the cheesiness seems bad. But once you've grown to love the Doctor, you eat that cheese right up).

OpportunityBox,"An alien race of beings becomes so advanced that the power of the entire universe is at their beck and call.  They can instantly travel anywhere in time and space, manipulate stars and black holes, etc.  

These aliens (called Time Lords) use time travel to change history too much to suit their own ends and screw up.  They mistakenly create super evil beings just as powerful as themselves.  They wage a war so devastating that it tears major holes in the history of the universe and are about to tear apart the entire universe and destroy everything in it just to save themselves.

One of these Time Lords, The Doctor, determines that he can save the universe but it will mean destroying his entire race.  He steals one of the most powerful ships ever created (The Tardis, a physical embodiment of the energy of the universe itself), and uses it to stop the war by imprisoning both the evil race and his entire race of Time Lords for all time.   

He then spends thousands of years trying to alleviate his guilt and boredom trying to fix the damage to the universe caused by the Time Lords by traveling through space and time. The Tardis brings him to places and times where he can do the most good and regenerates him into a new body each time he dies so he can continue his work.  

His effect is so profound that many races and planets (including Earth) call their heroes or healers ""Doctors"".

He has access to the best technology ever created in the entire history of the universe.  He travels with a human companion who helps to keep him honest and true.  Storylines frequently involve a danger where there appear to be only two choices.  For example, making one choice will destroy a planet, but making the other choice will only kill a small child.  While the choice of one small child dying seems better than an entire planet dying, his human companion attempts to force him to find a third choice where everyone lives.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

EngineeringStudent_,"The basic premise is the Doctor (a Time Lord from the planet of Gallifrey) has a machine that can travel anywhere in space and time. The machine is called the TARDIS* which looks like an old London Police Box. 

The Doctor ran away from his home planet and travels around the universe to explore. He picks up companions (the first of which he kidnapped, back in '63) and travels around with them until they decide (or are forced) to leave. In his travels, he just so happens to help out other races so he can save himself and his companions.** The show is a chronicle of his travels.

Because he is a Time Lord,*** he can regenerate. This means he gets a new body and a different personality. His memories are the same, but otherwise he's a completely different person. This is why there are multiple Doctors. The ""classic"" series contains the First through Seventh Doctors (1963 to 1989 iirc). There was an American TV movie in '96 which featured the Eighth Doctor. The 2005 reboot of the series, dubbed ""New Who"" began with the Nineth Doctor.

As for where to begin: I stared with the episode ""The Eleventh Hour"" which is the Eleventh Doctor's first episode. Another good starter, as others have mentioned is the first episode of the 2005 reboot with the Nineth Doctor. However, since every Doctor is different (different actor, different writers, etc), I would encourage giving at least two or three of them a try. The good thing about Dr. Who is that you can jump in pretty much anywhere as stories are generally stand-alone and don't rely on knowledge of stuff that happened before.

*Stands for T.ime A.nd R.elative D.imensions I.n S.pace. The TARDIS is bigger on the inside, and we generally see the console room. 

**The motivation behind helping other races depends on which Doctor you're dealing with. Their MO also changes. Some are very peaceful and avoid violence, some may have committed genocide.

CultureMan,"Well, let's see.

The Doctor is, as others have stated, an alien from a race that has learned how to manipulate time but, in the main, just watch the passing parade.  The Doctor thought they should be doing more, and stole one of the time-space ships to change things. 

When he is old or seriously injured (irradiated, shot, etc), he has ""this trick"" as he puts it, which allows his body to regenerate on a cellular level.  He retains his memories, but is in effect a completely new person, who goes swaggering off to new adventures.

His human companions often keep him grounded and are 'way in' characters for us.  In some ways they have healed him from his past actions.

Best starting points are, I actually think, 'Rose' and 'Dalek'  In  those eps, you find out why companions are important, and why Daleks are actually shit-scary and pretty iconic.

If you've watched old TV shows from the 60s on, you should at least sample some of the earlier Doctors, each have strong points.  If you haven't watched old shows, well, Who was always about the characters and the story, not the effects.

The Doctor has the ability of 'regenerating', which he has done eleven (for simplicity's sake - don't get me started on [that one](http://static.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/john-hurt-doctor-who.jpg), or [that one](http://brianofmorbius.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/doctor-who-084-4k-the-brain-of-morbius-4-of-4_0-19-03-29.jpg)) times. During this, the character dies and changes his face and a lot of his personality. Each Doctor (they generally last three-five years, the longest being seven) is a completely different era for the show.

Part of the appeal is due to this - different Doctors, and different writers completely change up the show every few years - no era is really the same. The current writer likes complicated plots, and fan-pleasing moments, whilst the previous liked bringing 'soap opera' type things into it. It's had a horror phase, and a camp phase, and an educational phase, every few years it's different.

I started watching with the start of new Series Three (2007) and to my mind that's still one of the best series. There's a new companion (who is also very good) at the beginning, so it's explained quite well. Don't worry about effects - one, it's 2007, not 1872, and two, it is and always has been about creativity, rather than showing off.

However, the series has always been written as a 'dip-in' type series, so really you can start anywhere you like (though probably not a finale, they resolve all the plots of recent and can leave you feeling a bit confused.). 

Last night's episode was a continuity-laden festival, but it was also half-written for the cinemas (it's an anniversary!) so there were quite a few crowd-pleasing moments, and a bit of explanation. You might as well dive in there, as I feel the show is less about understanding everything and more just loving it.

If you watch last night's spectacular and don't love it, IMO you have no soul.

Bearing in mind what I said about watching what you want, when you want, here's a list of some of the best IMO, in no particular order. (Most are new series, just because I'm not old enough to have seen many of the classics.)

* Dalek (2005)
* Blink (2007)
* Human Nature/The Family of Blood (2007)
* Voyage of the Damned (2007)
* Genesis of the Daleks (1975)
* Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (2008)
* The Waters of Mars (2009) -*My favourite, but probably not the best to start with*
* The Next Doctor (2009)
* The Eleventh Hour (2010)
* The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang (2010)
* The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon (2011)
* A Good Man Goes To War (2011)
* Asylum of the Daleks (2012)
* The Angels Take Manhatten (2012)
* Cold War (2013) -*I like this one, it got mixed reviews though*
* The Day of the Doctor (2013)
* The Five Doctors (1983)
* Remembrance of the Daleks (1987)
* The Time Warrior (1973)

TL;DR: Man flies about universe righting wrongs, watch what you like, it's a monster-of-the-week show.

Good luck!

sacramentalist,"Time Lords come from a planet called Gallifrey.  They discovered time travel.  They'd stepped back and prefer to observe.  The Doctor (whose name is never revealed) is one of these Time Lords.  He chose a life of adventure.  So he stole this ship called a TARDIS and too off to explore and participate.

Time-space has fixed points.  so he is unable to change all things.  He can only change what has happened.

Time Lords have differet anatomy.  For instance, they have two hearts and longevity.  Some Time Lords (like The Doctor) can regenerate into a new person 12 times.  It's a way to change actor and give him a new personality

The Doctor almost always has a companion.  He's partial to earth and earthlings.  The companion asks those questions the audeience would ask.  they also get captured and such.

In any case, the law of conservation of mass itself doesn't hold true in many circumstances - it's a special case version of the law of conservation of energy.

corpuscle634,"There's no such thing as conservation of mass in physics. Mass gets created and destroyed all the time. In chemistry and basic physics, mass never gets destroyed, so they call it a ""law"" to keep things simple. It's not true though.

Anyway, what you're describing is ""relativistic mass,"" which is a sort of tricky concept. Most physicists these days prefer to avoid it entirely, because it's just not a very coherent concept. If you read a modern physics textbook, they'll generally skirt away from the idea entirely.

The reason that most physicists don't like it is that it gives you somewhat nonsensical results. For example, let's imagine you have a box with perfect mirrors on all sides. If you shoot a bunch of photons (light) into the box, the mass of the box, as measured from the outside, increases.

Photons, however, don't have mass. It doesn't matter how you rig the numbers, they just don't. So, we have a bit of a conundrum, because the presence of photons increased the mass but photons do not have mass.

It's frankly a logical inconsistency that most physicists prefer to avoid. The preferred approach is to say that by adding photons to the box, we increased the ""rest energy"" of the system, which causes an increase in the mass.

For your case, what physicists prefer to say is that the *momentum* increases as the object moves faster (more than it normally would), not the mass.",null,2,cdlj1f1,1rbjsm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

drewtam,"Democrats and Republicans agreed to try and contain communist expansion. The war was initiated and ramped up under Kennedy (D) and Johnson (D).

(some) Republicans were upset that the war was being fought in half measures rather than the total war of the previous conflicts (Korea &amp; WW2). Some thought the war had no clear objectives or purpose.
(some) Democrats didn't consider the war just. It was after all, a foreign adventure that America thrust itself into the midst.
Part of getting involved was that an America warship was attacked, this was later shown to be staged or overblown, leading some to feel betrayed by the causes for getting involved. Some felt that the burden of the fighting was too heavily laid on the middle class, poor and blacks.

This was also a time of changing party dynamics. There were many more ""liberal"" Republicans, and very ""conservative"" Democrats than the party polarization and alignment that we see today. So there was a lot of internal party disagreements and fracturing. This fed the chaos and turmoil of the politics.

Feeding this turmoil was a news media that was not nearly restrained in its war reporting as it was in WW2 or Korea, and made every effort to be as explicit as possible about what was going on.

Some Americans did not believe in confronting the Soviet and Chinese for various reasons. Not just political reasons, but religious and pragmatic as well.
Obviously the communist political fringe in America were a core group certainly against fighting the Soviet empire. Although it is downplayed today, there was a well documented communist/socialist ideology in the counter culture of the day. [History repeats itself as farce, so that now counter culture kids wear Che Guevara shirts.]

Many were afraid of the draft. But this often stated objection is only a surface argument... what I mean is that there is a deeper ""why"" men didn't want to serve in the draft. After all, there was no such draft objections in WW2 or Korean War...

I think the big controversy was that America was culturally changing, baby boomers were coming into adulthood and wanted a complete break from recent history. And this war was one more issue that they wanted handled ""completely different"" than their fathers' generations.

I'll put this out there...

Vietnam was plagued with foreign conquerors for centuries.  They were fighting for independence more so than communism.  South Vietnam was held together with a loose web of a corrupt government mostly comprised of officials endorsed by the US.  

The thinking was this would be another Korea but with modern firepower of epic proportion.  Not the case, few battles were fought with conventional armies.

This wasn't your daddy's war, we were fighting a mostly guerrilla force comprised of south Vietnamese sympathetic to the communists.  They were known as the NLF national liberation front.  Many villagers were drafted into the NLF, they were normal adolescent males.  Very difficult to distinguish from civilians which is where the controversy starts.  

Since the objective of the war was attrition and not securing ground, It was hard to tell who was winning.  Body count was the name of the game.  In a war being fought around civilians whom look no different than enemy it's hard to tell who you are killing.

News of a few village massacres became public and the whole ""baby killer"" mantra erupted. 

We started to sustain large numbers of casualties which is bad for politics.  Civilian casualties through the roof also.  News of all this eventually caused policy makers to adjust the rules of engagement.

creep_nu,"lets start with the basics.

a credit card is basically a standing agreement that you can be loaned X amount at any one time, and you can use it anywhere, and if you pay it off you can use it again.  a loan is an agreement that you can borrow x amount of money once.  an APR stands for annual percentage rate and is the amount of interest you have to pay on a loan over the course of a year.

you use a credit card like you do a debit card, for any purchases you want to make.  if you pay off your purchases at the end of the month then the credit card company will waive the interest that would be due that month.  if you don't pay off your purchases, then you're responsible for paying the interest accrued over the month.

there are a couple types of loans, those would be secured and unsecured loans.  a mortgage or car note are examples of secured loans, you're using the money to purchase an item that can be repoed by the bank if you don't pay on your loan.  unsecured loans are usually called personal loans and are for smaller amounts.  lets say you need 5k for repairs on your home, you may be able to get the loan from your bank just because of your credit history.  there's no collateral, so if you default(don't pay), the bank is out that money.  both secured and unsecured loans also have an interest rate that you pay, so at the end of the loan you may have borrowed 10k, but with interest you're actually paying back 11k to the bank.

The bulge at the far side of the Moon is a bit further away from the common center of mass and therefore does feel a bit less attracted to it. Gravitational attraction diminishes with distance. The bulge rises because there are in fact two forces at work on the water: gravitation pulls it inward towards the center of gravity, but because the world rotates around the center of gravity things are also pushed slightly outward by the centrifugal force.

Since although we do have an idea about what vitamins the body needs on a daily basis and we can kinda guesstimate as to how much they need as well (which is where you get the ""suggested daily allowance"" figures) we can estimate that and set a rating.

But because bodies have different requirements, different needs daily, and some bodies also have difficulty in absorbing those nutrients, providing more of them hopefully assists in a few ways-it allows a greater chance of absorption as the pill or supplement travels through the body, it meets the varying needs daily also as well.

And the simple fact is although the benefits and amounts of some vitamins are known fairly well, its still honestly an ""educated guess"" and since it cannot be narrowed down, ""overdoing it"" in a lot of cases doesn't cause any harm.

If there is known harm from having too much of a nutrient, you'll see that they usually are not placed into a vitamin or supplement in those quantities.  They will be 100% or less if you can get them from normal food as well.

But unless something is known to be harmful in large quantities, its easier to provide way more for those reasons, especially if its something known that the body needs, but the quantity is unsure.  If it doesn't hurt the body to take more and the excess is simply discarded, there is no real harm in doing that.  And with your body having varying needs, providing 100% RDA daily will be fine some days, but not on others.

Having said that, unless there is some science in it, 1000% is really overkill.  200% would more than meet any variations the body may have for demand.

In the early 90s they started something that can be called ""creative accounting"": 
(this is just a rough overview and not everything is strictly correct to someone who knows about business but its the most obvious way I can put it)


Simply put, when they sold something into the future they already put it in their balance in whole, when they bought something they didn't account for it until they really had to.  
Then they thought it would be a nice idea to make such deals with companies they founded themselves in other countries and didn't consolidate the balance sheets (when you own two companies and sell something from one to the other, you actually didn't earn something but they pretended they did).  
That really wasn't enough in their minds so they let these foreign companies take big loans from banks to finance this non existing business. Of course Enron also had a stake in these companies and when needed paid themselves large dividends out of the borrowed money.  
Because that really wasn't enough (Enron just ballooned into one of the biggest companies with the greatest revenues and was considered to be the smartest an best company in the world) they also didn't account for the things they owned properly. They valued everything at market value but a lot of things didn't have a market to sell them into so there was no observable market value. If there is no market value one has to have a system how to value those things and how to justify their valuation and as you can imagine, all the stuff they owned was like pure gold. 
But of course they also had the energy business left. That business needs big investments in risky programs and therefore they often found new companies for that special purpose (so called special purpose entities). That isn't unusual, but whats special is that they had hundreds of them and tried to put all the liabilities they had into those companies and either designed contracts beforehand or changed ownership later in a way that allowed them to take all those businesses out of their own balance sheets effectively reducing their liabilities considerably and driving revenue up.  
While doing all those things they also had some time to get creative in other fields like inventing new types of options (for example with the weather as underlying) or incentivizing their employees in a way that drove a competition to make the biggest fake deals and the smartest ways to get around laws.




Why didn't this system collapse quickly?  
At first it worked out nicely. Revenues went up massively, stock prices rose accordingly, big banks got big deals, everyone was happy. Other companies even thought they did something wrong and were told to take Enron as an example. Later people started to wonder how it all worked but by then a lot of top level Enron employees changed into politics and consulting (and politicians became consultant and/or were being supported by Enron, like George Bush sr received 2,5 million for elections, almost 200 congressmen were supported too), banks were being threatened to lose their deals with Enron if they didn't keep up the loans and other deals, ever new stock was given and large dividends payed (out of nothing) to keep people happy. The auditing companies were at the same time hired as consultants and payed lots and lots of money so they had an interest in keeping it up as well. 
But like everything, this had to end, too. People started to question the extremely high stock price in comparison to the revenues, banks started to be a bit more careful in deals with Enron and in the end they were also called out by an insider and their entire system collapsed quite quickly at that point.

Also considering prostitution to be a ""consenting"" act is a charitable description. No woman, or man, gladly participates in sex for money. It is almost entirely made necessary through desperate economic needs.  ",null,2,cdl99gq,1raknd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

Both have requirements for age and consent, among other things.

Just because you can find it for free online and be underage and viewing it (among other things), doing so doesn't mean that its ""more legal.""  If you get caught doing so you could face legal ramifications, including the fact that even though its on a free site its probably copyrighted and not posted by permission of the people who made it, or that you clicked on a warning that said you have to be 18 to view it (or of legal age in your jurisdiction) and you did, even though by the letter of the law doing so is illegal in itself, because you are not but are attesting that you are.

She was likely not sent to jail just because of the prostitution either.  She was likely sent to jail because she was not meeting health requirements (she could have got a STD and then infected others following that partner) and I have a feeling she probably wasn't reporting any and all of the income from her johns as well.

If she did it in a Brothel, she would have STD testing requirements and her income would have been properly reported, which are things that are required in ""legal"" porn as well, and the income from making a porno would also be reported to the proper authorities for proper taxation.  The STD testing requirements would also include the fact that if she suddenly came back with one, the Brothel would do its best to contact all the partners that she was with between her last ""clean"" check and the one she had then to advise them to get tested.  Besides the fact the Brothel would likely require safe sex practices be used to avoid that happening in the first place.  She also wouldn't be allowed to continue having sex with clients till the STD was eradicated (if possible) and if not possible to eradicate, she wouldn't be doing that anymore.

Those things are supposed to happen with companies that produce porn as well, although not all of them obviously follow the practice, which would make them ""illegal"" also.

Both are legal within the letter of the law where the acts occur.  Both have ramifications for stepping outside those boundaries.

So as you can see to get the angle you take the inverse tangent of the imaginary part over the real part. This has many useful applications. For instance in electrical engineering they are used to keep track of phases and used in circuit analysis.

The quaternion extends this idea. It is an complex number with three parts. This allows you to keep track of three rotations. So now you can imagine how this is used in the real world. You can keep track of three rotations and we live in a 3 dimensional world.

Familiar with frames of reference? Quaternions can rotate you between these frames of reference and are not subject to [gimbal lock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock) as can happen with using Euler angles to track rotations. You can turn a quaternion into a rotation matrix and a rotation matrix into a quaternion.

Octonions extend this concept into 8 dimensions. At the end of the day complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions all use a real part and imaginary numbers to keep track of angles. 1 angle, 3 angles, and 8 angles respectively. From that simple idea a lot of really complicated math is derived.

Some waves can't travel through solids, and some can't pass through liquids, so these shadow zones of seismic waves allow us to detect the solidity and radius of the core.

LIPCSB,"Vibrations travel differently through different media--generally, the more dense the material, the faster vibrations travel through it.  Furthermore, some vibrations can only travel through solids.  

So, by measuring the shaking of the earth produced by an earthquake, we can tell there's a great big ball of liquid in the middle.  

Now, how do we know what it's made of?  By looking at meteorites.  The prevailing model of planet formation is that a lot of space rocks piled up into a planet, so the Earth's average composition should match the average composition of an asteroid.  We know from the study of meteorites that that's silicate, iron, nickel, and other elements.  

In this model, the Earth was at some point molten (all the heat released by those impacts melted the rocks).  The heaviest elements (iron, nickel) would sink to the bottom, so that's what the liquid is made of.  However, we can also calculate the pressure at the center of the Earth because we know how gravity works and the mass of the Earth, and we know that, at a high enough pressure, iron and nickel become solid even at very high temperatures.  This pressure exists at the center of the Earth, so we know that the center has to be solid nickel-iron.   

So, by earthquake measurement, we know that the core of the Earth is liquid, but by physics, we know that, within that liquid, there's another ball of solid iron.  By study of meteorites, we know what the average composition of the Earth is.  By study of the earth's crust, we know that the lighter elements (silicon and oxygen) are much more prevalent at Earth's surface than they are in meteorites, so the heavy parts of the meteorites must have sunken to the bottom.  ",null,1,cdl9dd4,1rajct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
Lobin,"No, we've never seen it, but there's plenty of evidence lying around for scientists to interpret.

First, the structure. We know that Earth has a solid crust, which is the part we walk around on. We know it's solid because, well, we walk around on it!

The crust is underlain by a mantle geologists describe as ""plastic,"" by which they mean that it isn't quite solid and isn't quite liquid; it's sort of squishy and deformable like Play-Doh. We know the mantle isn't quite solid for a couple of reasons: first, convection cells within it are what move tectonic plates around--imagine some stiff lasagna noodles banging around at the surface of a pot of boiling water, and you'll get the idea; and second, certain places in the mantle generate magma. When magma cools, it crystallizes into minerals, and the minerals grow together into rock. Geologists can analyze the chemical constituents of those minerals and determine that their parent magma came from the mantle, because mantle rock is chemically very different from, say, granite and limestone.

Underlying the mantle is the liquid outer core. How do we know it's liquid? Very clever geophysicists who study the behavior of seismic waves from earthquakes and atomic bomb tests noticed something. Seismic waves come in a few flavors. They call one flavor S-waves, or shear waves. If you've ever been in an earthquake and felt yourself moving from side to side, then you've felt S-waves. Geophysicists looked at the way seismic waves travel around the globe, and noticed that S-waves stop at a certain point. S-waves can't travel through liquid, so their disappearance alerted the geophysicists to the presence of a large liquid body within the Earth.

At the very center is the solid inner core. We believe that the inner core has the same chemical composition as the liquid outer core, but because it's under so much pressure from all the stuff on top of it, it remains solid.

As to how we know the chemical composition of things: we learn what the crust and mantle are made of by chemically analyzing rocks. You first have to know that rocks are made of minerals, and minerals are made of elements (chemicals). Chemicals can only combine in certain ways and under specific conditions. Minerals, therefore, can only form under specific conditions. A mineral called [olivine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine), for example, is very common in rocks which originated in the mantle, because the pressure and temperature conditions there permit the elements iron, magnesium, silicon, and oxygen to combine into olivine.

We infer a lot about the core from studying meteorites. The early solar system was a mass of small particles. Most of them banged into each other and clumped together until they coalesced into the planets, but some of those particles are still out there, and they land on Earth. Those are meteorites, and they're like snapshots of the early solar system. They can tell us lots about the chemical composition of the early Earth. At some point in Earth's development, it underwent a process called magmatic differentiation: most of the planet was molten, and the elements making up that magma began to separate, with the densest elements sinking toward the center. We believe that the inner core is an iron-nickel alloy--iron and nickel are both quite dense--with trace amounts of other heavy elements like gold and platinum.",null,0,cdl9swp,1rajct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

Dolphins are placental mammals, meaning they develop a placenta that connects the blood supply of the mother to her developing offspring. It allows the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and wastes between the two via the umbilical cord. 

All placental mammals need to breathe air - even though dolphins look like fish, they have lungs instead of gills. Since they live underwater, dolphins and other marine mammals have the difficulty of getting their newborns to the surface of the water to breathe air as quickly as possible immediately after giving birth. The reason the calf was born ""fluke first"" is to maximize the amount of time the calf stays connected to that umbilical cord, receiving oxygen from its mother's blood. As soon as the calf is completely out, it makes the most sense to sever the umbilical cord immediately to give both the mother and calf the most freedom of movement so the mother can hold her newborn at the surface of the water. She can do this by making a tight turn in the water - the sudden change in direction provides enough force that the umbilical cord snaps.

In short, the umbilical cord *was* attached for all of the gestation and most of the delivery, but the mother snapped the cord as soon as the calf was free so that she could help her calf reach the surface.

If you are willing to pay a huge markup for a widget in the store, then chances are the store owner is willing to pay a high markup to the supplier, the supplier a huge markup for the distributor, the distributor a huge markup to the factory, and the factory a huge markup for skills, resources, and services.   So those price signals, end up dictating priorities in every facet of the economy.

In the big picture, the entire structure of the economy rotates around these price signals.   Money, time, skills, services, and resources, all start to build the structure of society around those price signals.   

Sometimes, (like say through the central bank printing up trillions of dollars worth of credit and loaning it into sub prime thorough freddie and fannie), those price signals get distorted.   That's why we had a massive housing bubble, and a massive dot.com bubble before that.   Unfortunately, the transition back to a normal society hurts people who vested and bet their lives on the distorted structure.  If you spent decades of your live improving your housing related skills, then when things go back to normal, it has the potential to totally fuck up your life.   It also has the potential to fuck up the financial institutions who bet the farm that things would go a certain way, when then didn't.   

However, once you distort things, there is not really a nice way to back out of it.  You can't print up more money and credit to solve a problem that was created by printed up money and credit to begin with.   All it will do is reward behavior that society doesn't need, and never allow the distortion to return back to normal.   

Today, the banks lent recklessly into sub prime, and recklessly over extended themselves.   Covering it up provides no social function, other than delaying the pain, and creating more distortions.   

In sum, yes, a lot of people will get hurt as unproductive credit goes into default and people without lots of backup are forced into bankruptcy.  The reset will likely hurt like hell for 18 months.

what Crazebe said is essentially what happened.  Banks chopped up bad debt and sold it at high yeild to other banks, who then chopped it up again and sold it to other banks, tying together many economies.  Then subsequent derivities were created to bet that the debt would NOT be paid (Credit Default Swaps).  Without bailing out the banks (and most prolifically AIG) there would be a massive loss to many many countries, companies, banks, pension funds, etc.  Not to mention the ridiculous inflation it would cause, and how pissed China would be due to the fact that America would have to default on it's debt (or devalue its currency causing hyperinflation).

You're correct in your assumption that eventually the economy would normalize... eventually, assuming there was no human element (most likely looting and mob mentality)

MrTuesdayNight,"I don't know what your masturbation habits have been.  But speaking as someone who went from masturbating about 25 times a week, down to about once a week - I think I understand now why those cultures and religions consider it a bad thing.

I grew up religious but only recently tried NoFap (/r/NoFap).  I didn't realize it, but masturbating every day was having an effect on me.  A negative one.  In particular, it had made me weak, slow, and painfully shy.  So I figure - if even a reasonable percentage of other people are wired like me - then what religion would want that for their people, particularly their youth?  

A lot of people find my kind of story here, and /r/NoFap in general, outrageous.  Like some kind of placebo cult.  So did I.  All I can say is - read /r/NoFap, or try it for a few days yourself.  Then make your own conclusions. 

For myself - now I know that abstaining from masturbation (indeed, all orgasms) for even a few days gives me a level of mental zeal at all times that I previously only knew very occasionally.  This zeal is, for lack of a better word, very compatible with religion and many aspects of what one might call an old-fashioned life.  It is incompatible with many aspects of our modern world.  I find it hard to explain.  

Of course, I can only speak for myself.  Obviously I can't speak for all the religious people throughout history.  All I'm saying is - it makes sense to me now.  Even those brutal Victorian punishments for masturbation, and the once-common belief that it can ruin a person's life - it all makes sense to me now.

No, but seriously, I grew up in a very religious family. I hated it every step of the way, it was forced on me, and when I finally told my parents how I felt about it all they damn near disowned me and still look at me as less of a person. 

My personal bias aside, maybe you shouldn't crank it all day every day. But maybe it's not bad to crank it every once in a while. Me, personally, I won't masturbate for a week, maybe two. I just don't want to. I get busy and it never crosses my mind, or I'm tired, or whatever. 

But every once in a while, maybe once or twice a month, on one of my off days I'll crank it throughout the day, maybe 10, 20 times in a day. Just to get it out of my system, ""clean out the pipes"" as it were. Sometimes I even break out the gigantic dildo and get freaky deaky in the shower for an hour or two. 

Is it bad? Well, sometimes I get chafed and I'm usually pretty exhausted afterwards. But I don't do it every day, or even most days. I just set aside a day or two out of the month to have an all-day fapathon. 

I really think the biggest reason the church isn't very fond of masturbation is because it's so much easier, and usually more gratifying, than sex. Or it becomes that way when you haven't had sex in a long time or haven't been in a relationship. Whoever circumsized me when I was a kid (Oh, hey, thanks for that one too religion - paragons of good and humanity, but only if you let us snip your dick when you're an infant) didn't do such a great job. Everything looks fine, and it's the right size and everything. But I have shit for sensitivity. Every time I have sex, even after not jackin' it for almost two weeks, it either takes me so long to get off that the girl gets exhausted, sore, or bored, or I can't get off at all. Even when I do crank it, it takes me almost 20 minutes to even get close. 

It's all just about controlling people. If you think it's bad to masturbate, then you'll seek out sex to sate that urge. Just go around knocking people up, since your sperm is so important you can't even spill it on the ground.

Mahvinthamahtian,"
The following have been my observations.  Results may vary.

Check /r/nofap for evidence or better explanations, there's a reason why that group is so large.

Self control is a factor, gaining control of your wants and desires furthers the self from instinctual urges and allows the mind to impress moderation or suppress addiction.  You'll hear of people say they have ""needs"" that need to be fulfilled. No they don't, they just lost control or don't want mental control.  Again, you can check /r/nofap , people get a sense of clarity and productivity when they train themselves to control their bodies.

Second is psychological, masturbation/porn teaches the brain to associate people with sex and in a sense de-humanizes them as something to ""get-off to"" also known as objectification.  Soon it becomes easier to see beautiful people and ignore them as humans in favor of lusting after their bodies.  This is why some call it evil.

Last is that it does not satisfy which equals bad.  Sure one feels ""satisfied"" after masturbating, but will soon find themselves with urges the minute they find a stimulus again.

Matthew 5:28 but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 

This means that to even look at a woman lustfully is sin. i.e. checking her out. Because this leads to craving more and more until one is having sex outside of marriage, which is wrong. Obviously masturbation and sexual desires are linked.

Ephesians 5:3 But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people

This is also to protect us from where sexual sin leads. Just go by r/NoFap and read some of the stories of marriges destroyed by one's desire to masturbate and look at pornography. Not to mention that sexual desire leads to actually having sex with other which, needless to say, often leads to STDs. 

Plus I think the first couple times anyone has masturbated they felt a measure of guilt, this is the conscience telling you that what you have done is wrong

Romans 2:15 in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them

God's word is written on our hearts, in other words, our conscience tells us right and wrong. After a while of repeated sin however, the conscience becomes seared and is no longer sensitive to certain types of sin.

1 Thessalonians 4:3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality.

In conclusion, does masturbation feel good? Yes, but only for a moment. It does not satisfy, you will continually want more and more. To have real joy and eternal happiness is to have a good relationship with God. Masturbation is clearly defined as sin throughout the Bible and should be avoided at all costs. And as a Christian, nothing brings more joy than fulfilling God's will.

Networking has several layers, the lowest of which is call the Physical Layer. It's concerned with how to get data across the cable, the air, the pigeon, whatever. Most, if not all, of the physical layer techniques to move data work on individual bits to convert them into electrical impulses of one kind or another. As you go up the network layers those bits get combined into bytes, frames, packets, etc, but at the layer that is most often measured (physical) it's all bits. 

Storage is a little different. There's no one standard that defines how to store bits on a disc, on a memory chip, on paper tape, etc. In networking terms, each storage vendor worries about their own physical layer. The standardized parts are the layers above that, where all of the data is accessed as bytes. Well, technically most/all drives return data in blocks, but block sizes aren't the same sizes across all drives, so the common measurable size is the byte. 

You could be pedantic and say that you can't ask a network interface for bits any more than you can a hard drive, and I used to be one of the tools making that point.

EDFDarkAngel1,"I was a broadband tech support supervisor for 7 years.

First off, you have the ISP (internet service provider), and they provide the signal via the cable network (aka. plant). That signal has a series of flags on it, two of the more well-known flags are DHCP (alternates your IP address based on a random protocol, and is network-based), and lease. 

One thing to realize is that, gateways aside, the modem (cable bridge) and the router are two separate objects that do different things. The modem is what talks to the network, and receives the information. The router takes that signal, encrypts it via NAT, and evenly distributes it through your network, either wired or wirelessly depending on your router. If you have an issue with your internet, and you reset your router, chances are that you are NOT going to fix your problem. This is why:

Your modem has an IP address provided by the network, known as an external (or public) address. If you have a router, the router will request that IP like a computer would. The router than takes it, and hides it behind its own security (NAT). It will then provide all connected devices with another IP address, known as internal address. This is typically what you see when your address says 192.168.0.1, or something similar depending on where your device is in your network.

When your router turns on for the first time, it will request the IP address from the modem. Although typically automatic, you can request the router to check with the modem periodically to make sure the IP address hasn't changed, but sometimes it doesn't work.

If your modem's lease expires but isn't provided a new IP address, if there was a software update that wasn't properly applied to the modem, or if the modem is having a fault due to improper signal level/packet loss, then the router may not get the updated information. Your computer will request information from the router, who then requests it from the modem. If the router and modem have conflicting information, the request is denied and you will get errors like ""ISP unavailble"" or ""internet connection not detected"" or ""webpage unavailable"".

Now, if the problem is on the modem's end, resetting the router will not fix anything as it will still have the most updated information that the modem can provide. Resetting the modem may fix that, or you may need to call your ISP so they can adjust the information being sent. 

However, if the problem is on the router's end (ie. the router isn't requesting updated information), then resetting the router will force it to do its initial startup check, of which includes requesting new information. If the problem is not solved with that, and the modem is indeed fine, you may need to perform a factory reset on your router to clear any potentially bad firmware updates, or glitches.",null,5,cdle85o,1rad4n,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10

silk-e-smooth,"The Earth's atmosphere contains carbon, as most of us know. The thing is, not all carbon atoms are the same. Some have more mass than others (i.e. Carbon 14, or simply C-14), but the majority is C-12. Living organisms are constantly eating, breathing, and interacting with the environment. Because of this, our bodies contain a set proportion of C-12 and C-14 (and others) that varies only slightly. However, when an organism dies it no longer can get new carbon atoms; it can only lose them. C-14 has a known half-life (the time it takes for the total to reduce by half), and because of this, the older an organism is, the less C-14 it will have. By measuring how much C-14 is in a dead organism, we can estimate how long ago it was alive.

Hypothetical example with arbitrary numbers (extremely simplified):
Say all living humans of have around 1g of C-14 in them at all times. We know that the half life of C-14 is 1 year. Now, we find a dead human in Antarctica. We measure the C-14 in their body and find 0.5g of C-14. Since we know the (hypothetical) half life of C-14, we can estimate that this person has been dead for 1 year. That's how it works.

Now please note once again that the above example is extremely simplified and rather uses the proportion of C-12:C-14, as we wouldn't really be able to just add up the mass of C-14 in an organism, but I think it gives you a good idea of how it works.

null,"So, there are two versions of the carbon atom. Both versions have 6 protons and 6 electrons, but one version has 6 neutrons (Carbon-12), and one version has 8(Carbon-14). Carbon-14 is unstable, and will convert itself back into Carbon-12. Carbon-14 is created by energetic waves from the sun interacting with atoms in the atmosphere. When something is alive, it will naturally have the same ratio of Carbon-12/14 as its environment, because it's constantly recycling carbon. However, once it dies, no new carbon comes in. This means that the carbon-14 atoms won't be replaced with new atoms, and thus over time the ratio of 12/14 grows higher and higher as the carbon 14 decays. Since carbon-14 has a known half-life (the time it takes for half of a substance to decay), we can use the ratio to mathematically determine the age of an object. The downsides are that it's expensive, only accurate to 100,000 years ago, and can only be used to determine the age of living things",null,1,cdl6idp,1raccx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

neither_party,"The answers thus far are not accurate.  I used to work in the gasoline business.  Here's how it works.  Gasoline is purchased on contracts and delivered at the local terminal.  For much of the US population, this terminal was fed by a gasoline pipeline from greater Houston.  When the gasoline is pulled at the terminal from the pipeline, it is a commodity.  Exxon going in, Hess coming out.  The gas is put into tanks where additives are added to differentiate brands from each other.


Gasoline is delivered to the various gas stations, sometimes up to 3 times per day based on volume.   Despite getting their gasoline from the same place, different companies do NOT pay the same price.  There are spot prices for those with no contracts and contracted pricing for the more sophisticated gas retailers.


The price at the pump is determined by what the other stations are charging, NOT the cost of the gasoline.  Large gasoline retailers (typically independents) sell gas below cost for most of the year and make all their profits in 3 or 4 months.  Competitive surveys are done multiple times per day by the gas stations, usually with managers coming on or off shift driving a pre-determined route and recording all prices.  Then the pricing strategy is applied.  Some companies want to match the lowest price, some want to best the lowest by one cent, etc.  Gas price changes are not instantaneous, but can happen multiple times per day.

Mc6arnagle,"Salt tends to reduce our perception of bitterness in foods.  By reducing the bitterness perception it actually increases our perception of not only the salt but the other flavors in the food that we can detect: sweet, sour, and umami (savory flavor).  This brings out 4 of our major 5 tastes while reducing one that is often undesirable.  Of course too much salt eventually overtakes those other flavors as well, so the amount of salt is very important.

sababababa,"Salt is sodium chloride. When saliva breaks down salt, it dissociates into Na+, which has a positive charge, and Cl-, which has a negative charge. The Na+ is the important one here! We'll get back to it in a minute.

Your taste buds operate using something called an action potential. These are found in neurons (brain cells) throughout your brain and spinal chord, but also in your taste receptors and other cells. I'll give you a brief rundown of how they work.

There's an electrical current running through these cells. The inside of the cells are kept at a constant -70mV. This charge can fluctuate up or down a little bit if positively or negative charged ions enter the cell. You might see where we're going with this. If the cell's polarity (another name for the charge, kinda), rises or falls a little bit, nothing really happens. But if the cell depolarizes enough (that is, if its charge is raised enough), it hits a point of no return. That point is -55mV. What happens next?

Well, once the point of no return is reached (a value also known as the threshold stimulus or simply, the threshold), we see what's called an a action potential. This is a sudden SPIKE in charge, making the cell reach upwards of +40mV! This causes a chain reaction where the charge travels to other cells close by. This electrical impulse travels through the body and eventually reaches the brain, where it gets interpreted as ""hey, I'm touching/smelling/tasting something!"" Cells return to their normal -70mV baseline after they fire an action potential, and after a brief refractory period they're ready to go again.

Food electrically stimulates taste cells, raising them to that critical level so they go nuts and blast your brain with messages. Remember how I talked about salt dissociating into Na+ and Cl-? Well, the Na+, being positively charged and all, effectively raises the baseline voltage on the receptors in your tongue! Instead of -70mV, they might be hovering closer to, say, -65 or -60mV. That means that they require less stimulation to reach that critical -55mV and fire signals to your brain!  Foods taste richer and more flavorful because your taste buds are primed and ready to fire at the drop of a hat.

Salt does indeed have it's own flavor, but to say it ""brings out the flavor of food"" is also accurate in my opinion, cause that's exactly what it's doing! As someone else mentioned, try putting a pinch of salt into sweet foods. Salted caramel ice cream? game over dawg

edit: you might be wondering why the Cl-'s negative charge doesn't just negate the Na+'s positive charge. The  answer is that the resting potential (that -70mV we were talking about) is regulated by the concentration of Na+ and K+, or potassium, inside and outside the cell. Cl- does come in to play, but a little later!

JohnSmith1800,"&gt;Is it just a method of searching for life based on what we already know

Pretty much. Our understanding of the development of life on Earth is that it required the presence of liquid water (and some other relatively common trace elements). Although forms of life exist which live outside of environments with liquid water, they all originated from the first cell. They are also almost exclusively small and boring (and their cell is still water filled).

Given that we don't know of any other way life could start, we discount planets which orbit either too far or too close to their host star for liquid water to exist on their surface. We also focus on rocky planets, although a gas giant in the ""habitable zone"" would almost certainly have some rocky moons which might have water. There is a growing number of candidate planets which are in, or on the edge of, the habitable zone. With a suitable greenhouse effect, there could well be liquid water on some of them (the habitable zone is therefore a somewhat fluid term).

There's no reason that life couldn't originate elsewhere as you said, but we don't know what to look for so we don't make any assumptions/statements about planets out of the hospitable zone being capable of supporting life.",null,123,cdl7e56,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,601
prjindigo,"Basically we have a VERY good understanding of what chemical processes can generate energy for life to consume.  

There first must be some way to be able to generate a differential in energy.  

Next comes the chemical complexity necessary to support the development.

After that comes the external source and the replenishment of resource.


If an environment stops every form of any of these three, it is LITERALLY unable to support life - immaterial to the form of life in question.

Planets close enough to stars to cause metals like aluminum and copper to vaporize.

Planets too far enough away from heat that their temperature oscillates above and below the superconductive point.

Planets with thick atmospheres and massive gravity which impede energy transfer.  (these also tend to have insane amounts of radiation)

----------------------------------------------------------

On the other side of the argument we have exceptionally good ideas about what planets may harbor life.
While much of this is based on our ""Goldilocks Zone"" theories, there are several things necessary for bio-diversity.

A large moon or heavy tidal force that keeps the core molten and thus through vulcanism replenishes the surface minerals.

A complex atmosphere containing a wide range of gasses in mixture.

Both a day-night cycle AND some kind of mild yearly variance in weather due to tilt.  

A star with stable output.


So these second sets of conditions, when all met, will almost certainly result in development of some level of life on their planet.  Notice I didn't mention liquid water or weather that oscillates around a freezing point of a liquid!  These are NOT necessary.     The bacteria growing in the Chernobil reactor room don't appear to need liquid water at all and they're not exposed to a large variation in temperature!    They do however have a stable energy source, a complex atmosphere, replenishment of mineral resource and a daily/yearly weather variance.

dead_middle_finger,"prjindigo gives a great response. I agree with what he wrote.

One principle I did not see is much of it is due to the the inherent qualities of chemicals, for the actual ""being."" There are only so many chemicals that can be used. We are carbon based, because carbon is extremely extremely easy to create chemical bonds with other atoms. It would be very difficult to create a being with inert noble gases, like Argon, Neon. Those atoms do not combine with anything - their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be ""full"". So really, one needs to eliminate or assign a value to each *atom* relative to carbon. That way, one can get a ""standard"" probability or likelihood of combining to get life. 

Also,  carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. So ubiquity has something to do with what life forms can be made from. It would be difficult to create life with an extremely rare atom, just because of scarcity.

Hydrogen makes up 74% of the Milky Way Disk, and helium makes up 24%. This ratio is from the Big Bang. The rest of the Milky Way - 2% - is made of heavier atoms, which are generated from stellar nucleosynthesis, ie, we are all stardust, even other ""types"" of beings.

Then, you have to look at the relative abundance of atoms, and their combinatorial likelihoods. This has to do with what atom combines easily with another, *and* the relative abundance of each. And again, we are talking about 2% of the galaxy mass (non black matter).  For example, glycolaldehyde. It is a key ingredient for life. It helps to build Ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is thought to be the central molecule involved in the origin of life on Earth. Glycolaldehyde is a monosaccharide sugar, the basic unit of carbohydrates. It can react with the chemical propenal to form ribose, the building block of RNA. It would be nice if that shit were naturally occurring, right? Well, it is. It was spotted in a large star-forming area of space around 26,000 light-years from Earth in the less-chaotic outer regions of the Milky Way.   The finding, was made with the IRAM radio telescope in France, is published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Again, I am more concerned with the atomic level of life creation. All the other parts, like a planet being in a ""life supporting band"" is interesting. But ultimately, it depends on the atomic level - wether it can even happen with relative abundances and valances of atoms.

It would be interesting to find out how the energy would be generated. Here on earth, all beings, as far as I know, use the [Citric acid (Krebs) Cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Citric_acid_cycle_with_aconitate_2.svg) It is just atoms. For example, the citrate is C6H5O3−7.  Six Carbons, five Hydrogens, and seven Oxygen atoms. I bring this up, because bringing in energy, through some kind of energy source (food) is necessary if a being works and expends energy.

So the point is that there are actual physics limitations that determine what *actually* can happen, and the probability of it happening. So rather than creating a *theoretical model* of what is *possible* (habitable zone, presence of liquid water, etc) it is much better to create a 100% known information of what can happen, based on our actual knowledge of what *is.*

We are currently looking for these kinds of planets outside our solar system which lie in Safe (Habitable) zones. There are lists of [Habitable Planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potential_habitable_exoplanets) around the internet. These lists are continually growing (as well as the list of planets outside our solar system grows, in general).

Due to complexity of other elements, and the larger amount of carbon &amp; oxygen compared to these other more complex elements, we expect that life is most probable to be carbon, oxygen, and water based -- We assume that since it is the simplest, and most abundant choice that it is most likely to occur.

That aside, we can in fact see if a planet has an atmosphere. We have seen atmospheres before. Here is a bit of an explanation on that: [Link](http://astrobites.org/2012/11/11/detecting-exoplanet-atmospheres-from-the-ground/). 

It can be tricky to see it, but the easiest way in which we can detect an atmosphere on another planet is when a planet passes in front of it's own star. We see the outline of the planet, and with that, we also see the light coming from the star that passes through the atmosphere. 

Now, every gas has it's own signature it gives off when light passes through it, and by looking at this signature we can tell what gasses are present in the atmosphere. 

Oxygen is particularly unstable and reactive by itself. Over long periods of time, it will interact with other elements, changing both itself and them (think rust on metals, but this occurs with a lot of elements and compounds). By itself, in nature, Oxygen is so unstable that pure oxygen in the atmosphere of a planet is so unlikely that on a very large time scale it becomes impossible for an exoplanet's atmosphere to contain it.

Impossible unless you have a source of Oxygen renewal. Think of Earth. Animals use oxygen and make CO2. Plants, however, use CO2 and make oxygen. Without plants, we would run out of Oxygen in Earth's atmosphere.

For this reason if there is a significant amount of oxygen in the atmosphere of a planet outside of our solar system, it is a very good indication that there may be some form of life on that planet.

EDIT: However, keep in mind that a lot of these things *are* assumptions. They may be highly informed &amp; educated assumptions, but they are still just that. It is most likely that life will occur under similar conditions with similar chemical elements and compounds. This is not, however to say, that it must.

Let's say that I'm looking for an ice cube.  I go into your oven and search it.  No ice cubes. I test the temperature and the humidity.  I find it to be hot and dry.

At this point, I declare your oven to be ice cube free.

Then someone says ""But how do you know that the oven had no ice cubes, if you don't know what type of ice cube you're looking for?

...but I DID know.  I had a very specific definition for the words ""Ice cube"".  I wasn't looking for some hypothetical ice cube that was made out of something other than ice in cube form.

When we say ""life"", we have a strict definition.  We know what we mean when we say it.  There are billions of things we might find on planets that *aren't* our definition of life.  Let's say we found a sentient energy field.  Would it be ""life""?  Not necessarily.  Dandelions aren't sentient, but they're alive.  Sentience isn't a requirement for life.  When we say ""life"", we mean:

Movement
Reproduction
Respiration
Sensitivity
Growth
Excretion
Nutrition

An organism has to meet all those standards for it to be ""Life"", because that's how the word is defined.  You'll notice that ""thinks"" isn't anywhere on there, because it's not a requirement.

So, given the definition of the word ""Life"", it's very easy for us to tell if a planet can support it, much like I can tell if an oven can support ice cubs.

Sinstrite,"Saying it as simply as I know how, scientists base their facts and theory-craft, even state the possible and impossible based off of the current rules in the laws of physics.  If you break down life as we know it to the most simplistic form, you can see it needs certain things in order to live, such as different types of mass as an outside source of energy to break down, sunlight, water, etc.  

If you were to ask a scientist if there is life on Mars, they would most likely say that as long as certain variables were there such as the right chemicals in the atmosphere, traces of water in the ground, the things life evolved from here on Earth, then they would say it's possible.  

They only say that though based on the current science and how life is bound to exist or not based on the fundamental laws of physics.  If we found a life form on Jupiter that does not ingest any type of outside mass as a way to convert it to energy, then the question is asked ""how does the life form sustain itself?"" - Let's say that to sustain itself, it rises from increasing pockets in its body to create a gas and then when it's at the right height, it releases the gas and falls at a fast rate.  The friction of its body against the atmosphere around it may create a type of heat which the life form can convert into energy, most of which is probably used to create more rising gas, and other energy to sustain it's basic life functions.

Well, some type of life form along those lines, my science is very bad obviously.  

But to discover a life form that lives that way would introduce new possibilities, because it doesn't need water, or to ingest mass, or to take away from anything in order to live.  Instead it lives solely from heat created from friction.

TLDR;

Basically because we have our ""rules"" that allow or don't allow life to exist currently, life we can study, we have decided to explore new possibilities using those rules as a template.  Until we discover a life form that goes against those rules, we will never know what is and isn't possible outside of that realm, because we can't actually ""test"" anything and come to a conclusion without a test subject (life form).",null,0,cdld2no,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

A planet must have a substantial amount of at least several of the following elements: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, silicon, fluorine, chlorine, germanium, arsenic, selenium.

The following's an excerpt from Stephen Hawking's book The Grand Design that explains this in a bit more detail:

""Life ... depends on more complex elements [than, say, lithium or helium,  atoms whose nuclei contain two and three protons]. Carbon is the most important of these, the basis for all organic chemistry. Though one might imagine “living” organisms such as intelligent computers produced from other elements, such as silicon, it is doubtful that life could have spontaneously evolved in the absence of carbon. The reasons for that are technical but have to do with the unique manner in which
carbon bonds with other elements. Carbon dioxide, for example, is gaseous at room temperature, and biologically very useful. Since silicon is the element directly below carbon on the periodic table, it has similar chemical properties. However, silicon dioxide, quartz, is far more useful in a rock collection than in an organism’s lungs. Still, perhaps life-forms could evolve that feast on silicon and rhythmically twirl their tails in pools of liquid ammonia. Even that type of exotic life could not evolve from just the primordial elements, for those elements can form only two stable compounds, lithium hydride, which is a colorless crystalline solid, and hydrogen gas, neither of them a compound likely to reproduce or even to fall in love.""",null,0,cdlf1g2,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
Bparrett77,"Those planets and moons don't likely support life ""as we know it"". We know that all life on Earth has a few things in common such as it's all carbon based and requires water. There are other theories about silicon based life since silicon is so similar to carbon but those haven't been proven. So when astronomers look for planets that can support life it makes sense to look for planets that have features which could theoretically support Earth-like life. It doesn't have to be just like Earth though.

For example, Europa is covered in water ice but it's all cracked and the cracks change frequently. This indicates that the ice is a shell covering an ocean of liquid water underneath and Jupiter's gravity constantly flexes the shell, cracking it while the liquid water repairs it. It's possible that hydrothermal vents are supporting microbial life at the bottom of that ocean, just like at the bottom of Earth's oceans. So even though Europa isn't even close to being like Earth, it does (theoretically) have some Earth-like conditions.

Therefore, we can look at a pretty diverse set of planets and say ""those could possibly support Earth-like life"". But then we need to ask the next question. If Earth-like life exists on a planet, what evidence will it leave that we can examine from here? Well how about a substance like methane? Much of life on Earth produces methane gas. Even you. When you fart! So let's look at Titan. Titan has methane in the atmosphere. The methane itself doesn't ensure that life exists but we can watch for changes over time in total atmospheric methane (what is producing it?) and also look for areas where the methane is inexplicably thicker than surrounding areas (could that be a large bacterial colony or a huge herd of space cows?). So far we can only make observations like that within our own solar system though. Exoplanets (around other stars) are still too far and too dim compared to their host star to observe in any detail.

Anyway, there could totally be crazy forms of life that we have no clue about. But we have literally 10 billion-trillion (aka 10 sextillion, aka 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) stars to look at. Why not start with what we already know?

The team's new research show that the cells reproduce at a temperature of 121 degrees C. ""Under these conditions daughter cells appear within the original mother cells and the number of cells in the samples increases with length of exposure to 121 degrees C,"" they report. By contrast, the cells are inert at room temperature. The spores of some extremophiles can survive these kinds of temperatures and then reproduce at lower temperatures but nothing discovered to date on Earth behaves like this at these temperatures -an extraordinary claim that will need to be independently verified before it will be more broadly accepted.

Points against immigration:

* Many Americans are unemployed because immigrants are willing to do their jobs for less money. In some cases, this is true. In other cases, immigrants are often willing to do jobs that are so crappy that most Americans aren't willing to do them.

* Since immigrants aren't citizens, they don't pay taxes, but are still eligible to receive some government benefits. For example, it is illegal to deny a child a public education on the basis that he/she is an illegal immigrant.

* Much of the money that an immigrant earns is sent back to his/her home country, removing money from our economy and weakening it.

* Many who oppose illegal immigration will try to link it with crime, such as by bringing up stories of individual illegal immigrants who commit crimes like rape or murder, or trying to correlate the low income of illegal immigrants to the fact that most crime is committed by low-income individuals. In my opinion, the first type are really the exception and not the rule, most illegal immigrants are good people. I do believe that deportation should be a mandatory part of the sentence for illegal immigrants who commit felonies, though. As for the second part, it has been shown that low-income illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than US citizens in the same income bracket.

Points for immigration:

* The human aspect. Illegal immigrants are basically just trying to make better lives for themselves and their families. Sometimes you have situations where an illegal couple has children in the US, making them citizens, so to deport them would be to separate children from their parents.

* In many industries, employing illegal immigrants drives prices down. For example, when farms employ illegal immigrants, their labor cost goes down, and in turn the cost of groceries goes down for the rest of the country, making it easier for Americans to feed themselves.

* Many programs meant to curb illegal immigration have some fairly racist implications. For example there was the law passed in Arizona a few years back that police could stop motorists if they had reason to believe they were illegal immigrants, which, to an extent, was translated as ""being Hispanic is probable cause.""",null,1,cdl59x5,1ra5m2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7

Prox,"Whoa, here's one I can do!
  
 To make it as simple as possible, the human retina consists of two broad classifications of photo-receptive cell: rods and cones. The cones detect 'colour' light (or more accurately, detect three different ranges of wavelengths of light, and determine colour by comparison), whereas the rods are better at black-and white (due to not making colour comparisons).

 The rod cells are the focus here. Rod cells are wider than cones, and can capture a larger amount of information for each cell. Because of this, they are much better at motion than cone cells. In addition to this, cone cells are mostly in the centre of the retina, while rods are found towards the outside. This means that the centre of the eye is more adept at colour, while the peripheral detects more motion.

  This should give a good basis for why you can see motion better out of the peripheral, but doesn't quite explain why vision in the dark is better in the peripherals. To do this, we need to revisit the colour comparison idea I mentioned in the first paragraph.

  Since cone vision (centre of visual field) determines colour by comparison of three cone types, the peak response for each differs. Rods only have one wavelength range, which peaks right about the middle of the visual spectrum. Because of this, the visual range of three cone types is much larger than the range of one rod.

  If you've stuck with me so far, I can put it all back together now. Rods, which specialise in motion and are found in the peripheral of the visual field, detect light in 'black-and-white' (to put it crudely). Because of this (and a few interactions of photoreceptive proteins), they can adapt to the dark faster than cones. This means that while it is *mostly* in black and white, your vision in the dark is better with your rods than your cones, and being found in the peripheral of the visual field, your dark vision is hence better in your peripherals.

edit for more detail:  As top comment said, a huge reason this matters so much in medicine is to ensure a protected airway.  It is also a simple way to determine the severity of potential injury before we are able to get imaging.  Since I work exclusively in the hospital, and not in the field, we have access to CT scanners which are infinitely more informative than just asking questions.  I had a patient last week that was perseverating after a bike accident (asking the same questions over and over every 30 seconds) but since we already had a CT and MRI that said he had no traumatic head bleed, it was SUBSTANTIALLY less concerning.  If we have a patient that has a sudden dropoff in neuro status (GCS &gt;8) it's life-sustainingly important to protect their airway via endotracheal intubation or whatever means are necessary.  Airway, airway, airway!

save_our_bluths_,"Hi there. Surgical resident at a level 1 trauma center here. It's a little more complicated than explained below. Loss of consciousness (LOC) is part of almost every algorithm we use in assessing trauma patients, particularly those involved in blunt (car, motorcycle, etc.) trauma. Its far less important in penetrating truama (guns and knives), unless that trauma is directly to the head.
There is direct correlation between LOC and type and severity of head injury. Now, a finer point here is WHEN the loss of consciousness happened (immediately after the injury vs during resuscitation). Loss of consciousness during the transport to and while in the trauma bay is a different beast than immediate LOC during the incident. But as trauma surgeons, when we make the decision on whether or not to CT scan someone's head to look for injury, LOC is often very high on our list of reasons for doing so.
That being said, the below commenters who say that a conscious patient is more easily assessed than an unconscious one, amen. We can't assess neurological function in someone not moving anything...which often leads unconscious patients to getting more scans and invasive tests to try to answer questions that could otherwise be answered by simply asking the patient.

Damskibeat,"I'd like to add something here. Consciousness is not just important in terms of neurological injury, it's a measure of cerebral perfusion. If a trauma patient has lost blood, either internally or externally, the body's mechanisms for maintaining cerebral perfusion kick in (tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, reduction in blood flow to less vital organs such as the kidneys). We see these effects as shock which get progressively worse as the patient loses more intravascular volume (ie blood). When the patient begins to become confused, or unconscious, this is a sign that the body's mechanisms for compensating for the blood loss are no longer sufficient to maintain the brain's blood supply, and we need to do something about it!

So, keeping the patient talking isn't important for them as much as it's important for us to monitor: 1) their neurological status (from injury) and 2) their intravascular volume status.

When you buy a property 'Freehold', you are buying the house and the land underneath it

When you buy 'Leasehold' you are buying the house but only renting the land. This means you have to either pay 'ground rent' or have a long term lease on the land

A 999year lease is as good as buying it outright but just means the developers want to keep the land in their portfolio.

OldWolf2,"There are a few different sorts of legal ownership of land: freehold, leasehold, cross-lease (amongst others).

I believe that the London 999-year lease is **leasehold**,  although in my country anyway, all of the ownership types include a lease term.

(Rest of this post applies to New Zealand only, but our system is based on the British one, so some of it may also apply there).

**Freehold** (aka. fee simple) is defined as a 99-year lease from the Crown here, but it gets renewed to 99 years on sale (and I presume the owner has the right to renew it at any time).  It's done like this so that the country the land is in still has the right to charge you property tax, and apply the laws of the country, etc.  For most intents and purposes, you own the land absolutely.

**Cross-lease** is also popular here, it's where there is a single underlying freehold title, but two members agree to both share the freehold title, and also lease half of the property from the other person for 999 years (which is the closest the law allows to saying ""in perpetuity"".

Cross-leases are typically used when the land is too small to divide into two separate freehold titles (city councils have rules about that); or occasionally when an unscrupulous developer is too lazy to subdivide properly.

**Leasehold** is where one person owns the land freehold and then they lease the buildings out.  This is the worst type of ownership if you're the one buying the lease; because the leaseholder can change the terms of usage of the land, and also put up the rent. There was a case recently where some leasehold titles included a lease of $7000/yr for the land, and then they were renewed (this happens every 21 years) for a rent of $84,000.  So most people who owned houses on this leasehold land were immediately ruined , because they couldn't afford this rent and the re-sale value of the house was destroyed.

So except for a few rare circumstances, normal peons don't really ""OWN"" land, they rent it. Long term ( 999 year + ) leases are the only way for normal peons to 'own' land. Such leases usually allow transference to the leasers heirs or other assignees. But after 999 years, the land and all fixed improvements (houses, roads, etc) would revert to the original land owner or their assignees/heirs.

Also, in the UK, if you make improvements to the land, build a house, etc, then all fixed items become property of the landowner once the lease is up. You only retain movable assets, or chattel.

This is a leftover of the medieval feudalism.

This is why the US was such a big deal for early settlers. Here, lowly peons could own land free and clear, and turn it over to their heirs, or sell/trade it, without worrying if the lease would revert to some lord or master in 50 or 999 years.

jixig,"A computer virus is nothing magical, it's just a series of instructions like any computer program, but with malicious intent. It takes advantage of different features of your operating system to do things that you'd probably not like it doing. Keystrokes, for example, are readily available to be logged so that different programs can react to what you're typing, but a virus can turn that intent into tracking your passwords, bank accounts, etc..

Not sure how technical you want to get here, but when a computer program runs, the operating system will find its raw data on the hard drive and place its code into virtual memory (RAM) where it's quickly accessible. Then it looks up where the starting point/instruction is and lets it take off. That computer program can see its own code body, however, and make copies of itself if it wants to.

It can also seek out other programs/executables (and other file types in general) and use the operating system functionality to load THOSE into memory. But instead of executing them, they'll modify the contents, usually by adding the body of the virus into it somewhere. A common way to do this is to find gaps in the computer program caused by file alignments. To relate this to more understandable terms, let's pretend that a physical representation of a computer program can fit into one or more fixed-size shipping boxes. But it only needs 10% of a certain box to run. The virus can fill the other 90% of the space with its own code, and then make sure it gets executed.

How do they steal your information: The aforementioned keylogger, for one, is a common way. They can also present you with fake ""security patches"" that capture your information. They can see your file system, read any network communication, etc.. It will then try to communicate with another computer and transfer that information over to it. Or just record it somewhere on the computer for later.",null,0,cdl3e8r,1r9q9l,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

you can actually derive the schrödinger equation, probably the most important QM equation, from this single property of matter. 

the schrödinger equation is an energy equation, that can be used to derive the wave function of a specific system (e.g. the hydrogen atom). for example the atomic ""orbitals"" (our most current model of the electron distribution in atoms [and moelcules]) are solutions of the schrödinger equation of the hydrogen atom.

basically this single property, ""matter acts like a wave"", has very far reaching consequences for how matter on a subatomic/atomic scale acts. among other things this property explains, why the fusion rate within the sun is so high. just to put out there how far reaching the consequences here are, and in which context they can become important. its not always predictable, in whichfields which rules will become important.

But I'll give it a try.Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by a lack of empathy to some degree. The word is derived from auto, meaning self, implying the person is incapable of perceiving the world outsode of themselves to some degree. In the most mild forms of autism, including Asperger's, the person can often function normally and may even be a savant (extremely gifted in a specific area), but they have trouble reading social situations and conveying emotion. Imagine you are upset because your friend's carpet is too blue. To an average person this wouldn't even be a problem, or you might jokingly tell your friend you don't like his carpet. To someone with Asperger's, who doesn't understand sarcasm or tact, they might think its perfectly appropriate to begin screaming at the carpet for being too blue, or at their friend for having such a blue carpet, or at their parents for bringing them to a place with such a blue carpet. And they lack the skills to explain why blue carpets bother them, which makes it even more frustrating. Children with Asperger's are often easily distracted and have a hard time generalizing skills (I wrote with a pencil on a notepad and made words, so the only time I can ever write anything is with that pencil on that notepad.)More severe forms of autism essentially isolate the person from the world. They aren't aware that people around them are actual human beings that care about them. People are background objects, like trees in a park, and there is no value in paying attention to them. Children with severe autism have an extremely hard time learning, even when they aren't concurrently diagnosed with mental retardation (which they often are.) Their brains are essentially on autopilot, performing tasks without higher level comprehension as to why or how. They are alone but aren't even aware of what alone means.The good news is that the earlier a child is diagnosed, their outcome become exponentially more positive.

mikejonas,"A lot of television entertainment as we know it today was carried over from the live theater (also by way of radio), so in a sense, they were theatrical performances that happened to be recorded and broadcast.   So in the early days of sitcoms, that's kind of how they set things up--each episode would be a little play in front of an audience, who would obviously laugh and react to the action they watched in front of them.

The TV audience got used to this format over the decades, so even shows that didn't have a live audience (animated shows like the Flintstones, single-camera sitcoms like Bewitched) included an artificial laugh track.

And yeah, there is something sort of psychologically comforting about it, our instinctive itch to belong being scratched by laughing along with others, even if the others are on the other side of the screen.

I'm not one of those narrow-minded, cynical types who think that a laugh track is an indicator that the show is somehow cheesy or unsophisticated--many of television's most important and genuinely funniest sitcoms have had laugh tracks.  Also ridiculous is the assumption that single-camera, non-laugh-track shows are automatically superior--there've been plenty of stinkers over the years since they've come into fashion.

It's interesting that someone mentioned ""How I Met Your Mother's"" laugh track, because the show is actually a sort of ""hybrid"" in this sense--a stylistic choice by its creators, who wanted the feel of the old-fashioned multi-camera sitcoms but wanted to innovate on the format.  Unlike Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and other current ""laugh track"" sitcoms, who record their shows the old fashioned way by rehearsing through the week and then performing each episode live in front of a studio audience a couple of times (with the final product being edited together from the two recordings), HIMYM actually shoots like a single-camera TV show, without a live audience, shooting the scenes piecemeal and not necessarily in chronological order, and doing as many takes as they feel comfortable with.  They do have the cameras and stage set up so that it has the ""look"" of a traditional sitcom, but it's put together differently.  That allows HIMYM to be paced faster than your average multi-camera sitcom (a HIMYM episode has about three times as many scenes as a Two and a Half Men episode), and allows for a lot of humor ""in the edit"" via quick flashbacks and cutaways.   Because of this and the fact that the laugh track is more subtle (you don't hear the audience cheer and whoop it up whenever a beloved character shows up for the first time in the episode), some people don't actually notice that there's a laugh track until they discover it much later.

On youtube there is a group of channels of ASMR channels that specialize in making videos with sounds that trigger that response. Some of the more common ones are simulated whispering in your ear, scratching, tapping or rubbing noises, which are heightened by the use of directional/binaural audio, which means if you wear headphones the sound will seem to be coming from a certain position, which increases the sensation.

There's also often roleplays or reaffirming dialogues which are used to relax the listener and even encourage falling asleep.

House came a few years later. It was the first form of electronic dance music to become mainstream. It kind of takes up the mantle of disco music, but with more computerisation -- it's got a disco feel, and disco aesthetics/vibes a lot of the time, but has a steady drum machine where disco usually had physical drums, really heavy and prominent synthesised bass, and felt more 'robotic' and rhythmic and less 'funky'. House artists might take bits of old disco songs and reuse portions of them in more electronic ways, especially French house artists [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUC2b-OSZ00&amp;t=1m25s), which you've probably heard. 

Techno came out shortly after that. It is much more rigid, with common structures and very steady clear beats.

Walmart has its silly points (like the ""cheer"" they do before shifts) but is very, very good at product distribution (they knew to the dollar how much sales had changed from the year before for every department and orders were designed to cover 1-2 days sales (and they regularly did) and this was long before the internet made that common in business.  Even at our relatively good store, employee turnover was 100% (we had 300 employees and in a year 300 employees would leave and 300 new employees would be hired)!  

During the time there, I learned something, retail employees blow off steam by complaining.  At first I thought it was Wal-mart, but having later made friends with much better paid retail employees they did the same thing on breaks.  

No one ever asked us to work off the clock (when I'd first started my only experience was farm work which doesn't take breaks, ever) and I got in trouble for not taking my 15 minute breaks as scheduled, it would have been a firing offense in our store for a manager to ask you to work off the clock.  

Even then we weren't ever scheduled to work close to 40 hours, most weeks I was scheduled for 35-38 hours, not getting done within 39 hours would have been an issue.  This was fine with me (I was a student at the time), but may not have been ideal for non-student employees.  

Costco pays far more, but they can afford to be picky (hiring only the best employees after training by other retailers) and don't have turnover.  There wouldn't be room for everyone to follow Costco's strategy.  

TL; DR: Wal-mart is like most entry level jobs, but as America's largest retailer they have more stores and more chance for a shitty manager to become a headline, they're excellent at distribution but tend to be relatively bad at high touch service (partly because they've found that their customers won't pay for it--which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy).  

Edit: Clarified employee turnover and fixed a capitalization.  Also, I'm happy to answer questions and rarely shop in the local Wal-marts near me because they're pretty terrible (I told someone about a spill knowing it was f'ing drop everything to fix this only to have the employee either not understand me or totally ignore me), stores were filthy and checkers are very slow.  Outside of this area, I'm pretty agnostic about where I shop.   Big shops, local stores each have advantages and I aim for places that offer a good value (which doesn't mean lowest prices).

Mephysteaux,"I work in retail at a union store. I started watching the documentary *WalMart: The High Cost of Low Prices*, but around the time they talked about unionizing WalMart, I had to turn it off. I couldn't take it seriously anymore. I'd say the majority of the complaints workers had about working at Walmart are things that I've dealth with on a fairly regular basis. They expected that, if they unionized, UFCW would come and solve all their problems. While UFCW does some good things, there are some areas where, in my experience, they're completely and utterly useless. But here's what I've seen, anyway:

* Wages: Union stores seem to have a slightly better wage structure than WalMart. We start out slightly above minimum wage, but after union dues your take home is actually less than that of a minimum wage worker. The one guy in the documentary said it took him 2 years to get a $1/hr raise, whereas in my union it only takes a year. As a side note, I have 2 friends who used to work overnights at WalMart, whose starting wages were more than I'm making now after 3 years.

* Working off the clock: There seemed to be two sides to this one. One was that managers told employees to work off the clock, the other was that employees were put under so much pressure to perform that they worked off the clock on their own volition to keep up. I have no idea how prevalent this is, but in any case it is illegal, and you can report your employer for making you work off the clock.

* Funny that /u/Ipooponpee mentioned pharmaceuticals. Today my shop steward was telling me that the union had just changed its policy, and under our prescriptions coverage you now had to buy from a pharmacy at one of our union's stores.

* Keeping employees' hours low so they wouldn't have to pay full time benefits/overtime: This is true, my friends who worked at Walmart said that anyone who worked too much got pulled aside and talked to. But, it's fairly similar at my store. I'm part time, but was regularly working 40 hours a week. According to our contract, if you average 40 hours a week for 3 or 6 months, I forget which, the store had to offer you full time benefits.

A few specifics: Walmart doesn't pay a living wage to its average workers. Their typical employees tend to require assistance from various public programs (food stamps, welfare, Medicaid, etc.) and the average cost of these services is of order $900k per year per superstore opened, amounting, in effect, to a taxpayer subsidy for the Walton family. In locations where the local minimum wage is higher than the national minimum, they build their stores just outside city limits, often violating building ordinances and environmental laws.

Hexadecimal_String,"A turbocharger is two turbines joined by a shaft. One turbine is in the engine's exhaust system, and is turned by the exhaust gasses. The other turbine is in the intake system, and turns because it's hooked up to the first one. It pushes more air into the intake system.

Because fuel only burns well when it's mixed in a fairly narrow range of ratios with air, adding more air means you have to add more fuel. Using more fuel, and enough air to let it burn well, makes more power.

It's hard to compare all 4-cylinder, turbocharged engines with all 6-cylinder, normally aspirated engines, but in general, a turbocharged engine will make more power than a similar, normally-aspirated engine. A turbo 4 can make more power than a 6, or even an 8, if it's built for it. There are, for example, 4-cylinder Subarus with highly-tuned engines, that can make 900 HP, which is a lot more than a stock V8 from a normal Mustang.

A turbo 4 in a normal car can get about the same fuel economy as a normally-aspirated 4-cyl when not driven hard, but can also give power like a V6 when asked. It's also heavier, and can require more maintenance, than a normally-aspirated 4.",null,0,cdkxhhv,1r9f80,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8

Ev_antics,"depending how big of a lake you speak of they may freeze. It is rare that deep lakes freeze all the way down as their is still a current running beneath the ice on the top.

SwedishBoatlover,"The reason lakes and oceans normally don't freeze all the way to the bottom is that water has a very special property: it's highest density is at 4 degrees Celsius (39.4 degrees F), while it freezes at 0 degrees C (32 degrees F). Hence, the temperature on the bottom of a lake is 4 degrees Celsius if it's cold outside (for deep lakes, it's usually 4 degrees at the bottom all year round). 

So, if you we're to weigh your bottle down, or use a glass bottle, it wouldn't freeze since the water surrounding the bottle would be above freezing temperature. If, however, the bottle were to float up against the ice, it would most likely freeze into the ice as the ice gets thicker. And then the water in the bottle would also freeze.

DiogenesKuon,"There were two major issues involved that are both highly controversial.  The first was possibility that the attack was based mostly on racial profiling.  Zimmerman followed Martin because he said he looked suspicious, but at the time he was simply walking back home and not engaged in any criminal activity.  This lead people to suggest that Zimmerman was following Martin simply because he was a young black kid, and for no other reason.

The second issue surrounded Florida's Stand Your Ground rules (which end up not being the defense that Zimmerman used at trial).  Prior to Stand Your Ground laws being enacted the person with superior firepower has a duty to retreat.  Basically, because the firearm can give you the ability to safely disengage without confrontation, you have a duty to do so, and if you refuse and then use your firearm you are not doing so in self defense anymore.  Stand Your Ground laws remove the duty of retreat.

The combination of these things led both to people in the black community (especially) and people on both sides of the gun control debate, to engage in a lot of debate concerning the facts of the matter, as well as the potential guilt or innocent of Zimmerman.",null,1,cdkw2ck,1r9b40,explainlikeimfive,top_week,13

Sibbour,"*I'm not sure exactly how he did it, but when the ""nuclear option"" was discussed before, here's an example about how it can be done:*

In general, changes to the rules can be filibustered, and a 67-vote threshold is required to cut off debate on any such change. But a ruling from the presiding officer of the Senate on the rules can be affirmed or overturned by a majority vote.

***A likely scenario:*** Reid invokes cloture on a nomination. If Republicans object, Reid raises a point of order and asks the presiding officer for a ruling from the chair on how many votes are needed to confirm an executive branch nominee. The presiding officer turns to the parliamentarian and ask for a ruling. The parliamentarian responds that according to precedent, 60 votes are required. The presiding officer then declares filibusters on executive branch nominees invalid, followed by a vote requiring 51 votes to uphold the ruling.

....now, that's an example of a possible route, and it has its own issues like whether the presiding officer can make that decision, and what point of order needs to be raised. Oh, and Presiding Officer being the President Pro Tempore (usually the most senior Senator of the party in power) or the Vice President

Hiddencamper,"A combination of reasons. 

First, the longer it is, the more you can spread the heat out. A bwr fuel rod can only handle a maximum of about 14 kw/ft. This means the longer the rod, the more heat I can get out of it. Typical rods for bwrs are 12 feet. 

Second reason, having longer rods means I need less diameter for my reactor boiler vessel. Diameter is a huge part of the driving cost, and it is much more efficient to have taller rods than a wider vessel. 

Third reason, more fuel in one space. A goal of nuclear plants is to get you 2 years of continuous full power operation, so the ability to load more fuel extends your cycle length. 

Fourth reason, the length of the rod means the water will be about 17% boiled by the time it exits the reactor. This percentage is high enough to be meaningful. If I used shorter rods, I would have to develop materials which could handle greater than 14 kW/ft to get enough steam generation. 

The size doesn't increase the risk. If anything size helps, because it gives you more surface area to transfer heat. As for radiological danger, this is a function of how much power you produce, not size. If I have a very small core that releases 40000gwd of power and a large core that releases the same, they will be equally dangerous in terms of how much radioactive material they have.

danceycat,"Psychological disorders are defined by people in the DSM.  I don't know exactly how it works or the details, but a group of people decide what changes to be added to the latest editions of the DSM every now and then.  Should X be a disorder? What category should it be under (e.g. mood disorders)? How many of which symptoms does one need to have in order to be diagnosed?  How long must these symptoms have been present? And so on.  They look at the latest research (and I'm sure that of course, as with most things, somehow there are politics involved).

Disorders are pretty much defined and diagnosed by symptoms in an effort to treat and study them.  Homosexuality could be a psychological disorder, if the people who updated the DSM chose to define it as such (though probably many people would disagree with it, but the DSM is what determines whether or not certain symptoms are a disorder).  However, things are labeled as disorders so they can be treated, not because there is something in the brain that is different than the majority of people.  If homosexuality were labeled a disorder, the implications would be that it would be treated.  Though this used to be the case (and homosexuality was indeed in the DSM), it isn't any more (at least in western society as a whole today).

corpuscle634,"Cars use torque to propel themselves, whereas boats use thrust. You can't really use mechanical advantage to increase thrust, whereas you can use it for torque. That's why cars have gears.

In simpler terms, the distance a car travels depends on how much its wheels spin. If your wheel has a circumference of 4 feet, you move forwards 4 feet every time your wheel spins. If it's harder to move that 4 feet because you don't have momentum, you want to put more work into pushing on the wheel, rather than just trying to get it to spin as fast as possible. To do that, you use a lower gear. Conversely, if you're already moving, you want the wheels to spin as fast as possible but don't need to push on them very hard, so you use a higher gear.

For a boat, the amount of distance it travels doesn't depend *directly* on how fast the propeller is spinning. If you don't have any momentum and you want to go, you want to push as much water backwards as you can, ie spin the propeller as fast as possible. If you have lots of momentum and want to go faster, you want to push as much water backwards as you can. It's the same thing.

There's never any advantage to spinning a propeller slower while still having the engine revved high, so there's no need for a lower gear.

Greenjourney,"Ex-teacher here.

The idea was that if we could all agree on what kids needed to know at what ages, and make sure we taught those things, we'd have a (hopefully fairly high) standardized level of education that allowed our kids to be competitive. (And our teachers could be evaluated by definite benchmarks, reducing incompetency.)

The Common Core Standards were created because: 

A) The public wanted to hold teachers accountable to some kind of standard. The thinking was, ""Since teachers pretty much make up their own curriculum (teaching plan for the year), how can we judge whether they are challenging kids and themselves, or just sitting back and handing out easy As?""

B) American kids were performing worse than kids in many other countries on standardized tests.

 C) Since every state had a different curriculum, not all Americans were getting the same level of education.

The idea was controversial for several reasons:

a) Not everyone agrees that ""teaching to the test"" is the best kind of education. There may already too much emphasis on standardized testing. While other countries do often do better on tests, other countries also place much more value on rote memorization than we do. And while Common Core Standards don't necessarily = standardized testing, it's often what happens.

b) In some cases, the Common Core Standards were *lower* standards than the curriculum standards that some teachers/schools already had in place. Therefore, re-making the curriculum to those lower standards was actually ""dumbing down"" kids.

c) Common Core Standards don't leave much room for states' preferences... such as Texas's determination to mention evolution as little as possible, or California's emphasis on the arts and ecology.

d) Some teachers didn't like being told exactly what to teach.

In my personal experience, the Common Core Standards are a good guide. Having had no real central curriculum planning at my school, and having inherited a lot of wacky lesson plans from my predecessor, the CCS were nice to have. I also liked the idea that teachers would be judged on actual results, because many senior teachers in my school were being kept around simply because they had tenure. Some of them were great, but some of them were just terrible, and taught outright false information. Having said those things, I am not a huge fan of the ""standardized testing mentality."" I believe school should be a place to explore ideas that you can't reduce to multiple choice questions and short essays.

as far as English goes, they're tailoring the lessons to writing that is relevant in the workplace and school. they're tailoring reading to skills, not texts. so people are upset because we're no longer reading the full grapes of wrath, for example. it's a classic, blahblahblah, but now we are challenging that, asking but what's the point of teaching it? 

the common core is going to give America a chance to compare our stats with the rest of the world. we, as a nation, will have the same education across the country. with that being said though, some states are now rushing to fill the gaps between their low standards and the now higher ones. and it's hard to give a higher level student (high school, particularly) a test on these standards yet because they haven't been in the common core system for their whole education.

Windows is a gigantic collection of libraries and images (backgrounds, icons etc.) and mass of services that do various things - talk to all of your pieces of hardware, your network, libraries talking to libraries etc.  

All of those things take time.  Unfortunately hard drive speeds (conventional hard drives), of the magnetic platter variety, have not really increased in speeds in about a decade.  Capacity yes.  But unfortunately the platters spin about as fast as they possibly can so... you're stuck around 70MB/s on a drive for most regular consumer drives.  

Solid state drives are about 8x more expensive per capacity than conventional hard drives, on the cheap end, and about 30x more on the high end, but they run at 500-600 MB/s (the new ones anyway), assuming you have a motherboard and CPU that can run them at full speeds.  

So while hard drives got bigger, and software (movies, libraries, windows etc.) all got bigger, hard drives stayed slow.  The technology used for something like 15 years to actually start up your computer - BIOS is slow as molasses and always has been.  There are faster replacements (UEFI), and new Windows 8 machines and Macs have supported it for a while, but what people found with UEFI was that it was so fast you couldn't actually get into any of the settings easily - which is a problem - so they have to actually slow it down to give you long enough to 'press delete to enter setup' sort of thing.  

So if you want to spend a bunch of money on a new computer and you get a solid state drive windows will boot very quickly, but that costs money, and a solid state drive that's 128 gigs for example doesn't leave a lot of space for programs or data, so you still need a regular hard drive anyway, unless you're rich.  

Also, if you only reboot rarely windows could be running installer related things regularly (or if you've got an update that didn't install properly) and that will slow things down a lot.  Usually it pops up with screen telling you the update progress or windows will tell you and update failed once it starts.  

Oh and all those programs set to run on startup (adobe reader, steam, one note, your printer etc.) all that has to be loaded at least partially as well.  So the more stuff you have loading at startup the longer it takes.

afcagroo,"When a CPU reads an instruction, it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer. It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips ""Give me the information at this address"". It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus - high voltage means 1, low voltage means 0. The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion. It toggles some control pins to say ""Here ya go"" and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the 1s and 0s corresponding to that binary data. The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory.  (This description is actually vastly simplified, but hopefully gets the idea across.)   
  
Similarly, the CPU (or other devices) can move data/instructions from the HDD into DRAM, or to/from network interface chips, etc.  One thing asks for data stored in a particular set of locations, the other thing says ""OK, here it is"" and sends it, and the first thing (sometimes) says ""Thanks, got it!"".   Or, something says ""I'm going to send you some information to store/work on"" and a similar handshaking goes on.  
  
All of this communication is built up in layers.  The lowest layer that I described above, where voltages change to represent something, is called Layer 1, the physical layer.  Higher layers define the *protocol* for decoding that information and deciding what it means and how to use it.    
  
These generic layers are described in the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).

Processors tend to have their own proprietary or semi-proprietary bus protocols for some things; this has been a recurring issue for companies like AMD who are trying to compete with the 500 pound gorilla in PCs, Intel.

Oh Everquest had a level cap of 50, but you have a level cap of 60, that must mean your game has more in it.... right... bullshit.  But that's marketing for you.  

The second problem is pacing, and keeping enough rewards that people feel like they're achieving something as they play.  This also means you need to give the player something at each level.  D&amp;D had a 20 level system at once point, but each level gave you a lot of stuff.  That makes sense in Pen and paper where calculating leveling up is a relative inconvenient process.  But in a computer system leveling up is easy, so you can do the same thing, just.... break it up into 60 parts rather than 20.   60 happens to be a convenient number for some developers to work with maybe that equates to 10 active abilities, 30 talent points and 20 passive abilities (bonus health!), but the idea is to break up the process into small chunks player can understand, and where they can appreciate what they are working for and what they're getting at each step, and that it takes a reasonable amount of time between steps.

[According to the Federal Reserve, 96.7% of the US money supply in circulation is in the form of Federal Reserve Notes, or cash](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12773.htm)

What you described in the second part of your question is a run on a bank, and was part of what caused the collapse of the financial industry at the start of the Great Depression.  When you deposit money into a bank, it isn't staying in some underground vault, the bank turns around and lends it to businesses (start up loans) or people (car loans, mortgages, etc.). A bank will keep a certain percentage of cash ""on hand"" (kept in a vault at local branches) for when people want to make withdrawals.  This number varies from bank to bank, but usually varies between 4% and 10% and is called a capital requirement.  If too many people try to withdraw money at the same time, the amount requested exceeds the amount of cash on hand and the bank would be unable to honor the requests, forcing a bank to either borrow money or shut down.  

At the end of the 1920s, around the start of the Great Depression, most people entrusted banks with their life savings, as we do today. When the stock market crashed and people ran the banks, many banks were not able to borrow enough money to honor all of the withdrawal requests and were forced to shut down.  When this happened, many people's life savings suddenly disappeared, causing more people to run the banks, continuing the cycle.  The FDIC was started in 1933 to stop this cycle.  What the FDIC does is insures the deposits made into FDIC member institutions (banks) up to a certain amount of money, meaning that if a bank declared bankruptcy, the federal government will write you a check for the amount of money in your account, so your money is never lost.  When the FDIC was created, the Federal Government would only insure an account up to $5,000, meaning that if your bank collapsed and you had $20,000 held in an account there, you would lose everything but the $5,000 insured by the FDIC.  Since its inception, the insured amount has increased 7 times, most recently in 2008 to $250,000.

This Federally owned corp. insures each and every bank account in the United States up to a quarter of a million dollars.

unitedireland,"That is called a ""**bank run**"": a bank run occurs when a large number of bank customers withdraw their deposits because they believe the bank might fail. As more people withdraw their deposits, the likelihood of default increases, and this encourages further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it faces bankruptcy.
If it happens in all the country, to all or most banks, the entire country risks default, like happened in Argentina in 2001.
The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long economic recession, as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down. Much of the Great Depression's economic damage was caused directly by bank runs

Funny thing is, you get that sort of alignment EVERY YEAR. And the other thing is an alignment is simply a matter of drawing a straight line between a series of points along a plane. So what line do you want to draw between what points?

As others have said, the planets don't rotate on the same plane, the models we learned in school of planetary oribts are just that: models. They don't have to be all that correct to make their point: they're certainly not to scale, in size or distance, nor do they accuratelly illustrate the very not circular orbit of the planets, which are in fact roughly elliptical and can vary depending on tugs of gravity here or there. They exist to teach children the names and order of the major solar bodies.

""If the planet was just 10' out of it's normal orbit, the Earth would be too hot to live!"" Makes climbing a ladder extremely dangerous... Truth be told, the distance to the sun varies by several hundred miles depending on where we are in our orbit.

The mystics are selling their bullshit based on a childly simplistic grade school [orrery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery). And depending on how you draw your lines, we're aligned with all sorts of shit. Just take your pick: draw a line until you run into enough stuff. Where would you like to stop?

Another interesting point is the light we see from the stars, if you'd like to consider star alignments, is millions of years old. The stars haven't been in that position for millions of years!

He's on point with the explanation of the process, that is, the crushing of rocks with high pressure fluids, but the main ""neat"" thing about hydraulic fracturing (fracking) is that you can drill horizontally as well as vertically. In regions with large shale deposits, that have lots of little pockets of gas, as opposed to great big deposits of gas, a single well head can recover gas from thousands of feet around, as well as under, it.  
The controversy is that the fluids used are both proprietary and really, really nasty. It's not water, it's a fierce chemical cocktail mixed with sand that's blasted at super-high pressure into the rocks around a well head. The goop also comes back up. Where it sits in big stinky ponds and evaporates. I've ridden a 4-wheeler by a fluid pond on several occasions, and wish I'd brought a respirator.  
The region where I live has *lots* of well heads, and lots of fracking. Some folks, who rely on well water, have discovered noticeable quantities of both fracking fluid as well as natural gas in their water. There are so many little pockets of shale with gas in them that the department of energy blew up a nuclear bomb in the 60's in an attempt to recover the gas. This was called [Project Rulison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Rulison). If you look at the location of the nuke from '69, 39.405345,-107.948433, and zoom in a bit, you'll see tons of well heads (all the little light patches are fracking well heads).

FactualPedanticReply,"HVAC design engineer here! This is literally my job. (HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning)

First, let's talk about ""feeling"" cold. Most people with a basic understanding of mammals know that we're pretty good at keeping ourselves at the same temperature most of the time. If you're in a snowstorm or if you're in the sahara, we know that your core temperature should be right around 98°F (37°C), and, if it's not, you have a very serious health problem. Moreover, if you step outside into the cold from a comfortable room, you feel cold right away; there's no waiting for your extremities to equalize temperature with your surroundings or some nonsense. You can see then, I hope, that your skin's temperature sensors aren't detecting *temperature* so much as they are detecting *the rate at which you're gaining or losing heat* (which is a kind of energy).

The odds are pretty good that the difference in your perception here comes from the difference in your general metabolic activity level. I'm assuming that, when you're home, you're relatively sedentary, and, when you're outside, you are relatively active. The human body generates and emits almost half again as much heat when it's doing light office work at a desk than when it's sitting motionless in a movie theater, and 3 to 4 times as much when it's highly physically active. Just standing and walking around release twice as much heat as quietly sitting still. Also, the odds are good you put on a little more clothing when you go outside, which makes you both more insulated and more draft-tolerant. 

It's not the humidity. Other people in this thread are quite right when they say higher humidities feel warmer, but you can't really fit that much water into 60 degree air. 

Warm air can hold a lottttttt of water, and more water in hot air makes that heat more oppressive-feeling because your sweating is less effective. The rate at which sweat evaporates off you to cool you down goes up when the air is drier and goes down when the air is wetter. (because there's already water there!)

The study of air/water vapor mixtures is called ""psychrometry,"" and this is a [psychrometric chart.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/PsychrometricChart.SeaLevel.SI.svg) It tells us loads of stuff. Along the bottom are what engineers call ""dry bulb"" temperatures. These are the temperatures you would read of a thermometer hanging on your wall, plain and simple. along the right-hand side is the moisture content of the air, in units of water mass per air mass. The topmost curve of the chart represents the upper limit on how much water you can fit in that air. For example, judging by this chart, you can get around 0.020 gm of water evaporated into 1 gm of 25°C dry air. If you try and squeeze any more water into that air, it will fall out as precipitation or condensation - it just won't stay gas. 

Now look at the *enthalpy* lines. For the purposes of this discussion, you can think of ""enthalpy"" as a generic way of measuring the total amount of different kinds of energies going on with the substance in question. Look at how many black enthalpy lines cross the vertical green 30°C line compared to the number that cross the 15°C line. There is a much wider variety of amounts of energy that 30°C air can have going on compared to 15°C air. It happens that 15°C is around the 60°F that this question is about (while 30°C is 86°F), so you can see that the amount of humidity in the air matters less at lower temperatures when you're trying to figure out how much general ""energy"" the air has going on.",null,64,cdkq1bj,1r8d24,explainlikeimfive,top_week,342

 The air temperature isn't a very good measurement of comfort; a better indicator is the mean radiant temperature ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_radiant_temperature), which is best measured with a black-globe thermometer. 
""What we experience and feel relating to thermal comfort in a building is related to the influence of both the air temperature and the temperature of surfaces in that space.""

All the visible surfaces are exchanging heat, with you and with one another; the rate of heat transfer depends on their temperatures.

  You can get black bulb temperature sensors for the control of heating or cooling systems. I have only ever seen them used on commercial systems. 

  So when I started up a new heating system in winter, the thermostat said I was comfortable since it was 70 degF (21 degC); it lied. It felt icy because the walls, floors and ceilings  were cold and I was losing a lot of heat to them through radiation. It took several days before 70 degF felt comfortable.

  Similarly underfloor heating (UFH) can create a feeling of comfort at a lower air temperature than radiators or warm air heating systems. The heated floor surface is a large radiant body from which you absorb warmth by radiation.",null,1,cdkock8,1r8d24,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7
LazersGoPewPew,"My father will be so proud I’ve taken his random dinner science talks and turned them into some sort of knowledge to pass along. Basically it boils down to something called relative humidity. The temperature difference is noticeable because the relative humidity in your house and the relative humidity outside are different. Relative humidity ranges from low - 0% to high - 100% and is determined by how much water vapor is in the air (the lower the percentage, the less water vapor is in the air). 

Okay, now all molecules have some kinetic energy and are bouncing around everywhere. When there is low relative humidity, it is easy for water molecules to break bonds with the surface of your skin and bounce into the ambient air because the air is not saturated with water molecules already. When things with high kinetic energy leave a system, temperature for the system is then reduced. This is known as evaporative cooling and is easiest in low-humidity environments.

As relative humidity increases (which means there is more water vapor in the air) it is harder for the water molecules on your skin surface to break free into the air. And, because there are more water molecules in the ambient air, it is more likely that those will start to bind with moisture on your skin. Essentially evaporative cooling is significantly reduced as humidity is increased so the same temperature feels warmer.

Here’s a little pic from NOAA (yay, Dad!) that kind of covers what actual vs. felt ambient air temperatures are when relative humidity is factored in.

When it is 60 degrees inside, you lose heat faster than you produce it, so your body has to do work to regulate its temperature, and signals you to feel uncomfortable so that you will find a warmer room and your body can work more efficiently again.

* How hot or cold the air is.
* How much water is dispersed in the air.
* How fast or slow the air is moving.

In your case, the first point doesn't matter, because the temperature is the same, both inside and out. Also, I will assume that the air speed in your home is comfortable, just like outside. So the real reason why you are feeling uncomfortable is the amount of moisture in the air.

Inside, the air is conditioned (note, this doesn't mean regulating only temperature). This means it is at a speed and humidity to feel very cold to you right now. Normally, the magic number for you to feel comfortable is between 30 - 60% relative humidity. (found [here](http://greengaragedetroit.com/index.php?)) 

Relative Humidity is the amount of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold. Outside, it is likely a comfortable 60 percent relative humidity with a moderate air speed.

The reason you are probably feeling so uncomfortable in your home is that as your A/C unit cools the air, the relative humidity is dropping. This change is what is making you feel uncomfortable. To remedy this, you can get a humidifier. This will raise the total amount of water in the air, which will bring the relative humidity up to a comfortable zone.

As for direct sunlight, you are being cooled by the colder air, but also being warmed by the sunlight. In your home you are being cooled by the colder air around you and not feeling the compensating effects of the sun. (this is if it is daytime, but I don't know your life)

Quetzalcoatls,"The filibuster reform essentially makes it possible to now break a filibuster of judicial and executive nominees with 51 votes, or a simple majority. They did not change the filibuster for everything, just those two situations. 

While Obama supports the move, this was lead by Senate Democrats. Essentially the Democrats feel that the GOP has abused the filibuster by blocking nominations to courts and executive agencies not because of legitimate grievances with the candidates, but rather just to make sure the President can't implement his policy. Because there are only 55 Democrats in the Senate and the fact that the GOP is voting completely on the party line this has made it impossible to break the filibuster and fill these positions. This has led to many courts and executive agencies have vacancies in very important positions for some time. 

The GOP counters that this is just a distraction from the failure of the ACA roll-out and that they are blocking these nominations because they don't like the candidates.

ExplodingCorndog,"In my mind, it took away one more tool for politicians as a whole to act like children.  A filibuster is tantamount to  ones older sibling telling the younger that santa doesn't exist.  Not wanting to hear it the younger child puts a finger in each ear and chants ""NAH NAH NAH...."" loudly so as not to hear what they don't want to, until the older gives up trying to say what the younger doesn't want to hear.  Except in the case of a filibuster, its not a couple of adolescents.  Instead, they are grown-assed men and women acting this out, and it's not always until the one in power gives up. Sometimes it's even more unreasonable, or just to extract concessions.  I see reform as a good thing, as it corrects one of the many flaws in the system that wastes our time and money in this country.

I can see where some may feel differently about it, as it allows the minority to have a voice in the political process where the majority could otherwise easily overrule them without ever hea.  However, if we didn't want the majority to do what they are doing, then they wouldn't be in the majority, right?  In theory anyway...  To me this mentality is kind of like the ""everybody is a winner"" mentality where everyone who participates gets a metal, winner or loser.  In this way, even though you've lost due to being in the minority, you can still win by dragging out the process till the end of session, not unlike a pouting child that sits at the dinner table refusing to eat their veggies until bedtime arrives, and they are sent away without eating them. 

There was a time when the filibuster may have served a valid purpose, but that time is long gone.  It's nothing more than a huge inefficient wast of time now, and purely used to forward one party or the other party's goals, or to hinder the goals of their opponent.

Most outlets are wired so that one side is connected to a hot 120V wire, and the other side is connected to a neutral.  There's 115-120V RELATIVE voltage between the two wires.  
If your house electrical system breaks, the safety issues depend on whether it's the neutral that breaks (opens) or the hot side.  If the hot side opens up, bad things don't usually happen (neutrals are usually tied to OR close to ground voltage).  If the neutral opens up, your hot wire becomes a floating voltage (relative to ground).  You could potentially have a dangerous situation (fire/shock/etc.).  So.....appliances/electronics are sometimes built to prevent ""accepting"" a floating voltage from the hot side of an outlet.

You want the side with the light socket to be ""neutral"" so when you turn off the switch and go to change the lightbulb, you don't accidentally shock yourself by touching the socket.  If the plug wasn't keyed, you'd have a 50/50 chance.  

The lamp will work fine either way, it doesn't care which is hot and which is neutral.  But it's safer to have certain parts of the circuit at neutral when power isn't flowing.

nojuan_1,"Keep in mind that ""Motzart"" was composing at a very special time - a time where the greatest musical minds were *also* composing the most popular music.  Vienna would have been a great place to be - Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert were (among others) at least somewhat recognized by the ""average"" person to be great composers.  This hasn't really happened at any other time in Western history (a possible exception/side note could be the great Tin Pan Alley/Broadway composers of the early 20th century).

There have been some *titanic* musical geniuses in the last century: Stravinsky, Britten, Gershwin, Schoenberg, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, etc.  Generally speaking, if you and I are too busy listening to pop music to notice, these guys don't care.  To quote Wynton Marsalis: ""Great music doesn't come to you - you have to go to it"".  So if you look around and think that there's nothing that brilliant out there, that's probably your fault!

I love pop music as much as the next guy/gal, but anyone operating at the level of a Mozart or Stravinsky would be terribly, terribly bored by the conventions and superficialities that are inherent in the majority of today's pop music.  Do some research on *The Rite Of Spring* or *Peter Grimes*, listen to the pieces many times over, read what scholars say about these pieces, then compare what you've heard to the music you typically listen to.  Again, you have to make the effort to approach great music.

Also think about the music in other cultures: look at how much respect Ravi Shankar commanded in India, or how popular Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
does.  I hope that helps.

GaakHead,"Mozart's first composition was composed when he was five years old. This may seem unusual, but bear in mind he lived in a musical household (both his brother and his father were respected composers), and his father taught him music theory and performance to an extent that would be considered criminal by today's standards (in that Mozart learned very little else). It's also worth mentioning that while there is no doubt that Mozart was talented, he wasn't particularly innovative. Mozart had an exceptional ability to make incredibly vast and complicated variations on existing themes, often on a whim, but a great deal of his style was pioneered by Beethoven and Haydn. Mozart was also never employed by a king, but rather by a Prince-Archbishop, and being employed by wealthy figures *was normal for talented musicians during his time*.

Having said that, there are most certainly musical ""geniuses"" working today. Musicians such as Danny Elfman have composed an incredible amount of music, and musicians such as Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Phuture, and the Belleville Three have all played a role in the innovation of new musical genres, techniques and even compositional methods. There are certainly problems currently facing the music industry that may encourage certain musical ""geniuses"" to seek employment in unrelated fields, but music theory, techniques and compositional methods have continued to advance.

Unfortunately I suspect as the current music industry continues to face problems musicians will take a cue from the days of being employed by wealthy figures for their exclusive performance: innovative and talented musicians will press a single copy of a record, and sell it on the merits of their reputation for $100K or more to a single, wealthy buyer, who can choose to hoard it for their own pleasure, leak it on to the internet, or play it for a select few at their exclusive parties for the rich. Bill Gates will have the only copy of Aphex Twin's next album, Carlos Slim will have the only copy of Boards of Canada's next album, etc. The rest of us will be left with music from years gone by, and the unpolished demo material from musicians trying to gain enough notoriety to attract the attention of millionaires and billionaires.

2) A quick search of youtube will turn up a litany of videos of 4 year old asians playing shit on guitar or piano that could have blown Beethoven's syphilitic ears straight off. These kids are geniuses. Have you ever listened to a good jazz composition. There are 12 year olds writing and performing jazz that could make heroine popular again and jazz is several orders of magnitude more systemically complex than the standard modes used by the classical ""greats.""

3) If you asked a peasant farmer in 1780 what his favorite composition of Mozart's was, his response might have been along the lines of ""Who's Moats, and what kinda arts duz'ee do?"" After which he'd sing you a pint song his neighbor wrote and call it the most beautiful song he'd heard. Point being, music of that scale wasn't available to the general public while it was being composed. It was for rich folks. So really ""world wide famous"" is a bit of a subjective comparison given the limitations of distribution in the time period and the ""geniuses"" of today have about as wide an audience as they always have (just change 'the rich' to 'academics' or 'intellectuals')

4) Lots of geniuses only get labeled as such years postmortem because genius is often a product of boundary pushing and experimentation. But in any given present, the broader culture is still catching up with the ideas of the last generation's boundary pushers. Generally where the last generation pushed the boundary to is where the current generation's laymen assume the boundary will remain and today's arts are being judged on the standards of their predecessors.

Zephod03,"From what I hear it sounds like you mean Decline of interest from a social standpoint i.e. decline of popularity due to other forms or circumstances. Music, in being that it is auditory(and sometimes physical) form of expression lends its principles very well to many other disciplines(e.g. mathematics, language, communication to name a few). 

  However because of the time period in which music defined by the *Oxford Concise Dictionary of music* of being ""classical"" was codified, we must distinguish between the factors of classical music syndication From the syndication of music we see today.  Without going into too much detail classical (not to be confused with Classical period)music saw its zenith between 1550 and 1900.  Access to the form was very controlled. At first, You had to be the right class to even study it let alone the ability to hear it. There was very little variation compared to today's music and even held an aversion to [dissonant intervals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone#Historical_uses) . Only 113 years later and our access and knowledge to music is infinitely greater. 

also one must consider that after 1900 Music was turned into a commodity to be used to drive commercial sales in addition to a lot of other forms of art. When that happened, it changed the course of Music in the sense that as opposed to embracing all forms One form would be lifted above all others and used to solidify its users intent. What you see as a result is that when a form of music is popular it is partly on behalf of a larger entity who has invested in it. You can see the sway of music popularity falling in line with the businesses who own the ""rights""  to it. In contrast musicians who are invested in their art form continue to develop regardless of whether it is popular in the eyes of anyone else. This is not to be confused with Artists who are not musicians who often will change with the ""popular music at the time"" although the former is driven by the same forces.  In summary I would say that musical geniuses are alive and well and even though corporate control may only expose the semblance of 0.000000001% of them, There are many. Most of the reason you don't hear about them is because Cronyism is a bane to Creativity in the same way Bain Capital stifles Musicians.

The best way to get at them is to fracture the rock and let all the gas shoot upto the surface, you collect the gas and can sell it.

The way you do this in principal is simple, you drill a big hole down to the level where the gas is hiding. You then pump a bunch of fluid at high pressure down the tube. This fluid moves around the rock, gets inbetween the gaps, causes the rock to fracture and whooooosh the gas comes shooting out for you to collect.

Obviously in practice there is much more science to it, but thats the basic principal. The reason its on the news so much is becasue there is debate as to if doing this causes bigger problems or not.

M35T,"Fracing, not fracking, is short for hydraulic fracturing.  This method is used to extract trapped resources in the ground.  

Before anything happens the land is surveyed and studied.  The two main factors for getting the oil or natural gas out of the ground are porosity and permeability of the rock, which is most likely shale.  After the well is drilled you can extract natural gas immediately.  But you don't extract all that the well has to offer.  Drilling a well is very expensive so you want to ensure you get everything you can from the well before moving to completions. 

Fracing uses high horsepower high pressure pumps.  Ranging from 1000hp to 3000hp and pressures up to 20000psi.  These are like the drag cars of the pump world.  On a frac site there could be as many as 20 pumps running. Using these pumps an engineer will select a proppant, generally sand, and a small amount of fracing chemicals to mix with water making ""frac fluid"".  The chemicals all have a purpose.  Ranging from controlling the viscosity of the fluid, keeping the walls of the well as smooth as possible, prevention of corrosion, prevention of fungus or any living growth, etc.  many states and companies publish there frac fluid composition.  Overall this makes up a few percent of the overall fluid.  

Frac process:

Drill the well then send down a perforation gun.  This ""gun"" has small explosions that poke holes through the cement casing of the well and into the rock formation.  After this is completed the frac pumps go to work. They pump the frac fluid down the well at high pressure to fracture the rock.  The sand will embed into the rock formation keeping the newly created channels open for the natural gas or oil to to flow from.  After the fracing portion is completed that portion of the well is capped off.  Then the next stage is started and so on.  After all stages are completed.  A drill will come down and drill through the cap for each stage and the extraction process will begin. ",null,1,cdknycg,1r88xt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

RadiatorSam,"There is a really good documentary called Gasland, about a guy who goes around the US and finds out about it, well worth a watch. 
           
Fracking is a gas extraction technique that involves injecting a mixture of chemicals into the ground at pressure. Natural gas is found underground in rocks and by injecting this mixture at pressure they can crack the rock and let the gas out (that is the fracking part of fracking). By doing this they can release the gas and suck it back to the surface.
        
The reason it hads been in the media before and is again now is that the mixture they inject into the ground is highly toxic and contains heaps of carcenogens (98 if i remember correctly) and in fracturing the rock they allow it to seep into the water table. there have been many reports and demonstrations of people in areas that fracking is used in who are able to light their drinking water on fire. I mean the water that comes out of their taps is cloudy, and catches fire when a match is taken to it, and so obviously there are serious health risks associated with that. The other big thing is that they dont suck all of the mixture back out of the ground when they are done, and so the environmental effects are really bad. The way they dispose of the mixture which they inject is by evaporating off the water and then taking away what's left, however they speed up the process by spraying the mixture in a mist into the air so that ""the water evaporates more quickly"" of course this means all of these really scary chemicals are now airborne. In that documentary they showed people's animals that were losing all their hair, (officially attributed to being near lamp posts) and a farmer who was having cattle get malnourished and die. The unfortunate thing is that we have the environment on one side, and the highly paid corporate laawyers defending the oil companies on the other, that's why it continues.

Yes, that's right. Despite all the chatter on the campaign trail (hello, Ron Paul) and on cable TV, the Fed is actually not in the business of printing money.

A lot of people are confused about this. That's probably because the Fed does control the money supply. But ""money supply' is not the same as actual physical dollars — and yet another reason why economics is known as ""the dismal science"".
The money supply equals the amount of physical cash plus the amount of credit circulating throughout the economy, which is where the Fed comes in a very big way.

Think of the Fed as a bank — but just for other banks. The Fed lends money to banks, which determines the rate which banks charge the rest of us for everything from car loans to mortgages to credit card rates and pretty much every other loan you can think of (and some fees only a banker can dream up.)

By setting the rate banks can borrow from the Fed, non-ironically called ""the discount rate"", the Fed helps determine whether rates are high or low for the rest of us. And those rates help determine whether people want to borrow money or not.

Cancer is fairly gender neutral, overall. Women get breast cancer far more often than men, but women also do not get prostate cancer at all. The trend is that the male gender is slightly more cancerous than the female, but the difference (3,000 out of a total 323,000 for 2010) is very slight. So cancer can't be the reason women outlive men.

That leaves, then, cardiovascular disease. Heart attacks and strokes kill more people than all other causes of death combined, save cancer. A large part of the free-radical-producing reactions that are to blame for the damage that can cause heart attacks is iron. Women are, on average, at a significant iron deficit compared to men. When the doctors tell you that red meat causes heart attacks, they aren't joking, and women simply don't eat as much red meat as men. It is also worth noting that menstruation plays an enormous role in iron levels, especially in younger women.

tl;dr Women have periods, men eat too much meat.

I don't think it's just because of social constructs that lead to men being in more dangerous work positions, I think social constructs tend to put men in more dangerous situations, period.

To clarify, I don't think men are inherently stupider than women, but google ""People doing stupid things"". I did it just now. 9 of the first 10 images were of guys doing stupid things. Of those, five could potentially result in death or serious injury.

For whatever reason, many cultures, especially Western ones, have traditionally encouraged men to be brave and somewhat reckless; it's a very romantic image that has a lot more practical applications in war than it does in peace. I think that tendency for males in Western society to act out, occasionally in a dangerous or reckless manner, manifests in really stupid ways during peacetime.

This isn't the only thing at play here, but it is a significant enough factor that during adolescence particularly, men have a measurably higher death rate than women. Men are most vulnerable to death by culture-of-recklessness at a relatively young age; it wouldn't take a huge absolute number of men dying in adolescence to have an effect on men's *Average* lifespan.

The way to think about how your body cares for itself, is to think about how you take care of your car.  Let's say you get a dent in your brand new Ferrari?  You are going to get that dent fixed ASAP.

Now let's say you have beat up 1992 Corolla, and it get a new dent. You probably aren't going to go out and get that dent fixed right away.

Our bodies are the same way.  Regeneration takes valuable resources, and as we evolved we came up with a balance of how much time/energy we spend rebuilding ourselves, and how much time/energy we spend doing other things.

Like the car example above, women and men have different formula's.  Men evolved to need more resources fighting and hunting.  Women evolved to spend more resources on regeneration as they need a certain amount of health to be pregnant and give birth to a healthy baby.  Additionally, Grandmothers spend more time child-rearing than grandfathers, and so it was more adventurous for woman to put more resources into regeneration so they were more likely to reach her ""grandmother"" stage and help raise her grandchildren.

Men on the other hand can reproduce by just by being big and strong, and so this is where the regeneration calculations start to diverge.

This is also why women have more body fat than men, take less risks, don't spend as much resources on building muscle etc.

As a man this sucks, but it makes sense.  Most of our medicine today is spent on removing ailments.  To allow us to live much longer, we are going to fundamentally change this evolutionary decision set hundreds of thousands of years ago.",null,2,cdkot8s,1r85d5,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6

1. Two X chromosomes. If there's a problematic mutation with one, the other can make up for it. If you have one Y and one X chromosome, they're all you've got and more likely to cause trouble. 

2. Grandmother hypothesis: Men are fertile until shortly before they die. Women hit menopause and then proceed to live another few decades, despite like of fertility.

This protective effect of course wears off after menopause, at which point they are back around the same risk level as men (some studies show they become more at-risk than men, due to the sudden change) for heart disease.

Certain body parts make chemicals that tell other body parts what to do. A certain category of chemical is released when you are sleeping to tell your body to not be hungry. Your body will release a certain amount every night because your body knows roughly how much sleep it is going to get it will release a certain amount during your work week.

Cortisol is your stress hormone and can be released for a multitude of reasons, waking up happens to be one of them.  One cortisol is released, your body then introduces insulin to counteract the cortisol released.  Waking up ""early"" would result in a higher insulin response than would sleeping in.  The resulting insulin crash is what causes the hunger.  

This same principle is true for people who eat breakfast early in the morning and feel hungry a couple hours later.  Waking up increases insulin, then eating also spikes the insulin more.  The ensuing insulin crash is what causes hunger.

node_of_ranvier,"The reason for this is a hormone called leptin. Leptin is a hormone released by your fat tissue that tells your brain that you currently have enough food and in turn suppresses appetite. The opposite hormone to this is ghrelin, which gets released when your body needs food and increases appetite. During the night time your body naturally increases leptin release so that you do not wake up from hunger in the middle of the night. The peak of this leptin release usually occurs around midnight.  Now lets move on to your question.

The most likely reason for your hunger/lack of hunger is sleep deprivation. The peak leptin release during the night is much lower when you are sleep deprived compared to when you are allowed to sleep in. Additionally, this peak actually occurs on average 2 hours earlier than when you are allowed adequate sleep (9pm vs 11:30pm) ([source](http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/89/11/5762.long)). Also in general, people with shorter sleep have elevated levels of ghrelin ([source](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0010062)). This means that when you are forced to wake up early (sleep deprived) your leptin  levels (which suppress appetite) are going to be lower. Also your ghrelin levels (which increase appetite) will be higher. This means when you are sleep deprived (waking up early) you are more likely to be hungry than when you are allowed to sleep as much as you need. 

The second source I posted above is a great study titled ""Short Sleep Duration Is Associated with Reduced Leptin, Elevated Ghrelin, and Increased Body Mass Index"". They basically conclude that people who are sleep deprived have are more likely to have higher BMI's, so they are fatter.

DuckySaysQuack,"To be sure, a lot of people are predicting India to become the next China within another few decades. So in a few years maybe India WILL become as powerful or more so than China. However, currently the main reason is that China has made itself more hospital for foreign investors and companies to do business there. Despite how China is depicted in the US because of the historical context with America and communist/socialist history, China is surprisingly very stable politically.

Developing countries such as China, India, Vietnam etc ""flower"" into powerful economies in the shadow of foreign investment and developed countries. They open up their gates to foreign foreign investment and entrepreneurs look at the countryside or cities and say, ""this place can benefit a lot from my company's technology, know-how, management, etc."" However to do business here, the government must provide them with safety, a means to get things done, and adequate infrastructure and tax/law benefits to make it profitable to be here.

China excels in this because they are able to make efficient choices and fast executions to make the place ""foreign hospitable."" Say what you will about Democracy and Communism, but authoritarian regimes are capable of making decisions and carrying them out faster. It takes congress months and sometimes years to find agreement to a debate. The Chinese CCP can do it much faster and carry them out in sometimes unethical or draconian means by western standards. It's like being a foreign investor and having the biggest, meanest, bully on your side.

India does have the land mass, resources, intelligence, and manpower to compete against China, however it's lacking in a lot of central authority and is inhibited by lots of bickering and differing interests. China often will have no problems in destroying acres of wildlife to build the worlds largest hydro electric plant, or bulldoze thousands of families to build new Olympic Stadiums or factories.

When China opened up to reforms in the 1980's, it had already amassed a high percentage literacy rate in its younger generation, between 85-90%.

In contrast, even today, India has only about 35-40% literacy rate, perhaps improved a little recently.

Between 1950 and 1980, China put in a rather large effort to universal free education at the primary education level.  And that effort paid off.

The issue in India is inequality in the access to its education system, which contain very good schools for very rich people, and very poor schools for most of the population.

Result:  When China opened up, Western companies found a huge educated labor force in China ready and capable of being trained very quickly.

GrimTuesday,"The way we detect smells is through receptors in the nose. Imagine the smell of cinnamon wafts up your nose. Among many other things, there exists a 'cinnamon smell molecule' which is accepted by a very specific receptor, like a key fits a lock. 

This receptor is mapped (through a long process) to a specific place in the brain which can then read the message of ""the cinnamon smell has bound"" to understanding  ""I smell cinnamon"". 

Now, why do we stop smelling cinnamon if we smell it for too long? Many neurons have an innate trait called ""adaptation"". The nervous system has evolved to detect change much more readily than constant stimuli -- your clothes may press against your body constantly but the nerves in your skin are not constantly firing. This happens at the individual neuron level and even before your brain has to filter out the signals, it never receives many of them at all.

Olfactory neurons (the smell detectors) are known to adapt more quickly than most other systems; this is what makes them so hard to study.

The bigger part of the announcement is that this suggests that China is going to try increase the buying power of its currency, meaning that China's labor is going to get more expensive, but China's population will be able to buy more foreign goods, which is welcome news to producers in other places which would like to export more.",null,33,cdkikku,1r81t5,explainlikeimfive,top_week,140
Failure_is_optional,"The fact that China only holds less than 8% of US public debt determines that the minute China dumps its bonds, US will not just suddenly de-stablise. The foreign holdings of US debts as a percentage of public debt is around 57%, go check the debt clock if you need source. The major risk to the US debt situation is that everyone will start throwing their bonds away at once, the risk of which is minuscule looking at the robustness of the US economy and the fact that most of the countries holding the debt exports quite a bit of its goods and services to the US, not to mention are currently allied to, or is the US's bitch. It is therefore in everyone's interest so far to hold on to the bonds they have on hand and not do anything hasty with them.

The US is also aware of the problem, and that is why you can see some of their policies are starting to focus on reducing debt. The issue is not as big as the news article would like you to believe.

And more on China manufacturing, Foxconn has moved some of its capacity to US and Indonesia as well as other SEA countries, the infrastructure there will catch up to China soon, many factories are moving out of China and this is worrying to the Chinese government due to the decrease in employment that comes with their migration, which will drag on their goal to transform China into a consumer economy, which is essential to their survival and continued growth. Their import/export numbers are mainly propped up with their own never ending stimulus packages, and corporate taxation is laughable to say the least. The only question is whether China will grow out of their dependence on state funding and shadow banking with a healthy consumer economy before their debt gets the better of them.

I am pessimistic as consumer economies can only exist with relatively equal wealth distribution (Hello 20th Century), as the lower to mid income population, which usually makes up a majority of the populace will always spend a higher percentage of their income on goods and services. But with the income inequality in China being what it is, most of that wealth will be locked up in investments and cash and thus cannot flow back into the economy. This hinders the implementation of the consumer economy and with the brain drain + rampant corruption, the problems are just gonna pile up.

Tl;dr: News has high shock value, but low substance, go do your own research.

Edit: forgot to add that the only real use for buying bonds is to keep the Yuan down due to cheaper exports, and the main beef that other countries have with China is their current account deficits. But since China will be less dependent on an exports driven economy in the future if it gets its shit together, stopping bond purchases will only drive the yuan up slightly, and a stronger yuan will be good for imports once the transition to a consumer based economy is complete.

Currently, and for the past three decades, China's rapid economic growth has been export led.  This was possible in part because their government ""stockpiled"" (they actually recycled them) US dollars in order to keep the Chinese Yuan (RMB) cheap - and thus keep Chinese exports cheap.  However, this strategy has led to a number of social and economic inefficiencies, which are no longer balanced out by rapid development.  The IMF called this one in 2012, and issued a public call for China to make this change.  The series of policy announcements during and following the 3rd Plenum meeting indicate that China's leadership has decided that the IMF was correct, and that they intend to increase the cost of their currency, so that their people can buy more stuff and not rely on American consumers.  This will raise prices of consumer goods around the world, and in turn have many unintended consequences and send shockwaves around the world, but will ultimately allow the global economy (as well as China and the US) to grow at a slower &amp; more stable rate based on solid economic principles instead of complex financial manipulation.",null,0,cdkpso4,1r81t5,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5

The chinese having a giant pile of money it wasn't spending wasn't doing anyone any favours, chinese consumers were effectively being underpaid for their work, and american exports were less competitive globally than they otherwise would have been.

So Win win for everyone.  

(N.B.  Countries need some stockpile of foreign currency, usually a lot of that being US dollars for a lot of reasons, but China has more than enough for those purposes by now).  

Long term:  

What we're starting to see is China making a gradual - perhaps too gradual push towards their own citizens consuming more.  Net that's good for everyone, it will open the market for foreign (non chinese) companies to sell more stuff in China, and Chinese consumers will improve their standard of living.

The impact on US debt and US bond purchases is essentially nothing, as interest rates the US is offering are so low the chinese haven't been buying much anyway, and even if interest rates creep up from 2.75% to 3% or the like it's not going to be a problem.

SCREECH95,"So with my highschool knowledge of economics...
Chinese stockpiling of dollars means that the exchange rate of the  yuan or renminbi is tied to the the exchange rate of the dollar: the Chinese buying dollars (with Yuan/renminbi of course) means the demand for Yuan/Renminbi decreases and the demand for dollars increases. Whenever the value of the dollar rises, the Chinese government can stockpile dollars in the form of US government obligations (debts) and make renminbi rise with it and the other way round.
The value of 1 renminbi is tied to the dollar at a very low exchange rate. This makes it cheaper for US companies to import products from China than to purchase US produced goods.
So the renminbi exchange rate will move more freely from the dollar, meaning that it´s easier to sell US goods (assuming the exchange rate of Yuan/Renminbi will rise given China's booming economy). US export will also increase. Basically, global demand for US goods will rise, which means more jobs. This can, also lead to inflation because consumers have more money to spend, but that´s just economics.
This is all of course dependent of a very simplistic model. With economics, anything can happen really.(come to think of it, this will mean that one of the biggest buyers of US debt stops buying US debts.

* Laws of supply and demand state that as the demand for anything decreases, the value of it will also decrease. This also works vice versa.
* China has ceased stockpiling US dollars, hence the 'demand' for US dollars will decrease, causing the value of the US currency to depreciate. In the past, China has stockpiled US dollars (keeping the demand for US dollars relatively high) to keep the value to their currency relatively low compered to the US currency. This benefits China's trade in various ways, but that can be discussed later.
* A relatively low valued US dollar has a billion different effects on the US economy but here are some basic ones:

1) Chinese goods become more expensive, as the purchasing power of the US dollar decreases

2) US made goods and services become less expensive for the Chinese (As the US dollar is worth less) hence the demand for US goods and services will increase. This is beneficial for US manufacturing firms and may benefit economic growth in the US (although this is a long term effect)

3) US debt gets more expensive, again the US currency is worth less, so the US will have to 'pay more of their dollars' in order to pay off the debt.

This isn't the only possible outcome of an oligopoly, however, since in some markets you might see heavy competition between rivals, in which case the presence of an oligopoly actually benefits consumers. 

I know that laws that apply to monopolies don't usually cover oligopolies, but you'd have to ask someone else about whether there's any official regulations in place for those situations. Blatant price-fixing amongst competitors can be challenged by the government, at the very least.

Some other examples of oligopolies include cable companies and the OPEC oil cartel. 

The reason why in your case it's still not seen as a monopoly is, essentially, that it's too small of a scale. Comcast  isn't shutting out competition, you just have the misfortune to live in an area where Comcast is the only option. It may even be that several ISPs agreed to parcel out different areas near you to different providers. 

Also, while it's not exactly an equivalent product, satellite internet is typically available pretty much everywhere, which also allows Comcast to claim they're not the only game in town even if they really are for all intents and purposes.",null,0,cdknphm,1r81m0,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

They basically under cut every single small company that opposed them and they were able to do this as they literally own all the copper lines in the UK and now they are moving over to the fiber market and are taking control. 

But the UK Government have prevented them from monopolizing this advantage and now all companies can safely use their lines without worrying that they will either be overcharged for the lines/undercut on their standard prices.

VivaLaForlan,"Because they are not monopolies at all, they are oligopolies. Essentially, this means that a handful of the most powerful and well-established ISPs will create a pact with eachother, wherein they agree to set the same base rates, the same package deals, and essentially put out the same product.

Now, this might not seem very logical, but if you were to consider that, here in the UK, we have BSkyB, Virgin Media, and BT as the three main ""competitors"", if they one day decided that, instead of fighting eachother, they just came to agreement, they could simultaneously raise their prices on a whim, leaving the average taxpayer no choice but to pay it.

This also means that there is absolutely no incentive for these companies to shell out more money to increase their quality i.e. Installing new lines, increasing our d/l speeds.

The copper or fiber going to each house is an obvious monopoly. It's just more efficient that way. A city could decide to treat it as a local utility, in which case the local government would install, own, and maintain it. They aren't an ISP at that point. They could have a central facility where all that cable connects to and rent out access to that to local ISPs, who would arrange with the backbone ISPs to get bandwidth from there to the rest of the Internet.

In exchange for monopoly access to the market, the company will usually have to submit to a set of restraints placed upon in by the contract it has with the local government. A common one, for example, is having to ask permission from the contracting government to increase prices. I'll add that it's not really a true monopoly in the case of ISPs and Cable companies usually. A lot of areas have at least a couple of different options, and contracts are rebid.

As long as there isn't a barrier to starting one besides startup costs, technically any company with the money to do so could become one.

You could call Starbucks a monopoly too if its the only place that serves coffee in your town, but its more likely they are the only place in town because nobody else has chosen to open a place that serves coffee.  Now the presence of a Starbucks may make the ability to start one and have it be successful be a lot more difficult, but it doesn't prevent you from doing so.

This is obviously oversimplistic, but the reason why Google isn't putting fiber into every large city in America to compete with Comcast and similar isn't because they don't want to, its because they cannot afford to.  So they are doing it in places first where the investment will reap the largest rewards.

Comcast, AT&amp;T, etc have the infrastructure and thus can penetrate the market and in a lot of places be the only provider there and thus the only choice.  Because of that also it makes competition difficult.

But it doesn't prevent someone else from trying.  It just makes it really, really hard for them to be able to.  There are laws also that make it more difficult as well, yes, in some areas, and in those areas you'd have more of an argument of calling them such, but in theory you'd still be able to provide a competing service.

Hospitalo,"In many cases the billed amount for supplies is so high because there is no logical relation between what an item cost for an institution to purchase and what the institution will charge for it. Suppliers DO gouge institutions. However, that is typically a small part of the problem. The supplier may sell aspirin that should be $.03 a pill for $1, but the institution may bill $30 or $100 for that item.

The two most common reasons for this are institutions ""backing into"" the price of a whole service or, more commonly, contract rate structures that have mutated over time creating insane rates.

When “backing into” a rate the institution decides on a level of revenue they need to make then dividing this across the types of procedures they expect to provide in a given time.

Rate structures are formed in relation to insurance entities or “payers”. In the beginning it was as simple as the payers have the money and can pay immediately so they ask for a discount. This discount can be simple or down to specific procedures. It often changes over time. In the beginning the institution may have had a perfectly sane charge master that the use to bill from. Over time this has broken down. The contracts often had escalators built in that inflated prices by a certain percent per year. Since the contracts can change year to year they often get more and more complex with both sides attempting to gain advantage. That is how you end up payers getting 50% or higher discount off of billed charges while still not getting a good “deal”. 50% off is not so great when it is billed at 1000% of what it cost.

TonsilTickler,"Let me first define some terms to make this clearer. 

DNA - the blue print of every thing in your body to be made by a process called transcription which is where the cell makes protein from the genetic code it contains.

Transcription Factor (TF) - This is protein that attaches to the part of DNA that tells the cells system to make the proteins that control things like hair growth, finger length, head size, - everything that makes differences in your body from anyone else's.

Chemical Gradient - think peeing in one end of the pool, more is one location in the pool than others, the gradient in this example is the amount of pee in the area of the pool where you are, the more pee the more disgusting. The further away you are from the place where the pee went in, the less pee you touch. This pee doesn't mix uniformly unless it the pump is on, but there is a natural expansion as it mixes with the water, just not uniformly across the pool. 

Like all things in your body, hair length is regulated by by a chemical gradient of transcription factors -TFs. This means that there are proteins called transcription factors that attach to portions of DNA  that cause the proteins to be made that need to be generated to make your follicles create the hair. The distribution of these TFs is important.  The more of these necessary TFs you have in the right part of the follicle cells, the more proteins are generated from the DNA, the longer your hair gets. Otherwise, if it just continued growing as suggested, elderly people would have long hair hanging off their arms. It does grow a length and stop. To prove it, shave a patch on your body that doesn't seem to grow, and it will grow back, to the same length of the surrounding hair, but no more. So much TF in the cells grow so much hair and no more.  

TFs are the reason that cells for organs, skin, and brain are so different, the different TFs specialize the cells.  Yes, uncut/shaven hair does have a growth cycle, but these cycles are not random. Hair does grow a predetermined length, and this is genetic, based on the TFs that tell the the DNA to make the proteins that make the follicle grow. This is why some people of certain cultures have more body hair than others. These TFs are responsible for every part of your body layout and determines where hands go, how long your fingers are etc. based on how many of these proteins are present in the right place at the right time. Most TFs have an opposing TF that limits their amount, so everything is based on how the levels of these hundreds of TFs balance/affect each other in different specific locations in the body. These TFs are all mainstays of developmental biology and control everything developmental from the moment the sperm touches the egg. 

The next step in understanding the transcription factors is using them in regenerative biology, which is the study of growing tissue to replace missing/damaged tissue from the patient. It is an exciting field that will hopefully help Vets and others with severed limbs grow them back like a starfish, or even be able to grow spare parts like entire hearts and lungs from the patients own DNA, eliminating rejection med requirements.

They fire a laser beam (which is a light beam with a very narrow light cone so it maintains a good photon density and brightness over a long distances) at the moon. The Apollo 11 astronauts left these light reflectors on the moon so the astronomers on earth fire their laser beam precisely at these reflectors and measure the time it takes for the light to be reflected back to earth. When you half this time, you get the time it takes for the light to travel to the moon and then you can use this time to calculate the distance of the moon from the earth.

With that information it was natural for people to say ""how could they not be prosecuting him"".  As that sentiment spread, it became political because the State of Florida had to take the case since the local authorities chose not to and there was a lot of pressure from people that felt a great injustice was occurring based on the information they had.

The media also put out a picture of a younger Trayvon Martin, before he was 6 feet tall, had a gold grill, and became more ""hood."" This image stuck and swayed people's opinions into thinking not only was this a white on black crime, but an older white male killing an innocent looking, young black boy. Zimmerman was a neighborhood watchman for his neighborhood which had a string of recent break ins. Trayvon caught Zimmerman's attention as suspicious. As the neighborhood watchman, he has a duty to check it out. So whether or not he should have followed Trayvon is out of the question, it was his service to the community. Then there's the fact that the older 'white' man shot and killed a younger black boy naturally infuriates people. Even though the evidence is clear that Trayvon jumped Zimmerman, was on top of him, punched him and slammed his head into the sidewalk, people will not accept this as fact. The final issue is that the black community is very hive minded in that they go along with what the community goes with, and that they are typically poorer and don't have access to other media outlets, thus more evidence.

FellowConspirator,"Thanksgiving celebrations were an old European tradition even back in the 1620's (specifically, the Dutch had the habit since the late 16th century). A Thaksgiving was a celebration made to recognize particularly good luck - the end of a war, an especially good harvest, etc. They were generally characterized by a day of prayer or religious services followed by a community meal. The pilgrim's Thanksgivings (they held several) were in this spirit (in response to survival, and good harvest).

Churches continued the practice until the late 17th century and after that, it wasn't uncommon for governors to pronounce a day of Thanksgiving every year or two (there was no set date). During the American Revolution, there were a number of Thanksgiving proclamations by both British governors, colonial politicians, and churches. At the close of the war, George Washington made the first proclamation of a national day of Thanksgiving - but that was a one-time deal.

After that, there irregular state-wide Thanksgivings held in various states, and Canada adopted the practice. It became a regular national holiday after the American Civil War by proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln who was pestered by a magazine editor, Sarah Josepha Hale, to do so.

While Americans still hold onto the imagery of thankful pilgrims dining with their Amerindian neighbors and the first Thanksgiving (a motif that was popularized in the 1950's), Americans recognize Thanksgiving as a very old tradition, one that evokes community, family, thankfulness for those that are close and good fortune.

October 3, 1863

By the President of the United States
A Proclamation

The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.

In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and provoke their aggressions, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere, except in the theater of military conflict; while that theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.

Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battlefield, and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.

No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.

It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility, and union.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United Stated States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington, this third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.

All that aside, without limits on how many children families are aloud and what gender they can be, the Chinese population will grow. The cons of that are obvious, as I already stated. But the pros are worth mentioning. 
1. China's population, much like the US', is aging. That means that there are many more retired folks than younger ones. With looser regulations regarding childbirth, China will begin to see an increase in the available workforce, and that will lead to a healthier economy. More younger and able people will be able to work. That's undeniably good or any country's economy.
2. China currently has a pretty substantial gender imbalance. I don't remember the exact number, bit there are significantly more men than women being born. While you can't exactly way that's because of the One Child law, there is a pretty strong correlation. Hopefully, with restrictions lifted, more women will be raised, balancing the genders. More and more women are being educated in China now, there is a definite link between women's education rates and economic prosperity. The smarter a country's female population, the better off that country will be. Period.

You can go on and on about whether or not an increase in the Chinese population will be good or bad. I just wanted to emphasize a few points that might not have been as obvious.

themeatbridge,"I haven't read the entire bill, but after taking a cursory pass at the full text, it looks like it is substantially similar to the previous bills offered by Price bearing the same name.  

Georgia Republican Rep Tom Price has proposed the Empowering Patients First Act twice before, in 2009 and 2011.  It has been one of the pieces of legislation that republicans have pointed to as an alternative to Obamacare.

The gist of the bill is to provide tax incentives for individuals to purchase their own healthcare.  It also allows for plans to be purchased across state lines, and allows for individuals to keep their employer-provided insurance after changing or losing jobs.  

The obvious difference between this bill and Obamacare is that there is no mandated coverage requirements.  You pay no penalty for not being insured, and insurance companies do not have the requirements and prohibitions enacted by the ACA (lifetime maximums, premium to costs ratios, preexisting conditions, etc).  

Instead, the bill requires states to set up high-risk pools where people with pre-existing conditions can purchase coverage, although there is no guarantee that the coverage will be affordable or meet any minimum requirements.  

Much of the bill seems to be focused on reducing wasteful medical spending, especially in the form of ""defensive medicine"" and the high cost of malpractice insurance.  

It does this by creating Best Practice Guidelines, limiting evidence presented against defendants to only that which is noncompliant.  It also has funding for states to create ""Administrative Health Care Tribunals"".

Essentially it boils down to this: Obamacare forces the Insurance Companies to adhere to specific rules, and forces citizens to buy the insurance.  Price's EPF Act encourages citizens to buy insurance through tax incentives, but has no provisions for what the Insurance Companies can and cannot do.  

I have tried not to be biased in this reply, but if you are interested in a critical comparison between the two, I'd be happy to oblige.

tracingspirals,"The writer writes the dialogues, scene setting and some actions. The director directs the actors how the actors are to deliver the dialogues, where they're to stand on the scene, where they're to look and the expressions they're to have, where they're to move in the scene and how they're going to interact with the other characters and the environment around them. As a lot of human conversation is based not just on dialogue but also on body language and emotional cues, its the job of the director to making all these non verbal aspects of human interaction believable, interesting, appropriate for the situation and powerful. 

Also how much the director actually does depends on the director. Some directors only care about the actors and how they're to move, behave and say their dialogues. Then the set director chooses and designs the environment and director of photography (or cinematographer) looks over how the scene is to be framed and focused. Other directors are a lot more involved in the set direction and cinematography too. Stantley Kubrick is a good example of a director with a strong photography background who was also very much involved in not just what the actors are doing but also how each shot was to be framed and focused and how the sets were designed. Many of the big/famous directors are a lot more involved in all the different aspects of the film from set design to photography so they dictate lot more of the overall look of the film than simply it's content. 

When the direction of the film is bad the actors appear wooden. Like they're simply reading their lines of a script instead of appearing to be having an actual emotional conversation or that the body language and movements of the actor just don't correlate with the dialogue and the actor appear emotionless or just odd. Watch The Room or Birdemic for some really really bad direction. 

When a film is directed well everything binds together. You feel connected to the characters. Every character appears that they're a real person who exist in the real world and not just an actor reading their lines.

Imagine the movie *Jaws*. All of the tension and build up comes from this sense of the 'unknown'. We don't know what's lurking in the water; we don't know if it's a shark or something else, or maybe nothing at all. That's because we never really see it--the camera just bobs in and out of the water, essentially creating the effect that *we're* in the water. Which is scary, because like I said, that would mean we're in the water and we have no way of knowing what's in there with us.

Now, imagine if the director, Steven Spielberg, had filmed it the way it was originally intended. The shark was supposed to be the **STAR**. We were supposed to see the shark all the time, and watch him swim around. (The mechanical shark actually broke in the salt water, which is why they made the decision to not show it quite as much, but that's not the point.)

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that yes, the writer did the writing. But a movie where we watch the shark is a VERY different story than the *Jaws* we know.

Enchanted_Bunny,"There's a difference between regular depression and clinical depression. Everybody gets regular depression when something depressing happens. 

Clinical depression is a completely different animal. It's not ""oh my dog died and I'm depressed.""  If you are clinically depressed, it last weeks, months, even years if not treated. It causes aches and pains. It affects your life in an adverse way. You gain weight, lose your job, etc. you contemplate suicide. And above all, it happens for *no reason whatsoever.* there is no single event you can tie your depression to. 

As far as how an episode starts. There is usually a trigger. Something minor or innocuous that on another day wouldn't bother you at all. But once it happens, your mind goes into overdrive. You relentlessly over analyze and second guess everything you've ever done. Over and over. You relive your most embarrassing moments and find embarrassing things about other moments too.  It's sort of like one of those ""oh god. Why?"" Rage comic moments except it lasts for weeks and *you can't turn it off.*

Then there's the medication, which all sucks because it never makes you feel normal just ""not depressed."" Lexapro made me stop giving a shit about everything, including cleaning my apartment, paying my bills on time, oh and also I couldn't have an orgasm. Paxil made me way too anxious and then I got really sick after going off of it. 

Now, it is possible that something could cause clinical depression. In my case it was because I was a Jehovah's Witness and it was extremely bad for my mental condition. But at the time I was a true believer and wouldn't even consider that was the cause. But I did meet the criteria medically for clinical depression. Ever since I left, I haven't needed a single pill.

In my mind, I had no reason to be depressed.  I was a 4.0 student, school was already paid for, didn't need to work because my scholarships  and grants covered everything, even my apartment.  Wtf do I have to be depressed about..  Nothing in many peoples minds, but I was haunted by the ideas of missed opportunities and others perceptions of what I should be doing vs what I was doing.  It formed a vicious mental feedback loop where everything began to suffer. 


 I was lucky that the university had a mental health department.  After talking with a councilor for a while, she determined that I had been in this feedback loop for so long that I had chemically depressed myself and put me on an antidepressant while we worked to the root of this depression.  The mesds recentered my brain, the talking showed me the cause and by changing how I thought about others perceptions of me and what I should be doing broke that loop.  Was able to get off the meds after about 3-4 months since I was centered once again and figured out how to break that feedback loop.

That being said we know some things about it. For instance there is the case of stressrelated depressions. In this case I can give a basic explanation.

When a person experiences stress, certain hormones that enhance thought, strength and reaction time are released. If a person is stressed for a prolonged period, for instance at work every single day, these hormones will accumulate in the brain. When this happens, one of the hormones (cortisol) changes the blood-brain-barrier to inhibit the transport of sugar into the brain. This causes brain cells to be less active. To counter this, the brain cells produce more signal molecules. The increased amount of these signal molecules, in turn, causes calciumions and waste products to accumulate in the brain cells, which in turn die. The death of the brain cells can cause loss of brain mass in areas that regulate mood and reward the individual for doing positive things. In turn, it becomes harder to gain happiness and motivation.

It's just more intense when you do and can come out of literally nowhere, even having a good time with friends. It is different in many cases.

GAB104,"I spent many years depressed, and then many on medicines, and when they quit working, one by one, I was lucky to find a psychiatrist and therapist team who could actually help me. I have been free of both depression and meds for seven years now, despite some serious life stressors during that time. I can be ""just sad"" now -- which is an unhappy state, but it's an emotion which I know will go away in time. When I was depressed, I was miserable to the bone, and it felt like I would be that way forever.

Here is what the doctor and therapist told me: Some people seem to be born more susceptible to depression, although we don't really know why, but no one is born with depression; there is some reason that you get it. They believed that the source of depression is a very deep anxiety, which results from conflicting emotions/desires. Something like loving and hating a person, needing to be close but needing to be separate at the same time. Deep anxieties produce fear -- if you need two things and don't think you can have both, then you've got to lose at least one thing you need, and that is frightening. And constant fear produces a sense of powerlessness that is characteristic of depression.

The goal, then, is to get the fear center to stand down. When we are afraid, the circuitry of the brain works differently, which is a good thing if our lives are actually in danger. But if we are afraid of something non-lethal, this is not healthy. 

Calming the fear center is difficult because it is not much affected by talk therapy. Because fear of things that can kill you is necessary to survival for any complex organism, fear resides in a very ancient, primitive part of the brain, which does not ""do"" language. That part of the brain only understands sensory information, so that is what you have to provide it. You literally have to let this part of the brain SEE that it is safe, in order to get it to stand down and let the rest of the brain work normally. 

So my therapist used a treatment based on relaxation/visualization/meditation. My therapist said that different people took it in slightly different directions, whatever worked for them, so it's hard to use just one word for it. I did this twice a day, sometimes more when I was in the thick of recovery, and now I do it any time I feel anxious. First close your eyes and relax, either sitting or lying down, starting with your toes and working up. Relaxing your body relaxes your brain. Then picture your spirit. Yes, that's right. Don't get hung up on any religious meanings here, because that is not what this exercise is about. Even if you are atheist, you can imagine the essence of who you are, in picture form. And it doesn't matter what the picture is. But look at your spirit, and know these things about it: This is your truest self. It is perfect. It is good. It is indestructible, untouched by anything bad that has happened to you. It is immensely powerful, and it will give you all the power you need to change anything about yourself that you would like to change. Just sit with that knowledge, looking at your spirit, for at least 10 minutes. When you get good at this, it is enjoyable, and it is pleasant and helpful to visualize for longer periods of time.

If you keep doing the visualization, your concept of your spirit will most likely change over time, and it is informative to see how that happens. Facing your fear and anger is still necessary for recovery, and talk therapy can help you do this. But the visualization exercises give you the strength to handle this process.

Again, I am no expert. I am merely someone who was helped to recover from what I think would have been a fatal illness eventually. Naturally, I think the beliefs that were actually able to help me (I had tried other counselors before) are correct ones. So I am sharing what I was taught. I hope this helps someone.

PurpleOrangeSkies,"The short answer is we aren't sure. 

Initially, it was thought that a deficiency of chemicals in the brain known as monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) caused depression. Most current antidepressants do in fact work by elevating the levels of these chemicals. However, lowering the levels of these chemicals in people without depression doesn't cause depression; so, the deficiency isn't the ultimate cause. 

MRIs show the physical strict of depressed people's brains are different. It's also hypothesized that estrogen may play a role. Another hypothesis is that it's a maladaptive immune response. There is also a potential genetic component. There's a lot of research being done, but nothing is really proven yet. ",null,0,cdkn7me,1r7keo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
shittymcknownothing,"I don't pretend to know. I'm nowhere near being a psychologist. However, Buddhists would say that a root of suffering is clinging to an outcome that doesn't happen. Clinging to love and losing it, losing youth, losing health. You live in the future or past and dwell on what you don't have now. 

Psychiatrists would say, depressive rumination reinforces itself. The more you think about it, the more you think about it. You remember things real well before you go to sleep, so a sleepless night thinking about bad things solidifies depression.

So how do you get depressed? Events do not make you depressed, your interpretation of them does. Usually, brain chemistry doesn't spontaneously switch to depression, your thought process conceives this and reinforces itself and the chemistry follows suite. Sometimes, however, low dopamine and seratonin will have you feel sad and your mind will invent reasons why, when it could be hypoglycemia or a mood disorder. Brain chemistry and thoughts tend to thus influence each other back and forth. 

Better question: How do you avoid depression? It helps to avoid rumination by living in the moment, to meditate, to be involved in a meditative task. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to be as effective as medication. Antidepressants tweak your seretonin level to make you feel better, and you tend to ruminate less because of it. Electroconvulsive therapy actually forces you to forget your depressive thoughts, which is effective in severely depressed people. I think, however, drugs and shocks treat the symptom but not the cause, and that a profound change in outlook in the way a person responds to events is in many cases the only way to break the cycle. I personally believe that depression is usually both a medical and a philosophical problem, as both biochemistry and thought pattern affect mood.

necr0potenc3,"When the nazi party (NSDAP) took over both inflation and unemployment were soaring, consequences from WW1 and the awful financial administration of the Weimar Republic.

Hitler had a 2 part plan to deal with both of these issues:

1) First, a forced redistribution of wealth. This is a topic which is frequently overlooked in the financial analysis of the time. Jews were not randomly chosen for the Holocaust.

German-Jews were Germany's high society at the time concentrating a lot of income, in fact, most banks and businesses in Germany were owned by jews. Hitler used them as scapegoats, blaming the jewish people in nazi propaganda for Germany's problems.

With the Holocaust the riches from the german-jews were acquired by the german (nazi) state, at the time jewish people comprised about 1% of Germany's population, it may not seem like it but *this is a huge slice*.

Germany was well financed after the hostile takeover of the banks, businesses and wealth from the victims of the Holocaust. Inflation rates went from 3000% to negative, that is to say deflation.

It was an economic miracle at the cost of millions of lives.

2) With the finances acquired by step #1 it was rather easy to lower unemployment (the state increased the public machinery) and re-establish a good circular flow of income.

someguywithaniphone,"W.A. Mozart is considered by most musicians to be one of the most influential composers for a variety of reasons:

(WALL OF TEXT WARNING, I'm on mobile, sorry)

-Prolific composer: He composed over 600 works throughout his lifetime, for a large variety of mediums (symphony, string quartets, trips, duos, woodwind ensembles, solo instruments, etc...). Many of those works are considered pillars of the repertoire.

-Stylistic innovation: During Mozart's early life, the ""stile galant"" was the dominant compositional language. This style was characterized by its overly simple harmonic and rhythmic structures, as well as its apparent superficiality. Composers of galant style were primarily concerned with doing away with the intellectual complexity of the Baroque period (most notably J.S. Bach). Mozart gradually did away with this style, incorporating Baroque style complexity into his compositions while maintaining utmost clarity and expressiveness. He also incorporated the ""sturm und drang"" style (storm and stress) later in life, paving the way, along with Haydn, for the Romantic period, and composers like Ludwig van Beethoven and the such.

A quote by pianist Charles Rosen puts it real nicely:

             ""It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous.""

TL;DR: Mozart changed the musical landscape by bringing back true depth of emotion in music, writing a ton of music, and being a role model for just about all composers after him.

Just like when a phone camera gets blurry and needs a second to re-adjust its focus, our eyes do this all the time but much faster. By stretching our eyes, we are able to focus on far objects and contracting focuses on near objects.
A lot of people stare at close objects for a long time like their phones, computers, and T.Vs and their lens stays contracted for a long time. When this happens their eye lenses kind of become less elastic and stay slightly contracted all the time. When this happens the eye can't focus on far objects and that's why we need glasses. We can't focus on far objects because light beams coming from those objects refract at the contracted lens making them get focused before they reach the retina. By wearing glasses, they manipulate light beams to make them fall right on the retina. It's like fooling your eye lens!

LurkerTalen,"ReFS is a newer filesystems that is designed to have more resiliency then NTFS by doing things like having checksums to validate that a disk drive isn't corrupting data (what you wrote is what you read) and store more data then NTFS can safely, as well as not requiring extended disk checks to ensure its internal structures aren't corrupt. That last part is important when a single filesystems can store petabytes of data, and taking the system down to do a CHKDSK can take many hours where in a corporate setting not having the file server available is a major issue. 

ReFS doesn't support all the features that NTFS does - it is specifically designed to be the file system for a large corporate file server. http://blogs.technet.com/b/askpfeplat/archive/2013/01/02/windows-server-2012-does-refs-replace-ntfs-when-should-i-use-it.aspx has a good outline of the differences between ReFS and NTFS. It's only available on Windows Server right now, and only for data drives. It's not a replacement for NTFS, it has a very different design goal at present. 

ReFS has larger drive limits (up to 2^78 bytes) then NTFS does and is better designed to handle them then NTFS is. ReFS is also not supported on removable disks at all. This is pure conjecture, but we might see it as consumers in the next client version of Windows (Windows 9?), or if there is ever going to be another Windows Home Server. I don't know if it will ever be supported as a boot drive file system.

exFAT is completely different - it's actually closer to FAT/FAT32 then it is to NTFS, and Microsoft has patents on it, making it proprietary and requiring licensing from Microsoft to implement. It is designed to be used on larger (&gt;32 GiB I'd say) removable / flash storage and support files larger then 4GiB. The downside is that not all devices support it. It does optionally support a lot of the same features that NTFS does (meaning they're in the spec, but not required to be implemented), but it's also not designed to replace NTFS. It's not a journaling file system - meaning if the system crashes while it's writing to the disk there is a chance (albeit pretty small in my experience) that the disk will be corrupted and require either a CHKDSK or reformat to be usable again. exFAT is not well supported by Linux systems due to the patent issues either (in my experience), and only fairly new devices and operating systems support it. It does have less overhead on disk compared to NTFS which is why it is better suited to removable flash drives then NTFS, where the media may not do wear levelling.

NTFS is actually a predecessor to FAT32 - it was first released with Windows NT 3.1 in 1993, while FAT32 was introduced in Windows 95 OSR2 in 1996. As a guess, it was easier to support and convert older FAT16 drives to FAT32 and to write a FAT32 driver for Windows 95/DOS7 then to write a NTFS driver - not to mention all the backwards compatibility that had to be added to DOS to make the hodgepodge actually hold together.

LaskaLee,"By passing the changes in parliamentary procedure, the Senate has changed the structure of how appointees get approved.  Rather than requiring 60% of the votes to pass most executive and judicial nominees they only need a simple majority vote.

This will effect you in several ways

1) The rules were put into place so that one party couldn't simply negate the wishes of the minority party. This has set a dangerous precedent that could lead to undermining other rules that are in place to allow for the ""checks and balances"" you were taught in school.

2) There are now concerns about leadership deciding to change the rules to fit their whims rather than following 225 years of structure and causing further gridlock. For example - Senator Obama [\(2005\)](http://obamaspeeches.com/010-The-Nuclear-Option-Obama-Speech.htm) stated 

""the American people sent us here to be their voice. They understand that those voices can at times become loud and argumentative, but they also hope that we can disagree without being disagreeable. And at the end of the day, they expect both parties to work together to get the people's business done.

What they don't expect is for one party - be it Republican or Democrat - to change the rules in the middle of the game so that they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet. The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster - if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate - then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock will only get worse."" 

From that same speech he also stated ""These are challenges we all want to meet and problems we all want to solve, even if we don't all agree how to do it. But if the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority party and the millions of Americans who asked us to be their voice, I fear that the already partisan atmosphere of Washington will be poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on anything. That doesn't serve anyone's best interests, and it certainly isn't what the patriots who founded this democracy had in mind.""

3) Focus has now shifted from Obamacare, Benghazi, NSA, IRS, (insert generic scandal here) to a parliamentary change that didn't need to happen. The next act the Senate did after passing this option was to leave for two weeks. This is scandal for scandal sake and may simply distract from other issues that could have been resolved.

4) Obama has had 1,540 nominations confirmed and only 4 defeated as of this past June. The main complaint was that the process was taking too long. The process is in place to ensure full vetting. Some appointees may not be thoroughly screened if it's a matter of an appointee being on the ""bigger team.""

*Important to note - Reid, Clinton, Obama, Biden and Hillary Clinton were all opposed to this option in 2005. The Republicans did not used the nuclear option when they were in control because the understood it would ""blow up the government.""


TL;DR - Changed 225 year old process, upset balance of power, will cause further gridlock, simple problems may now get blown out of proportion because of hurt feelings, judges may not be as impartial as they could be, and the next time the balance of power shifts there is nothing to control the other side either.

How do power companies make decisions?

If we assume that underground lines are always preferred for risk reasons, then it comes down to how much those risks are costing the power company that owns them on average.

Otherwise, they won't because it's not going to help them make money (or enough money).

Why would anyone want an above-ground line over an underground line?

Let's say we want to guarantee that we'll have power at a location because it's really costly or dangerous to lose power (like hospitals, data centers, or massive manufacturing facilities).  Well, it's cost-effective for them to have redundant power systems.  In addition to a backup power generator, the truly ambitious will have connections from at least two providers with as much separation as possible to reduce risk.

bkanber,"Imagine you invented a hypothetical clock that ticked by bouncing a pulse of light back and forth (forever) between two perfectly shiny mirrors. Each time the light hits a mirror, that's one clock tick. It's kind of like making a clock out of a ping pong ball and two paddles, except with light and mirrors. You put this rig in a car, and watch the car move away as you stand on the sidewalk.

If you have a ping pong ball bouncing vertically at 4 mph, back and forth between paddles forever, and you put that setup in a car, and drove at 3 mph, an observer on the street would see the ball moving at 5 mph (a 3-4-5 triangle; the speed of the car adds to the speed of the ball). The ball's total velocity increases when the car starts moving, and the timing of the ""ticking"" stays the same. This is the non-relativistic case.

But now, if we used the light-and-mirrors setup instead of the ping pong ball--the light *can't* speed up as the car starts moving very fast horizontally (50%+ of the speed of light is when you start seeing these effects). But the light is required to travel a farther distance as the car speeds up (ie, it has to travel the hypotenuse of a triangle). Our ping pong ball, because it wasn't moving at relativistic speeds, was ""allowed"" to appear to move faster in order to keep up the ""clock's"" pace. But the light isn't allowed to speed up in order to keep pace. It has to cover more ground, but it can't speed up, so that means the clock takes longer between ticks. If the clock takes longer between ticks, that means that time must have slowed down. 

Turns out, it doesn't matter what the clock is made out of--it'll always slow down to an inertial observer standing on the sidelines. Time and space are two facets of a bigger thing called ""spacetime"". You only have a total maximum velocity you can move through spacetime (the speed of light). If you use up all your velocity on moving through space, you don't have any available velocity left that you can use to move through time.

Hope that helps. (This is how Richard Feynman once explained it -- I had comfortably known relativity for a number of years before I read his explanation, but then it really clicked and became intuitive to me. He describes it better ;)

jay691,"Typically, in the case of an amicable divorce, both parties agree on most financial and familial matter such as alimony, child support, child custody, money, debt, property, and belongings. The reason why an amicable divorce is so much cheaper then a more contested one is due in large part to lawyers fees and court costs. 

For example, in the case of an amicable divorce, it may be as simple as meeting in one attorney's office to sign a settlement agreed on between the spouses without lawyers negotiating for them.

In the case of a divorce in which both spouses can't seem to agree, each side must pay their attorney for his time spent negotiating with the other's attorney; drafting motions, court appearances, research, and basically anything else they do related to the case. Unfortunately, most attorneys bill by the quarter hour, so this can easily rack up a tab quite quickly.

There would be a lot of testing to make sure this happened.  These tests were usually Standardised Tests, or lower order tests, that were high stakes, meaning a lot rode on them.  Since the tests would usually be pretty much the same year in and year out, and things like school funding was riding on them, schools learnt how to game the system to make sure they would keep getting their funding.  They would only teach what tended to appear on these tests (teaching to the test) which means the scope of education became very narrow.  

Also, because it was only about min. standards, classrooms became like a convoy, only moving at the pace of the slowest child.  The more gifted children ended up only being taught what the slowest children in the class were ready for because funding was tied to those slowest children.  

There was the complaint that the NCLB act made it seem like everyone was capable of succeeding at the min. standards, which just isn't true.

Yeah, they happen more often in ""Tornado Alley"", but even then, it isn't often enough to call for a full scale evacuation of the entire middle portion of our country. Even when tornadoes do touch down, they don't always touch down in urban areas. Yes, when they do is terrifying and tragic, and the media is all over it. When a tornado touches down in someone's field, the most you'll get is the local news reporting a touch down. Not every tornado deals hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.

Most tornadoes are much smaller, and most tornadoes don't strike densely populated areas.  When they do hit, they're not like hurricanes, tornadoes hop around.  One house can be flattened, while the house next door is barely touched.

Large swaths of what is considered Tornado Alley are also floodplains, that sit right on top of a huge aquifer.  That means the water table is really high, and basements are impractical for private residences.  Above ground ""safe rooms"" - basically closets reinforced with steel and concrete - are becoming more popular, but I wouldn't bet on how well those would hold up to a direct hit from an EF4 or EF5.  Most large public buildings do have a shelter (as do a lot of mobile home parks) but that's no guarantee.

Air is not very good at absorbing heat from our body. At around 70ºF, the point where air can no longer take heat from our body is reached, and we become uncomfortable. (Also being sweaty is unpleasant)

Water is much better than air at taking heat from our body. The point where water can no longer take heat from our body is much closer to 100ºF, so it feels nicer at much hotter temperatures. (Also, our pores open up, which feels nice and we are in control of the temperature too.)

OwariNeko,"When you take a shower the water is continually renewed. This makes the temperature of the water that hits you very stable. Air around you, in comparison, has a fluctuating temperature because of air currents, which is why a breeze on a hot day feels cold.

Okay. If you shower in water that is at or slightly above your core body temperature, your body will be warmed up by the water, but just slow enough for your body to sweat the heat away. Air at the same temperature should, basically, feel the same. So why is the room hotter? Now, it's unclear to me exactly what the scenario is, but usually you wear clothes when you're in a room. The clothes would act as insulation and make it harder for your body to cool down. I've had my own sauna. When it was at 40^o C (body temp. is 37,5) I'd occasionally get chills and feel cold, so my experience is different from yours. I also find hot baths very pleasant, but when I take long hot baths I get dizzy in a way I don't in a sauna at the same temp.

Now consider very cold and very hot water.
Very hot water, at boiling temperature is impossible to bathe in. However, a scientist has shown that it is possible for both dogs and humans to spend at least 5 minutes in a room at the temp of boiling water without any lasting effects. You can even put your hand into an oven at 220^o C without feeling any considerable discomfort, but put a hand in water at 100^o C and you'd feel immense pain and get nasty burns. So at high temperatures, water is certainly worse than air.

Resistive:  This touch screen is one found on some older touch screen cell phones and tablets, and on things like kiosks.

When pressure is applied, the current flows from one panel to the next completing the circuit. These types of screens have different ways of deciding where exactly the screen was touched, and are usually only able to determine one point at a time. 

Capacitive: These screens can be found in modern cell phones, and use actual glass. This is the kind of screen you see shattered in an Iphone. The screen consists of a thin layer of insulating glass coated in a thin transparent conductor. Since your finger is also an electrical conductor, your touch disrupts the electrostatic field of the screen.

In general, if you don't speak, when the cops are questioning you, they'll keep at it for as long as they can reasonably explain wasn't cruel and/or unusual.  As long as they give you bathroom breaks, food, water, and some sleep, that can go quite long...until they reach what has been concluded and upheld through repeated court rulings to be the time at which they have to take you before a judge/magistrate/court commissioner to be officially charged: within roughly 48 hours.

If you don't speak even to verify your identity and address, they may book you in as John Doe of No Known Address, which will prevent you from ever getting pre-trial release (either on your own recognizance or on bail), because they can't guarantee where to go find you if you fail to appear.  So even if you are eligible for bail or release without bail pending trial because your crime was minor and/or your record is minimal or non-existant, you'll just sit in jail until you speak or go to trial.

If you don't speak to the judge/magistrate/commissioner who explains your rights and charges, and acknowledge that you understand them, and understand the assigned court date for your initial appearance, they'll try to see if you need an interpreter and aren't answering simply because you don't understand English; or if you're deaf and/or mute, or otherwise disabled or ill; 
they may recommend or order that the jail staff take you for a medical and psychological evaluation.

If you don't speak at all to your cell mates while awaiting trial, you'll likely be abused by them in any of a whole range of imaginable ways.

If you don't speak to the judge at your initial appearance, s/he'll automatically enter a plea of ""not guilty"" on your behalf.  That's the standard throughout the nation (U.S.), established by multiple court decisions and rulings.

If you don't speak to your lawyer, s/he will still make an effort to put on as good a defense for you as possible without information and/or assistance from you, which will be greatly diminished.

When your lawyer informs the judge at the start of trial that they need more time to prepare a defense because you won't speak to them, the judge will try to speak with you to figure out what's going on, because s/he needs to determine that your trial is fair.  A big part of this is making sure you understand what's going on and can participate in a vigorous defense.  If you don't speak to the judge for that process, you'll likely be sent for a competency examination: a psychological and medical evaluation to determine if you are ""competent"", which means if you are of a sufficient mental state to understand the process you're being subjected to and what the possible consequences, to decide whether it's sufficiently fair in our system to actually try you.  They examine whether you are sane, aware, not ill or injured, not disabled, sufficiently intelligent and educated, faking some problem, etc.

If they find you competent, they'll try you, decide guilt or non-guilt, and either release you or sentence you based on that finding.

If you insist on maintaining silence at times when your speaking can't possibly incriminate you in any way, like answering ""Is your name BlueLand3r?"", and keep it up beyond all reasonable efforts from the judge to explain to you that you don't have a right to not answer administrative questions like you have a right to not answer incriminating questions, the judge may delay your trial and jail you for contempt of court.  Usually they handle contempt by jailing you for a few days, then bringing you back to court and asking questions again to see if you'll answer.  If not, you get a few more days, and another chance.  Then a few weeks, and another chance.  Then a couple of months, and another chance.  The judge will balance how long and how many times s/he does that to try to get you to speak, against a limitation they have to meet by assuring that you get a trial for your charges within a reasonable enough time to meet the requirement for a ""speedy"" trial.  That just means it can't be unreasonably delayed, and since your continued silence is contempt of court and they have the right under the law to punish you for that, they have lots of leeway in how long/how many times they do it.

If it senses one or two wheels suddenly slowing, it activates a solenoid that pulses the pressure in the break lines. Allowing the wheel(s) to begin rolling for a split second and regain traction, before apply pressure again. Anti lock systems are more about maintaining control than they are about decreasing stopping distance. Super modern systems work with accelerometers and the traction control to pulse individual break lines in order to improve traction, and decrease the chances of skidding weather the brakes are applied or not.

Typically the front wheels (that do most of the braking) lock up first, and then the rear (if you're braking hard enough or on a very slippery surface). 

The senors are tied to a computer that monitors the speed of each wheel. If it senses that (a) you are hitting the brakes and (b) one wheel is turning at a different speed than the others it will engage the ABS and pulse the brakes for you. It can make this measurement very quickly, so even if you panic stop and attempt to lock all 4 wheels up immediately, there's still enough time to tell that you've locked up. 

Changing tire diameter (by putting on different size rims), especially in cars with different size tires on the front and back, can mess up ABS systems because the whole system is based on making sure the tires are spinning at the same speed. ",null,0,cdk4scx,1r6ohf,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

1. When you generate electricity, it has to be used immediately. Or, it can be stored in a battery. If not, things can blow up.

2. Batteries are really expensive. To store energy for a house would be astronomically expensive.

3. Home solar setups generate electricity when the home uses the least electricity. On the opposite end, the home uses the most electricity when the solar panels generate no electricity.

4. Currently, homes with solar sell excess electricity to the grid during the day. At night, they buy the electricity they need. This results in little to no charge for home owners.


With that in mind, the central question of the debate is on the cost of infrastructure. The utilities provide a connection to home with a fixed cost. When a solar home effectively uses no electricity, the cost of the pole and wires is shifted to non-solar homes. Without the connection, solar homes would need batteries to store and use electricity. This would pretty much make home solar power prohibitively expensive.

Electric utilities wants to change the rate structure so solar home pay for infrastructure cost. Solar industry don't want that because it makes solar less attractive.

iheartbbq,"I keep this around for just such an occasion:

* Detroit is founded in 1701 as a trading outpost on the edge of the Detroit River, first main terminus on the westward expansion. 

* Detroit rises in power as a logging hub, the vast deciduous and northern coniferous forest are leveled and shipped by boat back east, creating the original fortunes of the city.

* The late 1800s saw a growing city often called the Paris of the West. Major building projects began in the city's hub and rail lines were routed to Detroit from the east through Canada and out to Chicago. The lumber barons were investing in real estate and the architecture of the time reflects magnificently. The hub and spoke road system is adopted, but crucially is not rigidly adhered to. Main line roads radiate from the downtown hub, but secondary roundabouts and opposite diagonals are not constructed. 

* At the turn of the century, the auto industry explodes. Albert Kahn creates an architectural model still in use today that allows for rapid construction of space-efficient factories. Factories are built almost as fast as they can be. At this point, Detroit begins installing a street car system on its main line roads. Henry Ford establishes the $5 day. Ford is viciously anti-union and rumblings of union formation at the time are knocked down by Ford's generous pay levels. Word spreads and poor black southerners begin moving to Detroit in droves. The city housing stock explodes to accommodate this new population and vast tracts of land become identical row houses all built in the 1910-20 era. 

* The first section of roadway is paved with concrete in Detroit on the Woodward corridor. As poorly maintained and expensive brick and dirt roads give way to durable concrete roads, more people begin using cars and the auto industry continues expansion.

* Prohibition hits Detroit hard. The city's proximity to Canada encourages illicit importation of alcohol and a vast underground of speakeasies. Organized crime takes hold in Detroit and the City government becomes corrupted. Government culture shifts towards bribery and intimidation. 

* By the start of WWII, Detroit is economically the most powerful city in the country. Its companies are making money on both cars and foreign military equipment contracts. When the US enters the war, all manufacturers are retasked to produce ""the arsenal of Democracy"" tanks, planes, military trucks, etc roll out of Detroit's factories and while many other cities suffer under rations, Detroit profits. Due to the draft, many of the factory workers are at war and although 2.5M African Americans registered for the draft, a maximum of 700,000 were declared fit and served at any given time. Due to the economic opportunity in the factories, even more African Americans moved to Detroit. 
Following the war, the imbalance in certain government contracts meant some companies had advanced technology relevant to consumer markets while others did not. Ford and General Motors benefited greatly with technologies applicable to passenger cars while Packard and Chrysler struggled after receiving mostly airplane-related contracts. Returning GIs found a city with an increasingly black racial makeup and racial tensions began escalating. 

* By the 1950s Detroit was at the height of its population with 1.8M, but violence became endemic owing to racism and government corruption. By this time the Teamsters, UAW and various Gangsters had staggering political influence and were bending the laws to the benefit of labor and detriment of business. The Eisenhower Freeway System comes to Detroit and slices the city to shreds. The highly inefficient hub-and-spoke road system means regular cross-city transit is very slow. The freeway system is routed indiscriminately through poor and immigrant neighborhoods. Whole neighborhoods are demolished or cut in two, fragmenting the entrenched communities. It is very obvious that rich cities are carefully routed around. This sows deep seeds of resentment amongst poorer Detroiters. The completed freeway system allows for living in outlying towns formerly too far for a practical commute. Automobile ownership soars and ridership on the street cars plummets, by 1956 the street car lines are closed. 180,000 Detroiters have left by 1960. Chrysler issues major layoffs in 1961. Packard goes out of business and the mile long Packard Plant closes. 

* It's a hot summer day in 1967. A police raid on an illegal bar escalates to police brutality and African American retaliation. The incident was the match that lit the fuse on a powder keg. Five days of rioting left the city decimated. 43 dead, 1189 injured, more than 7000 arrests, and more than 2000 buildings destroyed. The riots were viewed by whites as a sign of things to come and what had been a slow stream of whites leaving the city for the suburbs exploded to a flood. White flight was in full effect. By 1980 470,000 Detroiters have left. 

* The Coleman Young era is a city descending into madness. Rapid depletion of the city population, an incredibly inept and corrupt government, and the rise of crack cocaine as the street drug of choice lead to extreme violence. Although the police force is up, the police are not much better than the criminals. Young is known to have had shady dealings with a great number of organizations, but no police organization will investigate him. It is during this era that massive projects are undertaken to attempt city revitalization. The Renaissance Center, People Mover and Joe Louis Arena included. One of the most controversial was the completion of the Poletown Plant, a GM plant built after the mayor evicted a large portion of neighborhood and razed it. Considerable city funds were directed away from fundamentals and towards these ends. The effects of these large projects were fragmentation of neighborhoods and bad blood between residents and the government-business partnerships. In 1989, the iconic Michigan Central Station closes. A city income tax on residents, workers, and businesses is established to supplement dropping property tax revenues.

* 1994, the North American Free Trade Act passes. Ross Perot's prediction is correct and the biggest [sucking sound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_sucking_sound) in the country is centered right over Detroit. The auto industry races to set up ""maquiladora"" along the border of Mexico. These towns are little more than dusty villages but in five years they'd be filled with factories churning out subassemblies with zero value added tax or tariffs imposed. Local suppliers and large specialized sub-assembly plants in Detroit begin closing, labor rates in Mexico under $2 an hour which puts American workers out of competition. The same model will be applied when China woos manufacturers in the 2000s, but their ~75 cent labor rates are even more enticing. (*thanks for the section suggestion [u/y2knole](http://www.reddit.com/user/y2knole)*)

* By the late 90s projects to restore downtown begin. Massive sporting arenas (Ford Field and Comerica park) are constructed while neighborhoods continue being hollowed out. The renovation of downtown continues through the early 2000s and defunct neighborhoods such as Brush Park and Corktown are being purchased by speculators. The city government is heavily in debt, however in 2003 it's not running deficits. As the city enters the new millennium, its population is below 1M for the first time since the 1920s

* The housing and banking crisis cripples the city. Rising property values plummet and speculators and developers pull out. The city pushes on with ambitious riverfront projects hoping to lure citizens downtown. Automakers and suppliers lay off thousands and the city's revenue disintegrates. Jefferson North plant closes. Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick is indicted on corruption charges. The police force is sliced down and police respond primarily to violent crime calls only. A series of police commissioners are fired following corruption investigations.

* Mayor Dave Bing is elected and his straight-talking, no baloney style chafes city council. The new mayor proposes bold plans to bring the city finances in line with its receipts, including closing down sections of the city and relocating population, selling or leasing Belle Isle, and restructuring the city charter. All are shot down following political infighting. Downtown development has been successful and the downtown district is now a major entertainment location. Investors are buying and renovating major downtown structures formerly vacant. Some downtown neighborhoods are at 100% occupancy, however this effect is concentrated and vast stretches remain vacant and essentially urban prairie. Jefferson North plant re-opens and GM invests heavily in the nearby Hamtramck plant. Special economic zones such as TechTown are centers of innovation. Outlying neighborhoods slowly disintegrate and scrapping rages out of control. Vacant homes in these areas are stripped of plumbing, HVAC, and wiring within days of becoming empty, rendering them essentially useless for market sale. The population is below 700,000 in spite of urban renewal in concentrated areas. 

* The Governor of the state declares the city in a financial emergency and appoints Kevyn Orr as emergency financial manager, effectively rendering Detroit's elected government impotent. Orr analyzes the city finances and offers a 10 year budget plan the council accepts (although primarily a ceremonial vote). Orr files bankruptcy proceedings, which are currently being adjudicated. 

**Edit:** I should add a point about the late 90s early 2000s. During the nationwide housing boom, lax regional zoning restrictions led to developers like Pulte buying enormous tracts on the outside of the metropolitan area and constructing instant neighborhoods at an incredible rate. The greater metropolitan area grew markedly in diameter during this time. Following the market crash in 08, huge numbers of these homes went for practically nothing which in turn drove market values across the city down, making the exodus from Detroit in the next four years even easier. The greater metropolitan area faces a serious issue of infrastructure upkeep, as so many new roads, drainage systems, electrical, gas and water lines were laid that flagging municipal tax revenues will cause major maintenance issues in the next decade. The city of Detroit operates the central water supply system for the entire region, supplying cities as far away as Flint, and could in the future be a major sale or source of income from the region.",null,2300,cdk1zkh,1r6f8w,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5131
mondrygo,"There are a lot of things I'm going to gloss over, but some of the highlights are...

Race riots in the 1960s, which is likely still a factor in the racial divide that can be seen between many neighborhoods around Detroit today.  This lead to the ""white flight"", where in the majority of the Caucasian population moved out of Detroit proper and into the suburbs.  This has caused some serious hurdles for urban development, as the population of downtown Detroit is tiny, and not big enough to merit many of the infrastructure investments needed to improve the conditions for it's citizens.  On top of that, there's very little PULLING citizens back into downtown.  Just in 2013 did they actually open a true grocery store (near Wayne State's campus).  So realize that before this year, if you lived downtown, you either did your grocery shopping at a convenience store like a 7-11, or you made the trek out to the suburbs. 

Automotive industry ties... As the autos go, so goes Detroit.  So all the hardships befalling the Auto manufacturers are felt immediately throughout the community.  Even if you don't work for an auto maker, their influence in the community through their employees and such are undeniable.

Corruption!  So Detroit was in a tough spot to begin with... uneasy race relations, and a bruised and wounded economy with no signs of real growth.  Turns out on top of that, Detroit's former Mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, is a horrendously corrupt man.  Even though he's been removed from office, we're still finding evidence of things like him appointing is family member to run something and finding that family member was embezzling money.  The one I think I'm remembering is his cousin stealing $2 million from the school system.  Detroit public schools don't have $2 million to just lose!

I could go on, but I feel those are some of the highlights, and I bet others will correct me or better elaborate.

BobSlydelsTongue,"I'm a former resident of Detroit who has extensively studied its history, culture, and present politics.  

I could give a 30 page dissertation on the topic, which I have done, but this could be much shorter.  Thus: what happened in Detroit?  Shortsightedness, greed, corruption, and dependency on easy credit.  

* __Shortsightedness__: Both public planning and private planning suffered from this.  On the private side of things, the ""big 3"" auto companies paid extremely high wages, agreed to extremely expensive retirement packages, and did not plan for an economic downturn.  Same on the public side in many respects.  On both sides, everyone believed that the economic prosperity would continue forever... 

* __Greed__: of course there is greed on the private side, but the public side greed is what actually damaged the city.  People in office were getting kickbacks (this is not a new phenomenon, I know) and were (and are) giving horribly overpriced contracts to firms that couldn't get the job done... It became a sick joke... A job would be ""complete"" and the services paid for were horrible or the building or road was not done correctly and unusable - it became a joke and cliche over time.  

* __Corruption__: this goes hand-in-hand with the greed.  The public officials in Detroit quite literally had their own little gangs... profitable businesses which weren't part of the in-crowd would be forced out of the city, the permits would be denied, taxed at higher rates (or taxes were only collected from them).  

* __Dependency__: this happens constantly with individuals all the time, but when a city government does it, it becomes monstrous; addiction to easy credit.  The city government was bailed out by Jimmy Carter (IIRC) and that didn't solve anything... The city government then expected to have its bills paid by the state or the federal governments ever since; that credit addiction put the nail in the coffin.  

The story goes on; but those 4 areas are the gist of the story.

yellowtowel1,"Basically it started with white flight. In the late 1960s there were huge racial tensions following the race riots. White affluent people subsequently began moving out of the city in huge numbers. The city, designed and built for a massive amount of people (it has more area than San Francisco, Boston, and Manhattan combined), now had a fraction of the population. In addition, this small, predominantly black population was devoid of the highest income earners which moved to the suburbs. This destroyed the tax base necessary to run the city. In essence, there were not enough people to pay for the city to run. While the city continued to function decently, the latest recession and the trouble with the automakers saw even more people flee the Detroit area as jobs were scarce. This exacerbated the deficit spending. Add in a couple corrupt politicians and the city is bankrupt. 

As far as the abandoned buildings, its a result of millions of people leaving the city. The resulting large land area could not be sustained properly by the remaining population or the city, thus many building deteriorated.

The biggest problem Detroit faces is convincing people it is worth living in. This is where the artist groups that have been moving in are working. In general, Detroit is just like any other big city. It has its good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods.

In the last 20 years or so cheap labor prices overseas, heavy taxation, poor financial decisions, and harsh pro-union laws have spurred a mass exodus of industry from the American Midwest.

Detroit was the heaviest hit but huge swathes of Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana eventually turned into industrial boneyards.

The factories closed (replaced by new factories in the more business friendly South or overseas) and the workers were left to flee the city or find lesser employment.

Lobozombie,"Detroit's story is the story of every major American city, for the most part, but the con flux of problems that have plagued the city were more severe than maybe any other, with the exception of perhaps Camden, NJ, among a few others. 

These problems are multiple, some general and some more specific to Detroit and it's own history-- but chief among any of them is the loss of industry. Detroit, like every other American City, exists for one reason-- industry brought people in search of work, who settled the surrounding neighborhoods. Detroit had a large and profitable Auto Industry since about 1903, when ford motors started up. 

As American prosperity grew, and workers were able to secure higher wages (after WWII) mainly though union organizing, corporations started to go to work undoing many of the labor protections offered by the New Deal, and then, finally, resorted to outsourcing most of their manufacture in the globalized economy to places like Mexico and China. Another problem was the inability of American Auto companies to adapt to more modern consumer demands-- such as worrying about fuel efficiency and mileage, designing small urban vehicles, safety, etc. The major American auto companies, i.e. Ford, Gm, christler, ect, were complacent in their market dominance and spent a great deal of money trying to prevent Americans from utilizing alternative forms of travel, (such as this incident http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy) rather than reinvesting in their companies or trying to innovate. 

A major defeat to Detroit came during the Great Recession of 2007-8, when it was revealed that many of the major auto manufacturers were investing in the types of toxic assets that banks were finding highly profitable-- and as such, they went under. Although these companies were bailed out, they continued to fail at turning a profit or to supply Detroit with jobs, and now are taking away peoples pensions to pay their bills in the ultimate slap in the face to the people of Detroit. 

So Tl&amp;DR Capitalism Happened. 

But what about outside of the Market? What about the political contributions to the downfall? 

Well like other posters are pointing out, Detroit politics are corrupt-- but no more so than any other major American city. Financial dealings behind closed doors, inept leadership, political grandstanding, shady contracting (monorail) and other issues-- this type of political behavior, while damaging, can fly in a city with an industrial base-- but when the life blood of Detroit, it's jobs, are shipped over seas, the city starts to fall apart, and the political atmosphere only contributes to the problem. 

Right now the city is in a position where it can no longer function. The city cant pay for its own upkeep, unemployment is extremely high, and the property is virtually worthless. Almost nobody-- on the governmental level, at least, has anything to say on the matter. No solutions are being offered, and much of the publicity is localized. Detroit no longer exists, really. This was a major city, and a huge industrial lung of the American body, its loss has meant the suffering of many unemployed people and the true economic cost has not been evaluated, but definitely felt. 

People like to point fingers real quick though-- at workers, at black people, at the poor in general, ect. But never the economic system, its American as apple pie not to talk about the economic system, unless you're praising it. (we have billy clubs for the people that don't.) 

The question for America is what city is next? Camden? Philadelphia? Cleavland? Our single red/blue political party is failing to give us any genuine economic policy, due to unchecked corporate influence. So theirs that. Alot needs to be turned around-- quickly. 


EDIT: A great place to get a feel for what this economic downturn has meant to some of these areas hit hardest, though the stories of individual lives and political/economic context, I'd suggest reading Chris Hedges latest book Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt.

GoldenRatio31415,"In late December of 1913 henry Ford closed his manufacturing plants for a retooling.  In January of 1914 Henry Ford reopened the assembly line, and in a bid to solve his worker turn over problem announced that the workday would be reduced from 9 hours to 8 and most workers would be paid $5/day.  This made world wide headlines because it was double what an unskilled laborer could make anywhere else.  Poor people flocked to Detroit, from all over the world, but mainly from the American south ( the civil war had ended only 50 years earlier).

Detroit experienced a boom of unskilled labor.  It was a fact that an uneducated unskilled worker, who could get an assembly line job in Detroit was earning enough to support a family up until the 1980s.  

Imagine that, a city with this kind of industrial support system could get away with many layers of mismanagement ( see all other posts). Poor schools, poor road planing, lack of public transport, racial tensions, corrupt government, etc....

State lines are set in stone and almost never change; city lines are a little more flexible — but for a city to expand and annex its suburbs is complicated politically and often meets resistance.

If we consider the whole Detroit metro area, the situation isn't nearly as bleak as if we focus on the city proper. But although the suburbs owe their existence to the city proper, they (for understandable reasons) do everything in their power to disassociate themselves from it and insist that it's somebody else's problem.",null,3,cdk8bds,1r6f8w,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

Without the auto industry being as big as it once was, the place is a hole.

As with many products, single nations/economic units tend to not control a single industry for long (Germany used to be a massive steel and coal exporter, now its much more of a banking and manufacturing hub). 

Unlike other cities in America that adapted to the changing economy, Detroit failed to do so, instead falling prey to de-industrialization (effect from the transition to service-based economy and migration to the suburbs). It's population shrank from 2 million to 700,000 in the city proper (also its tax-base).

The result is that Detroit is left with maintaining city structures meant for 2 million, but only with 700,000 taxpayers (and because the rich moved to the suburbs, the wealthier ones at that).

Detroit, through a combination of factors grew to be the most important industrial city in the US.  The automotive industry brought prosperity to the city.  However all things change...

Detroit always had issues, and did the country.  Racism, greed, crime, and pride.  As long as there were jobs and prosperity, the issues were out weighed buy the benefits, worked on, or other wise ignored.  

For a while it was had for the US auto industry to imagine others could make better cars cheaper.  And the city of Detroit didn't stop believing.  Until pretty much everyone had by the 1980s.  The decline of the US auto industry combined with the decline of heavy industry was a continuous downward slope in Detroit from the peak in the 1950's.  

A lot of bad stuff happened between the 50's and now to the city of Detroit.  A population of over 2mil dwindled to 700K.   Racial tensions screwed up so many things.  Industry moved.  

On the plus side.. 
Many problems are being addressed.  The US is making better cars (although not too many in Detroit.)  Other industries have started to move back to the city.  Many things are improving.  Many still need a good bit of work.  
Some the the political problems are starting to be cleaned up.  Some majorly corrupt members of the government are now out of office and or in jail.  Future city council members will be elected by districts instead of at large.  (There is a good chance they will be more responsible to their districts.  We'll see what happens.)

whileromeburns88,"1. The decline of the American car industry, which began in the 1970s and was largely due in part of the companies' failures to respond to consumer desires. Union demands are also often seen as a culprit, though this fails to explain the successes of the far more labor-oriented Japanese and European carmakers during this period.

2. The decline of heavy industry in general due to foreign competition. Factory automation also depressed labor demand, exacerbating unemployment. 

3. The spread of air conditioning in the 1960s made hotter areas of the southern and western United States more feasible to live in. 

4. Detroit's local government was reluctant to reduce spending and the public workforce as the city's population declined. Instead, taxes were raised, often inciting residents to move to adjacent suburbs. 

5. Population loss was also exacerbated by a phenomenon known as ""white flight"" - as laws banning discrimination in housing were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s, blacks were allowed to live in more areas of the city and schools were integrated, prompting many white residents to relocate elsewhere.

6. A vicious cycle began to take hold. As economic decline and population loss depressed tax revenues, there was fear that cutting public spending and laying off city workers would accelerate the problem. Instead, to avoid further tax increases, bonds were issued to pay for recurring obligations and the city's debt began to increase. 

7. The crack epidemic of the 1980s and the rise in violent crime that accompanied it hurt Detroit, along with many other cities. Crime prompted even more citizens to move away while also putting stress on law enforcement and creating more demand for city services, which yet again had to be funded by issuing more debt.

Enchanted_Bunny,"Detroit's problems are many fold:

First, you have a city that was built almost entirely around a single industry: automobiles. When the city peaked it was more than just the big three. Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, and other companies all had factories there.

The plentiful factory jobs attracted black (and white) southerners to move in. (My grandfather was actually one of those southerners. Chrysler got him out of the coal mines). The influx of poor black southerners led to ""white flight"" where wealthy whites moved to the suburbs en masse. The tension that resulted led to race riots in the late sixties. 

Starting in the 90s outsourcing led to a massive withdrawal of the auto industry. Factories closed, jobs were gone. It didn't just happen to Detroit either. Flint lost 30,000 jobs within a decade. Think about that.  30,000 people out of work practically overnight. In the same area. The havoc that wreaked in the local economy is still heavily impacting it and will for decades to come. 

Detroit's other problem is that it is spread too thin. Population-wise there are under a million but area wise Detroit dwarfs New York City. City services still have to cover this massive area. Police, fire, roads, sewer, water all have to be kept up but the population and tax revenue keep going down. Trash trucks have to drive several miles just to make a few stops because there are streets where only one or two houses are still occupied. 

Finally, years of corrupt city government has resulted in mis management at a massive scale.  The state placed an emergency financial manager on charge for good reason: the elected officials don't have money but want to keep spending it as if nothing has happened. Unlike the federal government, city and state governments don't have the option to be in debt for extended periods of time. 

So that, in short, is my humble opinion of why Detroit is fucked up. It's a dead city. It's like Pompeii or Troy.  It's over. It just doesn't know it yet. ",null,2,cdk7bbv,1r6f8w,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

In a nut shell, it's been a vicious cycle.  People left from the race riots in the 40s and 60s (""white-flight"").  This caused housing prices to fall.  Cities get most of their revenue for services from property taxes, and Detroit is no different.  Lower housing value means lower property tax revenue.  This means services have to be cut, which leads to lower quality of life and higher crime rates, rampant arson, you get the picture.  This causes even more people to flee the city.  The government actually owns over 50,000 properties and refuses to sell them because their value is horrifically low.  They have the audacity of refusing to sell them until their value is closer to what they'd like to see.

Fallom_TO,"There are actually 7 modes for any scale (c-c is ionian or major, d-d is dorian, e-e is phrygian and on). In various times the other modes have been more popular, but western modern music generally focusses on the ones you're calling major and minor.


When you play a group of notes together, certain ones have a quality that defines the overall chord. If you have the first, third and seventh note of the scale, that's all you need to define the sound, regardless of which note is on the bottom, top or middle. If those key notes are emphasized in a melody or chord (by being there more or by landing on strong beats, like 1 and 3 of a four beat bar) then your ear decides what mode you are hearing. In certain modes, there are some notes that just don't fit. In major, the fourth note clashes (creates tonal ambiguity for reasons that are beyond me explaining to a five year old). If you're in C Major playing a C Major chord, you can't have an F in the chord or as a note that you hang onto in the melody or it just sounds wrong. Of course if you move to another chord you can still be in the key of C and play an F (for example going to an F Major chord) but you're temporarily playing in the mixolydian mode.

insomn1ac,"Somewhat flippantly, the obvious difference is that one starts on C and the other one starts on A.

By ""one"" here I mean the _scale used by the song_, not the song itself, which might start on any note.

The note that starts (and ends) the scale is the root or tonic.  Easiest way to imagine this like you're 5 is the song is playing along, la di dah la la la, it comes to the end, big obvious ending, nothing clever or weird or ""has it finished yet?"", just the most natural, obvious, final, finished sounding ending of the song you can imagine - the note you're singing at the end there, that's the root.

Now, to really see how this makes a different to the feel of the song you need to look at the pattern made by the scale, by counting the semitones between each note.

C major = C D E F G A B C = (start), 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, (end)  
A minor = A B C D E F G A = (start), 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, (end)

So, even though they have the same notes, because the pattern of tones and semitones is assymettrical (i.e. look at a piano keyboard, the black keys are not simply alternating, they bunch into groups of 2s and 3s with a gap between), if you start in a different place, the pattern of intervals between the notes becomes different.  And that makes the scales have a different feel or mood.",null,0,cdk2fal,1r6bny,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
Back41DayOnly,"In western music we have 12 separate tones with traditional scales containing [usually] 7 different tones, until the tonic repeats in a different octave [oct = 8, eighth note is the repeated tonic]. Basic harmony is any two notes played at the same time, the interaction of the two pitches, constitutes harmony. Some harmonies sound really good [namely 3rds and 6ths in both major and minor variations], some harmonies sound particularly strong, but seem to lack definition [perfect fourths and perfect fifths] and some harmonies don't sound very pleasant and create a lot of tension [2nds and 7ths, diminished or augmented fifths, augmented 4ths].

When noticing that 3rd's and 6th's sound sweet [or sorrowful if they happen to be of the minor variety] and Perfect intervals sound strong but lack definition, when you combine the two into a chord, you get the best of both worlds.

Basic chords are formed with first the root note, then the note an interval of a third above it [major or minor depending on your key], and then the perfect 5th in relation to the root note, which happens to be another third away from the previous note. Now that we know how to construct chords, we can apply it to the scales we already know.

The chromatic 12 tone scale from which we pull our tones from consists of:
A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#
An ""a minor"" scale consists of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, [A]

Building chords in order of the scale degrees we get:

- a minor: A, C, E [it is a minor chord because the C is a minor third up from A or 3-half steps, as well as a perfect 5th consisting of 7 half-steps]
- b diminished: B, D, F [it is diminished because it has a minor third interval as well as a diminished 5th as opposed to a perfect 5th, 6 half steps instead of 7 half-steps]
- C Major: C, E, G [major third, perfect 5th]
- d minor: D, F, A [see notes above for major/minor definitions]
- e minor: E, G, B
- F Major: F, A, C
- g minor: G, B, D

Versus the chords for C Major in order of their scale degrees:

- C Major: C, E, G [see notes above for major/minor definitions]
- d minor: D, F, A 
- e minor: E, G, B
- F Major: F, A, C
- g minor: G, B, D
- a minor: A, C, E
- b diminished: B, D, F

Same notes and same chords, just in a different order right? So how does one sound one way and another sound the other way? Tension and resolution.

Western music is built around tension and resolution. That's why a one chord song is incredibly boring. There is no tension, there is nothing driving the music forward, there is nothing to resolve. How do we create tensions then? Remember those ugly intervals we spoke about earlier? We use those, but not directly. We hint at them.

If C major is our tonic note, the best way to create tension is to have a note that is very close to it. In this case B is a half-step underneath the tonic note of our key [also known as the leading tone because our ears want to be lead to the tonic when we hear it]. If we play a chord with a B in it and then resolve that note to C, it is a very satisfying resolution of tension.

The V chord [in this case G Major: G, B, D] is a very pleasing chord to resolve to I [C major: C, E, G] because the G note is common between the chords, the B resolves a half-step away to our tonic and the D resolves a full-step to E. The notes are very close together and the G glues both chords together by remaining static. It's also a very strong resolution because the V chord is built on the note a perfect 5th above the tonic of our key. Chords that are a perfect 5th or perfect 4th apart sound good one after the other because of the circle of 5ths, which is what ties various keys together [this would require a more in-depth discussion for another time].

We can also create tension with the vii' chord [b diminished, B-D-F], but the diminished 5th can make this a pretty ugly sounding chord if not used sparingly or resolved in a good way. The other chords function as mild tension creating chords [other than the ii or II chord, which is a bit of an oddball ] and can lead into each other fairly well without demanding resolution, or they can be used to lead to the dominant chords which really sound great when resolved to the tonic.

So how does this relate to ""a minor?""

If we focus on the tonic note being 'a,' playing a series of chords that resolve to C Major isn't going to get our point across, it will sound like we modulated to a different key [the relative major in this case. All the same notes, just focusing on a different tonic].

To make a song sound like it is in the key of ""a minor"" we need to build tension and resolve to the chord 'a minor.' The best way to do this is to utilize the 'v' chord in relation to the key of 'a,' which traditionally would be 'e minor.' The chord being built on the 5th scale degree, thus sharing that tone between the two chords and causing the effect of the root of the chords to be a perfect fifth apart [remember, our brains like that interval], creates a really great resolution of the tension.

Here's the extra trick though. V to I or V to i, sounds much better than v to i or v to I. To remove that from music theory speak, a major chord built on the fifth scale degree resolving to the tonic of the key [whether it is major or minor] sounds MUCH better than the minor chord built on the fifth scale degree resolving to the tonic of the key.

But why? The difference is only one half-step in one of the notes! It's because that particular note is the one closest to the tonic. If that note is only a half-step away, it creates more tension and therefore sounds better when it finally is resolved.

So if you really want to make a song sound like it's in ""a minor."" Instead of playing an 'e minor' chord [which is what we would build if we strictly used only the notes in the key], play an 'E Major' chord, because that 'G#' wants to resolve to 'a.'",null,0,cdk45ag,1r6bny,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
frobnic8,"One quick bit: Scales are really just the ordered notes of a key, and I think what you're really asking here is more ""What makes a song be in one key and not another?""

Lots of things identify a song, the rhythm, the particular instruments, the lyrics (if it has them), but the bit we need to talk about is the chord progression. Let's break that down.

The chord progression means the different chords the song goes through. I hate this phrase, but if a song is a ""musical journey"" then the chords are the places you go along the way.

Okay, whatever, so what's a chord? One cheap answer is ""three notes played at the same time"", but that's not what we care about here. (That's a lie, it's actually 3 or MORE notes, but don't sweat that too much right now.) Each chord, like each key, has a note that is the ""start"" of the chord. This is the one the rest of the notes are built on top of. But that's all factual junk.

Basically, a chord has two things going for it. A note it starts on, and a type. Major and minor are two types. Minor is the sad sounding one, and major the more normal/happy one.

Big point I'll come back to in a minute here: It's the TYPE of chord that changes how it sounds, *the starting note doesn't really mean anything on it's own*. A C major chord is just as happy sounding as G major one. It's only when you play one chord after another that the different starting notes matter. More on this in a second.
For any melody, you can pick a chord for each note that has the melody note in it. (There are lots of options, really, though we as people have decided on a set we think usually sounds more ""right"" than others.) Anyway, that's the chord progression for the song, i.e. a set of chords that one after the other to fit the melody.

So we've got a chord progression, which is a set of chords, which is just 3 notes that start somewhere on the scale and that have a major or minor (or other type) kind of ""vibe"".

The key of a song, is based on chord in the progression is the ""home base"" chord. And this is really a by ear sort of thing to pick out. I can give you rules of thumb, but they are often wrong.

For example, the chord the song starts on, and even more so ENDS on is usually the same as the key. If it starts with a G major chord and ends with a G major chord, odds are the songs in G major, but not always. :/

The real thing that makes the key is that home base part. Remember when I said that, by themselves, any major (or minor) chord sounds kinda like any other of the same type? Well the chord progression is what makes the note the chord starts on matter, and THAT'S what makes the song be in a certain key.

After the first few chords in a song, your brain pretty much picks one (often the first, sometimes the second for details that aren't helpful here) to be ""home"" or... to be the ""chord place"" the song starts,... the (if you can stand the phrase) place where the song begins it's ""musical journey"". That is, the /key/ the song is in.

Sudden that G major chord sounds different from the C major chord because we started the song on C major, and now G major is further away from the place we started. In this specific example, (if you play it out on a keyboard this is easier to see) the notes in the G major chord are all the ones AROUND the note C (the main note of the key our ear has adopted as home). That makes it sound to your ear like we're ALMOST back home at C, and the G chord sort of pulls towards it.

The big point here is that the key of a song is the chord that our ear adopts as the base station of the song that we use as a reference point for other chords until the song is over.

So to get back to your question (thanks for hanging in there!) the key of C major and A minor use the same notes, but a song is in C major if the chord progression tends to start, come back to a lot, and end up on C major chords when you pick chords that fit the melody.

You start writing the code for level 1-1. You write code to add some blocks where they go, put a goomba in, put the pipes, etc. Then you write code to keep track of where Mario is, how he jumps, and what to draw on the screen depending on where he is. Awesome, level 1-1 is working perfectly.

Now it's time for level 1-2. Hmm...well this level also has blocks, and goombas, and pipes. So I'll just copy the code from level 1-1 and paste it here. And Mario still moves around and jumps, so I'll copy that code too. Now level 1-2 is working. We're making great progress. Sure, 90% of the code here is the same as from level 1-1, but it works so we won't worry about it.

Now we've done this for a lot of levels. We have worlds 1 through 4 done! But uh oh, we just discovered a bug in the code that makes mario move around. And we've copied this code into all 16 levels we've coded. Ok, so we'll just go through all of them and fix the bug. That's kind of tedious, but it works.

Then someone else comes along with a brilliant idea. What if instead of writing separate code for all our levels, we made up a way to put how a level looks into a text file. Like maybe one line would be ""block 23 9"" which means that on the 23rd column of our level, there's a block 9 squares above the ground. Now we can save all our levels in files, and then just write code once that will load the file for a level, then draw that level, control how Mario moves around in it and jumps, and all of that. We don't have to copy and paste it for each level anymore, we only have to fix bugs we find in one place.

The way developers make different games with the same engine is because the engine is the ""how"", not the ""what"". The engine controls how the character moves but not what the character looks like. The engine controls how a bullet fires, but the developers can add in multiple weapons without necessarily having to write additional code. They can just specify ""Weapon X has a rate of fire of 700 rpm, the bullets shoot at 1200 fps, the magazine size is 20 rounds, and here's an image file of how the gun looks"" and the game engine turns that into a functional weapon.

The hope is that they will eventually find a common trigger for an ""engram""  *look that up*    TBH the ideas are actually really solid.   I stopped because I mistakenly had included my sister in this one memory and had all kinds of new resentment.  I went to visit my sister at her house after my auditing and confessed my resentment, she reminded me that she had in been 3000 miles away during aforementioned event. So that was it for me and scientology.

MrOnionMaster,"From Halupka. M. (2014) The Church of Scientology: legitimacy through perception management, Politics and Religion, p. 4-6:

&gt;""Scientology, as a religious practice, draws heavily from L. Ron Hubbard’s concept of Dianetics. First published in an article for Astounding Science Fiction, Dianetics was initially promoted as a scientific self-help system (Kent 1999). Dianetics suggests that the mind is comprised of two sections, the reactive mind and the analytical mind. The analytical mind is described as the portion of the mind which: “...thinks, observes data, remembers it and stores data” (Scientology 1998, p. 16). The reactive mind serves as the source of an individual’s: “... fears, emotions, pains and psychosomatic illness...” (Scientology 1998, p. 16). Scientology doctrine states that an individual’s spiritual trauma is sequentially recorded upon one’s time track and, ultimately, manifests itself as the reactive mind (Scientology 1998). Hubbard claimed that, through singling out these subconscious experiences and confronting them, the reactive mind could be cleansed, alleviating both mental and physical anguish. However, individuals practicing the techniques soon highlighted experiences coinciding with what they described as past lives. Confronting the issue, Hubbard expanded his writings to include the concept of an immortal soul (referred to as the thetan) and went on to suggest that the reactive mind was accumulative through reincarnation. The introduction of this spiritual component marked the foundation of the Scientology doctrine.

&gt;Scientology belief states that man is inherently good. It is the accumulation of the reactive mind that creates a disposition towards negative behaviour within the individual. As the thetan is immortal, the reactive mind represents many lifetimes’ worth of spiritual anguish. Through the utilisation of Dianetics, an individual can cleanse their reactive mind, ultimately achieving a: “new state of spiritual awareness called Clear” (Scientology 1998, p. 16). The concept of Clear is best understood as a form of enlightenment, derived, in part, from the Buddhist concept of Bohdi (Kent 1996; Flinn 2009). Within Scientology, an individual’s progression towards this state is achieved through the central religious practice of auditing. Auditing is a: “precise form of spiritual counselling between a Scientology minister and a parishioner” (Scientology 1998, p. 33). The minister, drawing upon the religion’s ‘basic truths’, guides the parishioner towards significant moments located within the reactive mind. This process is aided through the use of an electropsychometer, an E-meter (Wallis 1977). The E-meter works under the understanding that each significant traumatic experience on an individual’s time track holds a very minute amount of electrical energy. The E-meter allows the auditor to locate these instances and work through them with the participant. Here, Scientology requires increasing level of ‘donations’ to progress through these levels. The Church’s justification for this practice is that higher levels require more advanced ministers, and are therefore more expensive (Scientology 1998; Kent 1999; Melton 2009).

&gt;Hubbard argued that man had been misled by the idea that he had a soul. Rather, he suggested that man is a spiritual being, who has both a mind and a body (Scientology 1998). That is, man is thetan reincarnate- life energy housed in flesh. Hubbard argued that thetans were the creators of the universe, simultaneously willing themselves into existence. This lends itself to the Scientologist belief that man is inherently good, as man is an immortal spiritual being, free from original sin. The physical universe, comprised of MEST (Matter, Energy, Space and Time): “encumber the thetan and cause it to act in contrary to its true spiritual nature” (Scientology 1998). In this way, thetan exist within the physical universe and, through a continuous state of reincarnation, are negatively affected by MEST, losing true spiritual identity. As such, achieving a state of clear is seen as cleansing the reactive mind, allowing the thetan to realise its true spiritual nature, resulting in a state of enlightenment.""

JamboMcQuambo,"**Why do dogs have a distinct wet smell?**

1. Smell is the reaction between receptors in the nose/mouth and odorous molecules in the air.  
2. Water vapor is an excellent medium for transporting those molecules to your nose, *and* water increases the volatility of the odor molecules (makes the reaction with your smell receptors more likely to occur).  
3. Water vapor is especially good at transporting those smells from a dog *that are water soluble*.

So these water soluble odorous molecules are on your dog (and every other dog) all the time, but when they get wet they are more likely to leave the dog's skin, they're more likely to travel to your nose, and once they get to your nose, you're more likely to smell them.

**Why do they all have the same smell?**

The water soluble odor molecules are mostly made from organic acids. These acids are produced when bacteria on dog's skin digest oils on dog's skin. The organic acids on dogs skin tend to be pretty similar across many dogs, and they tend to produce a similar smell.

**Then why don't all dogs smell the same when they're dry?**

Because while the acids on their skin (which you smell when they're wet) are very similar, the oils on their skin (which you smell when they're dry) vary widely from dog-to-dog based on diet, environment and genetics.",null,0,cdk0ld9,1r689q,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

During the Cold War there was the thought-doctrine of ""mutually assured destruction"" -- basically, ""if you launch at us first, we'll launch back at you to ensure that you will be just as much radioactive dust as we are"". Basically, a decades-long twisted staring contest of playing ""chicken"", where if either side blinked than the whole world would die. Included in all this was a one-up-manship of ""I can destroy you even more than you can destroy me"" nuclear arms race. ""I have 10000 missiles!"" ""Well, I have 11000 missiles!"" and so forth.

Well, that ended when the Soviet Union collapsed. However, there's still all these missiles laying around. There've been a few disarmament treaties between the US and Russia, I believe called ""SMART"" and ""SMART 2"" or some-such... basically stating something like ""I'll destroy 7000 if you destroy 6000, and then we'll frisk each other's pockets to make sure we actually did it"". This started with Clinton, and Obama may have tried for another iteration of this type of treaty but I'm not sure. I don't know if Bush Jr was involved in anything like this.

Another thought-doctrine going on today is ""the nuclear deterrent"" -- basically, ""I've got the biggest damn weapon around here, so don't you dare think of doing crap to me"". Yes, multiple countries have the biggest stick around; they've also ganged up together with a ""non proliferation"" agreement to try to not let anyone else get their own biggest stick around.

But still, why have thousands? I'm not sure. Maybe it's because you could think, ""Well, you only have 10. I can keep attacking you until you run out of missiles."" Forget the fact that you'd be glowing as you shoot your pistol.

In any case, the process to disarm is slow. Everybody wants to jump in the disarmament game at the same time as everyone else, because no one wants to open themselves up to an attack by being the Big Humanitarian Around Town and actually volunteering to disarm all by themselves as a shining beacon of peace and love and just pray and hope that the other folks will follow suit all on their own without any accountability.",null,0,cdjzn38,1r66uv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

dcHurst,"Everyone seems aware that there is inequity but no one I meet seems to grasp the magnitude of these numbers. So bear with me while I establish what we're dealing with here.

The Gross Domestic Product, the most basic way to measure the size of an economy, of the United States is estimated to be [$16.724 trillion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). The median wage, the point where half of the population makes more and half makes less, is roughly [$28,000 a year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States).

Taking the numbers in the ""Income Distribution"" chart and assuming that everyone in a given income range earns the highest amount in that range, for ease of calculation, the lowest paid 48% of the US population earns $1.585 trillion a year, or around 9.5% GDP. 

The next 45% of Americans earn between $27,500 and $100,000 which, provided that the majority of these people will be one half of a two income family, is a really nice standard of living compared to most of the world. Collectively the earn roughly $4.522 trillion per year or about 27% GDP. 

So this chart is flawed in that the data is over three years old and it doesn't even capture information for the top 7% of earners. But it serves to illustrate that the bottom 93% of the population combined captures less than 37% of GDP in the United States. Remember that all of these numbers are very loose and weighted towards the higher end of the spectrum for someone with access to more detailed information these numbers would inevitably come out lower.

And it doesn't get better at the higher end of the spectrum. The gulf between the earnings of those who make more than 99.9% of other people and the top most .01% is actually much larger than a person in the bottom 1% and someone who earns $100,000 (more than 93% of other people). 

So why is this? How did it happen? What on earth is going on in the United States of America, land of the free home of the brave?!? Nothing, the system is working as it was intended to. Capitalism has a long and lustrous history; I would argue modern capitalism developed out of mercantilism in the Netherlands between the 16th and 18th centuries but it can be argued that all of the imperialistic governments of that era contributed to modern economics. 

Capitalism works most to the advantage of those who already have money. The system is built to ensure that they can invest that money, capital, into ideas and ventures that they deem worthy and then extract income from those ventures once they have come to fruit. 

There is a lot of talk about trickle down economics, progressive taxation, social welfare programs, raising the minimum wage, universal income disbursements and many other ways to keep the lower earning segments of the population content with taking a much smaller slice of the pie than they deserve but that is all these are; talking points. 
This is not a Republican vs Democrat; Deeply Religious vs Socially Liberal; Racist vs Minority; Us vs Them issue these are also just talking points that are used to confuse and mislead you about where you stand in society.

A systemic de facto oligarchy exists throughout the world, I'm not talking about some secret society; it has always been a fact of human nature. Before we had corporations and super rich capitalists we had industrialists, before that mercantile empires, kings, despots, tribal elders. Even in communism the antithesis of these systems a few people inevitably end up with (ruthlessly acquire) more power than all of their fellow comrades.

It was solved in the past after WWII when America was basically the manufacturing king of the world and returning GI's (and there now working wives) along with GI Bills for education, Vibrant social programs, Unions, Corporate tax rates were high 50ish% so it didnt make sense to hoard cash and off-shoring was a dream. (It actually made more sense to invest in workers since stacking cash wasnt smart so building a bigger business was the goal)

Now we're living the YANG of the YIN. The corporations have all the power and have bought our politics so they get their way. And... Of course whats good for corporations (shareholder profits) is not whats good for the bottom 90%. They want low wages, low taxes and low regulation. At this point they've basically achieved their goals to the point that people working full-time minimum wage qualify for food stamps and live at or near poverty levels.

I hope this is the worst of it and the devastating results that have resulted from the corporations domination are about to rebound back to more worker pay, rights and protections. (See efforts to raise the minimum wage). I'm not too hopeful on the speed of change since you have to undo a LOT of the political damage and until the Supreme Court does something about ""Corporations are People: Citizens United"", Voter Suppression, Etc.

The educational system plays a role in this as well. Think of the American South. It is home to the largest percentage of uneducated, or undereducated, people in the country. The schools in the South are, on average, not as good as the schools in other parts of the country, and fewer people pursue higher education in the South due largely to the cost of it.

Toastly,"In such a partisan country like America, you will get a different answer depending on who you ask. Often times the answer is completely different from someone even within the same political party. 


Aasking a typical person on the left side of the aisle (a typical 'liberal' person) why America has such a high income disparity and poverty rate, the answer will say something along the lines of there being a lack of adequate protections against poverty. Many people on the left side of the political spectrum in America feel that the social programs in place (Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, Food Stamps, etc.) are either underfunded or misused, leading to inadequate or ineffective activity from said programs. And, to some extent, they are correct. There are many cases of people exploiting Welfare programs for their own benefit, and there are definitely many social programs which, through political intervention or otherwise, are underfunded and as such ineffective in combating poverty or income disparity.


On the other seat in the seesaw, asking someone who would be considered conservative about why America has high income disparity and poverty would net a different answer. A typical conservative would note that Social Welfare programs are to the detriment to hardworking Americans, as they believe that many people just sit on their butts all day and collect a check from the government at the end of the month (I believe this is what Mitt Romney described as the '47%'). Another reason a typical conservative would state when answering the question would be to mention that regulation stifles economic growth. A typical conservative would believe that by relaxing economic regulation, everyone inherently benefits. And, to some extent on both of these points, they are correct as well. There are certainly many people that because of Social Welfare, they see no reason to even try to find a job. Additionally, there is quite a bit of evidence that economic regulation isn't necessarily conductive with economic growth.


I used the words 'typical conservative / liberal' because in America, even within the same political party, people can have vastly different opinions about how the government is run and how the government should be run.

Answer: both of us. However, American accents have actually changed *less* than what you think of as a typical ""British"" accent. Britain has many, many accents, but what most people think of as British is either the posh RP accent (think BBC newsreaders) or a more general London accent, both of which are non-rhotic. This means they don't say the ""r"" at the end of words, like ""car"" or ""heart"". 

This is a new development in the English accent that appeared some time in the 1800s, so after the United States was established. Some places in the US did get influenced by this accent (pahk the cah on havahd yahd), but most of the US and Canada remained happy saying their ""r""s.

StandardJonny,"One quick round of google-fu brings me to this:

The reason that salt stings a cut is that as the salt dissolves, it causes the fluid surrounding damaged tissues to become extremely hypertonic (which means that the concentration of salt and other electrolytes is higher than it is in normal body fluids).

Pain-sensing neurons have receptors on them that respond to a variety of stimuli. For example, there is a specific receptor that responds vigorously to capsaicin, which is the substance that gives jalapeño and habanero peppers their kick. So, quite literally, when you are adding hot pepper to food, you are (carefully, I hope!) inducing the sensation of pain to complement the other flavors of the meal.

More recently identified is a receptor that responds to changes in electrolyte concentration—such as the change that a large amount of salt induces. Thus, putting salt on a wound stimulates pain-sensing neurons in much the same way hot pepper does.

When tissue is damaged, many pain receptors become sensitized—that is, they need a much lower level of stimulation to respond than they normally would. (For example, after you have burned your mouth, try eating some spicy food that you could normally handle—ouch!) Salt may then compound the pain by further damaging injured tissues and making them more sensitive in general.

Oilfan94,"I think the hardest part of making (and selling) comic books...is coming up with really good characters.  That's probably why the same group of popular characters are always used again and again.

DkPhoenix,"There are many reasons why a publisher might reboot a single title or character.  I'll address the two biggest ones.

* To make the title friendlier for new readers. 40 to 50 years of continuity (or 75 + in the case of characters like Superman and Batman) can be pretty intimidating to catch up on.

* Comics often reference real world events, but the characters, by and large, don't age.

I'll talk more about the second problem.  The ""Big Two"" publishers, Marvel (the X-Men, the Avengers, Spider-Man, Iron Man, etc.) and DC (Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, the Justice League, etc.) handle things differently.  

Marvel tends to bend time.  For example, Iron Man's origin story is tied into events that occurred during wartime, or at least, some kind of conflict.  When he was first introduced in 1963, this was the Korean War.  Later re-tellings of his origin changed this to Vietnam, then Desert Storm.  The setting changes, but the story stays the same.  For characters that can't be separated from some historical event they come up with an explanation, like Nick Fury (anti-aging serum), Magneto (regressed to infancy by a cosmically powered being, then re-aged to adulthood), or Captain America (cryogenic suspension).

DC prefers to completely reboot their entire universe, and/or use a ""multiverse"" concept.  How they handle it isn't completely consistent from character to character.  For example, Superman has always been Kal-El, sent to Earth by his parents from the dying world of Krypton to be raised as Clark Kent, even if they have multiple versions of the character that exist on different parallel worlds in different timelimes, all within the larger DC Universe.  (Batman is handled pretty much the same.)  With characters like the Flash and Green Lantern, they prefer to pass the title and powers on to new characters.  So, at DC, for example, you've got Earth-2, which is where the WWII era heroes are.  Superman is Clark Kent, Batman is Bruce Wayne, the Flash is Jay Garrick, and Green Lantern is Alan Scott.  Then you've got Earth-1, which is the ""current"" timeline, Superman is Clark Kent (with more or less the same origin), Batman is Bruce Wayne (ditto), there have been three Flashes (with very different origins) and more Green Lanterns than you can shake a power ring at.

Seahawk_Fan,"I went through the eye of a hurricane on a US aircraft carrier just south-east of Florida. It was docked in Mayport and I believe they thought the storm was gong to miss us and we ended up staying in port too long. ( more dangerous in port for a big ship). Once they knew it might hit us we set sail.  At one point we headed south to go under it, but we ended up in its path. We had a frigate following us (for breakwater) for awhile until the waves where putting the bridge under water.  At some point the captain decided to sail into the eye of the storm where the seas where calm. We sailed in the eye of the hurricane for hours which was very surreal. If you looked up you could see a perfectly round hole in the sky and sun shinning down on us. The water was like glass and there was no waves; very weird.

deep_sea2,"If a ship is in the ocean, and finds herself in the path of a hurricane/typhoon/cyclone, there is a general procedure to maneuver out of it.  

First of all, let me explain a bit about the formation and path of the hurricane.  Hurricanes form in the Northern Hemisphere in the Atlantic and head west/northwest towards North America.  Once hurricanes get to about 20 degrees of latitude, they turn around and head towards Europe.  Hurricanes only form north of about 5 degrees of latitude.  Anything closer to the equator does not have enough Coriolis force (deflection force cause by the rotation of the Earth) to sustain the hurricane.  Winds in the hurricane rotate in an anti-clockwise direction.  The speed of the hurricane crossing the ocean increases and decreases the total wind speed of the hurricane.  If the winds of the hurricane go in the same direction as its path, the wind speed is higher.  It's like if you stick your hand out the car window while driving; the existing wind is amplified by the speed of the car.

A hurricane is split into two hemispheres: the dangerous semi-circle and the navigable semi-circle.  In the dangerous semi-circle, the wind goes in the same direction as the path of the hurricane.  The dangerous semi-circle is the right side of the hurricane.  The navigable semi-circle is where the wind direction and the path counter each other (resulting in less wind).  The navigable semi circle is the left side.

If a ship discovers that she is in the path of the hurricane, there are certain maneuvers that she does.  If the ship finds herself in the dangerous semi-circle, she steers with the wind on her starboard bow and steams as fast as she can until she comes clear.  If the ship finds herself in the navigable semi-circle, she steam with the wind her stern until she clears.  If the ship is in the direct path, then she steams towards the navigable semi-circle.  The is the recommended way to sail out of a hurricane.  Naturally, the ship will do whatever she can to avoid the hurricane before she gets close, such as sail towards the equator, where the hurricane cannot go.",null,1,cdk470p,1r60wu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,11

pseudononymous1,"I suppose it depends on what the circumstances are. In cases like Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, there wasn't anything that could be done until we got our hands on the Rosetta Stone. 

Basically, we have two options depending on how ancient it is and if there is text surviving from it. 

If we have some sorts of texts from the language, they are compared to languages that are children of that ancient language. We can see residual words, phrases, sounds, and grammar from the children that can be compared to the parent language. We can then piece together different translatable portions so we can use context to determine other portions. It's certainly a very difficult task, and it's near impossible to make a full reconstruction without something like the Rosetta Stone in which a language still in modern use (sort of) is directly translating the unknown language.

The more challenging alternative is reconstructing an ancient language with no existing language data. In this case, the only thing that can be done is reconstruct a theoretical proto-language since there is nothing existing that can prove anything. It involves painstaking analysis of data on words, sounds, and grammar of languages born from that hypothetical language. 

It becomes a game of ""what words seem to look similar in most of these languages? how can we reconstruct a proto-form from the similarities in those similar words (fake example: wodar, wuter, woter= possibly woter?)? how can we explain places where not all languages share a similar pattern/word for something?""

Re-construction translation is also quite challenging, but fruitful and enriches our understanding of history in a big way.

CarpeMortum90,"Applied Linguistics Grad Student here. 

To start with, there are things like the Rosetta Stone. It had a completely unknown language, Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs. Fortunately, there was also Demotic, which is a much later Egyptian language and script. And, most happily of all, there was Ancient Greek. Now, linguistic and historical scholars have long known how languages like Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit are pronounced, and how they function. 

This isn't just because they have writing, but also because we are lucky enough to have language bridges between them. I.e., we can understand Latin because we can understand, say, modern Italian, and use it to understand, say, medieval Italian documents, which give us insight into how the even earlier Latin was pronounced and used. Basically our current modern knowledge can bridge to older knowledge, and that process basically brings us (Eventually) back to  the original sources. This works well when there is an unbroken written tradition. 

We were able to crack the Rosetta Stone because of the Greek on it. Academics had, since the days of Alexander the Great, kept a Greek Koine alive as an academic language, that had even survived into the 20th century. (A 20th century English Gentleman was supposed to be familiar with not only Latin but Greek as well). So scholars,especially Jean-Francois Champollion used Greek to estimate an approximate translation of the Demotic, by doing things such as counting words, and trying to take into account grammar differences, word ordering, and idiom, to make a rough translation. Then Champollion used this rough translation of Demotic as a stepping stone to translating the Hieroglyphs. Again, doing things like counting words, while taking into account grammatical and word order differences, and idioms. He then had a very rough translation of the Ancient Hieroglyphic language.

Then  he analyzed the script against the meanings, counting the symbols to determine the nature of the system. He figured it was a mixed logographic-alphabetic system. The true proof of his work came when he actually went to ancient ruins in Egypt and attempted to read the messages left there. And he could.

So, to answer your question, though the lens of the example above, here goes: If we encounter a script that we have no idea where it comes from, no provenance, the best we can do is count the symbols to determine the nature of the system. We might try to see if the visual style of the symbols tells us anything. But we couldn't know how it was pronounced, let alone what it means, without an intermediary translation, in a language we are familiar with. (~1-50 symbols suggests an alphabet, ~50-150 symbols suggests a syllabary, and ~200+ suggests a logographic system.)

tl;dr: Without an intermediate language of which we are very familiar with, it is impossible to translate or understand a mysterious script, let alone know how to pronounce it.  ",null,1,cdk549x,1r5zyt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

This will lead to an inability to distinguish different sounds in English, for example R and L, and they will confuse the two. From a native English speaker's perspective this sounds like an accent.

In it is every sound in every language in the world (well, that's the idea at least), but not every sound is found in every language. Take the Spanish ""r"" for example, it is a trill in the front part of the mouth. We don't have this sound in English, we don't carry out the trill, but we still recognize it as an ""r"" sound. In Arabic however they have an ""r"" that is a trill, and an ""r"" like in Standard English and they are DIFFERENT letters - it makes a difference in meaning which one you say. 

In India they have many languages with retroflex letters. Think Abu from The Simpsons. They have a ""d"" sound in Telugu (a language from south-east India) which is not like our ""d"" in English but it is with the tongue rolled back instead of right behind the teeth and seemingly ""softer"". To a native Telugu speaker they hear a ""d"" and automatically say their ""version"" which sounds different to a native English speaker.

Accents CAN be overcome. In most people (barring any irregularities such as a lisp) there is nothing in the physiology of the mouth that keeps you from making certain sounds.

What's been already mentioned about different regions of the world having different phonemes is absolutely correct--phonemes will affect how you say particular words.  

Accent comes from the way those phonemes translate into the actual words.  Take the English language, and the accents of the general population of the USA, vs. the accents of British English.  The letter ""r"" in the word ""are"" is pronounced differently.  

Americans (with the exception of those around New York and New Jersey, and in the South) pronounce that sound with a more grinding emphasis, known as a Retroflex approximant.  

That same letter in that word for Britons is pronounced with a looser sound, more akin to the ""h"" than the American ""r.""  This is called a Post-Alveolar Approximant. 

Now, take a Spanish speaker who learned English later in life, that ""r"" becomes an alveolar tap.  One letter, one word, three different pronunciations based on geographical phonetic interpretations.

GaakHead,"Loud sounds, particularly sounds that approach the necessary levels for causing (either immediate or accumulative) hearing damage, actually activate your sense of balance (in addition to your sense of hearing). The biological basis for this has to do with how the saccule, a structure within the ear, responds to both sound and movement. The currently favored hypothesis is that the human brain perceives noise stimulus activating the sense of balance as a form of *touch*, and as you know the sensation of touch can be very personal, desirable and intimate. In other words, loud music has a similar effect on the human brain as a baby might experience when being rocked gently back and forth by a parent. Interestingly, this relationship between loud sounds and the sensation of balance doesn't appear to be exclusive to humans. For example, many species of alligators only mate during the presence of thunder storms.

workingredditor769,"Not a psychologist,  but I know of a bit about how sound works.   

In music there are a lot of suddle sounds and harmonics.   These are at much lower volumes than the ""meat""  of the song. 

So while you still hear the basic elements of the song at a low volume.   You will hear the more discrete parts at higher volumes simply because  there is more sound to hear. 

I'll add that  essentially  what loud music does is increase the signal to noise ratio of the music.   Where any ambient  sound (car engine,  refrigerator,  computer  fans,  idiot brothers  etc..)  is considered  noise.   Higher s/n ratios result in better sound quality,  so your brain can pick up more of the detail.   You would actually  get the same result of loud music by keeping the volume constant and lowering interfering noise. 

There's also another factor at play here though.   That is the THD (total harmonic distortion)  of your sounds system.   Amplifiers and speakers  have ranges where the THD bottoms out.   Basically  where it's going to make the best quality  sound.   For most sound systems the THD will increase as you increase the volume.   However  for speakers if they aren't getting driven hard enough they will also distort at the low end of the scale.   So it's possible  that cranking it up (to a degree)  actually  improves the sound quality. 

Finally,  loud music produces high sound pressure levels.   Especially  at lower frequencies.  So there is a lot of energy in the sound waves.   This results  in being able to not only hear the music,  but feel it as well.   I won't talk too much about how this is good because  I dont know.

Since a gay couple cannot have issue  - (a legitimate heir, adoption doesn't count), it's wouldn't change anything.   

Lets say Prince George is gay, and gets married to a man in the future.  Presumably by then Charles will be King, and could choose to let him keep his place in the line of succession, or to turf him  out of it.  Just because it would be a legal marriage in the UK does not mean it meets the requirements of succession. 

But since a gay King George cannot have legitimate children (except by a previous marriage to a protestant woman) even if he becomes king on his death the crown would pass to a sibling or to Harry or Harry's children, and if not them then Prince Andrew or Prince Andrews children or their children.  

The UK has dealt with Monarchs who left the position without children before - Edward the 8th abdicated but the processes is the same, whomever is next gets a title.

In reality though--this doesn't need to happen to keep a bill from passing. A Senator can threaten a filibuster, which is usually enough. This is because the majority generally wants to get things done--and is willing to pull the bill for the time being in order to sort things out. In that way, the mere threat has become a very effective tool.

Senators have always had the right to approve presidential appointments.  Back in constitutional days, that used to take a 51-49 vote.  But then, with holds, it became 60-40.

SupremeWizard,"That is a loaded question with a multitude of heavy answers, but I will just give you a small brief to tide you over. The common consensuses in the study of human origins is that the modern human came from Africa. The reason for the varied skin tones, bone structure, and genetic dispositions is due to adapting to new environments when modern humans started to explore and settle in new lands. For example: The ""European (White?) race"" typically depicted as fair skinned, long noses, and light hair; adapted this way to accommodate the cold weather, high elevations, and general northern hemispheric conditions. Over thousands of years in northern lands with significantly less sun, melanin (the things that gives pigment to our skin) production started to decrease to allow the suns rays to penetrate the skin and stimulate the production of vitamin D. Where as in Africa, exposure to the sun is extreme and the large amounts of melanin in the skin provides a natural sunscreen to overexposure to Ultra Violet radiation. It is adaptive mutations like these that changed the relative appearance and genetic differences in pockets of human settlements. Now as for the term race...This is a combination of so many things, far too many to get into...Like you said, it's more of a social construct rather than one from a scientific standpoint. Long story short, the dominance of a particular region of humans allows that group to assert their views more aggressively. The deliberate categorization and segregation of humanity by dominate groups creates an environment in favor of said groups.

sir_sri,"Germany doesn't have a minimum wage because it has strong labour unions, collective bargaining and low unemployment. 

Rather than relying on federal legislation to set wages the expectation is that labour unions and organizations can force yearly wage adjustments.  This only really works when unions are strong, and they have laws about not paying immorally low wages - which then ends up left to the discretion of judges.  

In effect that means it has a constantly floating minimum wage - whatever your trade organization or union can negotiate (and those are enforceable by law), and whatever a judge would rule as too low.  

They do have minimum wages for some sectors too. 

&gt;What effect does this have on its economy and people?

Hmm... Germany and German people are doing very well on average earnings, but that has more to do with strong labour unions than a lack of minimum wage.  

Minimum wages are crude instruments - it doesn't really make sense to have the same minimum wage in the biggest city in the country and the smallest.  Germany skirts around this problem by giving labour a lot of power in negotiations, and letting you go to court and fight out whether or not your wages are too low.  As an employer you don't want to be on the losing side of a court case, (or even dragged into one), and the 'middle class' is well enough protected in germany that you don't have any strong downward pressure on wages.

I believe one of the main reason to be dry air. The only other time I have gotten a nosebleed is high up in the mountains, where the air is just as dry as the desert. With this dry air your nose is more susceptible to scratches, and even if you haven't touched it at all the dryness is enough to create cuts, chances are the nosebleed is just from a cut that is healing opening up again. I found this out because a scratch in my left nostril opened up 3 mornings in a row, and my nose started to bleed as soon as I got up.

Another reason could be allergies, if you have had an itching or runny nose, or been sneezing a lot chances are there may be some minor ""rhinitis"" or inflammation of inner lining of your nose. This is very common and can happen to everyone, often causing nosebleeds. If you have had bad allergies in the past and nosebleeds are uncommon for you this might be the case.

Its not a good investment to buy a cod game anymore. A new version comes out year after year for full price. A bunch of dlc comes out over that year with some maps. Some maps are literally just copied from a previous installment. Suddenly all that dlc is worthless because come next november an even newer version is out. Rather than adding to the game they package it as a totally new game which works on the average consumer. You have a game with a few maps to play on at a time with previous maps rendered unplayable instead of a game with a large library of maps and content like youd see in games like tf2 or counterstrike.

Also the big marketing execs or who ever makes the decisions all see cod and tell their game developers to copy the formula instead of taking risks and trying something else. The artists arent allowed to do what they do well and make a truly good game because the marketing people basically say, ""This is what's hot. This sells. Make a game exactly with these features or else."" So other shooters devolve into crappy versions of Cod that dont even do what cod does well. They also try to have these tightly scripted linear campaigns but their writers may not be able to create as interesting a story as something youd see in black ops. So then you get a bland generic boring modern war story with bland generic gameplay in every other shooter out there that tries to copy cod. This basically happened with crysis 2, medal of honor, halo 4, and the battlefield campaigns. Ive seen other shooters like Alien Rage or Singularity fail for similar reasons. People forgot how to make good first person shooters. They just try to copy Cod and dont even come close.

Also the unlocking of guns and rpg elements can be fun, but its not the only way a shooter should be made. It doesnt work well for halo for example. Theres something really magical about having a game with an interesting variety of weapons and items, and fighting with others for the rocket launcher or the quad damage. That gets taken away when you can just unlock guns and always start with the berret 50 cal. I think the unlocking and loadouts actually work well for cod. It makes sense. I think it was a mistake for halo 4 and crysis 2 to try to copy that formula. I remember seeing servers in crysis 2 that banned loadouts with the grenade launcher for example. If players had to instead find it in the level which halo4 at least kept, that would keep the game on a more even playing field.",null,0,cdjw8pv,1r5lvx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

I think what is frustrating to some people is that fans of the series will literally buy the game every year regardless of reviews or how ""good"" or ""bad"" the game is. They do not care how good or bad the game is, they will buy it and play it, even if complaining the entire time.

A combination of unmaintained patent law, a patent office that doesn't have the time, or experts to review every patent as thoroughly as they should be, a reliance on courts, and of course, lobbying.

When Apple submits a patent to the patent office, it takes months before it gets approved.  In that time, it's going to be reviewed by a handful of people, but as is often the case with technology patents, it's being reviewed by people who don't really know the industry, so they have to fall back on a set of rules and conditions to determine the patent-worthiness of a product.  This becomes exceedingly messy as things get more and more complicated.

The problem with this is that Apple can effectively 'sneak' in some really odd conditions into their patents.  If you patent the iPad (which is actually several patents), it involves a lot,  and 'rounded corners' is just a small portion of it, but it's really hard for a patent officer to say, 'this is good, this is bad', because there is too much to do in a day, and they don't individually have the expertise that would often be required to make the most correct call.  They can't reject a patent without a reason either or they risk seeing themselves in court.  Prior Art is great and all, but when you have to dig through millions of patents and unpatented items to find it, it becomes less useful.

So it gets through, but that's seen as 'OK' because hey, if it's shit, someone is going to contest that in court, and all will be well, right?  

Well kind of.  The problem is that patent litigation has become hilariously expensive and it's in Apple's interest to drag their feet on the issue (specifically a review of the patent, not necessarily other related litigation).  So we are left with the shitshow that we currently are experiencing today.

Basically:  The system doesn't scale well with complexity and money.  Linear progression in technology and bankroll results in exponential increases in patent analysis complexity and review, both inside and outside of the courts.  There isn't a lot of oversight because there can't be.

DiogenesKuon,"The senate has a rule called cloture which means that a 3/5ths majority of the senate must agree before ending debate on a bill or a motion.  This has lead to a partisan tactic called the filibuster, where a minority of 41 senators can prevent the majority from taking a vote by demanding that debate continue indefinitely.  Traditionally this tactic has been reserved for the most important bills and only when the minority feels that the majority is being overly partisan or abusive.

Over the last two decades or so, though, filibuster usage has increased dramatically.  At this point there is a de facto filibuster on every single bill or motion brought forward, so even though the democrats routine have even votes to pass legislature, they can't get anything done without 60 senators voting for the legislation.

This has become increasing galling to the democrats, especially around federal nominations for judges and cabinet positions.  The democrats contend that the republicans are effectively circumventing the power of the executive branch by not allowing any nominees to branches of the government they dislike, and not allowing Obama to appoint judges with the hope that they will be able to fill those spots if they can win the presidency in 2016.  The republicans contend that the democrats are being overtly partisan with their picks, and hypocritical considering they didn't mind using partisan tactics such as the filibuster when Bush was in charge.

So the democrats are basically saying if the republicans don't allow votes on judicial nominees they are simply going to change the rules.  The cloture rule isn't in the constitution, in fact the constitution simply says that the senate gets to make up its own rules.  There is also no filibustering a rules change, which means as long as 50 democrats agree they can change the cloture rules or remove it entirely.  The fear is that this is a slippery slope towards removing minority power from the senate, and it could upset the balance of power.  It may sound like a good idea when your side has the majority, but how bad could it be the next time you are in the minority?

hellotheremrme,"Actually, one infinity can be larger than another.

For example, there are more irrational numbers than there are rational numbers, even though there are an infinite amount of each.

For example, there are as many multiples of 2 as there are multiples of 20.

Therefore, they are different sizes of infinity.

DominatedConvergence,"Many people have already posted simplified answers to this question, so I will provide one that is a bit more precise. Hopefully this'll complement the other answers.

First of all, if we have two collections of numbers, **how can we compare their sizes**? If the collections contain only finitely many numbers, like {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42} and {22/7, 3.14, 223/71, 0, -1, 2.718}, we can of course just count the number of elements in each collection. For example, the two collections mentioned above have 6 elements each, so they are of equal size. But if we try to do the same for infinite collections, we are more or less out of luck. So what do we do?

One answer (in fact, the usual one), is to think of sizes of collections in a different way. For example, when you lay the table for a lot of guests, you might find yourself not counting the number of forks or knives, and instead just making sure that every plate gets exactly one fork and one knife. This is another way to determine whether two collections of things have equal size. Just **see if you can find a way to match up every object in the first collection with exactly one object in the second collection in such a way that no object in either the first or the second collection goes unmatched**. For instance, we can once more see that the collections from the previous paragraph are of equal size. Just match them up:

|||||||
|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| 4 | 8 | 15 | 16 | 23 | 42 |
| 22/7 | 3.14 | 223/71 | 0 | -1 | 2.718 |

This way of measuring sizes actually works for infinite sets as well! For example, we can immediately show that there are as many odd positive integers as there are even positive integers by just matching every odd positive integer with the next integer, like this:

||||||||
|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | ...  |
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | ... |

To be absolutely certain that this works, my table must be made in such a way that if you give me an odd integer, I can give you the (one and only) corresponding even integer, and vice versa. And this is certainly true in this case.

To show that these infinite sizes are a bit strange, I will now show that **there are as many integers as there are positive integers**. Just pair them up like this:

||||||||
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 |  2 | 3 |  4 | 5 |   6 | ... |
| 1 | -1 | 2 | -2 | 3 | -3 | ... |

We can for example see that the positive integer 219 pairs up with the integer 110, and that the integer -73 pairs up with the positive integer 146.

Now, **let's get to the interesting bit**. How can we know that there are more decimal numbers (mathematicians call these real numbers) between 0 and 1 than there are integers? I will show that there are more decimal numbers between 0 and 1 than there are positive integers. Since the collection of integers is of the same size as the collection of positive integers, this is all I need to show.

To begin with, assume that the collection of decimal numbers between 0 and 1 and the collection of positive integers are of equal size. Then, we must be able to pair the two collections up. Imagine that we were to do this to obtain a list of all the decimal numbers between 0 and 1. It would look something like this:

Note that any of the numbers in the second row may have infinitely many digits (1/3 = 0.333333... for example). If one of the numbers has an ending decimal expansion (like 1/4 = 0.25), rewrite it with trailing zeroes (like 1/4 = 0.25000...). The trick is to now create a new decimal number by picking the first decimal of the first number, the second decimal of the second number, the third decimal of the third number, and so on and to increment all these by one (except for 9, which ""wraps around"" and becomes 0). With our assumed list above, we would get something like this:

| Original decimal number | Chosen digit | Incremented | New number |
|--:|--:|--:|:--|
|0.**1**21031... | 1 | 2 | 0.2 |
|0.8**9**2300... | 9 | 0 | 0.20 |
|0.54**5**545... | 5 | 6 | 0.206 |
|0.618**7**09... | 7 | 8 | 0.2068 |
|0.0011**1**5... | 1 | 2 | 0.20682 |
|0.333333**3**... | 3 | 4 | 0.206824 |
| ... | ... | ... | 0.206824... |

The new number that we form is then 0.206824..., and **this number is not on the list**! (Because its first decimal is different from the first decimal of the first number on the list, its second decimal is different from the second decimal of the second number on the list, and so on, so that the new number differs from any given number in the list in at least one decimal.) This method works no matter how we try to list the decimal number between 0 and 1. Just write the list down (you can't write the whole list down on actual paper of course, but you get what I mean), Then choose the decimals like above, increment them (with ""wrap around"" from 9 to 0), and create the new decimal number. So, we can conclude that **no matter how you try to pair the decimal number up with the integers, you will always be missing at least one decimal number among the pairs**. Therefore, there must be more decimal numbers between 0 and 1 than there are positive integers.

I'm aware that my explanation is a bit long, and perhaps too difficult for ELI5, but it is my firm belief that a diversity in the responses will increase the chance that one answer is good, so I contributed with this one. If you are interested in the argument I used, it is called [Cantor's diagonal argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument), since the decimals that are chosen in the construction form a diagonal.

**EDIT:** There are lots of rather confusing (and wrong) answers in this thread, and since the objective with my post was to provide a thorough complement to the other answers, I'll expand my response a bit more.

First of all, there is a fair bit of maths lingo in this thread. Perhaps the words are obvious to everybody, but in case they aren't, here's a list of some of them:

* **Natural number** -  The same as positive integer. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on are the natural numbers. (Some consider 0 to be a natural number as well. Both choices are fine in the context of your question.)
* **Rational number** - The same as fraction. Since every integer can be written as a fraction (like 7 = 7/1), this includes the integers. Examples: 0, 6/19, -12, -54/54.
* **Real number** - The same as decimal number. (Well, ""deci"" in decimal stands for ten, so when we speak of a decimal number, it is also understood that when we write the numbers down, we write them in base ten.) Examples: 0, 1, -3.7, π (pi), √2, -7/6. (Many decimal numbers, like the last three of my examples, have decimal expansions that never end. That decimal expansions can be never-ending is perfectly fine, and is in fact crucial to your question.)

* **Function**/**mapping** - If you have two collections of things, like {1, 2, 17, cat} and {0, Bob, -1}, a function (mapping is the same thing) between the two collections is a way to pair up each member of the first collection with exactly one member of the second collection. There is no requirement that every member in the second collection should belong to some pair. For instance, this defines a function between the two example collections:

|||
|-:|-:|
|1|0|
|2|0|
|17|Bob|
|cat|0|

* **Injection**/**surjection**/**bijection** - These are all different things, and are additional constraints on functions. A function from one collection to another is an injection if each value in the second collection occurs in at most one pair. So my example function above is not an injection, since the pairs (1,0), (2,0), (cat, 0) all have the same object (0) from the second collection. A function is a surjection if no object in the second collection goes unmatched. The example function is not a surjection, since no pair contains -1 in its second position (there is no -1 in the second column). Finally, a function is a bijection if it is both an injection and a surjection. In other words, every object in the second collection must me paired up with exactly one object from the first. (No more and no less.) So in fact, two sets are of equal size exactly if there exists a bijection between them. The example function is not a bijection, since it is neither an injection or a surjection.

My list is not really LI5-suitable, but neither are some of the words themselves.

Now, people below (/u/Scylla6, if I interpret him/her correctly) claim that there are more fractions than positive integers. This is simply not true. In fact, the collection of fractions is of equal size as the collection of positive integers. I'll show this like above. Remember that what I need to do is to pair every positive integer up with exactly one fraction in such a way that every fraction can be found in a pair. The idea is to just write the fractions down in a big array, and to then walk along the diagonals:

|||||||
|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|1/1|1/2|1/3|1/4|1/5|...|
|2/1|2/2|2/3|2/4|2/5|...|
|3/1|3/2|3/3|3/4|3/5|...|
|4/1|4/2|4/3|4/4|4/5|...|
|...|...|...|...|...|...|

By walking along the diagonals, I mean [this](http://sites.psu.edu/musingsofamathnerd/files/2012/10/Cantor-Diagonal-Proof.png). Doing so, we can pair up positive integers with fractions (leaving none out) like this:

|||
|-:|-:|
|1|1/1|
|2|2/1|
|3|1/2|
|4|1/3|
|5|2/2|
|6|3/1|
|7|4/1|
|...|...|

To be fair I have cheated a bit, since I only have positive fractions, but this can be fixed like with the integers above. Also 1/1=2/2 and so on, so I have only really showed that there can be no more fractions than positive integers. But all integers are also fractions, so there can't be more integers than fractions. Thus the sizes are equal.",null,0,cdk33bv,1r5aya,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8
gcuz,"Infinity works in weird ways. First off, the integers are what we call countably infinite. What this means is that we can find a function that pairs up each integer with a single natural number (the natural numbers are the positive integers, sometimes including zero).

Real numbers are what we call uncountably infinite. To show this you assume that they're countable. You can then show that you can construct a new real number that's you haven't considered, which implies that the reals are uncountable. 

Finally, there are two properties that we need. First, any non-empty interval of the real numbers has the same cardinality (same number of elements) as the entire set of real numbers. Second, subtracting a countably infinite set from an uncountably infinite set leaves you with an uncountable set. Thus the interval (0,1) has uncountably more elements than there are integers.

vitatata128,"Say you want to put numbers in a line and count them and there's infinite number of them, the line goes on forever. But you still want to put them in a line and count them. Let's put all integers in a line. We will put 0 first. Then we can put 1 right after 0. We can count two numbers. Let's put -1 right after 1. Bam! We have three numbers. And we know that we have three numbers. Now let's spend eternity putting integers in a line, one after another, one after another. You can still count them. Before you put the next integer in the line, you already know how many you have. Now, let's count all the real numbers betwee 0 and 1. Here, let's start with a 0. 0 is the first number. We have one number. Now, let's put the next number in a line. We can put 0.1 and count it as a second number but we want to count ALL the numbers, so we should probably get as close to 0 as possible. Say 0.000001? Well, 0.0000000001 is still smaller. And 0.00.....00001 is yet smaller. That's already a lot of numbers we went through to get here and we still haven't reached a number closest to 0. So we can't really form the line and count these numbers.
Another way to think about this is the following. Your line of integers looks something like this: 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ...... It's a line of single whole numbers. AND these numbers are limited. You can use each one only once. But when trying to reach a number closest to 0, you can add as many 0's as you want after your 0.0000.... and put a 1 at the end. Similarly, you can add as many 0's after your 0.0000... as you want and put a 2 at the end.
Thus, forming a line and counting all integers will take an eternity but you will have a count.

jmcw,"Give me any integer, and I'll give you a number between 0 and 1 (I will call these ""small numbers"" from now on). Give me a different integer, and I'll give you a different small number. In fact, if I can show you a different small number for each integer that exists, then I'll have proven what you're looking for.

Now here's how I do it:

* If you give me 0, I'll give you back 0.
* If you give me any positive integer, say 52, then I'll give you the inverse of that integer (i.e. 1/52). I guarantee you it will be a small number, every time (check for yourself if you want, I'm not going to prove it here).

This idea is the key point that will prove what you're looking for. If you understand what's going on, you can probably stop reading here as you've grasped the key concept. If you're wondering ""but what about the negative integers?"" then read on...

Notice how (except for 1), I'll never give you back a number larger than 1/2? Those are the ""more numbers"" you asked about, and I'm not even going to use that space to deal with the negative integers.

Using the method described above, if you give me a negative integer I'll try to give you back a negative small number. If you want to call me out and say ""AHA! that's not a number between 0 and 1"" then I'll just get my assistant Bob to give you unique small numbers for each integer. Here's how he does it: Whenever I give him a number x (obtained by taking 1/n of the number n you've given me), he'll give you (x+1)/2.

TL;DR: for any integer x (except 0), there is a number **(1 + (1/x)) / 2** (or just ""magically"" use 1/2 if you started with 0) which lies between 0 and 1. There are also plenty of numbers smaller than 1/4 that you will never obtain with this method.",null,0,cdk19qm,1r5aya,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

However, what do we do with fractions like 2/3 or 5/6? They cant map to any natural number, 2/3 maps to 3/2, which is not a natural number by definition. Therefore the set of whole numbers, n, does not map to the numbers a/n.

What this means is that there's an infinite number of values for a that aren't 1, therefore there are an infintely many numbers a/n than 1/n **for any number n**.

It is possible to raise your IQ as far as intelligence goes. This includes ability to learn, understand, and make decisions based on reasoning. Your brain is made up of many neurons which create electrical pulses that cause you to eat, breath, and think. These neurons are all interconnected and they may be thought of as a road or highway. If you start learning something you've never done before (such as baking a cake) the path between neurons for baking a cake is like a dirt road. As you continue baking more cakes that path becomes more efficient and seems more like a newly paved highway than that old dirt road. This is why mental exercises are so important to preventing dementia, this is upkeep for your brain.

If valve is driven out of business by say, microsoft, then you might end up screwed.

Questia,"I'm not sure it's even possible to simplify existentialism, or the role Jean-Paul Sartre played in advancing it as a philosophy, but I'm going to give it a shot. 

Sartre was actually the only self-declared existentialist among the major thinkers. For him the central idea of all existential thought is that existence precedes essence. For Sartre there is no God and therefore no fixed human nature that forces one to act. Man is totally free and entirely responsible for what he makes of himself. In fact freedom came to be the most important aspect of Sartre's philosophy and he passionately believed it to be the right of all men.

One of the primary ideas that sticks with me when it comes to existentialism is that we are ""condemned to be free."" Essentially Sartre concludes that the only choice in life that we were not able to make was to exist. Every single other choice is our responsibility, and we have no choice but to make a choice. Even choosing to do nothing is still making a choice. In every moment it must be considered that there are thousands or millions of different things you could possibly be doing, yet you must choose one and understand that you are responsible for that choice.

You can branch off of these ideas much further, and there are many books written on the subject. But my summary above is a concise enough simplification that will give you a general understanding about how existentialism works.",null,0,cdjsm8k,1r54dz,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

NeutralParty,"Going to quote the Privy Council Office because they put it better than I can:

The Northwest Territories, the Yukon and Nunavut are Canada's three territories... they represent approximately 3 % of the Canadian population.

There is a clear constitutional distinction between provinces and territories. While provinces exercise constitutional powers in their own right, the territories exercise delegated powers under the authority of the Parliament of Canada.

Historically, this authority has meant that the North was largely governed by federal officials. However, over the past 40 years, major changes have occurred in the governance of the territories. Federal statutes have established a legislative assembly and executive council for each territory and province-like powers are increasingly being transferred or ""devolved"" to territorial governments by the Government of Canada. This process, known as ""devolution"", provides greater local decision-making and accountability.

Because of economic, social and demographic realities linked to their challenging geographical situation, a significant portion of the territories' financial resources comes from the federal government through a transfer program known as Territorial Formula Financing. This funding gives territorial residents access to a range of public services comparable to those offered by provincial governments, at comparable levels of taxation.

**Historical context**

Shortly after Confederation in 1867, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to sell Rupert's Land and the North Western Territory to Canada (1870) while Britain surrendered to Canada the Arctic Islands (1880) - some 36,500 islands which make up much of Northern Canada.

These new territories were thereafter known as the Northwest Territories. They had neither a legislative assembly nor an elected government and were administered directly by the Federal Government. For example, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), then known as the North West Mounted Police, was established in 1873 by an act of Parliament to maintain peace and order in the Northwest Territories.

Over the years, parts of the Northwest Territories became provinces (Manitoba, 1871, Alberta and Saskatchewan, 1905) or were integrated into provinces (Manitoba in 1881,1912; Ontario, 1869, 1874, 1889, 1912; Québec, 1898, 1912).

In 1898, following the Gold Rush the Yukon was given a separate territorial administration. In 1999 Nunavut, whose population is more than 80 % Inuit, also became a separate territory with a separate territorial administration.

**TL;DR:** It was always sparsely populated and vast, so it called for a different form of governance. Since it's also largely a native population and there's some historical racism that also came into the picture with not really wanting to grant them real power. (Although to be fair here much of the native population up there would be happy to just be left alone and run their stuff their own way.)

In general, the US was 'made' in 4 big parts, more or less.

You have the original colonies - the East Coast - where a lot of the borders/divisions would have been the result of the initial colonization efforts. There were many colonies (13 original!), but also forts, plantations, etc. I believe most of the 'crowded' nature of the east* coast was due to this.

To the east were vast tracts of land owned by Mexico, or France. After the American Revolutionary War, there was a need to expand - the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 gave us a large chunk of the midwest.

The US annexed Texas, and ended up in a war with Mexico (Mexican-American War). The US won and grabbed everything north of what was the California-Mexican border. 

That's partially why things get so spread out to the west - those were massive pieces of land that were picked up after the original colonies were settled. Some of those lands, specifically the ones controlled by Mexico, already had large borders defined. They might have tried to split it, as with the Dakotas and Carolinas, but those themselves were pretty political (The Carolinas were split before there was even a 'US', so that probably isn't going to be an example to work off of either).

In the end, the land borders were as they were, and other than some minor shifts over time, they more or less stayed as they were when the lands were acquired or settled.

I am not a Historian, but that is my understanding anyways.

This means that any bonds sold will be paying a higher rate of interest for the period of that bond (bond markets are very complex, though, so I won't go into details on that).

Scientific research has been massively affected, and there are likely to be long term effects resulting.

PoglaTheGrate,"Well, the bird thing is mostly due to their vision


The eye is an extremely complex bunch of cells, and due to it's complexity, it needs a constant blood flow.

No blood flow, dead eye cells.  Dead eye cells == loss of vision.

So... the human eye is almost completely covered in capillaries (the tiny, tiny blood vessels that carry oxygen rich blood to the smallest places in the body).  There is a small part of the human eye that isn't covered in blood vessels, the iris.  

We have a small field of focus

We have binocular vision, which is great for judging distances, but when we need to focus on one thing, everything else gets out of focus.

A bird's eye isn't covered in blood vessels, so they can keep many things in focus at once.  There is a little organ at the back of the bird's eye  (the name of which I will tell you, without typing once, not checking duckduckgo.com and know the answer instantly) which is called the pecten, which holds all the blood required for the eye to 'live'

Birds will 'shake' their eyes occationally to distribute this blood all over the eye.  

Because there are no blood vessels covering they eye, they don't have one point of focus, but their whole vision is in focus.

Furthermore, a bird's eye will tend to be oval shaped, rather than spherical, giving them more peripheral vision.

Most birds have eyes on the sides of their heads as well. \*

So eyes that look kinda to the sides, all of their vision in focus at once, and oval shaped eyes gives a bird an amazing vision of the world around them (almost no colour, not much depth perception, but amazing detail) will allow them to navigate impossibly small spaces without crashing into anything.

\*Raptors (eagles, falcons, owls etc.) will have eyes on the front of their heads.  These birds have evolved to hunt prey, so they need binocular vision so as to judge where their prey is, and swoop in for the kill.

Sharlinator,"Partially due to the very short distances that their nerve signals must travel.

But I'd like to talk a bit about something more fundamental: the same reason an oil tanker is so slow to turn.

There's this fundamental thing called the square-cube law: imagine a cube with side length of one meter (or yard) wide. Now imagine another cube with twice the side length of the first one. How much greater is its surface area and volume compared to the smaller one?

The surface area will be four times as large, and the volume will be *eight* times the smaller cube's volume! The latter also means that, with equal density, the larger cube will also be eight times more massive. As we continue our thought experiment with larger and larger cubes, we quickly notice that the surface area grows quite a bit faster than the side length, and the volume/mass grows even faster. Similarly, if we instead consider smaller cubes, we find that their surface area and especially mass and volume shrink very rapidly.

So how is this relevant? The strength of some load-bearing structure such as bone, an insect's exoskeleton, or the hull of an oil tanker, is proportional to the surface area of the structure's cross-section across which force is applied. Also, the strength of an animal's muscle is proportional to the surface area of its cross-section. However, the force required to accelerate an object is proportional to the object's mass (this is Newton's second law - *F = ma*). 

So the larger you get, the stronger your muscles will get, but the mass the muscles are required to move grows faster than the strength of your muscles! This is why very small animals are capable of great accelerations, whereas elephants and whales need considerable time to change their speed or direction.

In the case of the US that would mean buying the networks of the big 2. That would cost more than the US can afford.

Yeti_Administrator,"Some of the major principles of camouflage involve reducing colour contrast and breaking up easily recognizable shapes including wholly or partially visible humans. 

Disruptive (pixelated) camouflage was first applied to battle dress by the Canadian Armed Forces in the form of [CADPAT](http://mpmuseum.org/cadpat.html) (Canadian Disruptive Pattern).

The idea behind this pattern is to increase the time it takes to identify the camouflaged object against its environment when compared to solid colour or ""blotchy"" camouflage patterns. As with any camouflage pattern, this only really works when the colour scheme of the pattern is correctly designed for the environment. 

Disruptive camouflage works by using many small shapes (pixels) of environmentally appropriate colours to disrupt the perception of an observer, making the shape of the object more difficult to pick out against a similarly-coloured background. The small pixels also provide an increased ""dithering"" (sort of like blending) effect between colours, preventing the identification of solid lines between shapes by the human eye. This makes it much easier to confuse and overlook the pattern when laid against something like a treeline which includes small twigs, leaves, and shadows.

You can check out [this](http://www.hyperstealth.com/camo-improvement/) link for a more in-depth explanation of why this works. 


EDIT: For perspective, this was developed for the Canadian Armed Forces as an improvement over the solid [olive-drab](http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/uniforms/combatuniform.htm) pattern used on previous uniforms.

Leyxa,"Basically, digital camouflage looks digital because it was designed with a digital process in the mid 1990s.

I can't find a source for this so I have to go by memory (so if you've got the inside scoop and can correct me, that'd be great), but IIRC, CADPAT (Canadian Disruptive Pattern -- the first digital camouflage to be adopted) was developed using a genetic algorithm. CADPAT was developed back in 1996, so there were technical limits to the resolution of the digital patterns that could be tested.

A genetic algorithm is a computer-powered design process in which a computer is given an objective and a set of rules by which to create a set of randomly adjusted solutions. Each randomly generated solution is tested for suitability and the most suitable solutions are remembered and slightly modified and tested again. Over the course of many generations, the best solution literally evolves out of the process.

The biggest problem with genetic algorithms is that sometimes they can evolve themselves into corners. They reach a particular solution and any modification of that solution the algorithm attempts is inferior, but the particular solution itself may not be the best solution.  It is also time consuming to run.

The visible pixellation is more of a technical limit than a design feature, but it's practically irrelevant as the pixellation is not perceptible at even moderate distances.",null,2,cdjpwt4,1r4qbd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6

riverine17,"Short and sweet, the camouflage used for hunting is normally for a specific use, the patterns are meant and bought by the hunter depending on where said hunter will be hunting, for use in hardwoods, wetlands ect. IE mossy oak hunting pattern will not work in all enviornments. Military camouflage needs to be universal, or as universal as can be anyways. One pattern will NOT work for every single enviornment (we already tried with UCP and it failed) therefore we've found that having two patterns can work for most enviornments (woodland/desert).

Pixilated patterns helps to break up the outline/shape of the Serviceman and therefore blend in with the enviornment. It's not so much about looking exactly like the surroundings as much as it is helping mask the human shape into its surroundings and helping the wearer to not be as noticable to the human eye.

4. This right here is how most European countries tweak their tax legislation to compete with eachother. For instance, Belgian banks have found this loophole by moving their bonds activities to the Netherlands. Under Belgian law, they're okay to be taxed there.

nonspence,"The pit may be essentially dead at the NYSE, but in Chicago at the CME particularly in the options pits, open outcry trading is alive and well. Source: i work in the pit as a broker. 

There are a lot of reasons that they are alive in well in the option pits, but mostly its because the option pits are a better system at the moment and have more liquidity then electronic trading. If youd like to know details as to why and how it is better i can get into that but for now ill focus on your original question.  

In my pit there about 150-200 guys on a given day depending on how busy it is. It may seem crazy but the pit is a very efficient system. It is controlled chaos, but it is transparent, there are checks and balances, etiquette and rules. Much of what you can do trading electronically would be seen as criminal in the pit. Again if you have interest i can provide specific examples.

In basics as others have said, there are 2 types of people in the pit. The brokers (work with customer) and the ""locals"" or market makers. The brokers will work with everyone from funds, to producers or users of a commodity and even other prop groups. The ""locals"" job is to try and make a 1/8th 1/4 cent of ""edge"" off of whatever they trade as many times as they can. 

So ill walk you through how a typical trade happens..

I get a phone call. Customer wants me to ""quote"" the December 500 calls. 

I scream at the top of my lungs as well as hand signal, ""Hey Dec 500 calls, where are they"" ( or something along those lines)

The locals in the pit scream back and hand signal two prices. First what they are willing to Pay for the Dec 500 calls or their Bid. And second what they are willing to sell the Dec 500 calls at or their offer. 

I tell the customer on the phone, the market is 1 bid at 1 and a 1/2. (meaning locals want to pay 1 and they want to sell it at 1 1/2) 

The customer tells me to sell 100 at 1 1/4. 

I scream out to the crowd and hand signal that I want to sell 100 at 1 1/4. 

At this point a few different things can happen. 1) locals will hold with their 1 bid. 2) maybe a few locals will show me a 1 1/8 bid. 3) Someone yells SOLD. 

As a broker i have to execute the order how the customer wants. Sometimes they will give me discretion to get the best price based on my feel of the market. Sometimes they want it at a specific price. For this example, well say he wanted to sell 1 1/4s and the pit is only 1 bid for now. 

So i continue to scream that i have 100 to sell at 1 1/4. And the locals continue to respond if they are 1 bid. Suddenly the futures market upticks and 4 traders in the pit simultaneously yell SOLD. I divide up the 100 contracts and sell each guy who ""hit me"" 25 contracts. As a broker you try and be fair as possible and that definitely creates a reputation. 

Now as I am handing out or dividing up the contracts, i double check that they have the right trade both verbally and with hand signals. ""Hey ABC i sold the Dec 500 calls at 1 1/4 25 times check?"" ABC says check. Then i call the customer and give him his fill. ""Hey bob, we sold 100 at 1 1/4.""

Then i write out the trade or ""card it up"" and put down the time the trade was done, buying or selling, how many times, and price, as well as the Acronym of the traders who i sold it to. (Every trader in the pit has a 2-3 letter acronym used to identify them. Some guys get clever with theirs and they make for good nicknames.) Anyways next i hand my filled out trading cards to my clerk and i quote the trade to the market reporters who put it out to the world, which it also goes up on the board, allowing us in the pit to double check it another time. Meanwhile my clerk goes and finds each of the other traders clerks that i sold 25 contracts to and double checks all the details of the trade. 

Then i wait for the phone to ring again and do it all over. 

Hope that clears things up. Any questions just ask.

Essentially, you have two types of 'workers' there. You have the traders and the brokers. The brokers offer prices to buy or sell a stock or share at, while the traders are looking for the best opportunity (price) to buy or sell at. They are practically in teams, representing different firms (the different coloured jackets identify each team). 

The brokers take orders from hand signals normally. So one trader may be communicating a bid/ask price and another may be informing someone else of the amount of futures contracts they wish to purchase.

Ever since NYSE moved their trade execution platforms out of Broad St, and into data centers in North Jersey and east of London in Essex, that's where the actual trades take place.  The vast majority of trades on the exchange never see the inside of the building everyone thinks they happen in.  Even those trades that happen ""on the floor"" still get executed in those 2 DCs.

In those 2 facilities, there are co-location racks that firms install servers and comms gear in.  Every co-lo rack has the same fiber distance to the distribution switches for fairness.  Yes - the guy in the rack 10 feet away has the same fiber length as the guy 400 feet away.  You might say that given the speed of light, that's irrelevant, but it's not.  The vast majority of trades these days aren't done by humans - they're done by HFT firms and their algo trading systems, which often times live on an FPGA card in a system, or even more interesting is now you're starting to see FPGAs pop up inside switches - so your trade application now lives in the network, and is that much closer.

That last bit sounds like an arms race, and it for the most part is.  In that world, microseconds, heck, nanoseconds matter.  If you can match 1 microsecond before the other guys, you get the trade, and they get nothing.

Also interesting to note that given the location and cost of real estate, NYSE has taken to renting out the floor of the exchange in the evenings for events.  My company had a customer event there last year.  Cocktails, small plates spread around the floor, and you could go up and get your picture taken holding the gavel like you're ringing the bell.  I posted mine on Facebook, and my wife's cousin bought the whole thing hook, line &amp; sinker.

financeguy19,"Lot of political opinions instead of answering the question...

The NYSE now actually has ""Posts"" instead of pits and have been that way for a while.  These are seen on CNBC and in movies like the Dark Knight Rises.  Each post is run by a specialist (or at least they used to call them that) and that is a company that has a handful of people down there that make sure their stocks are trading smoothly.  Each post probably has a couple hundred stocks that they deal with, so if you want to buy IBM it may be at a different post than Johnson and Johnson.  The specialists will make sure the market is flowing by creating liquidity when needed so if there are a bunch of sellers and no buyers he will then step in and become a buyer to keep the stock from taking a drop too quickly.  This is what happened in 1987 and specialist were frantically trying to buy more to prevent the free fall (Markets largely came back in just a week then).  The traders now do not use open outcry which is the crazy yelling, they all have tablets and can run trades from there but are still on the floor as you can more easily communicate with others about what might be going on in the market or on a particular stock.  The traders generally work for large banks and will execute only large orders (100,000+ shares for example).

The exchanges with ""pits"" are generally the commodities markets.  In the movie Trading Places they go to the New York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, and Chicago Board of Trade, CBOT, I know also have pits.  They used hand signals as was linked to earlier to buy or sell.  Hand facing away is sell and towards you buy, two fingers by your chin means 2 and by your forehead means 20.  Here they have traders from banks on the steps and the people at the top will be on the phone with all the banks making trades for them.  In the bottom of the pit is where the ""market makers"" are and they are generally just trading their own money trying to make small profits on trades to keep the market liquid.  Things used to trade in fraction increments until the end of the 90s so market makers would make the difference between the bid and ask (1/8th of a dollar lets say) but they did a 10,000 share trade so they make $1,250.

Open Outcry is mostly gone though I did visit the CME in 2007 and they were still doing a hybrid of open outcry and electronic trading.  I visited the NYSE floor in 2011 and I talked to a guy who said he used to have 200 people from their bank on the floor and now there is only 4.

To answer the bare bones of pit dynamics about getting orders through the chaos of everyone yelling at each other, everything is more orderly than it looks.

Brokers are typically the only people who do open outcry.  The market makers stand and listen and try to make a market when a broken calls something out.  

A group of brokers work at a station with their clerks.  These stations are positioned around the pit, market makers crowd around them.  Most companies have a market maker in close proximity to each broker station.  So the brokers are typically trading with a small group of market makers.

If you want to trade with someone further away and it's is too loud, you use hand signals.  There's signs for puts and calls, the type of package they are being sold under (fly, condor), and for numbers going past five you turn your hand  parallel to the ground and start over with your fingers so a 6 is one finger.

As far as understandings everyone through all the chaos, you start to learn body languages quickly.  Sometimes a glance is enough to signal yes I have traded with you.

The people on the floor actually have a set of rules (or system) which they operate under which keeps it organized. This is known as the Open Outcry system. This can appear to be absolutely chaotic to someone who might only be coming in off the street to look at the madness ensue. However, since everyone has a role to play, you might be shocked at how organized it is.

First, lets think about how we identify people on the floor. People on the floor MUST wear a badge with a numeric identifier along with their credentials such as who they work with and what their specialty is.

The data according to given symbols can be communicated via hand signals - which will relate to the buy, sell, price and size etc. Further to this there may be information regarding expiry if trading futures / options.

Second - All that noise... it isn't actually the buying and selling! its actually people reacting to news that is made available inside the exchange as it breaks. 

With all of this in mind, you can see how it is vital to keep everything organized - which is the foundation the exchange actually operates on. This is aided further by the fact that a take executed in an open outcry based floor is actually a contract, you cannot back out of it once you commit, violation of thiss results in fines, reprimands, reputation damage (either of these or all actually).

The people at the desks will interpret the signals from the people on the floor, and will execute the trades - Which is why you don't see these guys / girls shouting constantly, unlike the people on the floor.

Brokers receive orders from funds, banks, and off floor traders. Once received by phone in the pit, the broker will ask the traders for a market (what's the bid/ask on these options?). The traders will make a market and arb (trader sign language) the order to their clerk outside the pit. The clerk, on a headset, will relay the order to the managers upstairs. Based on positioning and their volatility models, the managers will tell the clerk (to relay to the trader) the quantity and price to buy or sell, or give a range (how much ""edge"" is acceptable). By this time the broker will announce his order, ""I wanna buy 20000 1650/1700 call flys!"". This is when all the yelling and screaming starts, this is where the traders will need to buy/sell if instructed, get their quantity and price, arb the info to their clerk who can relay how many futures/underlying to buy/sell as a hedge to the upstairs desk. 

This is how transactions happen in large trading groups, there are still guys down here that do everything themselves.

TheYeti46,"Equity trading is currently done electronically, meaning that the days of big crowds, screaming, and paper tickets are over.  The only instances where the floor is remotely close to what it once was is on the open and close of the markets, where the NYSE in particular does most of its volume.  The market also resembles the open outcry system during times of volatility when the market trades ""slow"", but I'll get to that after a quick breakdown of ""the floor.""  On the open and close, brokers interact with marketmakers in the interest of their customers.  The marketmakers facilitate trading on their electronic displaybooks, and are able to give the brokers information, or ""looks,"" on the market for specific stocks (i.e. price &amp; volume to buy or sell).  The brokers are agents for their customers, who communicate information from the ""looks"" to their customers and work to provide them with the best possible order executions.  Regarding the process, brokers enter orders through their handhelds, which are sent to the marketmaker's displaybook.  It is through the book that matching engines put trades together and excute them.  The marketmaker not only offers a point of sale for stocks to trade, but also utilizes his or her own capital to maximize liquidity (the ability to trade easily and quickly) in their stocks. The rest of the day on the floor is relatively quiet, as trading is executed automatically.  The marketmakers also play a very important role in regulating volatility in the marketplace by trading ""slow"" when certain volatility thresholds are crossed.  When the market trades ""slow"", orders are executed manually by the marketmakers themselves on the displaybooks.  In many of these instances, the floor resembles the open outcry model as brokers come out from their booths to make sure their interest is in the book and hopefully being executed.

A spotter is used because while a sniper is certainly capable of gathering all that information and calculating it, having someone to feed him/her numbers speeds up the calculation of a long shot significantly. 

That's especially important if lives are contingent on the sniper taking down a target quickly. 

As for wind speed, etc., an electronic anemometer has been available for almost 2 decades now. 

A spotter gets to position this and other devices and convey the data to the sniper in a single package. And the spotter isn't in the same place, so assuming good communication, you have a much wider ""field of vision"" based on the spotter's reports.

The spotter has a better field of view, leads to the target, runs the issues, gives the info to the trigger man, s/he pulls the trigger and hits the target. Also, when first shot misses, the correction and second shot is a lot quicker with your buddy seeing where you hit and giving you the correction.

catacombs2001,"All of the previous posts are correct. There's more as well. A spotter often has binoculars for a wider field of view than common fixed magnification scopes; this aids with finding targets. He also has a spotting scope. One of the more common riflescope fixed magnifications for snipers is 10x. This is adequate for hitting targets out to and even past 1000m, but it is hard to see where you're hitting if you miss (due to the low magnification and the recoil of your rifle moving the scope off target). The spotter has a higher (20x-60x) magnification via the spotting scope, so this makes calling misses easier, as well as finding small targets. 

EDIT:  Also, the spotter often carries a secondary weapon to add more firepower if the team needs to break contact. Often an M4 with m203 launcher, or a semi-auto .308 rifle if the sniper has a bolt-action .300 win mag like an M24.",null,1,cdjj6up,1r4irz,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

As for the calculations of wind etc.. The spotter would also help or completely handle them (each team is different). You use whatever you can to get the direction and speed (blades of grass, trees, etc...)
It's also important to note that winds change direction and strength multiple times on the path to the target. It's the spotters job to look for all these thing and give updated info to the shooter.

However the Kestrels can only give you a reading for the wind in relation to the shooter. The winds 200m down range may be different, and another 500m past that may be different as well.

Typically the spotter is the more experienced sniper of the two. The shooter is just operating the weapon system, while the spotter is actually giving the shooter all of the input he needs to apply to the optics.

rozhbash,"A spotter will often be either looking at the target with a higher level of magnification or with less magnification to see a wider area.  As the shooter fires, especially with magnum cartridges, the recoil often takes his eye out of alignment and getting back on target to see the effects can be difficult when magnified significantly.  Because the spotter is not affected by recoil, he can see the trajectory of the bullet in good conditions (spotting ""trace"") as well as spot terminal effects (hit or miss) in a way that is more difficult for the shooter.  The spotter then can call corrections by looking at where the bullet impacts and measuring the distance with the reticle (crosshair) and passing the correction over to the shooter.  Reading the wind is both an art developed over time as well as a science.  For extreme range precision shooting, multiple wind vectors need to be estimated and while an anemometer can tell you wind speed at your location, it takes experience to be able to read the wind direction and magnitude downrange.  This is why the spotter is often the more experienced of the two, able to read the wind and help estimate the needed turret adjustments.  The spotter can also handle the work of range estimation, determining environmental variables and calculating a ballistic solution all while the shooter is on the scope either scanning his sector for threats or focused on the target.

ETA: reading the wind downrange involves experience with how air flows through different terrain and how much wind speed affects different terrain features.  For example, dust is easily moved by a 1mph wind, while grass will gently blow with 3-4mph, big trees need closer to 10mph to start waving, etc.  It's all about past experience and knowing what to look for.",null,0,cdk71h9,1r4irz,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

Now in 'nature', sometimes these genetic mutations are beneficial. So maybe all iguanas were originally red, then one of them was born green. The new green iguana easily survived, and was able to reproduce more easily than the red iguanas. So a bunch of his kids were also green, and they all easily survived and reproduced.

In the mean time, the predators that hunted the iguanas evolved to have better eyesight, so they could more easily hunt the red iguanas. So over time, the red population dwindled, and the green population because much more common (possibly replacing the reds entirely).


The important thing to understand is that evolution doesn't really happen 'on purpose'. We don't 'try' to evolve to become better at survival, it's just that random genetic mutations make some of us better at survival. And since those with better genes are able to reproduce more, those mutations get passed on over many generations, until a particular trait becomes more and more popular within the population.

A better analogy is snow rabbits that change their fur colour in winter to match snow fields. Some rabbits were lighter in winter by pure luck. With food scarce, they were less likely to fall victim to predators through the harsh winter.

This is called ""mutation"".  Since genes determine our traits from eye color to lactose tolerance, this mutation makes the child a little different from what you'd expect given his parentage.  Like maybe the color of his skin is a little off.  Like maybe it's green, when none of his ancestors were green.

Whether the mutation is good or bad for the child is entirely luck; it's not pre-determined.  Sometimes, you get crappy things, like maybe your baby is deformed or has bad vision.  Sometimes, the mutant child strikes it lucky and gets something good, like the ability to digest milk - this is a great asset if you live in a cold climate where there is little food during winter aside from the milk your livestock produce.  That child now has an advantage: he is less likely to starve during winters.  He will more likely survive to grow into a man and have kids of his own than his poor brethren who are lactose intolerance.  His kids will inherit his lactose tolerance and they in turn will be more likely to survive.  In cold climates where this trait is useful, it will proliferate in the population over numerous generations.

You'll never turn green by standing in a cornfield for a long time, but you might, just might, give birth to a green-skinned kid who can better hide from cornfields monsters.  If you're lucky, that is.  If not, you might get an orange-skinned kid who is monster bait.  Natural selection is about the survival of those lucky to be born with a more useful set of genes.

If I wanted to breed a race of green-skinned humans, I would gather a large bunch of people and force them to live in a big cornfield full of monsters who have great color vision.  The more people you have making babies, the sooner one of them will produce a green-skinned kid.  The monsters will eat fewer of the green-skinned kids and more of the normal (or orange-skinned) kids, so the balance will shift towards the greenskins.",null,0,cdjl10j,1r4fxw,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

To do this, the cells on the surface (the epithelium) secrete a mucous, which helps to humidify the air. Your nose also has a highly developed blood flow, which helps to warm it up.

The problem with this, is that cold, dry air is actually quite damaging to your cells; this is why you have to heat/humidify the air before it gets into the respiratory system to begin with.

pH is a logarithmic measurement, so directly averaging them doesn't give correct values.

Alkaven5,"Neither. You *are* finding an average, but what you're averaging isn't the pH values because pH is a logarithmic scale. 

Acids are solutions in which a proportion of the water is present as positive hydronium ions, H3O+. This happens when molecules such as HCl are added to water: the molecule dissociates, or breaks apart, because of the polar forces in the water. The hydrogen atom is left simply as a proton, without its electron, because the other half of the molecule (here, Cl) is more electronegative. So, Cl hangs out in the solution as Cl-, and H as H+. This leaves the proton free to attach to the water molecules, forming H3O+.

pH is a measure of how much an acid like HCl, H2SO4, or any other acid (or base), dissociates in water. The scale goes from zero to fourteen, with acids on the low end, neutral at seven, and bases on the high end. The number represents the concentration of hydronium ions in the solution. A solution with a pH of seven has 10^-7 moles of H3O+ per Liter; a solution with a pH of three has 10^-3 moles of H3O+/L, etc. This is why lower pH numbers correspond to stronger acid solutions.

Now, to tie into your question: due to the logarithmic nature of the scale, a pH of 4 is *not* the average of a pH of 3 and a pH of 5. The average of the pH of 3 and 5 will end up being much closer to three. When you're calculating it, convert your pH back to concentration, then take the average. If you mix equal amounts of pH 3 and pH 5 solutions, you'll get this: -log[(10^-3 +10^-5 )/2] = 3.58, which is the pH.

**TL;DR: when you mix two acids, the resulting solution has a pH derived from the average *concentrations* of the solutions.

pirround,"Normal white sugar is sucrose, which is made of one fructose and one glucose molecule. Your body can very quickly split the sucrose apart, so you can think of it as being 50% glucose and 50% fructose.

Corn starch is a long chain of glucose molecules, so when the starch is split apart to make corn syrup, it is almost all glucose. The glucose is then treated with an enzyme to convert it into fructose so you get high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The enzyme only converts 42% of the glucose to fructose (and leaves ~5% as maltose, to there is 53% glucose), so you usually get what is called HFCS 42. The problem is that HFCS 42 doesn't taste as sweet as sucrose, so it's quite common to refine it a bit more and get HFCS 55, which is as sweet as sucrose. It's possible to get HFCS 90 which has 90% fructose and only a little glucose and maltose.

So what are the concerns:

Starch is made up of sugar, but it takes some time for your body to break the starch apart, so starch doesn't cause the same spike in blood sugar. Similarly some people worry that since when you eat HFCS your body doesn't need to split apart the sucrose, the HFCS can hit you faster and be tougher on your body. I haven't seen a lot yo back this up since sucrose is very easy to split apart.

The ratio of glucose to fructose is different in HFCS (41% glucose and 55% fructose in HFCS 55 as compared with 50% glucose and 50% fructose in normal sucrose -- there's also some water but I'm ignoring that). This is important because your body metabolizes glucose and fructose differently. I won't try to explain all of the differences, but the main ones are: 

* Glucose can be broken down by almost any cell in your body, while fructose can only be broken down by the liver, which in excess causes fat to be deposited in the liver (much like heavy drinking does).

* Glucose causes insulin to be produced which affects your metabolism in lots of ways, including triggering your body that you're full. Fructose doesn't cause this reaction, so it's possible that you will eat more and your body will metabolize that food differently.

The final concern is that HFCS is cheaper than sucrose, to it is easier for manufacturers to add to food. In some cases ""diet"" foods which have  &lt;20% of calories from fat, do this by adding more sugar so they have more calories in total.

Honey is sometime considered to be healthier than white sugar, but it has a composition that is very similar to HFCS 55. Other than the cost issue, all of the same arguments could be used to show that honey is less healthy than white sugar.

Edit: [Sugar:The Bitter Truth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM) is an interesting start to understanding how glucose and fructose are metabolized.",null,9,cdjhnj4,1r45v7,explainlikeimfive,top_week,40

In Europe, they use cane sugar, because it is cheap, natural, and tastes great.  In Mexico, they use cane sugar, because it is cheap, natural, and tastes great.

Yes, if you've used an alarm to wake up after a full night's sleep, you might feel like crap for a good hour, but that is probably because your alarm just forced you out of deep (stage 3) sleep and your brain requires some time to reorient itself to the awake state. If you slept very little, its possible you haven't entered deep stage sleep at all, or you are in a different stage, say stage 1 or REM, so you might not be as groggy when you wake up.

However, if you were to actually test your mental performance in both scenarios after being awake a few hours, I'm sure you would fare a bit better after having gotten a full night's sleep.

Leptin also activates an uncoupling protein (it's hard to explain what that is in few words), which causes your cells to produce more heat. This will make you feel warm after any large meal. On top of this, meat needs a relatively high amount of energy for processing - the chemical reactions that break down meat produce lots of heat.

The above is a bit of an oversimplification because this is a difficult topic to discuss non-scientifically. Leptin controls the **long-term** sensation of satiety, so it's not at clear-cut as signaling a full belly (there is another chemical for that - cholecytokinin or CCK).

By definition, if your batteries work again after you twiddle with them, but did not actually charge them, then they were not dead, yet.
The question is, why did your device stop working with batteries, then start working after you removed them and then swapped them?

The likely answer is the battery connections. By taking them out and putting them back, you rubbed and bumped and scraped the connections in the device. Remotes go through a lot of wear and tear and sometimes develop loose wires etc. Your jostling may have pushed some things back into place.
For more evolved devices like cell phones, the phenomena can be explained by the fact that the phones use a device to estimate the amount of energy in the battery. When it falls below a level, the device shuts down. By removing your battery and the putting it back, you are forcing the phone to estimate the battery again.

eideid,"The first thing to recognize is that there isn't any one dominant string theory. String theory discusses a lot of different theories based on similar mathematical constructions.

String theory is a possible mathematical solution which is believed to be able to solve some of the big problems in physics, but of particular interest is the ability to bridge the gap between quantum mechanics, the study of things on the smallest scales, and general relativity, which mostly explains gravity. Both QM and GR are backed by a lot of evidence and we believe with as much certainty as we can that both of them accurately describe the universe, but when we try to make the math work, it just doesn't. String theory presumes a few facts about the universe which we have not been able to verify, but which alter the equations in such a way that suddenly QM and GR are compatible and the universe makes sense.

A key part of how this works involves the introduction of a way of explaining fields and particles in a unified way which has been called 'strings'. We tend to think of particles as being one-dimensional points, but in ST, we think of them as being one dimensional lines which can vibrate. The term 'string' is useful because these objects don't have to be straight, they can take shapes similar to how a string can take shapes.

The big problem, and part of the reason everybody is so vague about it, is that we don't have any way of telling (with current technology) if strings are even a valid way to model the universe, much less the limits of their properties. This has led to a lot of different ideas about what strings might be capable of. It's good that people are trying to figure this out, because it will hopefully lead to the development of methods by which to test and discard theories, but as it stands, the elegance of the mathematical concept is what keeps people interested.",null,3,cdj96ju,1r3n49,explainlikeimfive,top_week,18

KrelianZG,"The math is a bit dense. And by dense, I mean you need a PhD in a related field to really understand stuff. The popular explanations are very, VERY rough explanations. 

The best way to view modern string theories (as others have said, there are many versions) is to look at the Holographic Principle. 

Imagine that the universe is a 3D globe. And on the inside surface of that globe, you can map out the contents of the inside. 

Through a lot of math that isn't relevant here (the surface is DUAL to the inside space, if you want to wiki it[yes, for the math guys, that's not literally correct...]), what happens in OUR 3D universe is describable on the 2D surface of the interior of that sphere. 

On that 2D surface, strings are literally 1-dimensional strings, wriggling around on that surface. Things which appear extraordinary in our 3D perspective can be rather tame at that boundary surface. For example, a black hole in 3D space is actually just a loop of 1D string (a loopy, curvy line, basically) behaving in a certain way on that 2D surface. 

If you want to try to get a better handle on the analogy, look up Anti De Sitter Spaces and the Holographic principle. 

The extra dimensions come from mathematical underpinnings. The extra dimensions are ""curled up"", and don't impact anything unless you go down to the Planck scale of length, when you can then traverse these extra dimensions (Only gravity has been shown to really ""bleed"" into these other dimensions [which is a ST explanation for why it's weaker than other forces here] and the other forces we're familiar with aren't affected at all). 

As I said though, and as others have said here, none of that is relevant for a conceptual understanding. I've neglected huge swaths of current theory, like M-Theory, branes, topological treatments of the universe, etc.. They're all mathematical masturbation right now anyway. 

Current string theories are consistent with all other models (for the most part, and certainly as far as observable phenomena) but we lack the technology to test most of the underpinnings. And since there are MANY ""string theories"" - ie., the mathematical systems that seem to coherently describe the universe aren't unique - it's hard to generalize past painting a very rough picture like I have and the other commentators did. 

To be fair though, I kinda crapped out on theoretical physics after quantum mechanics, and I only understand this stuff in the abstract for the most part. Even with a pure math background though, this stuff is dense. 

Leonard Susskind's book The Black Hole War is a good addition to the Green and Kaku books already mentioned, too. It explains how quantum mechanics lead itself into the Holographic Principle and M-Theory (by way of information theory!), which is a great alternate path to seeing how string theory can potentially solve the quantum gravity problem.

Because this fat is located behind the abdominal muscles, it takes up space and exerts a greater pressure within the abdominal cavity, causing the belly to feel firm. Others have a lot of subcutaneous fat, i.e. just underneath the skin. Since this fat is located outside the abdominal muscles, it creates ""flab"" - the belly skin is softer, squishier, and dimpled in appearance.

The part that has always bothered me is why we evolved to need sleep. We could gave evolved to function differently, but we didn't, so why? The best answer I've heard has to do with energy, vision, and predation.

First, running on full around the clock is expensive. While energy is readily available now, there were many times where we had to fight for every calorie. Sleep gave us a break. 

Second, we evolved to have very precise color vision. It's a very effective balance between color and detail sensitivity. Main drawback though is our lack of low light vision. So evolving a mechanism to take advantage of our otherwise useless time was beneficial. 

Third was predation. Many of our predators were nocturnal. Using the day to hunt and sustain with less worry was more helpful to us than constantly competing with death. At night, we would group together in a fortified or secluded location to geographically protect ourselves while we slept.

It's a code to tell your teammates something that you don't want the other team to know, based on what the opposition looks like when you come to the line of scrimmage.

The Time Lords carry the power of regeneration, where upon death they will take on a new form and continue with life. The current Doctor is considered the 11th such incarnation (though this number is not entirely accurate). 

The Doctor is sort of a rogue amongst Time Lord society, in that he travels the universe and interferes with the lives of lesser species (such as humans). He has developed an attachment to Earth and its inhabitants, and regularly travels with a human companion (the current one is Clara Oswin Oswald). 

The current major story arc details the Doctor's involvement in a conflict known as The Last Great Time War, wherein the Time Lords and their greatest enemies, the Daleks (a robot species dedicated to exterminating all life other than Dalek-kind) were mutually destroyed. It is accepted that the Doctor was the cause of this event, which the 50th anniversary special is due to explore. ",null,4,cdj6a9d,1r3fh2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

He travels the universe doing good. And he is usually accompanied by one or more companions (usually humans) who are along for the ride.

The original show was a kids show. One week they would travel back in time and learn history. The next week they would travel forward in time and learn science. But over time that became less important and it became a sci-fi adventure show.

The Doctor can regenerate his body when he is close to death, and has done so many times before (This is a great way to change actors when they can't or won't do the role anymore). 

He travels in an extremely powerful time machine called the TARDIS. The TARDIS adapts to camouflage itself with whatever time period its in, but the Doctor's TARDIS is a little broken and so it always appears as a blue police box.

So the Doctor travels around time and space and gets into adventures. One day he might go back to Pompeii the day the volcano explodes. Another day he might visit the year the Earth finally naturally ends. Another he might go off to some strange alien world. He usually has at least one companion to travel with (usually human). He's a big believer in peace and non-violence; though those philosophies are often scarified to save the day. His personality also slightly changes with each regeneration. 

He has a device called the Sonic Screwdriver, which basically does whatever the writers want it to do. It unlocks doors, can be used as a shield, analyses things, etc.

He has many different nemesis such as the Daleks, Cybermen and The Master (another Time Lord).

It's actually not a particularly difficult problem. Here is the simple explanation.

These are trees. A tree is made of nodes connected together with something called 'edges', but I will call them lines. Trees have the property that they can't link back on them selves to make a loop, so triangles, squares, etc are all out. It has to only branch, although these 'trees' can branch from any direction.

These trees need to be irreducible, which is a fancy way of saying that no node can be connected with exactly two lines.

They also need to be homeomorphic, which fairly simply means that the direction and length of the lines doesn't really matter, so if you just flip one around, it isn't a brand new tree, it is just a different way of drawing the same tree.

OldWolf2,"""In the key of C"" means, in the key of C major.  The C major scale is defined as the notes C,D,E,F,G,A,B in that order.   Other major scales have the same intervals between notes, but just starting at a different point.

Chords in the key of a scale means that the chords are made of notes from that scale, in this case:

C-E-G
D-F-A
E-G-B
F-A-C
G-B-D
A-C-E
B-D-F

These chords are called ""C"", ""D"" etc. - the name of a chord is taken from the name of its root note. Some of them are major chords and some are minor chords - it depends on the interval between the notes.

As always in music, these chords can be 'decorated', for example G-B-D-F is common (this is called a ""seventh chord"" when the next note in the sequence is tacked on the end).

Saying that a song is ""in a key"" means that the song primarily uses chords from that key, and further, its underlying structure follows the basic progression (C -&gt; F -&gt; G in this case).

Without going into too much detail, songs will play on this theme a lot, but it can always be found underneath.  (In fact we could even say that C -&gt; F -&gt; G is a variation on C -&gt; G which is the most elementary progression - a difference of 2:3 in frequency ratios between the notes).

In any key, if it's major then the third is two whole steps up from the root.  If it's minor, the third is a whole step and a half step.

Playing a song in a ""key"" means that most of the notes used in the song are in that scale.

Fiber is a newer technology that works by transmitting pulses of light through a ""glass"" cable, instead of electrical current through a conductor. This is much faster and can support a lot more simultaneous signals, but it is also more expensive and requires installing cables all over again.

The second is that a nation can declare a specific diplomat ""persona non grata,"" meaning that they are no longer welcome in the country. If the diplomat declared such remains in the host country, he risks having his status revoked and he become subject to local law.

&gt;Why doesn't the observer percieve that the train is fully inside the tunnel when it passes through?

**What** observer?

If you're asking about the observer (putatively) at rest at the side of the railroad track, well then yes.  He *does, indeed* perceive that the train is only 99m long and it is entirely inside the tunnel for a brief period of time.

But I don't think you're asking that.  You're asking about the preception of a *second* observer, standing **on the train**, aren'tcha?

If you're asking about the observer (putatively) in motion on the train, the answer is actually much more complicated than that.

* First of all, according to the observer on the train, the train is still 101m long.  And the tunnel, moving at 20% c, is contracted to 98m long.

* Secondly, according to the observer on the train, the clocks at either end of the tunnel are moving slowly.  About 2% slower, in fact.

* Finally, you have to consider the question of *when it enters* in terms of how you know it entered.  What tells you that the train has entered the tunnel?  Well, if you're talking about ""a moment"" or ""a time"" you're talking about ""a clock.""  Which, of course, means you have to consider that in relativity, two clocks which are *in synch* in one reference frame are **never** in synch in other reference frames.

So while the guy in the rest frame thinks that two doors came down at exactly the same time, trapping the train, the guy in the train frame thinks the front door came down first, trapping the train, and the back door waited until the ass-end of the train made it into the tunnel before coming down.

""But wait!"" you might ask:  ""What about if the door made the train come to a stop?!?""

Sorry.  You can't ask those questions.  At least, not when you're talking about **Special** Relativity.  The train has to smash right on through the front door.

OldWolf2,"You have it backwards - the observer perceives the train to be fully inside the tunnel when it passes through.  The tunnel is 100m and the train is 99m (from the observer's point of view).

You might ask: doesn't this contradict the observations of someone on board the train, for whom the tunnel contracts, and so the train cannot fit in the tunnel all at once?

The explanation for this is that it takes time for the light from those events (train enters tunnel, train leaves tunnel) to reach the observer in question.

Once you take that into account, there is no puzzle. We define the ""length"" of something as the space-time distance between two simultaneous events, one at each end of the object.  So the relative time difference between when observers perceive two events, changes how they perceive its length.

For an explanation with diagrams and a bit of math, see [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_paradox).",null,0,cdj56b1,1r2xlf,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
airor,"There are two events happening in this problem.  One event is the front of the train exiting the tunnel.  The second event is the back of the train entering the tunnel.  Both of these events have an (x,t) space-time coordinate that depend on the frame of reference of the observer.

Because of the speed and length of the train and tunnel, these events have a time-like interval between them.  This means that ALL frames of reference will agree that light can't get from one event to the other.  It also means that the sequence of events (which came first) is dependent on the frame of reference of the observer.

There are two frames of reference in this problem.  The first frame of reference is from the point of view of an observer on the train lets call him Abe.  Abe sees a 101m train and a shorter tunnel.  To determine if the train is ""in"" the tunnel he stands at the center of the train and waits for the light from the two events to reach him.  Since both distances are the same the event that gets to him first (the front of the 101m train exiting the tunnel) occurs before the other (the back of the train entering the tunnel).

The other frame of reference (which you refer to in your question) is an observer stationary with respect to the tunnel who's name is Bob.  Bob decides to stand at a point at an equal distance from the front of the tunnel and the back and also waits for the light from the events to reach him.  He observes two important facts: the light from event at the back of the train reaches Bob before the light from the event at the back of the train and therefore the train was completely inside the tunnel, and that Abe on the train moved towards the front of the train while the light from the events were traveling.  So to Bob the distance light traveled from the back of the train to Abe was longer than the distance light traveled from the front of the train.  So while Bob agrees that Abe saw the light from the front of the train first, he disagrees with Abe's conclusion.

Abe on the other hand agrees that Bob saw the back of the train event first, but it was because Bob was moving toward the back of the train while the light was in transit from the events.

To really understand, you should calculate (x,t) and (x',t') for both of the events.  Assume the start of the tunnel is x=x'=0, and when the front of the train enters the tunnel is t=t'=0.  You can then see that the interval between the events is the same for both observers even when all the other numbers are different.",null,0,cdjrdih,1r2xlf,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

The concept is called apparent or relative wind speed; it's common on a sail boat and curiously we often use an example of a person on a bicycle to illustrate it. 

so, start by thinking of a day when there's no wind. You get on your bike and travel 5 kph (in any direction since there's no wind). You feel apparent wind of 5 kph. Now, if on another day, before you hop on, you realize that there's a 5 kph wind moving south, and you travel 5kph moving north, if feels as if there's 10 kph of wind; if you turn around and travel ""with"" the wind south, it would feel as if there's no wind.

things get a little more complicated when not going directly into or away from the actual wind.

When you're traveling with the wind, often it feels like there is no wind; yet if you look over the side of the boat you can see that you're moving quickly.

Then, usually in a single day, the house is cladded in materials like housewrap and tar paper, and windows and doors are installed. This is the ""drying in"" phase, and the wood inside the house is supposed to fall beneath a particular moisture content before construction continues.

stomptron4000,"I'm by no means a scientist, or have I done any research on this topic (other than have a bunch of straight and a bunch of gay friends, and have talked to most of them about this at one time or another).  My two cents:

There is a difference between your sexual orientation and who you are sexual attracted to.  Your sexual orientation is who you can fall in LOVE with.  Your sexual attraction is who you are can SLEEP with.  I feel there is a clear distinction between those two things.  

Hopefully everyone here can agree with me that who you are willing to sleep with and who you can fall in love with are two completely different things, with completely different requirements.  Just as sex doesn't equate to love, love doesn't equate to sex.  Me being a straight male, I can absolutely tell when another guy is attractive.  
However, I can tell that I'm high on the straight scale not because I find any homosexual interaction repulsive (I don't, fairly ambivalent actually), but because I can't imagine falling IN LOVE with a guy.  Being that vulnerable, trusting, and intimate (in a non-sexual way) with another guy is just not appealing.  But having that relationship with a woman is very appealing.  

To me, this explains (along with societal encouragement and acceptance) how a decent percentage of straight women can honestly have a ""lesbian phase"" in their life.  Any person of any orientation can think that anyone of any other orientation is ""attractive"" and be willing to have sex with them, even be capable of being in long-term relationships with that person.  (We all can relate to being or staying in relationships that were dysfunctional or broken for a litany of reasons other than love.) 

But being able to get to the level and depth that is required of capital L - Love is something that most humans can't fake, force, or ignore.  That level of attraction isn't something that people can control.  (As is the burden of all closeted homosexuals.)  

I'm not saying that this makes sexual orientation an either/or thing.  Bisexuality is a very real orientation.  Just as much as asexuality.  I'm just trying to explain my view on how people can seem to ""switch"", as the question asks.

TL;DR:  Who you have sex with does not determine your sexual orientation.  Who you can imagine spending your life with does.

Some of the evidence to support this are studies of finger length ratios between straight and gay males. You might like to search for studies on this.

If you're interested in the *causes* of homosexuality, then it would be worth considering why homosexual behaviour is so [widespread throughout the animal kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior) and whether it has any evolutionary benefit. For instance, it might be beneficial for an animal to raise young who themselves have no interest in reproduction if it frees them up for other useful behaviour such as caring for siblings or elders.

Situational Homosexuality occurs mainly in enforced single-sex environments, or in cultures that socially separate males and females, and may not reflect a person's sexuality, but merely be the only sexual activity available to a person.

And they can go in with arthroscopic surgery and repair the tear sufficiently well that professional athletes can resume their careers. Of course MRIs and arthroscopic surgeries are vastly more expensive than X-Rays and standard surgery.

2 - Insurance. When I was a kid we didn't have insurance. My parents were well off. But we paid all medical costs directly. So we only went to the doctor when things were serious. And we frequently declined certain treatments. Is that antibiotic really going to help? More often than not the answer was no. The cold would pass on its own. In such a situation we intentionally restricted our use of medicine. Insurance hides the cost of medicine. If I only have a small co-pay, I'm far more willing to get things done. And if I don't know how much a doctor charges, I'm going to the best doctor even if I don't need him because my cost is the same.

In addition to hiding the costs, insurance also adds a layer of paper work. Doctors have to hire staffs to take care of paperwork. And insurance companies have staffs to receive it and accept or deny claims. It has been estimated that over a third of the cost of medicine in the US is from the overhead insurance adds. This is one of the reasons the US is far more expensive than other 1st world medical systems.

3 - US law prevents a lot of negotiation on pricing. In other countries the FDA equivalents set up pricing structures as part of drug approvals. The FDA and in fact Medicare and Medicaid are legally prevented from entering into pricing negotiation with drug companies. In a lot of ways we are subsidizing the whole world. A drug that sells for $1000 per dose in the US, may sell for $100 per dose in Canada and $10 per dose in Brazil.

4 - The US has an aging population. The average age in the US is creeping up. And older people have more health issues than younger people, meaning we have more costs per person.

5 - The US has laws requiring emergency service. Hospitals are required to render aid. So we force indigent populations to wait until problems are life threatening. An infection that could have been treated by a nurse practitioner and a simple antibiotic instead gets treated by an ER staff and a multi day stay in the hospital.

StuartTwittle,"Letting corporations into every step of the process is why prices in the USA are so high.

In the usa the insurance company, doctors, hospital and pharma companies are all looking to keep their slice of the pie as large as possible. And the consumer has no leverage to keep the pricing competitive. 
In the UK there is only National Insurance (there are private health plans, buy they have very few customers you still have to pay the national insurance). And there is (essentially) only one treatment/medication provider - the NHS - which is publicly owned and not a private corporation looking to make money. The system makes no profit at all and actually runs at a loss - which is okay because the shareholders are the British public, who benefit from (and indeed *love*) the NHS.

The theory that having many private insurance and healthcare providers fosters competition to the benefit of the consumer has turned out to be false. What has happened in the USA is that private companies have *colluded* to raise and maintain the high cost of healthcare to increase and safeguard their profit margins.

I love our NHS. It has quite literally saved my life and provided me with truly world-class care and a dozen surgeries from one of the top ortho surgeons in the world - all at the age of 23 when i have obviously not paid a whole lot into the system yet.

t_hab,"Argentina wants its peso valued highly so that it can use its peso to buy dollars and pay off its debt. Typically, for a country to get a highly valued currency, you have to use your foreign reserves to buy your own currency and push up its value with artificial demand and thereby reducing the amount on the free market. 

This, of course, would be counter-productive, since a country can't, at the same time, use more of its money buying foreign reserves than foreign reserves to buy its own money and vice versa. The net purchase of foreign reserves has to either be positive or negative.

Argentina looked at this problem and decided to go with an alternative (that also exists in Venezuela and was tried during the French revolution). That is to say, instead of raising the value of its Peso buy buying lots of it, it decided to raise the value by legally mandating an exchange rate while it continued to spend lots of it. If a bank or business wants to operate in Argentina, they have to use the official rate, even if the official rate is artificially created by law. They also created a parallel law that all business in the country must be done in Argentine Pesos, not any foreign currency. 

Let's plug in some numbers. If the official rate is 5:1 but the real value as dictated by supply and demand is 10:1, that means that when an international company with a presence in Argentina brings in dollars, they go to the bank and exchange each dollar for 5 pesos. The bank gets its pesos in part from Argentina's central bank, and gives them the dollar. This allows the Argentine government to increase its foreign reserves and pay off its debt. It's a tax, but it's a popular tax, since apparently only big corporations pay it. 

Except it doesn't end there. Locals can see that the government is printing lots of money and that the currency doesn't have much real value. They don't want to have a ton of pesos sitting under their mattress since they don't know when they will stop having value. Goods that are imported become very expensive to them, especially at the official rate. 

Tourists coming in want to enjoy the thrills of Buenos Aires and the win of Mendoza without paying double for it. They have foreign currency, but they don't want to go to the bank and exchange it at 5:1. 

If only these tourists and these locals could somehow find each other and exchange at a rate that more accurately described their supply and demand preferences... 

And that's how you get the black market. I go to Argentina every year and I want to get pesos as cheaply as possible. Locals hate having pesos and are thrilled to get dollars into the country. I often exchange with friends, but when I can't I go to the black market and use a middle-man, who charges a percentage by buying and selling at slightly different rates. 

Once this difference between official exchange rates and supply-demand exchange rates exist, however, an entire black market, involving smuggling, credit card scams, bank loopholes, etc also starts to pop up. 

Edit: it's also worth noting that once a black market exists and people stop using banks, the double-exchange rate becomes ineffective at helping the government increase its stock of foreign reserves, since the increased stock of foreign reserves now go into the pockets of those running the black market. This, in Argentina, has had the effect of reducing its foreign reserves even lower than before they implemented the policy. Either they will have to eliminate the double-exchange rate or begin to arrest people for using the black market. ",null,1,cdj1n6b,1r2eu8,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10
Wild_Marker,"You can ask us on /r/argentina for more details, but the short version is this:

We can't buy dollars legally. In fact that applies to all foreign currency. You need to go through a huge bureaucratic mess to get even a small amount, and you need justification, AND even then there's no guarantee that the government will approve the purchase.

This is because right now, our country's foreign currency reserves are dangerously low, so the government is trying to stop consumers from using them until they figure out a solution (if they ever do). Since you can't get them legally, that's where the black market comes in. Buying ""blue"" dollars is more expensive than the official exchange rate, but when it's your only option if you plan on traveling, you can see why the ""blue"" dollar has proliferated.",null,1,cdiwnfw,1r2eu8,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10
BoatLifeMN,"This is a complicated subject with many factors.  If you want a poster child for this bullshit in Latin America - look at Venezuela.


**The ""Blue Dollar"" dual-currency essentially is a product of government control and lack of trust in the Argentine Peso.  The lack of stability in Argentina has caused most citizens that have means to either hoard money in US dollars or invest them abroad.  Too many dollars are leaving the federal reserve so the Government creates controls, creating a black market for US dollars.**


It helps to think about currency value as essentially an IOU.


Let me give you a simplified break down of how this happened:


**1)**	No one trusts the Argentine government or banks to keep the value of the currency steady after the the [Crisis of 2001]&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_%281999%E2%80%932002%29&gt; where the banks stole everyone’s savings

**2)**	People trade in their pesos for dollars, and move them out of the formal economy (under their mattress) or out of the country

**3)**	Peso value drops further due to inflation (caused by 1 &amp; 2)

**4)**	People see the value dropping and points 1, 2, and 3 worsen

**5)**	Argentine government steps in and “doctors” official inflation statistics to ~10% (but in reality is ~25%).  This allows them to pay any inflation-linked bonds owed to other countries at a lower rate

**6)**	People see the prices of basic items going up ~25% a year and have a higher demand for more stable US dollars, so the peso:dollar ratio continues to climb

**7)**	Argentine government controls the official exchange rate to a fixed 4.5:1 and restricts the amount of US dollars that banks can give out.  The average person can only exchange a few hundred USD per month

**8)**	People desperately want USD and start to trade on the black market with people that have USD.  Those people charge more for each USD due to demand

**9)**	Peso value drops further, exacerbating previous points leading to a circle jerk where the banks sell limited USD for 4.5Pesos:1USD  while people on the street will sell them to you for 10:1



All numbers are approximate.

For women, it is impossible to be bald if their fathers are not bald, and if their fathers are bald, then it is the probability as their mothers giving them an X chromosome with the baldness gene.

Men do not have a gene to pair it against, so it will always end up dominant.",null,1,cdivl2w,1r2eit,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3
garrettj100,"The two sex chromosomes, X and Y, also carry certain genes, including that for hair loss.  There exists a gene on the X chromosome that lets you keep your hair when you get older.  So women, with two X chromosomes, get two bites at that apple to keep their hair.

The Y chromosome, on the other hand, contains very little genetic information at all, and contains no *keep-your-hair* gene.  So men only get once chance to keep their hair.

When a couple has a child, they each (mostly) randomly donate one of their chromosomes to the child, which, among other things, determines the sex of the child.  For boys the mother donated one of her two X chromosomes, while father donated his Y.  For girls the mother donated one of her two X chromosomes, while father donated his X instead.

For two parents, **both keeping currently their hair**, a daughter will *always* keep her hair, because the father had the *keep-your-hair* gene on his X chromosome he donated to the child.  The mother may or may not have donated a *keep-your-hair* chromosome, depending on both which X she donated, and whether she has two *keep-your-hair* X's or just the one.

On the other hand, a son will have to look further up the tree.  Did his *Maternal Grandfather* keep his hair?  If he did, then the mother likely has the double *keep-your-hair* X's and whichever X she donates it'll include the *keep-your-hair* X.  If his Maternal Grandfather was bald, however, then his mother (assuming she kept her hair) has a 50-50 shot of donating the *keep-your-hair* X rather than the empty X.  And the son thus has a 50-50 shot of going bald.

Now, for two parents, both of whom have gone bald, the situation is reversed.  All offspring will be eventually bald, because there isn't a single X chromosome with the *keep-your-hair* to be had in the genetic soup.

The final, and more common case is if the father is bald but the mother kept her hair.  For that couple we also need to look up to the maternal grandfather, to get a hint as to whether the mother is a double *keep-your-hair* or just a single.  If the maternal grandfather is bald then a double *keep-your-hair* mother is impossible.  If the maternal grandfather kept his hair, then there's a chance that she's a double, assuming the maternal *grandmother* kept her hair.

What's interesting is that because the father donates his Y chromosome to the son, the outcome for the son is pretty much completely independent of whether his father went bald.  It only matters what kind of X the mother donates.  Though I'm only thinking of it now, that may very well be where the whole ""skips a generation"" notion comes from.

And for some cities, the difference between renting and owning might not provide an advantage to owning after adding in property taxes, HOA fees, maintenance, etc.

Also, leasing an apartment, even through a private landlord, is something that can be done in a week, sometimes even a day. Buying a house requires credit checks, loan approvals, bids, escrow, then actually getting the house, maintaining it, paying your mortgage, and hoping that the value of your home or the area around it doesn't drop.

Buying a home is an investment - even if a mortgage might cost you only $1,000 a month, thats over 30 years, and you are on the hook for the hundreds of thousands that the home might be worth, even if the value of the home falls (a serious concern in the last 5-10 years). If you're lucky and the value goes up when you sell then you turn a profit, assuming you can even sell the house in a timely manner. Worst case scenario is you have to keep the house, try to rent it, and deal with the responsibilities of being a landlord while you try to figure out how to manage your current housing situation. This is not something anyone can do, it requires a certain kind of person with business/financial stability to handle properly. One bad tenant can seriously fuck your life up.

If you are like the friends/family I know who got the sour end of a home purchase, you'd do anything to go back and rent/lease, because it would have been cheaper than the tens or hundreds of thousands that can be lost of housing values drop significantly.

- Invest in a decent, comfortable matress. What is comfortable for you might not be comfortable to others. I love a super soft one and sleep like a baby when I sink into it.

- Buy a sun alarm clock. Melatonin is the hormone responsible for sleep. When your body needs rest, melatonin is released to cause drowsiness. However, light inhibits melatonin and either wakens you up or prevents you from sleeping. A sun alarm clock works by brightening gradually over the course of half an hour and wakening you gently. Providing you have had enough sleep, you will wake up refreshed.

- Keep all lights low in the lead up to bedtime. As I said earlier, light inhibits melatonin and prevents drowsiness.

- Allow yourself time to relax before bed. No stimulating games, movies or anything right before bed. A minimum of half an hour of unwind time - reading is ideal (not on a tablet - they're like staring into a torch, unless you can get an app that dramatically lowers brightness).

- Meditate before bed. Rid yourself of anxious pre-sleep thoughts. Whatever state of mind you go to sleep with will affect your sleep. Negative thoughts right before sleep will make you restless and will not be conducive to a healthy 8 hour sleep.

1. Sleep Apnea - Due to a variety of issues, you may not properly breath during the night. Several factors can exacerbate and/or cause apnea.  These include but are not limited to: obesity, smoking, diseases effecting your lungs (i.e., a disease that would cause dyspnea or reduce your lungs tidal volume), abnormally large soft palettes (i.e., your tongue/back of tongue are larger than the airway), use of alcohol, some prescriptions (i.e., muscle relaxants, pain killers, depressants, et al.), the position in which you sleep, allergies, nasal congestion, nasal blockage (i.e., polyps, deviated septums), and others.

There's more to it than just what is above - sleep apnea is dangerous.  It can definitely lead to heart damage.  If snore - you have it.  If you get drunk and have it, it could potentially be fatal, as it exacerbates reflux.  

To understand more about sleep apnea - [Click here](http://bit.ly/1aRE77M).

2. Circadian Rhythms - Jet Lag or Rapid Time Zone Change Syndrome, Shift Work Sleep Disorder, Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPD) and Non 24-Hour Sleep Wake Disorder are types of Circadian Sleep disorders, which will disrupt you while you sleep - interrupting the body's processes that are necessary to waking and feeling well rested. Some of this can be caused by lack of daylight (Vitamin D), melatonin regulation issues, and other factors.  Others have mentioned this as an issue.

3. Dehydration and/or Poor Nutrition - Your body is carbon based machine. If you are not properly hydrating, dehydration can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Certainly, if you go to be dehydrated, you will not wake up feeling ""better than usual."" You need to hydrate throughout the day and then there's nutrition.  You are what you eat.

paradoxpancake,"I answered a similar question as to why someone felt ""heavy"" when they woke up. The same answer still applies, but the following is copy/paste:

Now, while you feeling heavy could be realistically caused by any number of things, I'd likely say that the most common cause is that your body is going through something called ""sleep inertia"". Essentially, your body is coming out of the hypnopompic state of sleep and the frontal lobe of your brain is a bit restricted in the first few minutes of you waking up. This can lead to a loss in motor skills, speech, short-term memory, etc. Sleep inertia is basically responsible for all of that. Sleep inertia is also greater when you go long periods of time without resting. Though, other various influences can cause you to have a large amount of sleep inertia even if you get a whole night's rest. For example, TOO much sleep will actually cause a greater amount of sleep inertia. Hope that helps. 

End of copy/paste. Essentially, sleep inertia is usually the culprit as it is taking your brain a bit to kick into gear, so you'll feel sluggish, your motor control is lower than normal, etc. I have a family member that had sleeping issues for a very long time and this was the explanation that we were given by a neurologist. The best way that I know of to get rid of that sluggish feeling is having your bed exposed to sunlight when you wake up. Blue light is a way of telling the body that it is time to wake up, night is over, you should be up during the day. In fact, there are alarm clocks that instead of having a jarring, grating alarm, they will progressively begin to shine light on you to gradually bring you out of sleep. You may still feel partially sluggish, but it's probably going to be less than you normally do.",null,2,cdiwhzr,1r2clx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

trafficlightblue,"This may be strange or impractical but here is my experience...

I used to be severely overweight (250lbs/18stone/113kg) and infrequently exercised. In addition to this setback, I had terrible posture from prolonged video game/computer use (think the vulture crane neck + hunchback). About two years ago, I got my act together and started practicing good posture, frequent exercise, and a general improvement in quality of life (down to 170-180lbs neighborhood).

My sleep didn't get much better, if at all.

My poor posture led me to sleep on my side/stomach with my top leg thrown over my bottom leg causing lower back stress throughout the night, and in turn, frequent disturbance during the night. I switched beds, tried a Tempurpedic (okay), and ultimately heard about sleeping on the floor.

I've coupled limiting caffeine after 5PM, having a bed time ritual, and sleeping predominantly on my back (or proper side sleeping posture) to formulate a good quality of sleep. Now when I wake up, my muscles feel like they have had an extended period of rest which allows me to shake the morning blues in a matter of minutes as opposed to two to three hours. I believe my mental state correlates to the physical rest. (Think of your brain as a toddler - with a quality night sleep, the toddler wakes up feeling satisfied. Conversely, a bad night's sleep causes the toddler to feel like he just had the TV turned off, just got told no, AND threw his favorite toy out the car windows all at once!)

TL;DR: Try sleeping on the floor (or equally firm surface) with your back straight, and you will tend to keep this posture throughout the night and awaken in better condition.

fattmagan,"Just in case this hasn't been answered well enough yet.

Anyway, I was just discussing this with my roommate on the way to class. It's about your sleep cycle. 

During sleep, we move through 4 phases, which are defined by the type of brainwave active, and we move from stage 1 to REM about every 80-90 minutes. We do that cycle 4 times in a normal sleep cycle (8-9 hours of sleep). I'm on mobile so I can't link it, but the graph for this looks like a sin wave with a little tail at the end.

At the tail end of this, you end up in stage 1, the lightest sleep, so the energy it takes to bring your brain to conscious activity (wake up) is minimal and you feel great.

But, if you don't complete your sleep cycle and wake up in a deeper sleep, it takes more energy to get to conscious activity, making you feel groggy and desire sleep.

And any interruptions can mess with you too. The better you remember your dreams the closer you were to the REM stage, and if you deprive yourself of sleep your mind will go straight for REM and skip the earlier stuff to compensate. This why you dream when you nap sometimes and is the basis of other sleep cycles, like the 2-hour one consisting of small naps taken throughout the day. Again, I apologize for not being able to link anything, but this one was named after the guy that discovered and maintained it for several years with no medical complications.

Another fun fact is that alcohol (supposedly) prevents you from entering the REM stage of your cycle so that's why you feel fine when you wake up at 7 am from a night of drinking that ended at 4 am. But I'm not so sure of this because my drunk dreams get downright crazy.

But that's not really pertinent to you for 16 more years anyway.

&gt; Council voted by large margins to significantly cut Ford’s budget as mayor, his ability to speak first and last on council agendas, his right to designate key items and to give the deputy mayor control over the mayor’s staffing. The deputy mayor, Norm Kelly, takes over a number of Ford’s role, including becoming the chair of the executive committee.

Because he was a conservative darling, and the liberals are in charge in Ontario.  Sitting back and watching him trainwreck is nothing but good for them.

As doc daneeka says, the provincial government could step in and remove him, and he's not facing a criminal conviction any time soon.  Toronto was specifically constructed with a strong mayorship to keep the previous cities that all got glued together in line.

But the question, if you are a Liberal politician voting to remove him is 'what do I get out of it?'.  The longer this goes on the more footage there is going to be of Ford doing ridiculously stupid things, and come election time they'll run ads with Conservative politicians saying nice things about Rob Ford, and then have a video of Rob Ford doing something terrible.  

The things is, essentially nothing important is going to happen in Toronto in the short term (sorry guys, but it's true, cities just don't do much that can't wait a couple of years), and anything critical - say a flood or something, they can deal with as a one off basis.  But Ford is only there until october of next year, the longer they wait on doing anything the more they can blame on Ford as it goes badly, and the more political ammunition they get.

ZhanchiMan,"Plainly, they just age faster than humans do. 

18 years for a dog would be comparable to a human living 100 years.

5-year-old answer: They age faster, and therefore, pass away at an earlier date.

12th-grade answer: The way that their DNA replicates is in a way where their DNA degrades at a faster rate. There a 100 or so base pairs (steps in a twisted ladder) that are lost every time DNA is replicated and the cell to which those copies go to splits. Over time, the loss of base pairs in replication will eventually hit coding DNA (the important parts in your DNA) and since the coding parts of the DNA are now not functional because you lost 100 or so base pairs in the dna chain, then you age. For dogs, this happens at a substantially greater rate, causing them to age a lot faster that humans. The opposite is true for parrots and some turtles. They actually have non-coding sections in their DNA that act as protection against the loss of important base pairs. These sections of Non-coding dna are called telomeres. These telomeres prevent DNA from aging until they are used up, or until they aren't made anymore. Humans have telomeres in their DNA until roughly the age of 2, which means essentially we have the possibility of not aging and living forever until we are roughly two years old. For dogs, I'm guessing their telomeres either are used up earlier, or they just don't exist for a dog. ",null,2,cdiu8mc,1r29ac,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10
yakrider07,"Okay, I put up some criticism, but noone put up good explanation, so I'm taking the plunge.

As to do with most questions about biology that seem puzzling at first, the answer has to do with evolution and evolutionary equilibrium.

**TL/DR : Animal life-spans are determined by evolution selecting for the shortest possible life-span that allows the animal species to proliferate. For humans, it is longer than for other animals because tribes of ancient humans benefited from transmission of knowledge, cultures, customs and inter-tribe connections from older and wiser to younger members, thus aiding their survival and spread**

But before getting into that more, let me say that details on why some animals age faster than others in terms of how some mechanisms work at a cellular or genetic level is actually missing the point. Why? because if there was strong enough evolutionary pressure, the animals would over generations change their body chemistry so they age slower. But they dont. Why? Thats the real question here.

So think of it in the extreme form like for Salmon. Most fish don't just suddenly age and die. But salmon do. Even those that reach the breeding grounds upstream in great condition. Why? Mostly because evolution selected for salmon that spent very little energy trying to maintain their bodies, and all of it in swimming upstream faster / sooner and mating vigorously. What happens after they mate was not an evolutionary concern. When you have a complex system and you dont maintain it, it fails. It fails rapidly everywhere. Death ensues.

So aging is a similar issue. Natural selection for all plant / animal species has picked out close to the optimum life span that an individual organism is worth preserving for to ensure its long term survival and proliferation. This answers many things. Lets start thinking this way :


**Extended details for those interested...**

- What would happen if some animals were immortal ? Well, **an immortal species would go EXTINCT !**. This is because over time the environment and other animals around change, so what was the most well adapted species is no longer competitive anymore. They would soon all be killed by predators or climate or even more importantly by disease. (And I emphasize disease because disease is caused by microbes which are very small and live and die and evolve most rapidly, so they are the hardest to keep up with).

- So clearly living long isn't really that good. Evolution is biased towards quicker living and quicker dying species so it can evolve the fastest. So any additional years you keep an organism alive HAS to come with signficant benefits. Not for that animal itself (evolution couldn't care about any particular individual), but for the survival of the population as a whole.

- So over time, animal species tend to acquire life-spans that are optimal based on their environment (including how fast it changes, how the animal lives, what its predators are, how much food children need to grow, how much the seasons change etc). So this is really why things are the way they are :

- Evolutionary optimization means the optimal life span for larger animals is longer than that for smaller animals because they need time to grow to their full size, and that is limited, among many other things, by food availability. So this creates a generally applicable correlation where bigger animals usually live longer. Further, needing to provide lots of food to produce and rear a big baby means you can only have so many babies at once, this means to maintain population a big animal usually has to keep having babies for many years, which again means it has to live longer.

- Animals that can only raise a few offspring at a time, and only on good years, clearly need to live long otherwise they would soon go extinct. Examples include humans, penguins, many birds and predators, large animals and so on.

- Animals with few natural predators tend to have longer lifespans than those with many predators. Not just life-expectancy, but life-span! Why? because if chances are you will be eaten up before seeing too many seasons, it is more efficient to spend all the energy trying to have as many offspring as quickly as possible instead of the body spending some energy keeping it strong and healthy. So eventually the species evolves to breed earlier and quicker and let the body age and die sooner.

- Animals usually settled in faster changing environments have shorter lifetimes than animals in slower changing environments. Clearly how big the effect is depends on the scale of change. But for instance the it is part of the reason some tropical forest species like macaws live so long because their habitat and their niche has been stable for long periods of time (The other and just as important reasons include having fewer predators, their being intelligent social species with adult learning, the optimality of raising few chicks at a time and so forth). Same with many deep sea species like deep sea sharks, squid, octopus and other deep sea fish.

- Similarly, animals that use learned intelligence to help their survival generally live longer than other. They just need time to pick up all the skills from their parents or colony. And having to spend time teaching a kid limits the number of offspring an individual can have, thus making them have to live longer for the species to survive.

- **So finally**, it makes sense why humans live that long. They are relatively large. Their weak babies need a lot of care while they are young so they cant have too many at once. They need to teach their kids many skills and keep feeding them as they grow up so extra effort is required. This explains why human menopause is so late (around 40, almost the lifespan of most animals).  **Further**, since humans are social species at an inter-tribal level as well, it turns out having older adults even past menopause helps to preserve and transmit the acquired knowledge from a far, of environments that were different, of networks and connections with far and away tribes and so forth. So evolution selected for tribes where even non-reproducing old adults survived and lived to old age. And as bonus, it turns out in tight social groups like those of humans, grandparents can help in rearing the grandkids and keeping them alive so the parents can have more children. And there is nothing evolution loves more than animal populations that can have more kids and keep them alive.

- And finally, coming down to a lower level, since evolution selected for these, the right sets of genes, traits, and even instincts and culture was selected to make this happen at a cellular and genetic level. For animals where shorter lifespans were optimal, biochemical systems that were more efficient and less conducive to long term maintenance were chosen. If there were any potential problems, mutations etc that would cause early death in animals with longer optimal lifespans, they were rooted out in selecting the longer living individuals. For species with shorter optimal lifespan, they were not. Either way, for each species, by the time the optimal lifespan rolls around, the lack of maintenance, the wear and tear, the piles of un-resolved genetic errors and damaging interactions become overwhelming, and the body and organs deteriorate, start showing breakdown and eventually become unable to support life, the process which we call aging and death. 
- Bonus : so what are these *things* that pile up that we are talking about? things like cancerous gene networks. Inadequate clearing of arteries leading to cardiovascular problems. Inadequate replacement of organ cells leading to organ failure. Inadequate maintenance of bones and muscles leading to arthritis and muscle atrophy. Non-existent methods to rid the body of accumulated toxins, scarring damage, etc causing the aged appearance, the lost elasticity of skin, wrinkling, weak ligaments and muscles etc. So yeah, death becomes sort of inevitable and hard to cure when you think about it this way. Aging is a bitch. In particular because it a thousand bitches all bitching with the same goal.

And after understanding that, it also suddenly makes sense why preventing aging and death is sooo hard. It is because there's no one system that breaks. It is like trying to keep a machine made out of millions of biodegradable parts each of which have a lifetime of a month, going for a year. Over time, everything will break down and literally fall apart. From inside out and outside in. From the molecular, cellular, to the systems level. Indeed, many believe humans will just take to living as robots far before we learn to substantially extend our lifespans, not least because the level or technology that would enable us to fix aging, will likely also allow us to create artificial robotic bodies that are far more capable, comfortable, upgradeable, and customizable than our biological bodies ever will be!",null,1,cdj7ylo,1r29ac,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

the amtrak tickets cost us $285 for two people, round trip, relaxing with large seats, plenty of room to move around, a great view of pretty much the breadth of Upstate New York, plug points for our laptops, and WiFi (albeit a bit slow). A similar flight would have been faster, and for 50-100$ more, might have been better - but it was a comfortable ride at a price that was not that much worse than a plane.

Depending on where you are going, and how early you book, Amtrak also has various deals/specials that can sometimes beat the price/hassle of dealing with a plane - with Amtrak (at least from what i remember at Penn station) there is far less stress in getting on and off the train.

Of course planes have the advantage of being able to choose airports, whereas Amtrak is kind of stuck to its line, so to speak. Airliners do not have to maintain the airports or the air itself, but Amtrak has to keep miles of railway and wiring working through bad weather.

Plus there aren't going to be as many people crammed on that car as there could be on an airplane. There aren't always as many riders, and the stops are more controlled - meaning smaller ridership. With fewer riders, this means higher prices for a particular journey in order to keep costs the same.

JackDuvallTrides,"*...why can't they consolidate those trips and hook a passenger car or two on there?*

""They"" aren't the same company -- the tracks are owned by one railroad, the engines *usually* by the same company but not always, the cars may belong to one or more different railroads depending on the arrangement...and Amtrak is an entirely separate organization from the rest.

In fact, Amtrak owns very few tracks of its own.  Its arrangement for cross-country service is to share tracks belonging to freight railroads, but that doesn't extend to hooking up passenger cars to the end of a cargo train...plus, if your railroad is dragging a mile of coal cars across country, stopping at the railroad stations and being responsible for the people on the passenger cars is far too much to expect from the cargo-focused railroads.  So, Amtrak runs its own engines,  has its own conductors and engineers,  and has its own stations and stops.

The cost depends on access to the tracks and demand for the service.  Out west, a round-trip ticket from Fargo to the oil patch on the Empire Builder, one of the oldest passenger lines in America, for which they've had to add extra cars due to oilfield demand, costs about $80 for the thousand-mile round trip.

It is a common misconception that x amount of fuel is used per revolution. This is false.  Instead, it's directly related to how much you press the gas pedal, which opens the throttle.  The throttle determines how much air is sucked into the engine.  The carburetor or fuel injectors adjust the fuel amount based on the amount of air, not how fast the engine is spinning.

If you think about it, this makes sense. Say you rev your engine to 4000 rpm and take your foot off the gas pedal.  If it used the same amount of fuel, you would never slow down to 2000 rpm (at least without load).  When you take your foot off the gas pedal, the engine is still spinning, but the throttle is closed, and the fuel is cut.

meepstah,"Folks are right; while maintaining speed you will not use nearly twice as much fuel.  A thought experiment can help explain the phenomenon though: 

Suppose I push a brick across the floor by shoving it distance and waiting for it to stop.  I do it by giving it a certain amount of force, which causes the brick to move one foot per shove.  I shove it once per minute.  

In this scenario, the brick is going to move one foot per minute, or sixty feet in an hour.  

Now I double my shove rate without changing my force:  The brick now moves one foot but it does so twice per minute.  It crosses the floor at a new rate of 120 feet per minute.  

One more change...now I continue to shove twice per minute but I lower the force of my shove so the brick only moves half a foot.  It's moving twice as often, but half as far per shove, so it is back to 60 feet per hour. 

In a car, the ""shoves"" are the pistons in your engine moving against your drivetrain.  The force of the shove is determined by the amount of gas injected into each cylinder, which explodes and literally pushes the piston, which pushes your car forward.  

At 2000 RPM, to maintain a certain speed, you need each cylinder to push with a certain amount of force.  If you double the rate of the cylinder pushes, you need half as much force...half as much gas, twice as often.  

That's the pure, unexcepted ELI5 version.  In reality, there are a lot of friction, momentum, pressure, and general efficiency variables as you run your engine at different speeds.   Generally speaking, you'll get slightly less mileage as you increase your engine speed for the same amount of output simply because moving parts are working harder (wasting more energy via friction) and because the gas expansion in the cylinders becomes less efficient at delivering energy as hotter gas is expelled and higher final pressures are released.

djazzbass,"So every year (theoretically) Congress passes a budget to keep the US running. If they spend more in this budget than the US collects in taxes, there is a deficit. If there is a deficit, the national debt increases. 

The short answer to why the debt increased under Clinton even though there was a ""surplus"" is that there was never a true surplus on the federal budget. Every year Clinton was in office the US spent more on operations than they did received in taxes. So why do people say there was a surplus? Here's some copy pasta from another ELI5 I answered a couple days ago:

Saying ""Clinton ran a surplus"" is like Obi Wan telling Luke ""Darth Vader killed your father"" - it's true, from a certain point of view. 

What happened is this: When you pay federal income taxes, you actually pay three different things: (1) actual federal income tax, (2) Social Security, and (3) Medicare. #1 is what you pay to keep the USA running - military, etc. #2 and #3 are called ""FICA"", and are social programs for old people. We'll call them both social security for brevity. Think of these as two separate revenue streams to the government - federal taxes and social security - intended for two separate things 

In theory, all money to pay for government operations should come from income taxes alone. They're not allowed to take SS money directly and buy tanks for the Army. If the government spends more than they bring in from income taxes, they borrow money to cover the difference by selling US Treasury bonds. This is the deficit. They do this pretty much every single year.

For SS revenue, all that money legally has to go towards SS benefits and Medicare. With only couple of exceptions, social security takes in more money than they pay out every single year. In fact, SS has a surplus of almost $3 trillion right now.  So what happens each year when SS takes in too much money? They save it for the future. How? They invest it in the safest thing possible - US Treasury bonds. So the government sell bonds to cover their deficit, and SS buys bonds to invest their surplus. Staring to see the connection...

Ideally, we should always look at these two revenue streams as completely separate and having nothing to do with each other. In reality, no one does this. So, what happened in Clinton's last couple years in office was this: SS took in a LOT more money than they paid out (the economy was very good). The federal government spent more money on operations than they collected in taxes (as usual). However, for one of the first times ever, that year's deficit from operations was LESS than SS's surplus. Since SS had to (by law) buy US treasury bonds to invest their surplus, the government claimed a surplus *overall* because they didn't have to sell any extra bonds *outside of what SS was obligated to purchase by law*.

Saying Clinton balanced the budget is like saying you and your spouse have a balanced budget. You make $40,000/yr and so does he/she. You spend $50,000/yr, and they spend $25,000/yr. At the end of the year, there's $5000 left in the checking account (and your spouse has a $10,000 IOU from you). Yea! You didn't go in to debt! Well, *you* did, as you spent $10k more than you made.

In that case the nominal value of the debt is still increasing, but it's relative worth compared to your income is still going down.  Like borrowing 100 dollars a year when you get a 1000 dollar raise every year at the same time.

meepstah,"In much shorter form: 

The current economists who are ""running"" our system here in the USA operate under the assumption that a little bit of inflation is necessary to keep our debt-based society running.  This is (again, very much in short) due to the fact that nearly everyone is borrowing money.  Why is this?

If you inflate the value of currency, their debt gets easier to manage:  I owe $100, I make $50 per year, it takes me two years to pay off my debt.  If the currency inflates 100%, I now make $100 a year (even though it's worth the same), and it only takes me one year to pay off my debt.  If the currency deflates 50%, I now make $25 per year and it takes me four years to pay off that debt - this is bad in a debt-based economy. 

So yes, for the foreseeable future, the American Dollar will inflate until a cheeseburger costs $1000.  At today's 2-3% inflation rate, that will take a long time, but it will eventually happen.

sir_sri,"&gt;Prices are always going up. Why?

Because inflation adjusts economies both internally (relative to debt) and relative to each other - my economy inflating at 2% a year and  yours at 4 are essentially revaluing relative to each other slowly over time.  

Deflation is worse - where people aren't spending money on goods and it's preferable to hold onto money as it will be worth more later.  

Central banks or the federal reserve are deliberately causing inflation, but not too much (too much inflation, while having the right general effect goes too far the other way, making rapid acquisition of goods absolutely necessary).  

&gt; Will one day people pay $1,000 for a cheeseburger?

Probably.  

Well, somewhere along the line someone might decide they want to reissue the currency and change everything up, and just divide by 1000 or whatever, but at one point average hourly wages in the US were 10 cents and hour (that's like 1830's), and now it's into the 20 dollar an hour range, so times change.

iliterallyh8yourface,"Historically speaking the answer would be yes, however that price would simply be in new denominations. As humans have come to better understand economic theory I cannot precisely say what will happen in the future. Hopefully we don’t get to the point of reckless debasement as has happened so often  in the past. 

To use two old currencies … Rome (Denarii) and Britain (Pound) I think you can get an idea of how currency migrates through inflation. This is a very simplistic view and doesn’t count a host of additional factors.
Originally the operational (to buy normal things on a daily basis) currency in Imperial Rome was Sesterces which were the equivalent to a quarter Denarii.  Similarly pennies were used operationally in lieu of the much more valuable Pound Sterling, which were originally 240 pennies to a pound in medieval England. Once hundreds of years of inflation had occurred, for various reasons, the operational currency had migrated upward to the Denarii and Pound respectively with the former operational currency being relegated to small change.
  
Same thing has occurred in the US over a much shorter timeframe. You will hear some older folks talking about how they used to buy things for nickels and dimes.  Operational values were in cents. What was once the operational currency is now small change. 

So the answer is, probably yes but we may not call it dollars anymore. Maybe we have moved into $100 denominations and we would say, “Cheeseburger was good but for 100 Bens I wouldn’t go back.” I don’t really feel like Americans could do what they do in Japan and deal with such high numbers on a daily basis. 

As far as never ending inflation goes I don’t see it ending anytime soon. The current economic theorists think inflationary monetary policy forces people to move money around, which in theory is good.

Burner215,"This is of course a 10,000 foot overview of the subject but the principles are sound. 


Inflation/deflation is the inverse fluctuation between the amount of money in circulation and the amount of goods and services in circulation. Hypothetically lets say we had an economy that had $1,000 in circulation and the price of a loaf of bread was $.10. If you doubled the amount of money in circulation to $20,000 then bread would eventually inflate to $.20/loaf. On the other side of the equation, if the baker got a new oven that doubled his production then perhaps you'd see a decrease in bread prices. 


**An increase in the money supply = inflation**

**A decrease in the money supply = deflation**

**An increase in the amount of goods and services in circulation = deflation**

**A decrease in the amount of goods and services in circulation = inflation**


What we're seeing currently in our economy is mainly a fluctuation in the money supply as the production of goods and services is pretty stable. This fluctuation in the money supply (also known as the M3) is caused by the Federal Reserve Corporation counterfeiting and/or destroying money. When our government needs money over and above what it collects in taxes it borrows from the Federal Reserve Corporation. The FED Corp then goes to it's computers and after a few keystrokes it creates out of thin air the needed money then deposits it into the Federal Treasury. Yes, this process is obscured through the governments sale of bonds/IOU's but this is basically how it works. After this loan from the FED to the government, we the people are then obligated to pay interest on that money created out of thin air. So the Federal Reserve Corporation gets to collect interest that it can spend for tangible goods and services in exchange for money it created out of thin air. 


By the way, the amount of income tax collected closely equals the amount of interest paid on the national debt. If we eliminated the privately owned Federal Reserve Corporation and started to print our own money again rather than borrow it from the FED then we could eliminate this interest payment and also eliminate income taxes without without suffering any loss. 


Back on point, when the money supply (the M3) is increased this is referred d to as monetary inflation. Once that money makes it's way into circulation and changes the price of a loaf of bread then it's referred to as price inflation. So the first users of that newly created money get to purchase goods and services and the lower preinflation prices. Once they spend it into circulation and it creates price inflation then the rest of us have to pay the inflated prices. 

I could explain the current situation of deflation that we're seeing in regards to commodities such as oil/gas, silver/gold and such and explain the multiplying effect of fractional reserve but I think your initial question has been answered. ",null,4,cdisntd,1r24ab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

bagridersjohn,"VPN (Virtual Private Network) and Tor (""Onion Routing"") are two very different technologies, used for two very different goals. I'm assuming that you have a basic understanding of how the Internet works with requests and such in my answer.

Tor is primarily used as a means of obscuring your online identity by making it nearly impossible to track down where a request originated from. For example, a web server may log the IP address of every request that it responds to. When browsing normally (i.e., without using Tor), you could find your exact IP address in the server's logs, therefore the administrator could theoretically track you down in person and say ""Gee, thanks so much for visiting my website!""

When utilizing the Tor routing system, your request is routed through a series of servers known as ""nodes"".  Eventually, your request exits the Tor network through an ""exit node"" and proceeds on to the destination server. In this scenario, you would not be able to find your IP address in the server's log, instead you would see the IP address of the exit node, the last node in the Tor network that your request was routed through.

A VPN can be either a site-to-site (connecting two networks together) or remote access, which is the most common usage for your every day user. A common usage for a remote access VPN would be granting employees access to a companies intranet from their home, via VPN. Without the VPN, the employee would need to be on site and connected to the companies intranet in order to access the internal resources, for example a network attached storage server. A graphic designer for a web firm may need to access or upload his/her work to the companies storage server, which is located in the office's server room. By establish a remote access VPN, the graphic designer can work from home and upload/retrieve files to/from the companies storage server without needing to drive to the office and connect to the office network.

TLDR:
A VPN establishes a secure tunnel between two points: be it two networks (site-to-site) or a single computer to another network (remote access), allowing secure access to data as if you were physically connected to the remote network. Tor is a routing mechanism which is intended to shroud the origin of a request by bouncing the request through a series of encrypted nodes, making it very difficult if not impossible to trace the request back to its origin.

If a person takes one pill and it doesn't work for him, then the doctor can prescribe 1n1/2 or 2 pills for the patient and see if that works better knowing 2 pills is still well within the LD50 of the drug so shouldn't harm the patient if he takes two.

The biggest issue is that the chemistry of batteries is limited and research in the field goes much slower than research on processors. Finding ideal battery chemistries if very difficult. We need batteries that have relatively high capacity, and that don't degrade over time (high number of charge cycles), and that don't blow up easily. Early lithium batteries, while very easier to manufacture, have great capacity and high number of charge cycles, light on fire if they are exposed to water and oxygen. NiCad and LiIon batteries overcome this, but we sort of approach their capacity limits, or we may have already. The easiest solution at this point is just carry around multiple batteries or larger ones. A lot of research is investigating alternative energy storage, like [supercapacitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor), but they can't store nearly as much as current batteries. 

TL/DR; Battery research is much slower than processors, but it is ongoing and we are approaching the upper limit on battery storage.

Fairleee,"It depends on your use case. For many people in the industrialised world, they have constant, reliable access to electricity - so, the main concern is to make sure that your battery is good enough to last a whole day, but you don't really need it to last longer than that, because the assumption is that people will charge every day. Of course, when Sandy hit the USA, this showed just how much our technology relies on constant, reliable access to electricity. Many people were left without electricity for days, and had no way to charge their phones, which were their only means of contact, internet access etc. 

Now, broadly speaking, there are two types of phones: 'smartphones', which typically have internet access, and can run applications, and 'feature phones', which don't tend to have internet access, or apps. Smartphones need a lot more power than feature phones, because what they do is so much more energy-intensive - they are basically handheld computers. As a result, you have to prioritise certain things in favour of others. Sticking in a bigger battery to give it more power would mean having to make the phone bigger and heavier, or sacrificing internal space that is needed for other things in order to get a bigger battery in there. With feature phones, they are using less juice, so can last longer, and battery life is often a major selling point. For example, the [Nokia 1110](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1110) is the best-selling phone in the world, but you've probably never heard of it. It was designed for developing countries, and has a massive market in Africa. They specifically designed it to address common issues found in developing countries, such as a lack of regular access to electricity. As a result, it can go a very, very long time between charges.

So, to summarise, smartphone manufacturers prioritise other things over battery life, because the market for smartphones assumes a constant, reliable source of electricity to charge. That isn't to say they aren't working on improving the battery life of their phones, but 'good enough' is better than 'perfect' from a cost-benefit perspective. Feature phone manufacturers will focus on long battery life, because that is a common demand of the market in which they are sold.",null,44,cdirxst,1r1y49,explainlikeimfive,top_week,221

worthayaw,"I'm late to this but the current top comment is misguided.  It has much less to do with battery research and more to do with what users will buy (or the perception of what they will buy).  We can make phones that have very long of battery life right now (the old nokia bricks had around a month).  The problem is to get that longer battery life you have to sacrifice other things (processing power, screen brightness, etc).  So the question becomes, you can have a battery life that's 5 days, but would you still buy that phone if you knew it was 1/4 the speed of the iphone?  Maybe, maybe not.  The current thought from manufacturers is no.  Now some of you maybe thinking, but if we just get batteries 5 times better then we can have 5 days!  This is also not true because the limiting factor in what we can do with cell phones IS the battery life.  So, one of the guiding design principals is that the phone MUST have ~1 day of life, but doesn't need much more than that.  The minute we make a better battery, manufacturers will put in something like a faster chip, or a brighter screen, and your battery life will remain ~1 day on average.

tldr: we can make phones with more battery life, but cell phone makers think that users choose phones based on other features as long as there is at least 1 day.

Every computational unit, turn, bit flip, or otherwise click of a cog as it were, requires energy.  The problem is, a simple high-school physics interpretation of 'work' is directly translatable in that, the faster or more capable the electronic device, the many more 'clicks' or 'ticks' is happening in a shorter amount of time.

Each tick requires 'x' amount of energy; so in short, something seemingly 'fast', requires more energy than something 'slow'.  Duh right?

The only way to increase battery life in any electronic device, is to reduce how much energy those ticks require.

A headache is pain felt in the head.  It's not pain in the brain as the brain can't feel pain.

It's a huge question since there are many different types of headaches with a lot of causes.

The most common headache, accounting for almost all headaches, is the tension headache.  Its primary causes are things like stress, which has a muscular response in the muscles of the neck and head, putting pressure on the muscles of the neck and head such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position, eye strain, etc.  ",null,2,cdiqqsg,1r1w36,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

* Secondary headaches, which are caused by (secondary to) conditions including trauma, infection, tumor, poisoning, and vascular abnormality.

* Primary headaches, which aren't caused by (aren't secondary to) another condition such as those listed above.

The cause(s) of primary headaches remain(s) unknown. They seem to be caused by the interaction of environmental factors with inherited genetic factors.

The following are my beliefs: all headaches, primary and secondary, whatever their cause, share part of their causal mechanism, namely adenosine, an endogenous (originating within the body) neurochemical. I believe excessive activation of adenosine receptors causes headache pain. I believe anything that causes excessive adenosine receptor activation in the head causes a headache.

All primary headaches are caffeine withdrawal headaches.

Headache hurts in the head because the head is the location of the major sensory apparatus: the retinas (in the eyes), olfactory bulbs (behind the inner ends of the eyebrows), vestibular apparatus and semicircular canals (in the inner ears), lips, dorsal (top) surface of the tongue, and tooth pulp.

Back in the old days, finding stuff on the internet was hard, like really hard, you had to know where you were going. Some people tried to fix this and came up with internet search engines, who would scan the internet for what  you wanted. In the early phases, these were a mix of ""internet yellow pages"" type stuff and rather poor search functions.

Some of these sites might ring a bell: Altavista, Yahoo, Askjeeves, Lycos, infoseek, hotbot, and excite. They were all cluttered, and the searching functions were oddly poor, you could find what you wanted, but you may have to flip through a few pages of the search clicking every link till you find it. That sucked.

Google came out in 1998, and its search function rocked! It actually found what I wanted, what the hell right? It was also super easy to use, just a very simple plain website with a box to type into, that's all, no clutter, nothing, it just worked, and blew the other search engines out of the water.

Overtime, it got much better, more popular and started offering all sorts of other services, while the competitors still sucked at searching, let alone adding other cool features. Word of mouth was out, google was the go to search engine, and the internet was easy for anyone to use.

On a side note, Yahoo is still very important in the internet world, just not for their search function, but for their services and original content, such as yahoo sports, yahoo news/reporting, and their very popular homepage.

From a neurological psych view, I have heard that deja vu is caused by a misfiring of neurons. Essentially, instead of firing once, the neurons rapid-fire off twice, giving you the feeling that you have seen or experienced the event before but really, it's just those milliseconds in between the neurons firing that make you feel that way. 

From a more behavioral standpoint, the idea is that deja vu is caused by your schema of the situation. Schemata work as the backdrop of your knowledge. They are basically the framework for how you organize new information to fit into things you have already experienced. In regards to deja vu, the idea is that when you walk into a new environment that fits into a schema that you already have, you get this feeling of already having experienced it. For example, if you walk into a new restaurant and the tables, chairs, and overall setting of the restaurant is similar to another restaurant you have experienced, it fits right into your schema for a restaurant and you can have a feeling of deja vu because although you haven't experienced this exact restaurant, you have experienced a few that are damn near close.

BassoonHero,"Copying my post from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ehsua/eli5_the_difference_between_western_and_eastern/ca0p8ko):

Music is based on ratios.

The perceived pitch of a note is based on its (principal) frequency. Our perception of the ""distance"" between two notes is determined not by the *difference* of their frequencies, but by the *ratio* of their frequencies.

Suppose that you pluck a string and measure its movement. You will see see a vibration corresponding to a wave the length of the string. The frequency of this vibration is called the **fundamental frequency** of the pitch you hear. But you will also see vibrations corresponding to the string vibrating in halves, and in thirds, and so on. These vibrations will produce sounds with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. These sounds are called **overtones**, or collectively the **overtone series** of the fundamental. They are generally quieter than the fundamental.

Any vibrating object will produce overtones. Your ear and brain will interpret the combined sound of these frequencies as a single sound, rather than flooding your auditory awareness with the whole range of them separately. The **pitch** you perceive will be the loudest frequency (almost always the fundamental), and the relative prevalence of the different overtones (determined by the physical properties of the vibrating object) make the difference between, say, a trumpet and a clarinet playing the same pitch.

If a sound does not seem to have a definite pitch, then the vibrating object producing it is probably vibrating in a more chaotic manner due to its physical properties. Most drums are like this: they produce a whole mess of frequencies, and they are said to be ""unpitched"". Timpani (kettledrums), however, are designed to emphasize a certain frequency, and although they have a ""fuzzy"" drumlike sound, a single fundamental and series of overtones predominates, resulting in a definite pitch.

Bells are another interesting example. When you hear a bell, it often sounds like more than one definite pitch is being produced by the bell. This is because the bell vibrates in a manner that produces more than one fundamental and series of overtones. Your brain combines each overtone series into some fundamental, but it can't combine every overtone you hear into a single fundamental, so you hear more than one pitch. There are some weird applications of this. In Ravel's famous Bolero, he uses flutes and piccolo to simulate the sound of a bell by having them play different pitches to ""manually"" supply the correct fundamentals and overtones.

Anyway, all of this concerns how a single pitch is produced. When we make music, we generally use more than one pitch. But with an infinite number of possible frequencies, how did we decide to use a certain set of pitches? The answer is that some sets of pitches are more harmonious than others.

What does it *mean* for a set of pitches to be harmonious? Well, simply put, it means that their overtone series ""line up"" nicely. Suppose that you have a pitch of frequency N. This pitch consists of a fundamental at N and overtones at 2N, 3N, etc.. Then suppose that you introduce a second pitch at 2N. This pitch will have overtones at 4N, 6N, etc.. The overtones overlap completely! This ratio, 2:1, is the simplest in music, and we call it the **octave**. Notes separated by an octave are so similar-sounding to us that we say that they are in the same **pitch class**. For example, if you start at ""middle C"" on a piano (also called C4) and go an octave up, you will reach another note called ""C"" (C5), and an octave below middle C is called C3. Much of music theory is really concerned with pitch classes like ""C"" rather than pitches like ""C4"".

Given some ""starting"" pitch, we have all sorts of octaves of that pitch, but they sound so similar than we can't really make much music out of them alone. So we move on to the next simplest ratio, 3:1. Now, first, observe that a ratio of 3:1 is the same as a ratio of 3:2 multiplied by 2:1 (the octave). Because we consider pitches separated by an octave to be in the same class, we treat the ratios of 3:1 and 3:2 as describing the same sort of interval. For convenience, we usually talk about the interval in it's 3:2 form. We call this interval the **fifth**, or the perfect fifth in some contexts.

If you have a starting pitch with fundamental frequency N and a second pitch a fifth above it at 1.5N, then the second pitches overtone series will be 3N, 4.5N, etc.. Obviously, there is some overlap between this pitch's overtones and pitch N's overtones (2N, 3N&amp;hellip;). Observe that all of these frequencies are overtones of the pitch .5N, which is one octave below N. The combination of these two pitches (N and 1.5N) is perceived to be harmonious because their common root &amp;ndash; the highest pitch that would contain both their overtone series &amp;ndash; is so close to the notes.

Once you have the octave and the fifth, you can reach all manner of pitches by ""stacking"" intervals. For instance, two fifths will give you a ratio of 9:4, which you can scale up or down with octaves into 9:2, 9:8, or (if you really want) 9:1024. In fact, just having these two intervals to work with lets us get arbitrarily close to any frequency we want, which puts us right back where we started as far as deciding which pitches we're going to use. The way out of this, for Western music, is to observe that twelve fifths gives us the ratio 531441:4096 (about 129.7:1), which is really close to seven octaves (128:1). If we take that 1.5:1 ratio that makes a fifth and shrink it juuust a little bit to ~1.498:1, then twelve fifths makes exactly seven octaves. The infinite ""line"" of pitch classes off to either side of your starting note becomes a circle (the **circle of fifths**), where you hit eleven more pitch classes before returning where you started. These are the twelve pitch classes of Western music, called the **chromatic collection**. All you need to fully define a chromatic collection is to pick a starting frequency and go in fifths from there. Nowadays, we usually say that 440 Hz is a pitch called ""A4"".

(Note that the actual historical process of transitioning from the pure 3:2 ratio to this easier-to-manage system was a lot messier than described here. They tried to solve the problem by saying that most fifths are perfectly 3:2, but others are not quite. All sorts of interesting compromise approaches were proposed before the modern standard of ""equal temperament"" won out.)

In the chromatic collection, just as there are twelve pitch classes, there are twelve possible intervals between pitch classes (up to an octave). By restricting the set of pitches, you also restrict the set of intervals. The smallest interval is called the **semitone** or **minor second**. Its ratio is ~1.059:1, and all other intervals' ratios are multiple of this ratio. The interval of two semitones (~1.122:1) is called a **whole tone** or **major second**.

When you take some collection of pitch classes (such as the chromatic collection) and ""squeeze"" it into the space of one octave, you call the resultant sequence of notes a **scale**. A scale is defined by the pitches in it and by the starting note, or **root**.

As you may know, a traditional Western musical scale has seven pitch classes in it, not twelve. A set of seven notes as used in a major scale or natural minor scale is called a **diatonic collection**. (A major scale can be turned intoa natural minor scale, or vice versa, by picking a different pitch from the collection to be root.) You get a diatonic collection by picking a starting pitch class and repeatedly taking fifths, but whereas in the chromatic collection you keep going until you reach your starting point again, in the diatonic collection you stop when you have seven notes. Why seven? The resultant scale will have a property called ""maximal evenness"": for any number of steps between notes on the scale, there are at most two different intervals that you could form by taking that number of steps. For instance, the interval between two notes one step apart could only be a semitone or whole tone (a minor second or major second), and the interval between two notes four steps apart could only be a perfect fifth (seven semitones) or a ""diminished fifth"" (six semitones). (The apparent off-by-one error between the number of steps and the name of the interval is historical: if you go up four steps, then you have looked at five notes counting your starting point.)

There is exactly one other sort of scale made of fifths with the maximal evenness property. If you take five notes instead of seven, then you end up with the **pentatonic collection**. You cannot form intervals of a semitone or a ""tritone"" (seven semitones, also called an augmented fourth or diminished fifth) with the notes in this collection, so it is, in a sense, incomplete. The interval between ""adjacent"" notes in a pentatonic scale is either a whole tone or a ""minor third"" (three semitones). The essential quality of this scale is that the intervals excluded (the semitone and tritone) are the most dissonant intervals. For this reason, it is easy to write music using a pentatonic collection that is pleasant, and difficult to write music that is discordant. Of course, when you're actually writing music, you can use ""extra"" pitch classes if you like; a scale is not a straightjacket"".

You can look at a pentatonic scale as a diatonic scale with two pitch classes ""missing"". You can also look at it the other way. Adding different notes to a pentatonic scale may give you interesting effects. For instance, if you add a certain note to a pentatonic scale, you get a blues scale.",null,1,cdink1n,1r1h7t,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

Almost all melodies (or instrumental solos) are based off the specific scale that matches the key the song is in. If the background instruments are playing a progression or riff in the key of C, the melody could be any sort of pattern of the notes contained in the C scale: CDEFGABC. For example, the Star Wars melody in the key of C is ""C, G, F-E-D, C, G, F-E-D, C, G, F-E-F-D."" All of those notes are part of the C major scale.

Th4ab,"Oils are not generally water soluble. Oils would be left on the skin after washing with just water, which would contribute to body odor and mangy hair. You would be cleaner than you went in, but soap is important. ",null,4,cdimh9x,1r1ex9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10
Fairleee,"Our modern obsession with cleaning our bodies on a daily basis is still relatively new - you can get away without washing your body without too many ill effects, depending on your lifestyle - yes, you will get smellier, and dirtier hair and skin. However, most of the bacteria and yeast that lives on the human skin is not harmful on the skin; it is only if it enters your bloodstream that it would be a problem (so if you got a cut, or if you scratched yourself and broke the skin, you stand a greater risk of infection). And, of course, failure to wash your hands can be a major source of spreading pathogens and contamination, so there's that.

There was a documentary a few years ago where a woman went without showering for six weeks, to investigate the effects. Bacterial swabs were taken before and after the six week period by researchers at the university of Leeds. What they found was that, although by the end of the six weeks the 'hotspots' for bacterial action (groin, armpits etc.) contained 5,000 times more bacteria than at the start, this was still within the 'normal' parameters for a human. Unfortunately, the only source I can find for it is a [Daily Mail article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-477378/Six-weeks-wash-The-soapless-experiment.html), and it is important to remember this is a sample size of one. Also, part of her inspiration behind doing it was based on a misunderstanding of cause-and-effect; wondering if chemicals in grooming products (sales of which have been increasing year-on-year) caused increases in cancer (incidents of which also increased year-on-year). However, if you ignore the unfounded hypotheses, and just focus on the cleanliness issue, it is quite interesting. She found that she didn't smell that bad, and although her hair looked very greasy, she thought her skin looked better.

So, it all depends what you mean by 'clean'. Do you mean less smelly? In which case, yes, you can clean your body reasonably well with just water, and scrubbing - particularly if you use some sort of exfoliating agent (exfoliation is basically using something to remove the uppermost layers of dead skin and the various buildups - if you were just to use water, you would use a mechanical exfoliator, such as a coarse sponge). That will take care of a lot of the breeding ground that bacteria can use, and, as long as you wash like this on a regular basis, you probably won't get that smelly. Whilst soap does wash away the oils that can contain bacteria (so potentially making you 'cleaner'), it is important to remember that our skin needs that oil, and getting rid of it on a regular basis can cause our skin to dry out.

I am unaware of any studies that compare the bacteria on the human skin after washing with water, compared to washing with water and soap. However, as stated above, most of the bacteria on the human skin will not do you any harm as long as it doesn't get into the blood stream. So, as long as you do wash your hands with soap, and disinfect any wounds as and when they occur, you could easily get away with not using soap on your body when you wash.

Secondary, there are politics involved. For a multitude of reasons, dentistry and medicine developed as parallel fields. As such, dentistry is treated as a separate and unique entity from medicine, with its own regulation bodies and schooling.

A (contentious) argument might be made that these aren't quite as ""medically necessary"" - many people can get by without dental checkups and fillings for years with no ill-effects, whereas cancer treatment or management of heart failure has an immediate and recognizable impact on your health. The cardiac risk arising from poor dental health is itself a controversial topic.

garrettj100,"What you're really asking is why dental and optical insurance aren't covered under the rubric of ""health insurance"".  I think the reason is actually a little complicated, but it boils down to ""actuarial tables"".

Think about it a sec and you'll realize the odds of any particular person availing themselves of each insurance is wildly disparate:

* Optical depends entirely on what kind of eyesight you have.  People with 20/20 never make a claim.

* Dental depends to a large degree on how religiously someone brushes their teeth.  Brush and floss 7 times a day?  You'll never need to visit the dentist.

* Medical depends a great deal on the person's age, weight, and smoking.  Fatties have more issues.  So do smokers.

Because there are three different ways of calculation the odds of an individual availing themselves if the insurance, (and thus, the actuarial tables for calculating premiums) the policies are kept separate.  A fat guy with hypertension and diabetes could easily brush his teeth after every meal and before and after bed like he should.

Insurance companies live and die by actuarial tables.  It's more straightforward for them to calculate the premiums for three policies based upon the expected claims of the different health issues.

You get health insurance because you don't know when you're going to get sick (cold/flu/bronchitis) or injured. The 'uncertain loss' in this case is an unforeseeable health condition. Insurance companies can make money from this because how often do people get sick and what are the chances someone is going to get hit by a car or something random like that. However, for the most part, dentistry is not insurable because most cavities and gum disease is are chronic, progressive, predictable, and preventable. How will insurance companies make money from diseases that can be easily diagnosed and prevented? That's why payout is better for preventive procedures and not major work for dentistry. I wouldn't even call dental insurance 'dental insurance'. It's more like a maintenance plan or 'dental benefits'. I assume the same goes for optometry. The condition of your eyes getting more nearsighted or farsighted is progressive and if we take out genetics, I'm assuming preventable (don't stare at the computer so long or watch tv up close, etc).

At the rate of technological advancement the human race is currently progressing at, it is safe to assume one day we will have the technological ability to simulate a universe (on a computer/server etc).

Jazzeater,"One of Kant's main concerns was with human beings as rational agent. His view was that as rational agents, humans should only perform acts which; make no person (including yourself) a means to an end, but instead treats every person as an **end in themselves**. 

I bolded the last few words because I imagine this wording is confusing to any person who has not studied philosophy. In simple terms a person being treated as an end in themselves suggests a state where each persons well-being is treated as an ultimate goal, or end. 

Now to perform actions which treat yourself, as well as any other agent as an end, and never a means, might be a hard task. How would one choose one's actions so as they conform to that ideal. This is where Kant's famous categorical imperative comes from. The categorical imperative states (in my words not Kant's): In choosing any action, a person must ask themselves that given sufficiently similar circumstances **would they wish their maxim become universal law**. By maxim, Kant is referring to your actions and your reasons for doing them. If you should choose a maxim, you should wish that any person confronted with the same situation would act similarly. Living in this way is in accordance with proper rationality. 

In Kant's kingdom of ends, all moral agents (aka people) would act in accordance with the categorical imperative. In doing so they would treat themselves, and all agents, as ends in themselves.",null,0,cdik8y1,1r1add,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

Triddy,"I'll build this up in stages. If you're used to computer networks, feel free to skip ahead a bit.

**What is a Computer Network?**

A computer network is simply an infrastructure that allows two or more computers to communicate data. This is done using a physical medium, usually a cable but also various wireless technologies. Computer A takes the data it wants to send, puts it out on the physical medium. The data travels along the medium until it hit's Computer B.

A simplified analogy would be a highway system connecting cities. A person (data) who wants to travel to a neighbouring city, perhaps to go to work, takes their car out on the highway (cable) and drives to the next city. They could also, say, take a plane (wireless), but at an additional cost in exchange for some convenience.

Of course, computers can't just spew 1's and 0's at each other. Perhaps the sender wants to send a song, and the receiver, not knowing this, decides to interpret it as an image, or a text file, or something crazy. Without communicating what it is, communication is impossible.

**What is the internet?**

The internet is simply a very (*very*) large computer network. Fundamentally, it's no different from connecting two computers at your home. Computers on the internet use an agreed upon set of *protocols* that describe how the data is supposed to be sent and received. It is these protocols that define the internet as something different. In the end, though, your computer is still sending data along some medium to another computer, no different than any network.

**So, what does an ISP do?**

An ISP is responsible for making these connections. Without looking anything up here, let's say Reddit is hosted in Austin Texas. I live in Vancouver, Canada. If I want to exchange data with Reddit, I'd have to (theoretically) run a cable from Vancouver to Texas. This isn't going to happen.

What can happen, and does, is that I run a cable to my local Internet Service Provider. I send data to it, addressed to Reddit. The ISP recieves it, sees it's addressed to Texas. But the ISP doesn't run a cable to Texas either. It does, however, run a cable to a larger, *Tier 1* ISP responsible for my part of the country. So my data is then sent along to that. Again, this T1 ISP doesn't have a cable to Texas, but it does have a cable to the T1 ISP responsible for the Southern US. So it sends the data along to that.

Now we're getting somewhere! This ISP will then send my data along to a smaller, local ISP in the Austin area. And here, finally, the ISP will have a cable directly to Reddit! What's on the other end? Why, it's just a computer, like the one I sent the request from. Sure it's more powerful, and it's probably running special programs, but it's still a computer.

**To sum it all up?**

The internet is a very large series of connections between computers. The ISP is analogous to say, the postal service. It makes sure your data gets to the proper destination. In that effect, the ISPs don't connect you to ""the internet"". Rather they *are* the internet.",null,1,cdimgg3,1r199g,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8

cos,"Your computer has a PROM - a ""programmable read only memory"" - which is similar to regular computer memory except that the stuff in it is hardcoded.  It was put there in the past and it doesn't go away when you turn off your computer, and your computer never stores new stuff there.  (Technically this isn't entirely true, since what your computer may actually have is EEPROM which can be rewritten if an update is needed, but you can ignore that for now).

In that PROM are a few programs that were written to be run when you first turn the computer on.  When you turn the computer on, its processor starts running code from a specific memory location, and the designers of the computer knew which memory location that was so they put the PROM right there.  Your computer turns on, and the processor starts running instructions from the PROM.

Usually the first thing run is some sort of POST - a *Power On Self Test* that checks out a bunch of things and makes sure the computer isn't badly malfunctioning.  If the POST fails it knows how to display some text on your screen to tell you what's wrong, and it may stop right there and do nothing more.

What runs after the POST varies a lot.  It may be some sort of very very simple operating system, often called a ""boot monitor"" or ""power monitor"" or something like that.  Or it may be a ""boot loader"".  Even if your computer does start running a ""monitor"" (super-simple OS), chances are that monitor program is configured to try a boot loader first, though it may give you a chance to hit a key in the first few seconds to make it do something else.

Anyway, usually one way or another, a program called a boot loader runs.  It's a program that looks at the very beginning of whatever device your computer is set to boot from - usually a hard drive, but maybe a CD/DVD drive or perhaps a network interface.  Let's assume it's a hard drive.  It knows to look at a specific place at the logical beginning of a hard drive, read whatever is there into regular memory, and then start running whatever it just put in memory.

So, on your hard drive there's an area with a name like ""boot sector"" that has a program that will be loaded and run when your computer boots up.  And this is the program that, in most cases, knows where on the disk to look for your operating system.  Windows, OS X, whatever - this program finds it on your disk, and loads that into memory, and then jumps over to that part of memory, to start your operating system running.

From this point it gets even more varied, depending on what kind of operating system you have.  Each operating system has a bunch of stuff it's been programmed to do when it first starts up.  Some of these things include:

 - Set up device drivers - pieces of computer code stored on your disk that the OS knows how to find, that include all of the logic for interacting with various devices and interfaces like USB, Thunderbolt, your graphics card, etc.

 - Begin managing memory protection and CPU multitasking, and start assigning time slices to other processes.

 - Run through a series of startup scripts that have been supplied by the user - often the company who packaged the OS for you, but maybe some were added by you, and plenty were probably added by programs you installed that want to do something at startup or start themselves running.

 - Bring up a display &amp; window manager program, and start it with a few things, like maybe a menu, and a user login window.",null,0,cdijsjs,1r18yj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,19

Koooooj,"The things that a tabloid like the ones you mentioned would be sued for are libel and slander.  It's important to understand the circumstances under which an act can be considered libel or slander.

In general, the difference between libel and slander is that libel is committed in written form (and thus the one that a magazine would worry about), while slander it typically verbal.  In order for either of these to be a legal burden for the magazine (i.e. in order for a story to be grounds for a lawsuit) the offended person has to demonstrate that they suffered some harm from a *false* statement that wasn't an opinion.

Thus, they can get around a lot of cases by wording it carefully--""Is [insert female celebrity here] pregnant?  Check out the pictures on page 8!""  If they had stated ""[celebrity] is pregnant and we have the pictures to prove it!"" then there could be a budding case for libel, but it gets more complicated from there.

Someone suing for libel has to demonstrate that they have been harmed by the defamation.  For example, if you ran an advertisement that says ""Joe's deli has a rat infestation"" when, in fact, there is no such infestation then Joe can sue you for having hurt their reputation and reduced their sales.  For a lot of the stories that a tabloid will run it is much more difficult to demonstrate that there was damage done--how much am I actually personally injured if a tabloid suggests that I've put on a few pounds?  Not helping your case is the fact that people are expected to realize that tabloids should be taken with a grain of salt--everyone knows that they're full of crap, so if they publish something against you then people shouldn't be expected to *actually* act based on that article.

The final thing that really helps the tabloids out, though, is that the courts have pretty much decided that celebrities should expect a much larger amount of public scrutiny so they can only expect to win libel or slander cases in really clear-cut cases.  In essence, the courts give tabloids free reign to pick on celebrities (alas--the troubles of being famous).  They can't say whatever they want and I'm sure they face lawsuits because of it, but they can get away with more than you'd think. ",null,2,cdikw0u,1r17c2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

whatIsThisBullCrap,"Cavalry rarely got into fights with infantrymen as seen in movies. 

Normally, they just charge, and one of these two things happens

1) the troops break formation. This is what usually happened, because no matter how trained you are and no matter what advantage you have (ie polearms), a 1 ton beast is running at you at full speed, and that is fucking terrifying. After the enemy scatters, the Cavalry can then chase the soldiers off and cut them down, or footsoldiers take advantage of the gap and March through enemy lines

2) the enemy doesn't scatter, so the Cavalry does. If you have a very disciplined army, they will stand ground. Being able to face a horse and stay collected is no easy feat, so this was rare, and armies that were disciplined enough were tough to beat in battle. So if the enemy doesn't scatter, the Cavalry will have to. They're likely charging at pikemen, which means if they continue charging, they will run straight into an iron point. So, even if the rider wants to keep charging, chances are the horse will turn at the last moment (they're not stupid, they know running into a blade is bad), sending them topping into the enemy formation. 

Sometimes, but rarely, you do get Cavalry mixed in with footsoldiers. This usually happens when a charge scatters a formation, but they don't retreat in time, allowing the soldiers to regroup and surround them. In this case, the fighting would be too close and chaotic to accurately hit a leg, but soldiers did aim for legs and horses , and armies often carried special hooks that would bring a horse down ",null,3,cdij6a4,1r16xv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10

I never would have asked a woman to marry me who was not confident, couldn't think for herself, or make her own decisions in spite of social norms. 


But that's just it. It is sad and dissapointing that this is still an unpopular decision. That people don't consider it before they make assumptions. That people make a check out to her with my last name. Do you know how awkward and sometimes difficult to get a check cashed with a last name totally different than your own? We have had to bring our fucking marriage certificate to the damn bank. Ridiculous.


It is my opinion that men who demand a woman take his last name are insecure at best.

**Calories:** They can determine the absolute caloric value of a food item by [putting it into a sealed container, submerging that container into water, and then using electricity to burn the food and see how much it heats the water](http://www.chem.ufl.edu/~itl/2045/matter/FG05_016.GIF). However, that includes the calorie content of indigestible parts of the food that our bodies can't use for energy (like fiber), so now they just take the recipe, [look up the individual ingredients on standard reference tables for common ingredients, and estimate the calories](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-do-food-manufacturers). The reference tables and methodology used to add to those tables [were the products of experiments conducted by Wilbur Atwater at Wesleyan University in the late 1800s-early 1900s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwater_system).

**Fat:** The fat content of foods is measured by [using a solvent that pulls the fat out of a food, and then measuring the results](http://web2.slc.qc.ca/jmc/www/Chemweb/oldchemweb/extractionmethods.htm). If you use [this lab
](http://www.eurofinsus.com/services/Lipids_Oils_Fat%20Quality.html) they'll do it with a mix of ether and chloroform.

**Protein:** You can't directly measure protein, but [you can figure out how much protein is in a food sample by finding out how much nitrogen is in it](http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5022e/y5022e03.htm). The amount of nitrogen in a sample is measured by [melting the sample in sulfuric acid, which releases the nitrogen as a chemical called ammonium sulfate, then doing some other stuff to turn the ammonium sulfate into ammonia, and then extracting and measuring the ammonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjeldahl_method). If we know how much ammonia the original sample has made, we can figure out how much nitrogen it had, and then with a little math figure out how much protein the original sample had.

**Carbs:** The FDA allows the food companies to measure carbs by first measuring the protein and fat content of the the product as above, as well as measuring the water and ash content of the food sample with other methods. [Add the weight of all those together, subtract your result from the total weight of the food sample, and what you're left with the your carb content](http://books.google.com/books?id=yYeoaeh2XNkC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551&amp;dq=%286%29+%22Carbohydrate,+total%22+or+%22Total+carbohydrate%22:+A+statement+of+the+number+of+grams+of+total+carbohydrate+in+a+serving+expressed+to+the+nearest+gram,+except+that+if+a+serving+contains+less+than+1+gram,+the+statement+%22Contains+less+than+1+gram%22+or+%22less+than+1+gram%22+may+be+used+as+an+alternative,+or+if+the+serving+contains+less+than+0.5+gram,+the+content+may+be+expressed+as+zero.+Total+carbohydrate+content+shall+be+calculated+by+subtraction+of+the+sum+of+the+crude+protein,+total+fat,+moisture,+and+ash+from+the+total+weight+of+the+food.+This+calculation+method+is+described+in+A.+L.+Merrill+and+B.+K.+Watt,+%22Energy+Value+of+Foods--Basis+and+Derivation,%22+USDA+Handbook+74+%28slightly+revised+1973%29+pp.+2+and+3,+which+is+incorporated+by+reference+in+accordance+with+5+U.S.C.+552%28a%29+and+1+CFR+part+51+%28the+availability+of+this+incorporation+by+reference+is+given+in+paragraph+%28c%29%281%29%28i%29%28A%29+of+this+section%29.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pObxTa6H_I&amp;sig=b54p4xBFQ6Q7PaRUQDdiFdaTDf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DVCMUtWHD8PUiwLFyYGoAQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%286%29%20%22Carbohydrate%2C%20total%22%20or%20%22Total%20carbohydrate%22%3A%20A%20statement%20of%20the%20number%20of%20grams%20of%20total%20carbohydrate%20in%20a%20serving%20expressed%20to%20the%20nearest%20gram%2C%20except%20that%20if%20a%20serving%20contains%20less%20than%201%20gram%2C%20the%20statement%20%22Contains%20less%20than%201%20gram%22%20or%20%22less%20than%201%20gram%22%20may%20be%20used%20as%20an%20alternative%2C%20or%20if%20the%20serving%20contains%20less%20than%200.5%20gram%2C%20the%20content%20may%20be%20expressed%20as%20zero.%20Total%20carbohydrate%20content%20shall%20be%20calculated%20by%20subtraction%20of%20the%20sum%20of%20the%20crude%20protein%2C%20total%20fat%2C%20moisture%2C%20and%20ash%20from%20the%20total%20weight%20of%20the%20food.%20This%20calculation%20method%20is%20described%20in%20A.%20L.%20Merrill%20and%20B.%20K.%20Watt%2C%20%22Energy%20Value%20of%20Foods--Basis%20and%20Derivation%2C%22%20USDA%20Handbook%2074%20%28slightly%20revised%201973%29%20pp.%202%20and%203%2C%20which%20is%20incorporated%20by%20reference%20in%20accordance%20with%205%20U.S.C.%20552%28a%29%20and%201%20CFR%20part%2051%20%28the%20availability%20of%20this%20incorporation%20by%20reference%20is%20given%20in%20paragraph%20%28c%29%281%29%28i%29%28A%29%20of%20this%20section%29.&amp;f=false).

**TL;DR: They can burn the food to determine calories, but they mostly estimate calories based on the ingredients. For fat, they use a solvent to wash the fat out and measure it.

TruthJunky,"In practice, very little of the food on the market is calorically measured using a calorimeter of the sort being described by others. Very few companies have the means (or the inclination!) to measure their food in this way.

Instead, most food companies determine the caloric content of their products by using pre-existing databases of caloric information for base ingredients. So, in short, they'll take the ingredient quantities for a product (e.g., one tablespoon of oil, one teaspoon of sugar, one tablespoon of ketchup...) and refer to the standardly recognized caloric values for these items (e.g., 120 calories, 15 calories, 20 calories, respectively...) and add it all up.

If you've taken a high school chemistry class, you may have learnt something about ""[Calorimetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimetry)"". 

Taking it a step back, a Calorie you'd see on food is most likely a kCal (1000 calories). What is a calorie? The pure definition is ""the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius."" This also equals out to 4.184J of energy.

The OLD method was (as explained below,) to literally burn the object in what is called a ""bomb calorimeter"" and calculate using things like molar enthalpy and heat capacity to figure out how much energy it produced. 

The new method called the [Atwater System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwater_system) is a little more ""clean"". Simply put, they place the averages of things such as fats/proteins and carbs in certain foods as having X amount of energy per gram (E.g. fat found in cow's milk is assumed to be 9.19kCal/g) .They calculate how many of these are in a product (god knows how) and get the final result.

In the atmosphere, the force in question is the gravitational force due to the mass of the air being pulled toward the center of Earth. The higher up you go in the atmosphere, the less mass is above you and therefore, pressure decreases with height. 

Because of the laws of thermodynamics, in this situation, this decrease in pressure will result in an increase in volume. However, energy (work) must be used to expand this mass of air. Unless heat is being added to the system, the energy MUST come from somewhere. Therefore, the internal energy of the gas partly goes into expanding its volume.

tracingspirals,"Here's how one of the conspiracy theory lore goes:

During the crusades the Knights Templars were a special order that was created to protect the Temple of Solomon/Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. When stationed in Jerusalem they started exploring the temple area. It is during these explorations it is said they found something that made them an incredibly powerful order. Some say they found the ""holy grail"" whatever that may be, other's say they found lost ancient scrolls teaching dark magic (as these arts were said to be widespread around King Solomon's time) and using the help of spirits and demons they managed to gain big influence in European society. 

They soon became very wealthy and powerful (mostly because of banking) and the European kings owed them a lot of debt. Instead of paying off the debts the kings decided it was better to persecute them charging them of heresy and many other things such as witchcraft, satanism, homosexuality etc. So began a period where the Templars were actively persecuted. 

Here begins the second part of the lore. After being persecuted the Templars were forced to go underground. They ended up forming many secret societies around Europe. In Scotland they emerged as the Freemasons. Using the knowledge of the Templars they gained power and influence in European and later American society quickly (again it's mostly through banking). They orchestrated many wars and revolutions throughout history to drive the kingdoms into their debt and so their influence and control. The Illuminati are said to be the Templars who didn't emerge publicly and remained as an underground secret society. They called themselves Illuminati because they're ""illuminated"" by the knowledge of the Templars (or they were illuminated by knowledge of science). Many Renaissance and Enlightenment era scientists and philosophers are said to have been members of the illuminati. 

So why are they considered bad? Well conspiracy theorists suggest these secret societies are who really control the political and social structures of large parts of the world. They're the shadow government who ""run the show"" while the Presidents and Prime Ministers only are there to give the people an illusion of democracy. They own most of the large banking and financial institutions in the world and use the influence of debt to control societies and economies. They have a particular philosophy and view as to how the world and society needs to be and they use their influence in governments and the media to shape the world accordingly.

Illumiknot,"I apologize for the length and detail, but this is a complex question and I think the massive amount of misinformation about the Illuminati merits some depth. I'll deal with the first part of the question in this comment, and answer what the big deal surrounding them is in the reply, which is where I'll be posting my sources.

Yes, there was a real order of Illuminati. It was active in several Holy Roman Empire states from 1776 until ... well, we're not sure. The 1785 date given by the Wikipedia article doesn't take into account that the ""bavarian"" Illuminati had a large following outside of Bavaria (primarily in what is now northern germany) and support of two local rulers in the Ernestine Duchies (which are a bit north of Bavaria). All that happened in 1785 was a series of arrests and defections in Bavaria, followed by a change in leadership and base of operations. Adam Weishaupt, the founder, settled down in Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, while Johan Joachim Christoph Bode became the new head of the order, and made Weimar the new base. The focus of the order shifted to north Germany and there were some short-lived attempts to set up colonies in, among other places, Denmark and Italy. The last reports and protocols from other Illuminati groups were sent to Bode in early 1788, which suggests that the order dissolved that year. However, some historians want to push the date further into the 1790s for unclear reasons (most of the good Illuminati research is german, which I unfortunately don't speak). According to this line of thinking, Bode was replaced by Karl Leonard Reinhold after his death in 1793 and the Illuminati dissolved quietly some time after this.

So, what was the Illuminati? This is a difficult question to answer because the Illuminati was never an order in the way most people seem to think it was. It started out as a student league within the University of Ingolstadt, its main goal was to defend the reading of Enlightenment literature there. Adam Weishaupt is attributed as the founder, but the idea originally came from one of his students, Anton von Massenhausen. There was an epic conflict in the university between a pro-Enlightenment faction, led by Weishaupt's godfather Freiherr von Ickstatt (who had a big influence on staffing decisions), and a conservative Jesuit group. Weishaupt, already a professor of law, was given the traditionally jesuit chair of canon-law in 1775, leading to protests from the jesuit staff. He took Massenhausen's suggestion seriously, especially since the jesuits had managed to suspend his salary, found a few other like-minded students, and got together with them on May 1, 1776 to formally bring the Perfectibilisten into existence. It was renamed Illuminatenorden shortly after. Members were sworn to secrecy, wrote letters to each other in code, and used codenames for members and places taken from classical antiquity.

The order had no real rituals, formal degrees or structure, or even clear goals besides defending Enlightenment literature. Universities were more exclusive during this period, and as the Illuminati slowly expanded it began to attract some mildly influential members. Following an internal dispute, the council of areopagites was created in 1779 to divert power away from the despotic Weishaupt and provide some direction for the order. What the areopagites came to was that the Illuminati should also have an inner goal for its members, namely moral and intellectual development. This was to be achieved by constant analysis, both by the initiate and his superiors. Members had to write autobiographical reports (pensum) and send in regular confessionals (quibus licet), their superiors had to observe them constantly and find weaknesses that could be used to indoctrinate them. Despite these high-minded goals of nurturing man's perfectibilité, the early order was often plagued by a lack of focus and unprofessionalism. This is from a letter written by Weishaupt, which I assume is from 1779 or '80:

&gt;Socrates, who is a capital man, is always drunk. Augustus has a most terrible reputation, and Alcibiades sits with his serving wench all day and sighs and suffers. Tiberius sought to violate Diomedes' sister in Corinth (Imperial City of Regensburg), and the man accomplished this. For heaven's sake, what areopagites are these!

Evil world-dominating society indeed! Diomedes, whose real name was Marquis di Costanzo, was sent to northern germany on a recruitment drive in 1780. In order to sell the Illuminati, Costanzo presented it as a powerful society that had been behind the spread of French Enlightenment literature throughout most of the Holy Roman Empire. In Frankfurt-am-Main, he ran into Freiherr Adolph von Knigge, an influential member of the lower nobility and an established member of the Rite of Strict Observance (quasimasonic society based on templar myths, disbanded in 1782). Knigge was excited to work with such a prestigious group, recruiting an enormous number of people very quickly. He then wrote to his superiors for instructions, but received a letter from Weishaupt instead, who admitted that the whole thing was a sham and that most of the degrees and rituals only existed in his head. Weishaupt begged for Knigge to stay and gave him the green light to write ritual instructions and expand the vague degree system into something more concrete. Through some brilliant work at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, which was convened in 1782 to discuss the future of the Rite of Strict of Observance, Knigge was able to expand the order's size exponentially. In 1780, the order had about 50 members; it had reportedly 2,000 during its height (1,500 of which have been confirmed by historians). All thanks to Knigge.

The Illuminati was pro-Enlightenment, but was otherwise a mishmash of a diverse array of people and beliefs. While the order did have political ambitions, these have been grossly misrepresented. There was never any plan to destroy the current system or institute a one world government. What Knigge and Weishaupt both wanted was to change the political system gradually and from within. The end goal, which they knew would take generations, was a society filled with rational citizens, where external government would no longer be required. However, this was as much as Knigge and Weishaupt could agree on. Knigge's rituals were too mystical for Weishaupt, and there was a major conflict when Weishaupt went ahead and edited some of the ritual instructions to satisfy the grumblings of a rationalist faction at the University of Götingen. Knigge, Weishaupt, and the areopagites had all come to the agreement that no one would edit the ritual instructions once they were sent out to other lodges, so Weishaupt going against this was a huge thing. Knigge left in 1784.

The Illuminati's political meddling was what lead to its downfall. To simplify a convoluted story: The Prince-Elector of Bavaria did not want to be prince-elector of Bavaria and had tried to trade the land to Emperor Joseph II in 1776. King Frederick II (the Great) of Prussia did not approve, so he started and won a war against the emperor (the war of Bavarian succession). However, Joseph II made another attempt to get Bavaria in 1785. Some Illuminati wanted to use their new found political power to support the emperor, others did not. Those who wanted Bavaria to not become part of the imperial territories deserted and ratted out the Illuminati to the Prince-Elector, which led to the arrests and an edict banning the society in 1785, followed by a second edict in 1787 instituting capital punishment for Illuminati recruitment in Bavaria (to my knowledge, no one was executed).",null,0,cdj718r,1r0zwu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

So what is illuminati? it's actually a lot of things that will take hours to explain but the bottom line for me is:
Capitalism will fail and is meant to fail, the system we live in is rigged and based on greed. It is made so the rich become richer and the poor become even more poor. America and Israël together with the United Kingdom and families like the Rothchilds control the most important parts of our every day life.

The world governments and corperations are a pyramid scheme where the people at the top control everything at the bottom of the pyramid. crazy right? i couldn't believe it too when i first heard of it.

wreckeditralph,"To truly understand what is so impressive, you need to understand how sine wave works. You see all electricity follows a [sine wave](http://www.doctronics.co.uk/images/sig_03.gif).  In this example, we will be talking about FREQUENCY specifically. The definition of frequency is as follows: ""the rate at which something occurs or is repeated over a particular period of time or in a given sample."" So in our sine wave, we measure frequency by measuring how many of those peaks will pass in any given second.

Back in the day, RAM used a standard called SDRAM or Single Data Rate RAM.  This meant that RAM could only operate on the peak of each sine wave. With the introduction of DDR or Dual Data Rate RAM, the RAM can now operate at both the peak AND the valley of the sine wave.  This immediately doubles the speed of RAM. Now as we are moving forward with the DDR standard, we are able to turn the frequency higher.  This means that more peaks and valleys of a sine wave are passing every second, which means that more operations per second can be performed.  
  
Now something to keep in mind, as you increase frequency, you typically increase heat generated. Heat is the natural enemy of computers, as it greatly interferes with operation. So to go faster usually means more heat, which means that there would be an upper limit to how fast we can go.  Basically we would only be able to go at a speed where we can still effectively cool. However with the newer DDR standards we are actually able to reduce the amount of power required to run the RAM, which greatly reduces the amount of heat that is put off. This means we can go at faster and faster speeds without having to come up with a way to cool more and more effectively.",null,0,cdis9mt,1r0xsu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

The reason that Earth still has an atmosphere is that Earth has a very active core, which (because it is metal and spinning) generates a magnetic field.  This field deflects much of the solar wind that would otherwise strip away the upper layer of the atmosphere.  Combine that with our higher gravity (Earth's mass helps keep the atmosphere intact), and we are very lucky ducks indeed.

Mars is smaller, and its core has in large part solidified.  The remaining atmosphere on Mars is about as thick as it's ever going to get or will be again.

This building would theoretically be used to ""ring"" the ionosphere like a bell. The issue is that it used the same wavelengths as the alpha brain waves. or close enough at a range of about 7.5 to 7.9 Hz when the alpha waves are in a frequency range of 8–13 Hz. The manipulation of these frequencies in the lower ionosphere  is known to be highly disorientating and has the potential to cause many other problems.  2ndThe amount of energy that a system such as this would need to reconstruct a new ionosphere on mars on top of the extremely weak ionosphere that mars currently has is excessive. but luckily the difference in size between mars and earth may be great enough to change the base frequency range that would be used. ( this is only speculation though )  3rd gravity differences and reproduction in earth lifeforms need to be studied in fare more depth. our bodies are ""programmed "" to grow at a specific rate against a specific amount of gravity. The surface gravity of Mars is 38% that of Earth. Although microgravity is known to cause health problems such as muscle loss and bone demineralization, it is not known if Martian gravity would have a similar effect. there are also the issue of excessive growth and the human body. thanks to growth spurts the human body may not be capable of surviving past puberty.  So how do we address these problems? we need to properly test the effects of these specific wavelengths on the human and animal brain before the design is even attempted on a global earth or martian scale. there are many people that are willing to take a one way trip to mars for the chance to do these research projects. They know that they will die of radiation poisoning and other issues in a few years and they don't care. so let them do it for science. 90% of the cost of a mission to mars in in the return trip, and securing he astronauts from long term radiation poisoning. If that is no longer an issue then a research trip becomes a viable option. the Second is the power consumption issue. The sun's vast magnetic field is a truly untapped resource. Here is the basic concept for powering a martian colony and the the electromagnetic shield of the planet. start with a moon base and utilize a space elevator on the moon. thanks to the extremely low gravity of the moon Kevlar rope is strong enough to do the job without snapping. Begin mining the moon for rare earth resources and at the same time build man made asteroids out of the rock that is unused. these artificial asteroids can be used as the radiation shielding for near sun radiant energy collectors. Forget about solar panels we can directly harness the electromagnetic field of the sun. at close enough range to the sun the fluctuations in the field could be harnessed at extraordinary levels. This could produce many thousands of times the total global electric consumption of earth. thanks to the rare earth materials of the moon we would also have most of the material that is needed to construct radiant energy collectors that can handle the power levels involved in a project like this. the next step is simple. just transmit the energy collected to mars over focused microwave radiation beams. Did i mention that all of this is mostly proven technology? The only issues are applying it at this massive scale. Robotics can handle a bulk of the work if the energy source is the first issue addressed. another consideration is the difference in mineral levels and chemical compositions of mars. this is all based on the presumed safety of long term exposure to the electromagnetic wavelengths produced by Wardenclyffe Tower.

prjindigo,"The law of thermodynamics says no.

Mars needs about a 90% increase in mass to be able to maintain a ""human habitable"" temperature range with liquid water in areas that could grow plants.   Add to that problem the fact that at Mars's distance, the sun is exceptionally dim, more like moonlight.  Most of our plants simply cannot produce enough energy from that little of light to be usefully productive.   

Simply adding atmosphere to Mars will never work because it is already holding on to all it CAN hold on to.  Any additions would get blown away by the solar wind.

Its sad to stomp on dreams but Mars is Marsish due to the way physics work.  Even if we made a precise copy of earth at that distance it would completely freeze up and the CO2 would still freeze on the ground.  That's right: ""dry ice not evaporating on the ground"" cold.

In addition to the above problems we then get into the question of sustainable ecology.  The earth gets slowly but constantly renewed by the plate tectonics and volcanic activity induced by the moon's gravity interaction generating heat through stressing the inside of our planet.  As the moon goes further and further away the center of gravity becomes more and more shallow and has a weaker gradient, at some point we will begin losing more heat than can be generated and the plate tectonics will seize up, vulcanism will become almost non-existent and once the core cools the magnetic field will begin to weaken.   

All these things have happened on Mars already.   While the sunlight is so weak the UV component is still high enough to give you sunburn from exposure.  The planet's surface is no longer receiving new nutrients and minerals from the inside.

So, we'd not only need to give Mars a 90% upgrade in mass, we'd also have to give it a moon in ratio and let it begin heating up to the point where it gained a magnetic field to protect the atmosphere before we give it that atmosphere.

The tricky bit there is that we have to keep its moon in orbit with a final % of the planet's mass not added.     So we'd have to ""top off"" the Mars Moon's mass while we filled the planet with air.

We'd have to get rid of its existing captured asteroidal moons as well.

If you covered the dandelion with your hands (the Earth and its magnetic field) when the sun blew few seeds would blow off.

IronBear76,"The big problems we run into truely terraforming Mars is the low mass/low gravity and no magnetic field.  Sure we could probably find a way to liberate gases from the soil of Mars, but as quickly as we liberated them, they would bleed off into space.  You see the low gravity means that escape velocity is very low, and without the magnetic field to shield the planet solar winds and cosmic rays are constantly energizing the gases to escape velocity.

If you do not address these problems, any terraforming will quickly be undone.

I see two possible solutions to this:

1) Dome Mars.  If we encase Mars in a dome we could trap an atmosphere inside it and the dome could be used to filter out radiation.

2) Enlarge Mars.  This may sound wild, but with a combination of computing, lots of time, and lots of small well timed pushes, we could move mass from one part of the solar system to Mars.  We could start by crashing Mars's moons into Mars, then move on to the Asteroid Belt, the moons of the gas giants, and the Oort cloud.

PasswordEqualsDog,"There is one problem with your question: The very definition of species is ""one population of organisms that can produce fertile offspring"", or in more simple terms ""a group of animals which can make healthy babies that can, in turn, make more babies"". The examples you made all produce (mostly) infertile or sterile offspring. For instance, a Zebroid (Zebra + Horse) can usually not have any more children.

However, as with everything, there is a little problem. Sometimes, scientists find 2 groups of animals which where thought to be different species (so mostly no fertile babies) and then they just go ahead and have normal, healthy offspring, out of nowhere. For instance, there recently was a Liger (Lion + Tiger) which had a cub together with a normal Tiger, which was thought impossible for the last decades. Are Lions and Tigers now one species?
Another problem is a case like this. Imagine 3 groups of animals: A, B and C.
A and C can not have fertile offspring -&gt; ergo they should be different species
However, A and B can have fertile offspring, as well as B and C. *What the hell?*
So where does one species start and the other end? Is B part of 2 species ""A"" and ""C""? Is there only one species ABC? Well, we are not sure.

Anyway, in order to get back to your question:
Are there any weird maybe-inter-species maybe-not-inter-species children possible from us, Homo Sapiens? The problem here is that there is no one left of our ""genus"" Homo ([here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo) is a list of all our buddies inside the genus Homo). Genus is the group *above* species. So animals (or plants) of different genus are genetically very different from another and there are^(almost certainly) no fertile offspring possible from animals from 2 different genera (plural of genus). Our closest relatives are Chimpanzees, and Humans and Chimps cannot produce healthy children.
Now, what happened to the other ""Humans"" in our Genus Homo? All of them went extinct. Either they starved, froze to death or we, Homo Sapiens, plain and easy killed them all.

In other words, it is cheaper to trade the extra wool for wine than it is to not.  even though competition may drive down his profit margins he and his competitors will probably have similar expenses and a shared motivation to earn a profit so it is unlikely for the value in trade to fall below the margin needed for profit unless the actual costs of the good in different markets change.

A way for the government to make sure banks had money - as cheekske says basically. 

&gt;and if you think it was a good idea for the government to fund it.

TARP specifically?  The government needed to, and still should step in more to deal with the economic down turn. There are lots of ways to accomplish that.  TARP in particular isn't a great programme.  Rather than helping people pay the mortgages they were struggling with, and rather than helping to deal with unemployment TARP went straight to the holders of debt and helped them help themselves.   On the other hand, TARP was something that could be set up quickly, and speed was important.

There are lots of ways to look at good and bad here.  Tarp didn't solve any long term underlying problems with the financial sector, wages, unemployment or the like.  But then it wasn't necessarily supposed to.  It was supposed to make sure there wasn't a massive run on the banks and a collapse of the entire financial system like a house of cards.  In that regard it seems to have worked, but you don't know for sure what  would have happened if it hadn't been there.   

Some of it only really exists in the political context of the time - the bill was passed in october of 2008 and Obama was in charge in 2009.  Whether you view the plan as a success or not depends somewhat on what you think the point was - was it just to bridge the financial system until the next administration, or was it to actually try and solve things?

Troubled Asset Relief Program:

Since the lenders knew the loans were garbage, they insured them (If the homeowner stopped paying, the insurance kicked in, but these insurance companies had to pay SO MANY claims they went under).

Congress wanted to unfreeze money, i.e. have the banks start lending money to borrowers (credit). If Money was only givin to the banks that were weak, people would realize who those weak banks were and take their money out of them. To hide who the weak banks were, the US Gov. gave money to many banks to lend out.

These are called wheals (or weals, both are correct spelling but wheals is more common). They are due to a local histamine-induced inflammatory response and go away in about 24 hours. When you scratch hard enough, mast cells (a type of immune cell) located just under the skin break open, releasing their stored histamines. As you may know, histamines are involved in allergic reactions and induce local inflammation among other things. Normally, mast cells release their histamines when they come across an allergen. But you can physically break them open by... scratching hard enough. Wheals also arise when, say, someone touches poison ivy, gets bitten by a mosquito, or consumes a substance that he is allergic to and develops hives (urticaria).

These carbon-based molecules must be specially engineered and paired together to facilitate the necessary physical process to convert light into electricity.

The potential advantages of organic solar cells relate to cost reduction, not efficiency improvements.  However, I believe that it is unlikely for organic solar cells to ever gain popularity over their inorganic counterparts.  They presently suffer from low efficiency (&lt;10%), and short life-span (~2 yrs) at best.  Inorganic solar cells made from silicon and gallium-arsenide can have efficiencies greater than 20%, and have a useful life-span longer than 20 years.",null,0,cdigzqt,1r0p8h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

There are not a lot of satellites for the amount of space they take up and for two to collide they would have to cross the same point at the same time which is very hard to do.

FinanceITGuy,"To step back a bit, health care costs are not distributed equally throughout the population. Some people (through a combination of good genes, healthy living and plain luck) will live long, healthy lives with few major medical issues. Others may be born with chronic conditions, suffer accidents, or develop serious diseases at some point in their lives. 

Because modern medical care is expensive, any individual would find it difficult to pay for things like chemotherapy, organ transplant surgery, or the ongoing care for a disease like MS. Societies have adapted different methods of dealing with this problem. 

With the exception of the United States, all industrialized democracies have adopted one form or another of single payer. The idea is that everyone in the society contributes something in the form of tax money to a central government authority. This authority pays all the medical bills for everyone in the country (hence the single payer). There are significant differences from one country to another: in one, doctors might be government employees, in another they might be self-employed. Some countries see the single payer system as all-encompassing and meeting all the health care needs of their population while others provide an option to supplant the basic care from single payer with private insurance and private medical practitioners outside the government system. 

The system in the United States is significantly different. During World War II there was a significant shortage of skilled workers for some types of jobs. The government had imposed wage caps as a way to keep skilled workers from leaving jobs supporting the war effort. As a way to sidestep the regulations, companies began using fringe benefits as an unregulated means of attracting and retaining scarce labor. One of these benefits was health insurance paid for by the employer. 

After the war, this system of employer-sponsored health insurance became widely accepted in the US economy. Large industrial companies employed tens or hundreds of thousands of staff and, much like the broader population, found that some had more expensive medical needs than others. A few of these companies paid their employees' medical bills directly, but over time more and more companies turned to insurance companies like Blue Shield or Aetna to provide coverage. 

Each of these insurance companies views their customers (the individuals insured) as a risk pool. The company needs to take in enough money to cover the medical expenses of all the insured, plus its own expenses. This creates a strong incentive for insurance companies to prefer the healthy over those who are more likely to incur higher expenses. 

Over time, insurance companies put in place policies to deny coverage to individuals who had preexisting conditions (that is, someone who had a very high probability of requiring additional care) or excluding these conditions from future coverage. Small businesses that were treated as their own risk pool found that a very small number of expensive claims could lead to greatly increased premium costs. Since these insurance bills were paid primarily by employers, many companies required employees to pay a portion of their insurance premiums or just stopped offering health insurance completely. 

For self-employed people this made for a very expensive market. Insurance companies were very reluctant to take on a risk pool composed of a single individual, particularly if they had any inclination that the individual might require expensive care in the future. 

The Affordable Care Act is an attempt to address some of the structural failings of the existing health care system in the US. Specifically:

* Prevents insurers from denying coverage due to preexisting conditions

* Allows young adults to remain on their parents' plans longer

* Allows individuals and small businesses to use health care exchanges to aggregate themselves into larger risk pools

* Requires a minimum level of coverage for insurance policies. Previously, some policies excluded coverage for common conditions like pregnancy or didn't cover hospitalization or other high-cost treatments

The only way to keep private insurance viable while bringing the sickest and highest cost patients into the system is to expand the risk pool. This is done through the individual mandate. This requires everyone (note: for most values of 'everyone') to purchase health insurance. For those with lower incomes, up to 400% of the federal poverty line, there are subsidies available to offset the premium cost. For those over age 65, the existing federal Medicare program already provides coverage. For those at the very bottom of the income scale, Medicaid is meant to provide coverage. Due to political disputes, many states have chosen not to expand their Medicaid coverage. This leaves the poorest in the US without access to medical insurance as they make too little to qualify for subsidies and are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase coverage out of pocket. 

From anywhere outside the US, the system under the ACA stills looks incredibly complex and terribly inefficient. On a per capita basis, the US pays double what any other OECD nation pays for health care. In fact, the amount the federal government pays (that is, before employers and employees pay anything into the system) costs about what most countries pay for their single payer systems. 

Many people have noted that average wages in the US have been stagnant for decades. It's important to note that, while take-home pay adjusted for inflation has been flat or dropping, the cost to employers of keeping people employed has gone up significantly due to increasing health insurance premiums.

If that's too much detail, it may be much simpler to describe the subjective difference between the two systems. In a single payer system, a patient goes to the doctor and may be required to show a card proving that he or she is entitled to care under the single payer system. The person is treated and goes home. No money changes hands between the patient and the practitioner and no bill is issued later. Medical practices do not have billing departments, there are (usually) no co-pays and no insurance paperwork needs to be completed. This process is the same for office visits, hospitalization, surgery or other treatments. In some countries, like Japan, this system extends to dental and vision treatments as well, but in most countries these are handled separately. 

Egads, it appears that even my TL;DR needs a TL;DL.

It is a bit misleading because the government obviously levies taxes to pay for health care, and there are many tax payers, not one.  
Canada, the UK and Italy, for example, have this in place. The advantages are that administrative overhead costs are low since there is only one organization doing the administration, also it does not seek a profit. Further, the government as single representative of an entire health care providers can haggle for much greater discounts than a single doctor or hospital ever could.

Positive: We gain an extra 60 minutes of sleep. 
Negative: We’re plunged into darkness for many more of our waking hours, with the sun frequently setting before 5 p.m.

Benjamin Franklin gets the credit for coming up with Daylight-Saving Time, according to Fred Espenak of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “The basic idea is to make the best use of daylight hours by shifting the clock forward in the spring and backward in the fall,” he wrote.

Official timekeeper for the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, puts it another way: Going from Standard Time to DST, which happens during spring, essentially moves an hour of daylight from morning to night. The reverse happens in autumn, NIST writes. “The transition [back] from DST to ST effectively moves one hour of daylight from the evening to the morning.”

After World War I, the practice of moving clocks began, and in the mid-1960s, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law for when DST would start and end, making its duration from the final Sunday in April to the final Sunday of October. In 2007, a new law by the Bush Administration extended DST by a month, starting it in March instead of April. (That makes it DST about 65 percent of the calendar year, according to NIST.)

The funny part about DST is that not every state follows it. States can opt out by passing a law, Espenak notes, and a couple have done so. Currently, Hawaii and Arizona (except in Navajo Indian territories) don’t change their clocks, nor do American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands.

According to one poll, many Americans don’t think DST is worth the hassle or that it saves any energy — one of the main arguments for the switch six years ago. Here’s a proposal from Quartz magazine to do away the practice altogether, instead dividing the U.S. into just two time zones an hour apart. For now, at least, it’s here to stay.
