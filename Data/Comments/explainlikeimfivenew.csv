PasswordEqualsDog,"Short answer: Because evolution.

Long answer:
We weren't always at the top of the food chain. Once upon a time, the ancestors of mankind had to stroll around in the steppe and woodlands of Africa scavenging for food or sneaking up on some large and slow animal to kill it with a rock or maybe a spear.

Imagine doing that when coloured in a bright purple. It attracts a lot of (unwanted) attention, as if screaming ""I am here! Please eat me, oh large predators of Africa! I taste oh *so great*!"" So all pre-humans who (randomly [this is how evolution works]) developed a mutation for a different hair colour than brown or black weren't as good at... *surviving*... as their brothers.

Hair colours like red and blond only started showing up a few hundred thousand years ago (in terms of evolution, this is a *very* short time) when camouflage wasn't as necessary anymore. Crops can't run away, even when you have blue hair.

And, who knows? Maybe in another hundred thousand years, humans will develop green and purple hair, simply because *why the hell not*?",null,2,cdnp63p,1rivib,explainlikeimfive,new,5

Pandashriek,"First, a bit of introduction: Voltage is measured in volts, current is measured in amps, resistance is measured in ohms and power in watts.

Watt is the actual power an electrical unit, lets say a light bulb, consumes. The higher the watts, the more power is needed to feed the unit. Engines power is also measured in watts - 1 horsepower being around 700 watts.

As for volts, ohms and amps - water pipes are a good analogy. The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure, the current is equivalent to the flow rate, and the resistance is like the pipe size.

I hope that it makes more sense now. I am not so familiar with electricity and if you want a more detailed explanation, I'd suggest asking wikipedia or googling the topic. ",null,0,cdnolc3,1ritvw,explainlikeimfive,new,2
meldyr,"Usually people start using the water analogy. I have a couple of problems with it.

1. You have positive and negative charges. That would be the equivalent of water particles with positive and negative mass.

2. Current goes in circles (at least in circuit theory). Water doesn't do that necessarily.

3. Usually they say voltage is height or pressure. The problem is that voltage is just energy. It is thus a little bit of both, that can complicate the thinking sometimes.


**Charge**

Particles can have a charge. You have positive and negative charged particles. Two particles with the same charge repel each other. Two particles with an opposite charge attract each other.  Charge is expressed in Coulomb. E.g: An electron has a charge Q=1.9x10^-19 C.

Q is the symbol of charge and C is the symbol for Coulomb.

**Current**

Charged particles can move. If charged particles move through a wire you have current. Current tells how much charge goes through a wire in an instant of time.

If 1 Coulomb of charge travels to a wire in 1 second you have a current of I = 1C/s =1A

Where I is the symbol of current and A the symbol of Ampère/Amps.

**What is voltage**

An electrical particle causes an electrical field. Suppose you have a non-moving electrical charged object. Let's call it object A. 

If you bring another electrical charged object close to it. (This is object B). Object B starts to move. Object B starts to gain speed. You could say that just because B is put on a given start position it has some kind of energy. When it starts moving that energy is converted in kinetic energy (energy because it gains speed).

The voltage represents the electrical energy that particle has because it is on in that position in proportion to its charge. To every position in space we can assign a voltage V.

V = E/Q

Where V is the voltage, E is the energy an electrical particle would have on that position and Q is the charge of that particle. 

E.g:
Suppose the object B has a  charge Q=1C. Because of being at that place it has an energy of E=1J. We say that on that place the voltage V=1J/C=1V.

Note that the first V represent the voltage. And the second V stands for Volts.
.
**Resistors**

In this [figure](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/OhmsLaw.svg) you see that on the top is a high voltage called V^+  and on the bottom we have a low voltage (V^- ).

We know from the previous section that a charged particle that is in the high-voltage area will flow down to the low voltage area and gain speed. The problem is that it doesn't go that simple.

When the particle goes down it has to travel trough a resistor and the particle will bump against a lot of other things. How more things that it will hit when going through the resistor the slower the current will flow.

We can characterize a resistor by using Ohms Law.

V=I.R

If the Voltage difference over the resistance is 6V and the current I=2A the resistor has a resistance of 3 Ohm.

**Watts**

Previous I explained that a charged particle has trouble to go trough a resistor. 

The particle will lose speed as it goes trough the resistor. This means that the particle lose energy. Because the current runs in a circle we can assume that at any place the speed of the particle should be the same. (The kinetic energy doesn't change)

So the amount of energy that is lost in the resistor equal to 

E=V*Q

Where V is the voltage and Q the amount of charge that went trough the resistor.

If we want to know how much energy we use for a given time instance we can do the following. (dividing trough a time t).

P=E/t = V*Q/t= V*T

P is the power that is lost in the resistance. The power is expressed in Watts. 

**Buying a light bulb**

* Voltage: The light bulb is designed for a given voltage and the wires in your house provide that given voltage. (So nothing to worry about)

* Power: This is the amount of watts. The more power it uses, the higher your power bill will be. On most light fixtures you can find something like 53W. In that case you should put a light bulb in it that consumes less than 53 Watt.  If your light bulb consumes more power than your light fixture can provide you could damage/burn your fixture. 

* Light Intensity: The more Lumens (L) the more light it gives. Don't assume that because a light bulb uses more power it will produce more light. 

* Color Temperature: It is expressed in Kelvin (K). But it's tricky, what scientists call a low color temperature describes colors which normal people would describe as warm. So if you buy a light-bulb choose one that has a low co lour temperature to keep your house cozy. If your light color is too high you will have an unpleasant hospital-like light. A right choice depends on the atmosphere you want in the room. I wouldn't go above 4500K.

**Buying a microwave**

Here you have to be careful. You have two times a number in watts which describes different things.

* Power consumption: the microwave consumes 1100 Watt. (This is the number that ends up on your bill).

* Microwave Power: this is how much of the power is actually used to heat your food.

An average microwave oven uses about 1100 Watt to provide 700 Watt microwave food. If you buy a microwave oven you should check that it provides enough microwave power and the efficiency.

**Buying a generator**

For a simple generator you shouldn't mind the voltage. (It produces the same voltage as a power plug).

Power: The more power it can produce (In Watts). The more electrical appliances it can support at the same time.

Efficiency: How much fuel it needs to create one Watt. Sometimes given in liter/Watt, sometimes just given as a number. (Note: don't compare these two different numbers.)

**TL:DR; The power in Watts you see on your appliance ends up on your bill. Something that gives power (e.g: a light fixture) has a maximum power it can supply. Don't attach anything to it that uses more power or you might break something**

Anyways, here is how I break down the basics whenever I'm going into a PC Build:

* CPU - the brains of the outfit. While most modern CPUs are plenty powerful, there is something to be said for picking quality AMD/Intel processors for your gaming needs
* Motherboard - tied closely with the CPU. Newer motherboards act like the nervous system of the computer, tying everything together. High quality or new motherboards often have newer features, better speeds, etc.
* RAM - the memory (well, fast memory) - the more the better, but you aren't going to be hamstringed if you only have 4/8GB. for gaming 8GB is good enough for most applications
* Hard Drive - this is where your long term storage is. Size is good, speed is also good - SSDs are fast, but storage is expensive. traditional hard drives are big, but not as fast. There are some hybrid models out there - go with what you can afford first, you can always upgrade later
* Power Supply - you can't run a computer without power. Gaming requires juice, and i've rarely seen a gaming PC with less than a 600W power supply, especially with the newer high-end video cards. If you can afford a big PSU, you might as well future proof yourself. Look for good warranties on these puppies, they can burn out on you!
* Case - where you store all your PC crap. A good quality case is easy to install components into, has good airflow, fans, and usually looks aesthetically pleasing. My Antec 900 was my favorite gaming case, and it survived a UPS cross-country kickball match to NYC, keeping the internals of the computer mostly intact. 
* Video Card - now is where things get interesting. You need good card to game. Mid-range will last you, but sometimes there is something to be said for buying high. I like to buy one generation back, and the highest possible where I can. Some people argue this is stupid because graphics cards come out practically yearly, but for me, I keep components for 2-5 years at a time, so if I don't buy high, it might cause problems in the future.

Combined with engines, which provide the forward momentum, the air moving past the wings from the airplane moving forward on the ground creates lift, pushing the aircraft into the air.

I for how lift works, it has to do with air pressure. What you need to know is that the faster air flows, the lower its pressure. We use this to our advantage by making the air above the wing flow faster than the air below it. This means that there will be loiter air pressure above the wing than below it. This results in an overall upwards pressure (normally the pressure above would cancel the pressure below, but we made then unequal). this upwards force is called lift. 

The way we get the air above to flow faster is by curving the top of the wing and keeping the bottom side of the wing relatively flat. Since both sides of the wing are moving through the air at the same speed, the air above and the air below have to flow pay the wing in the same amount of time.

In a modern airplane we use jet-engines to go forward and we make wings with a special shape that convert the forward speed you have in energy. 

**Jet Engines**

Suppose you are standing still on a skateboard and are carrying a heavy bowling ball. If you throw the bowling ball backward, you will see that you start rolling forward.

If you want to roll faster you can do two things, you could try it with a heavier bowling ball. Or you could throw the bowling ball harder so it will gain more speed.

If you like physics this is because of conservation of momentum. You could write a formula of that law as:
&gt;    m_1 v_11 + m_2 v_21 = m_1 v_12 + m_2 v_22 

* with m_1 the mass of the person
* with m_2 the mass of the bowling ball
* with v_11 the speed of the person before throwing
* with v_12 the speed of the person after throwing
* with v_21 the speed of the ball before throwing
* with v_22 the speed of the ball after throwing

(Note that going backwards requires a negative sign for the velocity)

A jet engine uses the same mechanism. But instead of throwing away bowling balls, it throws gases. The Jet Engine sucks in some air, light it with some fuel and the fuel and air will be leaving at the other side with great speed.

The increase your speed you can do things,

* Push more gases backwards: (requires more fuel)
* Make the gases exit faster: (requires great engineers)

**The wing**

The basic principle of the jet engine is to use conservation of momentum which is relatively simple to understand. We can use the same principle for the create lift.

What if we can create a wing that makes air go down. Due to conservation of momentum this would push the airplane up.

Here is an example of such a [wing](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2007/ph210/glownia2/images/f3big.gif). 

The basic idea is simple. But designing a good wing profile is incredibly hard.

Mooi_Weer,"The most used anesthetic in surgery is propofol, 

Propofol works by making it harder for your nerves to transfer signals. If your nerves don't transfer signals you won't feel pain, can't move, are not conscious and you don't make memories. 

Propofol can make your nerves stop transferring signals through (at least) two pathways.

1. Neurons (the cells that are (mostly)your nerves) communicate with each other through neurotransmitters. There are neurotransmitters that make a nerve cell send a signal, but there are also neurotransmitters which prevent a neuron from activating. Propofol makes your nerves more susceptible to an inactivating neurotransmitter called GABA. By doing this it makes sure signals don't go from neuron to neuron. 

2. To transfer a signal through a single neuron, an electrical charge must pass through it. A resting neuron has a portential (voltage) between the inside and outside of the cell of ~-70mV when activated this is raised to about ~+40mV thereby sending an electrical signal through the cell. The potential goes form -70 to +40 by opening sodium (Na+) channels which makes Na+ flow into the cell increasing it's potential. Propofol blocks these channels making it impossible for neurons to transfer a signal. 

So basically neurons are less able to send send to other neurons and are less able to send information through the neuron itself.

bw405,"first off, if the scratches are too deep, you can't fully buff them out. Use your fingernail. If you can feel the scratch with a nail, it's pretty deep and won't be easy to totally remove. Car paint goes like this:

METAL ==== BASE COAT ==== CLEAR COAT

The clear coat is what gets scratched up when you're talking about fine scratches. If you can feel it with your fingernail you might be into the base coat (it all depends on the quality of paint/clear coat your manufacturer has. Clear coat scratches are easy to remove, base coat not so much.

Buffing/polishing is a process in which you take down the surrounding clear coat or paint so that the bottom of the scratch is now at the same level as the surrounding paint. Buffing/polishing compounds are made of a toothpaste/shampoo consistency which may feel smooth but in reality they are simply made of very fine abrasive particles in a lubricant solution. Generally you start with a more aggressive compound (which can create micro-scratches itself) and gradually move to finer compounds until the scratch is no longer visible. Buffing is more aggressive than polishing, but the physics behind each are mostly the same. Buffing by hand is simple and cheap but it takes a very long time. Machine buffing/polishing is quicker but it requires a bit of skill (depending on the machine).

Those products you see on TV like Scratch-X are pretty good but they are just a form of polishing compound and generally only work on small areas of hairline scratches in the clear coat. If your scratches are small and isolated to a small area (such as around the key hole or door handles) this product works OK.

If you have large areas of light scratches, pick up a machine and do it yourself. If you are a beginner then you want a RANDOM ORBITAL BUFFER. This machine spins in a circle but it also moves the buffing head around in random orbits so it doesn't sit in one place and ""burn through"" the paint. These are better than going by hand but they also move relatively slowly for a machine, and still take time. Buy a couple different stages of polishing compound (one coarser and one finer), they are usually labeled in auto parts stores for the level of scratches they can remove.

If you have deep scratches into the base coat, buffing these out is best done by a professional. If you correct these scratches by yourself, you'll end up taking down all of the surrounding clear coat and this will produce a dull looking spot (the clear coat gives paint its shine). If the scratch went all the way to your sheet metal of your car, you might also get rusting which can lead to paint bubbling up and cracking and should be corrected quickly. The pros will buff it down, paint (if needed), and shoot new clear coat, usually on the whole panel and they may ""blend"" their work into surrounding panels so it is not noticeable.

Hope this helps!

And even more confusingly: This debate isn't always done in words, but sometimes in the form of a blank canvas with a dot on it. That thing basically screams *""Is this art?""* in your face. And if you answer with ""No."" it will scream: *""Then what else is art? What makes it different?""*

The general public usually isn't really educated about this discussion within the ""artistic community"". So looking at a recent piece of fine art is like reading a comment of some physics professor on a minute detail of quantum physics. It doesn't have any real implication on your day-to-day life; you most likely won't really understand it; but you might or might not like the style of writing.

Alright, bad question, the US has gone to war for less and Japan/the Republic of Korea (ROK) are pretty pissed off by having their citizens abducted and the occasional ""Woops, almost hit you with a rocket. Say, how about a bit of food for us?"" attitude, amonst other things like ""coal tunnels"" under the demilitarized zone.  
Still, what entitles anyone to screw with a souvereign nation just because they don't like their way of handling things?

* China. China doesn't want war for several reasons, the least of those is because they actually like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They have actually told the US ambassador how annoyed they are by the childish sabre-rattling of then still Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il, as illustrated in correspondence somewhere in the Wikileaks documents. It is highly unlikely China would actually perform a military intervention if the DPRK started hostile actions, their main focus is having a buffer zone between them and the pro-US ROK, even if it means occasionally supporting a crazy dictatorship at huge losses. China wouldn't mind a change of regime as long as the two Koreas stay apart.

* The DPRK basically has held Seoul hostage for decades. They have hundreds of long-range artilleries and rocket artilleries aimed at the city constantly ready to fire. The ROK knows basically every bunker's position and can retaliate and destroy them but that still means several volleys hitting a major population centre, even if said city is riddled with bunkers. Although Seoul is full of Chinese diplomats, CEOs, important politicians and their kids so the DPRK probably screws itself over with that bombardment.

* War. War is hell. The DPRK may be under-equipped, under-trained, with fuel reserves for a few months at best and material mostly made up of handed-down Soviet stuff and some of their own but that doesn't mean they can't drag it out into bloody genocide before they surrender. Their Navy is crap from the 60s and in direct battle could probably be dealt with by a single Ohio-class sub, their pilots get about 20 hours of flight training a year in old equipment because of constant fuel shortage, conscriptees and partly even professional soldiers can't be properly equipped because they lack enough weapons for everyone and their supply chain is so ineffective and train-reliant it's ridiculously easy to completely obliterate.  
*But* they have vast hidden bunker systems, thousands of defensive structures with well-equipped artillery bunkers and hidden explosive charges all over their south border, territorial advantage and a big pool of dedicated and indoctrinated infantry (plus 5-10 times that in general population reserves) that will fight to the last man if necessary. And even if they don't use nukes, which would be foolish as even China would immediately get to business on them, they have one of the biggest arsenals of chemical and biological weaponry in the world and are quite capable of deploying it via rocket artillery over several hundred kilometres.

Technically, if you take a shuttle with its rocket engines still attached to its hull, teleport it into deep space, tore open the rocket engines and light the match you will witness some great fireworks. Those tanks will provide enough oxygen for the fuel to ignite and explode.

As for implosions - those are impossible to occur on a space ship. The fact that the Cosmos is a vacuum means that there is no pressure, which means that there is no force being exerted on the ship, making it implode. Actually, the main force being exerted on the ship is coming not from the outside, but the inside. The ship is actually a pressurized container and all that pressured air tries to escape in space. This is the reason why when a rupture occurs, everything is sucked out into space - you should've seen it in the movies and that is actually true.

Anthropophagite,"You have to remember, most things in the movies are using technology far more advanced than our own. The Death Star was a massive space station the size of a moon. The power core was large enough for ships to fly in. Most things in the movies use exotic means of power. Take Star Trek for instance, they use anti-matter generators, warp cores, singularity cores, and other exotic things like that. It's not unlikely that the explosions seen in Star Trek are realistic to some point. Most explosions are caused by either a warp core breach, self-destruct, or from the detonation of a photon/quantum torpedo. For comparison a quantum torpedo is rated at roughly 1380 gigatons; a asteroid that passed at 38 lunar distances yesterday had 231 gigatons of energy. The secondary means of self-destruct on a Federation ship is the detonation of explosives around the ship. This is equivalent to 1,500 photon torpedoes, or roughly 42000 gigatons. Strangely enough, a warp core breach is rated at 100 megatons. One would think such an advanced engine capable to bend space would create a larger explosion. One would only need to look at our own test of nuclear devices in space to imagine what would a much larger one would look like. Without the shock wave, most of the energy would most likely vaporize everything within the explosive radius.

As for your second question it becomes trickier to use sci-fi as a resource. Assuming a hull breach occurs then the atmosphere in the section would vent and assuming the section seals itself, not much else would happen. You would merely have a section of the ship that was exposed to space. I believe most of the explosions seen in sci-fi is caused by a hull breach occurring in a place near a critical (explosive) component, such that whatever has pierced the ship has also pierced and compromised the component. Explosive decompression is also a possibility, but how likely it is I don't know.

The weak force is tougher to explain, but one thing that it does is keep a quark 'stable'. Quarks can change 'color', which can in turn change a proton into a neutron, or a neutron into a proton.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"The strong and weak nuclear forces are two of the four fundamental universal forces.  As you mentioned, the other two fundamental,universal forces are electromagnetism and gravitation.  There are many interesting theories about why we have four and how they started, including that they all,started as one combined fundamental force and separated over time after the Big Bang.  

In any event, the strong nuclear force allows for the otherwise counter-intuitive formation and integrity of an atomic nucleus.  An atomic nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons, but gravitation doesn't operate a sub-atomic scales (and is a very weak force in any event) while electromagnetism says that protons should repel each other in such close proximity and prevent any atomic nuclei from forming.  Obviously, without atomic nuclei forming, we would not have anything we see, including life forms. So, the strong nuclear force is what overcomes electromagnetic repulsion among protons and allows atomic nuclei to maintain structural integrity and thereby for atoms, molecules, and things we see.  The strong nuclear force is very strong, but only within very short distances (such as atomic scales).  So, in summary, the strong nuclear force is what holds atomic nuclei together allowing the formation of atoms and obviously molecules by extension.  

The weak nuclear force allows for radioactive decay. It is different from and weaker than the strong nuclear force.  The crucial practical effect of the weak nuclear force is that it allows for nuclear fusion within stars. Nuclear fusion within stars is essential for fueling the stars and for ultimately allowing for the formation of the higher elements.  ",null,1,cdnn7on,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,new,3

Chances are that if you are arrested and want to bring up entrapment, its going to be very situation specific, taking into account a lot of context and investigation to figure out if the police/agents involved in the arrest provided too much pressure, to the point where the intent was more strongly influenced by the government, rather than the accused's actual predisposition to commit the crime.

Edit Edit Edit: Lots of scenarios - guys, look, when it comes down to it, if you are arrested by an undercover cop, its going be centered around how you defend yourself in trial. You have to prove that you simply would not have done it if it were not for the pressure on you, and it has to be believable. You have to convince the judge, or the jury, or both, that you were coerced. Whatever scenario, tip, trick that you have, when it comes down to it, if you're arrested, then its all up to how you defend yourself and how much proof you can bring to the table.

Entrapment is an illegal act by authority figures to MAKE people do bad things (Illegal). An example of this would be: An undercover Police Officer begging a person (Not a drug dealer in this case, just for example's sake) to sell them drugs. This person, who actually just so happens to have drugs, repeatedly refuses the Officer's requests, until he finally gives in just to shut him up. The Police Officer then arrests the person for drug trafficking, takes the ""offender"" to court, and then has to duck as a Judge throws his little mallet at him for entrapping some poor person. 

**Entrapment is the act of reasonably forcing a person to commit a criminal act they would not have otherwise done.**

Understand that so far? Good. Now. What the general problem is, people don't have a basic grasp of what entrapment isn't. Entrapment IS NOT:

- Being an undercover hooker.

- Operating a child porn website

- Being a drug dealer. 

""But why, internet anon? Surely, the Police are luring these poor, innocent people to their doom!"" LOL. No. See. Get this: People suck, and actively seek these things out. And when they do, it's no longer entrapment. That John looking to get his dick wet with undercover Suzie? He willingly tried to solicit her. Yes, she could have asked, and all he had to do is say no and go on his merry way, and he wouldn't be handcuffed. Uncle Robert getting his door knocked down in the middle of the night by the FBI? No one FORCED him to watch little kids get fucked on the internet, he was looking for it. Your dumbass friend Marley who asked the wrong guy for drugs? He shouldn't have been asking ANYONE for drugs. Nor should he have accepted any offers.

**ENTRAPMENT IS: LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCING SOMEONE TO COMMIT AN ILLEGAL ACT, OR PRESSURING THEM INTO AN ILLEGAL ACT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE COMMITTED.**

**ENTRAPMENT IS NOT: PLAYING UNDERCOVER HOOKER ARRESTING EVERY JOHN, DICK, AND JOE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR POON. IF PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO COMMIT CRIMES AND THEY STUMBLE ACROSS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER, THEY'RE SHIT OUT OF LUCK**.

Additional fun fact: Undercover officers can do nearly anything to keep their cover, just short of killing someone (Presumably, they might actually). No, they don't have to admit they're cops just because you asked. Yes, they will deal drugs and kick you in the face. With undercover agencies, the ends justify the means.

Normally, he takes the long way around, but he's running late, and the babysitter has to leave soon, so he cuts through the bad part of town. Along the way, a cop asks him to help him with a bust. He tells the man to go to the dealer around the corner and buy some meth. Father does so, and the dealer happens to be a cop as well. Father is arrested.

This is entrapment, because had the police officers not set up this scenario, Father never would have made the purchase. As well, the officers lied and they used a random civilian.

Here's an example of a sting: Father had a hard day at work. He also came home to find the babysitter left earlier than she was supposed to, and that Mother's maxed out the credit cards for the fifth month in a row. Father needs to unwind, and goes into town to find a dealer so he can buy some pot. However, the dealer he finds happens to be an undercover cop, and he is arrested.

You can make one by taking iron, melting it, putting a strong magnetic field through the molten iron, this causes the atoms to line up, then when it re-solidifies you have a permanent magnet.

Why do moving charges produce a magnetic field? The answer actually involves relativity. When things travel near the speed of light, their lengths contract. While electrons move rather slow in a wire, the charge itself is actually moving near the speed of light. A positive charge going one way and a negative going the other. The charges already have an electric field that repels like charges and attracts opposites, due to length contractions, these fields grow stronger, but only relative to the direction of their motion.  Thus if you put two wires side by side, each with a current running in the same direction. The positives charges in one have zero relative motion to the positive in the other, but near light speed motion relative to the negative in the other. Thus the two wires will attract as the electric fields are condensed between opposite charges but not like charges by relativistic effects. If you flip one wire around so that it's charges are traveling the opposite direction the reverse happens. The positive charges in one are moving with zero relative speed to the negative charges in the other wire, while the positive in one compared to the positive in the other are moving at near light speed, thus the positive fields become stronger (also the negatives as well but in the opposite direction), thus the two wires repel each other.

That's the theory I was taught at least. I've never seen it mention before in anything else I read so I'm not sure how widely the Relativistic effect of electromagnetism is accepted. It's hard to swallow, because the electrons are barely moving at all in wires, and the protons not moving at all, it's just the perceived charge that's moving. It's like the motion of toppling dominos, the dominos don't really move much, but you can see a different motion going on, that isn't really the dominos moving, it is a wave of energy traveling through them. That's what actually moves in electrical wires and it's that near light speed motion that's causing the weird phenomenon of magnetism. Thus a magnetic field is the same thing as an electric field, it's just that it's under the effect of relativity such that if a charge isn't moving in the field, nothing happens, but as soon as the charge starts to move, the electric fields it experiences changes depending on it's direction of motion. It would be as if gravity pulled you to earth when walking east, but pushed you away when walking west, but didn't effect you at all if you stood still.

QuickSpore,"Because ""realism"" wasn't necessarily the goal. If you look at medieval European Christian art, one thing you will notice is that individuals are all different sizes. Why? The Romans and Greeks were capable of using perspective. And so were the Italian renaissance painters. So why would a 10th century painter screw up and paint a picture where Christ is twice the size of the Apostles and four times the size of some Roman guard. The answer in this case was because the painter wouldn't be trying to recreate a realistic rendition of the scene. He would be trying to create an interpretive version of the scene. And in that time and place, the size of a person represents power and majesty of the individual.

It is a relatively rare idea that art is supposed to be a reproduction of the world as it is. Even today I would say various forms of abstract and impressionist art are more common than ""realistic"" art.

And that was true historically as well. We have Egyptian art both statues and drawn that is petty realistic. But most the art we see from Egypt isn't. Why? Because it was traditional. There was all sorts of meaning attached to various poses and styles. Left foot forward meant one thing, right foot another. One eye visible also meant something different than two eyes visible. So following that convention communicates meaning to the viewer.

And as a final thought, most artists weren't very good. Professional artists have been fairly rare in history. It is significant that we can name a lot of the painters who were working in Italy in the 1400s. There weren't that many. A lot of the art we have from Egypt and the like were done by untrained priests and the like. If you were to bury all the ""art"" produced this year, most of it would be pictionary style doodles.

Schnutzel,"**Stack overflow**

Whenever you call a function, memory for that function is allocated in a place called the call stack. When the function completes its run, that memory is released. A stack overflow happens if too many functions are called, and there's not enough room in the stack (which has a hard size limit) to allocate more memory.

How can this happen? Look at the following code for example:

    int foo() {
        return foo();
    }

When you execute foo() for the first time, memory for it is allocated on the stack. But then the function calls itself - so memory is allocated again. The 2nd invocation of the function calls itself a 3rd time - and so on, to infinity (and beyond). Eventually the stack will run out of memory and the program will crash.",null,3,cdnm8mi,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,new,18
Schnutzel,"**Buffer overflow**

A buffer overflow when you try to write data into a buffer (an array), and the data exceeds the size of the array. For example:

    char buffer[8];
    scanf(""%s"", buffer);

The function scanf reads a string from the user into the buffer, which is 8 bytes long. However, scanf doesn't limit how many characters will be read - it will read until it's done (until a whitespace character is reached). So what happens if the user enters ""helloworld""? The first 8 bytes are written into the buffer, but the rest are written just outside the boundaries of the array.

Now one of three things can happen:

1. The overwritten memory can be unimportant, and nothing bad will happen (for example, the memory could have been used previously in the function but not anymore).
2. The program is not allowed to write to this memory, so it will report an error (and probably crash).
3. The worst case is that the memory being overwritten is important, but the program continues running. This allows the user to change parts of the memory they shouldn't normally have access to, which is a security flaw (thanks /u/BrQQQ for expanding on this!).",null,3,cdnmsqz,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,new,14

MEaster,"Buffer Overflow: Any random piece of data has a certain size. For example, an ASCII character is 1 byte. So if you have a string of 10 characters, you would need 10 bytes to store it. A buffer overflow would be when you write data past the end of this string overwriting other data.

Stack overflows are a bit more complicated. Firstly, a stack is a way of storing a list of data. It's what's known as a last-in-first-out list. Basically think of it as a stack of plates. You add data to the list by putting it on top of the stack, and then remove data by taking it off the top.

Another thing to explain is that in programming your code will generally be separated into subroutines. A subroutine will generally be things you want to do multiple times without having to rewrite it every time.

When a program enters a subroutine, it needs to keep track of where it came from so it can return. It does this by adding the current address to the stack before entering the subroutine. If you keep going into subroutines without returning the stack gets bigger.

In an operating system such as Windows, I believe each program has its own stack of limited size. If the operating system detects that the stack is full when the program tries to add something to it, then it will halt the program with a ""stack overflow"" error to prevent the program from causing problems.",null,1,cdnmnhf,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,new,2
RandomRobot,"The two can be combined or independent, depending on the context. A buffer overflow is very common in the C/C++ languages. It just means that you try to fit more data into a buffer than what it can holds. In those languages, you can access memory directly, so a string can be shown as 

    char myString[10];

If you try to copy more than 10 chars into it, then it will overflow. A stack overflow means that the data was on the stack when it overflowed, like in the previous example. However if you dynamically allocate memory, that memory will be on the heap, a large chunk of RAM that your program has access to. 

    char* myString = new char[10];

This string will be stored on the heap so when you overflow it, it will not be a stack overflow but a heap overflow, which is handled slightly differently by the program.

Overflowing the stack is especially bad since the program stores a lot of useful addresses on the stack, such as return addresses. If you carefully craft your 10+x chars, then you can potentially control the execution of the program. If your buffer was large enough, say... char[1000], then you could embed assembly code in the buffer and control the return address to execute the buffer. Those assembly codes are usually called shellcodes, because what an attacker want(ed, back in the days), was to get a shell, or a command line to the infected computer. There are whole books dedicated to this, how to write them and how to detect them.

Another way to generate a stack overflow is to call too many functions. The stack is a limited place, with around 1M (depending on tons of factors, such as your OS, your language, your compiler...). Recursion is a common mistake to generate a stack overflow like this.

    void func(){
      func();
    }

Those kinds of overflow are not as dangerous as the previous ones, first because they are easy to detect, even by just reading the code. The first execution will also crash fast. Secondly, the first kind of buffer overflow is more tricky to detect and an overflown buffer might not cause any problem to the execution of the program, while leading an attacker to complete control of your machine.

There is a very good tutorial about buffer overflows and how to execute arbitrary code with it called [Smashing the stack for fun and profit, by Aleph One](http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=49&amp;id=14).

Modern OS such as Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 have built in protections against those attacks, since they are so dangerous and difficult to avoid. A common protection is a canary on the stack. It means that the OS puts a special, magic value at strategic places on the stack. After some instructions, the OS checks if the magic value has changed. If it has, then the stack was smashed and some kind of error is returned to the user.

There are other kinds of attacks that are directed toward the heap overflows, but they are more difficult to execute properly.",null,0,cdnv0ez,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,new,1
kyz,"The implications:

""The stack"" is some memory that keeps track of where you are in the computer program. Every time you call another function, it saves your current state on the stack, and where to come back to.

The called function runs, and when it finishes, it restores the state to before you made the call (stored on the stack) and jumps back to just after the call instruction (also saved on the stack).

If you *run out* of stack, the program simply has to stop running. Where can you store the details of the next function call? Nowhere, you're outta space! The OS has to abort the program.

However, there's something worse. Imagine you take input from the user, and put it into space located *on the stack*. What if the user tricks you into putting more data there than there is space for?

... it means that the end user gets to control what's on your stack. They get to overwrite it with whatever they like. They now control the *state* of your program. They get to control *where your program will go to* once the next function returns.

If it's easy enough to guess *where* the stack is (if it's at a predictable location, like it used to be before [address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) was promulgated), you can tell the program to jump to... the stack data itself, which is something you, the attacker, have control of thanks to the buffer overflow. This is called **[smashing the stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smashing_the_stack)** (for fun and profit). The stack data which is actually code is called ""[shellcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode)"".

So now you have *complete* control of the program. Just from supplying input to a program, you have made it start running your own code, and you get to take on the privileges it had and access the resources it has.

One fix against this (as well as ASLR and not writing exploitable code) is to mark the stack memory as ""[No eXecute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit)"", which means that if the CPU is told to run code on the stack, it will immediately end your program.

It does not prohibit the ownership or carrying of automatic knives or switchblades inside a state while not on federal property, nor does it prohibit the acquisition or disposition of such knives in an intrastate transaction or an interstate transaction that is noncommercial and/or does not substantially affect interstate commerce (as defined by recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court).

Switchblades are illegal in lots of jurisdictions, but not all. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade#State_laws

I went into a knife store in Arizona and saw a boatload of knives they would happily have taken my money for, but that would have been illegal for me to carry at home.

I have heard, but can't prove, that in California, the legal definition of a switchblade includes a length (maybe 2""). So it's illegal to buy, sell, possess, carry, etc., an automatic knife over 2"", but knives under that length by definition are not illegal. Apparently there is a whole subculture of people who make, sell, trade, and collect these little miniature switchblades - in-state only, since interstate sale is illegal.",null,0,cdnkvz2,1rigkq,explainlikeimfive,new,1

lumpy_potato,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it probably has a lot to do with the regulations required for each industry - there are numerous health and safety each factory has to undergo. Every additional piece you add complicates the ability for the business to operate. Complexity is typically not good for manufacturing - simplicity is almost always cheaper.

In India, my grandfather has ownership of a steel mill. The mill used to have a forge area, a cutting area, a chemical treatment area, and an assembly area. All in a single compound. The chemical fumes from the area where they nickle plated piping would float all around the factory floor, so that the guys who were grinding and cutting away at the metal pieces would get a good strong whiff of it themselves.

There were minimal safety features involved (not uncommon for manufacturing work in India), but that is what made it possible - if you applied U.S. Health and Safety standards, every worker in the factory would need chemical protection for hands, body, feet, eyes, they would need masks, etc. This is huge expense for the guy whose only job is to cut the metal sheets as they come down the line.

That doesn't mean that chemical/processing/manufacturing plants don't have such agreements to move waste material around - they probably do, especially if there is a financial advantage to it. But I imagine there are regulations on that as well, and trying to sell the byproduct of factory 1 to factory 2 might end up complicated so much so by regulation that its cheaper to dump it than it is to sell/transfer it.",null,0,cdnk340,1rif4q,explainlikeimfive,new,2
H335,"In addition the EPA regs now usually mandate that any infrastructure changes that are over a certain percentage of square footage, or dollar market value (or any of several criteria) require full environmental review and permitting and are treated as entirely new facilities. 

So essentially this means that to raze a smelter and combine it with a coke production facility would require them to get a full environmental review, permits, and mitigation plan for razing the smelter - which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars (to ELIMINATE a facility). Then to add on to the production facility the EPA and other agencies would treat it as new construction of BOTH plants, and require the full process for each. Again running into multiple millions of dollars for EACH facility.

This is why there haven't been hardly any new refineries built in decades, and why there are so many shuttered and abandoned industrial facilities rather than selling off the land.

Characteristics of a sociopath are as followed :

    Sociopaths are very charming.
    Sociopaths can be extremely manipulative and will try to con you whenever possible.
    Sociopaths feel that they are entitled to everything.
    Sociopaths will lie continuously to get what they want. They can even sometimes manipulate a lie detector.
    Sociopaths have no remorse, shame or guilt.
    Sociopaths will show love and happiness only when it serves their purpose. None of the feelings are genuine.
    Sociopaths have no room for love in their life.
    Sociopaths need to have excitement in their lives or live on the edge.
    Sociopaths have lack of empathy hen their victims suffer pain that they have caused.
    Sociopaths believe that they are all mightier than tho, there is no concern on how their behavior impacts others.
    Sociopaths usually have a long history of juvenile delinquency as well as behavior problems.
    Sociopaths will never take blame for anything they have done to anyone no matter if it is family or friend.
    Sociopaths have many sexual partners and tend to act out many sexual acts.
    Sociopaths rarely stay in one place for a long time (home/work).
    Sociopaths will change themselves if they know it will keep them from being found out.

Characteristics of a psychopath are as followed:

    Psychopaths use superficial charm to lure their victims.
    Psychopaths are extremely self-centered.
    Psychopaths must always do something to keep themselves from boredom.
    Psychopaths are very deceptive and tend to lie continuously.
    Psychopaths show no remorse of guilt towards their victims.
    Psychopaths are very predatory and usually will live off other people.
    Psychopaths have many sexual partners in their lifetime.
    Psychopaths are very impulsive with their lifestyle.
    Psychopaths are always blaming other people for their actions.
    Psychopaths never have a realistic view of their lives. (king of the world or from another planet)
    Psychopaths always want psychological gratification in sexual and criminal activities.

This is not included in the DSM but was created as a test for psychopathy. Each criterion gets a score from 0-2 and all are added up to determine psychopathy.

Additionally, the following is a direct excerpt from an interview I did with Dr. Peter Langman for a research paper of mine about active shooters (Cho, James Holmes, Columbine shooters). He is the author of ""Why Kids Kill"" and is a leading expert on school shooters. He has an interesting perspective.

I asked:
Psychopathy has not been included in the DSM-IV. If you were to include psychopathy as a personality disorder in the new DSM-V, what would the criteria be? 

It's hard to say. In some ways, psychopathy seems like an extreme version of narcissistic personality disorder. One thing I might add as a possible criterion would be sadism, though this is not one of the traits Robert Hare includes in the Psychopathy Check List. Possible criteria might be extreme narcissism; disregard for rules, laws, social norms, the feelings of others, etc.; lack of guilt/remorse; meeting own needs at the expense of others; inability to engage in mutual relationships. Violence and criminal behavior would not be necessary for the diagnosis, but are often part of the picture.

There is no official definition for ""sociopath"" while there (kind of) is an official definition for psychopath, laid out by Robert Hare. 

Different groups will make their own distinctions but these distinctions are not official or universally accepted.

Sometimes a field or group will prefer one term and simply not use or define the other term. More often than not the terms can be and are used interchangeably.

Certainly, they help people on a daily basis, but being unable to experience fear or empathy will keep them from getting emotionally attached to their patient.

OrangeCrack,"A cell phone is actually a radio -- an extremely sophisticated radio, but a radio nonetheless. 

Before cell phones, trucks would talk to each other using CBs, however, this was limited to the number of people that could talk at the same time due to the  range and the fact these typically only had about 25 channels. 

The genius of the cellular system is the division of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously.

In a typical analog cell-phone system in the United States, the cell-phone carrier receives about 800 frequencies to use across the city. The carrier chops up the city into cells. Each cell is typically sized at about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers).

Because cell phones and base stations use low-power transmitters, the same frequencies can be reused in non-adjacent cells. 

Here are the basics:

 - As you drive through the city areas are divided into cells
 - The cells read a unique ID on your phone to identify you and what carrier you are with.
 - If your ID matches that of the tower, you will be considered in your home network.
 -  Along with your ID, your phone also transmits a registration request, and the cell tower keeps track of your phone's location in a database -- this way, the tower knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone.
 - The cell tower gets the call, and it tries to find you. It looks in its database to see which cell you are in.
 - The cell tower picks a frequency pair that your phone will use in that cell to take the call.
 - The cell tower communicates with your phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use, and once your phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected. Now, you are talking by two-way radio to a friend.
 - As you move toward the edge of your cell, your cell's base station notes that your signal strength is diminishing. Meanwhile, the base station in the cell you are moving toward (which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies, not just its own one-seventh) sees your phone's signal strength increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each other through the cell tower, and at some point, your phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies. This hand off switches your phone to the new cell.

tl;dr - Your phone acts as a radio and cell towers communicate with your phone and each other to automatically transfer your call.",null,1,cdnjtsw,1rid4r,explainlikeimfive,new,9
classicsat,"Cell phones don't ""find"" each other, at their radio level, all they need to do is find the best tower associated with their service, or a roaming partner if need be, and communicate with that.

They find each other at the network level, which works above the radio. Your phone connects to the network, then to another phone. ",null,1,cdnmll8,1rid4r,explainlikeimfive,new,1
afcagroo,"When a CPU reads an instruction, it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer. It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips ""Give me the information at this address"". It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus - high voltage means 1, low voltage means 0. The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion. It toggles some control pins to say ""Here ya go"" and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the 1s and 0s corresponding to that binary data. The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory. (This description is actually vastly simplified, but hopefully gets the idea across.)  
  
Similarly, the CPU (or other devices) can move data/instructions from the HDD into DRAM, or to/from network interface chips, etc. One thing asks for data stored in a particular set of locations, the other thing says ""OK, here it is"" and sends it, and the first thing (sometimes) says ""Thanks, got it!"". Or, something says ""I'm going to send you some information to store/work on"" and a similar handshaking goes on.  
  
All of this communication is built up in layers. The lowest layer that I described above, where voltages change to represent something, is called Layer 1, the physical layer.  Sometimes a ""1"" is sent via a high voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage simultaneously on two different wires.  There are lots of different ways to do it, and some are better for some uses than others.   
   
Higher layers define the protocol for decoding that information and deciding what it means and how to use it.   

These generic layers are described in the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). But there are various different bus protocols (SATA, PCIe, Ethernet, etc.), and to understand any one of them you'd need to read up on its specifics.   
  
Processors tend to have their own proprietary or semi-proprietary bus protocols for some things; this has been a recurring issue for companies like AMD who are trying to compete with the 500 pound gorilla in PCs, Intel. For other things (like DRAM) they tend to use protocols that the industry has agreed upon (like DDR3).  
   
Wireless communication adds a bit more complexity. Since things aren't connected with wires, information must be sent by modulating a radio signal. There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
One simple way is to use signalling. You can pulse the light on and off like [Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code, you can transmit information.  This is actually done in some fiber optic systems. (They don't use Morse code, and it is much much faster than a human could do. But it's the same general idea.) This technique isn't really used with radio broadcasts, though. 
  
Another way is to *modulate* the signal.  If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.    ",null,0,cdnjdst,1ricgj,explainlikeimfive,new,2
lumpy_potato,"Depends. Are we talking wired or wireless?

Wired, its all just electrical signals representing binary digits, 0 and 1.

Lets say I have a chip that has 1 input and two outputs. The two outputs go to a red light and a green light.

When the input is off (0, no current) the red light stays on. When the input is on (1, current) the red light turns off and the green light turns on.

Electronics, when you get down to it, are a lot of red-light-green-light sort of operations, turning things on and off until you get the required output from a particular input.

With wireless, its the same thing, only you use some form of wireless medium - e.g. radio waves. You take your binary 0s and 1s and transmit it via radio, the same way you transmit music from an antenna to your car radio.

The receiver picks up the signal, decodes it, and turns it back into electrical 1s and 0s.

TheRockefellers,"There are about a million ways of scoring tennis, but I'm assuming you're talking about what you see in the pros. Here's the big picture:

To win a tennis match, you must:

* Win a majority of the **sets** (best of 3 for women, best of 5 for men);

* To win a **set**, you must be the first to win **6 games**, and you must win by two; or if both sides are tied at 6 games each, they play a **tiebreaker** (a specific type of game) to win the set;

* To win a **game**, you must win four (or more) points, and **you must win by two points.**

Now, as for game scoring:

* 0 points = love

* 1 point = 15 (or sometimes called ""5"")

* 2 points = 30

* 3 points = 40

* A tie at 3 points or more = deuce

If both players reach deuce, we kind of stop keeping track of the total number of points, since all that matters at this point is winning by 2.  So at this time, you abandon your numbers. Instead, the score is:

* Deuce, if the players are tied (as noted above)

* ""Ad in"" or ""advantage in"" if the **server** has one more point than the receiver (in which case the server wins the game if he wins the next point)

* ""Ad out"" or ""advantage out"" if the **receiver** has one more point than the server(in which case the receiver wins the game if he wins the next point)

Also, before each point serve, the score will be announced. The order of the numbers matters; the first is the server's score, and the second is the receiver's.  So if you hear ""30-15,"" you know that the server has two points to the receiver's one.

So here's an example of a single game being scored between S (who's serving) and R:

* Game starts at 0 (love) all
* S wins the point; 15-0
* S wins the point; 30-0
* R wins the point; 30-15
* R wins the point; 30 all
* R wins the point; 30-40
* S wins the point; deuce
* S wins the point; Ad-In or Advantage S
* R wins the point; deuce
* R wins the point; Ad-Out or Advantage R
* R wins the point; R wins the game

Also within these rules there are a few aberrations.  For example, in Wimbledon, there is no tiebreaker in the final set of a match. You have to win by two games. This can result in some loooong matches, like the championship a few years ago, which lasted something like 11 hours.

ADVANTAGE _________ = that player has to score one more point to win the game


when a game is won, they start back at love. one must win a certain number of games within a set, a certain number of sets to win a match.

TurtleHerder_,"Tennis is broken down into 3 components; These are points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games(usually 6), and games consist of points. It takes 4 points to win a game. The points however, have different names.
0 points= love
1 point=15
2 points=30
3 points=40
4 points=60
Once a player reaches 4 points, the game is over, unless the game was tied at 3 points a piece beforehand(ex:40-40). This occurance is referred to as 'deuce'. In this case you can only win this game by becoming 2 points ahead of them. Once a game reaches 'deuce', it stays in deuce until the 2 point margin is reached.
An example of an in-progress game score would be:
Player A has 3 points and Player has 2 points. Therefore, Game score=(A)40-(B)30.
If the game is tied, the score is followed by 'up'. Ex:15-up

Overall tennis matches are usually played best of 3(women) and best of 5(men) sets. In order to win a set, the player must win 6 games by at least a 2 game margin. Ex. 6-4.

*[I]t wasn’t Iran that turned the Israeli-Iranian cold war warm – it was Israel . . . The Israeli reversal on Iran was partially motivated by the fear that its strategic importance would diminish significantly in the post-cold war middle east if the then president (1989-97) Hashemi Rafsanjani’s outreach to the Bush Sr administration was successful.*

And so,

*Israeli politicians began painting the regime in Tehran as fanatical and irrational. Clearly, they maintained, finding an accommodation with such “mad mullahs” was a non-starter. Instead, they called on the US to classify Iran, along with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, as a rogue state that needed to be 'contained'*

So what we want to do is eliminate things that can change the environment. Pets produce many environmental waste just as making pencils do. The idea behind it is to eliminate as much as we can slowly over time. Pets do not produce that much of a concern to the ecosphere as coal burning does. If we changed green house emissions,. Suddenly we need to learn how to clean up these landfills. If we learn how to get rid of landfill waste, suddenly we need to learn how to incorporate our society and cities from being invasive to other species. The list will always go on.

Remember that climate change and environmental impact isn't necessary black and white.

We are really worried about things that could really impact our ecosphere and change it in ways we don't want, and those factors are much larger than the pet industry.

In this case the complete garment would have two pants, or better, a pair. Pantaloon as a garment could be used in the singular, but most often the plural was preferred. 

In the U.S. in particular, the single word ""pant"" came be used in the retail clothing industry (late 19th c. onward) to represent what every one else would call either ""pants"" or ""a pair of pants,"" e.g., "" A practical and well made pant for general sportswear"" (L.L. Bean Catalogue, 1962).

He represented a Venetian type and spoke in Venetian dialect (as did the Zanni character), and wore close-fitting trousers down to the foot. (Most commedia characters were known not only by their name, their calling, their dialect, and their manner, but also by their costume.) 

The French picked up on the name Pantalon (their version of Pantaleone), and passed it to the English as Pantaloon, both of which were used both for pants and for the character. Pantaloon is an old fool, whether in Italian, French or English. 

This does not answer the question about using the plural for a singular garment. This is also the case with shorts (that is, short pants). After the term ""pants"" came to be accepted for female attire, we had also pantaloons and panties, the latter being used both in the singular and in the plural, mostly in the plural. In a panty-raid, one steals panties. If a girl on spring break accidentally drops her bikini bottom you may say, ""She dropped her panties."" I don't know if anyone would ever say, ""She lost her panty,"" but I don't think so. (Panty in the singular is used mostly in trade language, like pant.) 

In any case, it's a garment with holes for the legs. This is also true of short shorts and tighty whities and briefs. But the actual covering of the legs is omitted altogether, unless you dignify the origin of the legs, or stump, as a pair of legs. When you don't even get the stump, as in a thong, no one uses the plural. 

So, one shirt, a pair of shorts, but NOT two shorts. Originally a pant was a pant-leg.",null,0,cdngqiv,1ri4fd,explainlikeimfive,new,7

That said, the death of one party to a contract *usually* doesn't release the other party from the contract. I'd expect that to be the case for virtually any lease. So in sum, the lease agreement would survive the lessor's death. It would then probably pass to whoever now owns the subject property. That could be the government, if the property escheated. Or if there was a mortgage on the property, the mortgagee may have foreclosed on the property and succeeded to the lease.

restricteddata,"[The same question came up on here a day or two ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rf3m3/eli5_why_can_some_countries_decide_who_can_and/); here's what I wrote there:

In the early 1960s, the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb. Maoist China had just set one off, and was considered a pretty looney ""rogue state"" at the time (Cultural Revolution and all that), and was a mutual enemy to both. Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism, there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future, as opposed to the five that then existed (US, USSR, UK, France, China). They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence (e.g. once China has nukes, you can't threaten China with nukes without being threatened back), and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to all-out nuclear war (which neither the US or the USSR wanted).

But the problem is that they didn't want to give up their own nukes. They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation. Once a country has nukes, a whole new (potentially stabilizing) political order emerges. They didn't want to give that up, they just wanted to stop _new_ political orders (which they saw as destabilizing) from cropping up elsewhere. 

The countries without nukes, of course, were like, wait, you guys get nukes, but we don't? Lame. So they made the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) include sections that said that the so-called Nuclear States (the ones that already had them) would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well. This is Article VI, which states:

&gt; Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.

Well that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding. All of them are willing to say, ""sure, we'll get rid of our nukes if everyone else does"" but they all know that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So why would a non-nuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is? Not so much because of the disarmament clause, but more because the NPT also says that non-nuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of ""peaceful"" nuclear energy as well. So they get help with reactors and things like that, as long as they agree to safeguards that won't let them weaponize any of it. It's also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region — if everyone in, say, South America agrees to not get the bomb (and this is enforced by means of the NPT), then that means you don't have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get one.

In practice things have always been messier than that. For one reason, not everybody signed the treaty. There were _many_ non-signatories/non-ratifiers until the end of the Cold War. Among them were two of the named nuclear states (France and China, both of whom did help other states proliferate), and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear (Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa), as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear (i.e. Egypt, Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil).

rsdancey,"After WWII ended, the United States thought that there were only two options.  Either nuclear weapons needed to be turned over to an international agency for use only in the enforcement of collective security, or there would be unlimited proliferation leading in short order to a nuclear Third World War.

The civilian benefits of nuclear technology were overstated.  People thought that nuclear power generation would replace conventional power generation very quickly.  The potential of nuclear medicine was just being investigated but hopes were high.  So most countries wanted access to nuclear technology.

The problem is that nuclear reactors using uranium, the easiest and first technology available, produce plutonium as they operate.  That plutonium can be removed from spent fuel and reprocessed to make nuclear weapons.  There is no good way to allow unlimited nuclear power generation without creating a nuclear weapon proliferation risk.

Once the Soviet Union developed its own nuclear weapon, it was no longer possible for the US to imagine giving up its own weapons to an international body.  In the end, an international treaty was developed that traded the right of a country to operate nuclear reactors for the enforcement of rules that prohibited the development of nuclear weapons.  This treaty called on the powers that had nuclear weapons as of the date it came into force to eliminate those weapons ""as fast as possible"" so that eventually no nation would have nuclear arms.  Those countries were the US, the USSR, the UK, France and China.  Coincidentally, those countries are also the veto-wielding permananent members of the UN Security Council which, via the language of the nuclear weapon / nuclear power treaty serves as the arbiter and enforcer of that treaty.

A small number of countries have never signed the treaty, or have withdrawn from it, which is how India, Pakistan, North Korea and Isreal have built their weapons programs.  Technically they should face crippling economic sanctions and potentially military action to force them to comply with the treaty even though they are not signatories, but practically the decision has been made to enforce those penalties ad hoc or not at all.

The problem with the treaty is the danger of dual-use.  A country can remain within the limits of the treaty while preparing itself to make nuclear weapons.  It can create enriched uranium or extract plutonium up to a limit.  It can conduct research on the triggers and controlled explosions used in nuclear weapons.  And then it can break the treaty and ""dash"" for a weapon, trying to get the work done before it faces international consequences.  North Korea shows that once you have nukes you probably can't be forced to give them up.  This is why Iran is so worrisome.  They are following the classic path to use the legal limits of the treaty to position themselves for a quick sprint to a bomb.  In fact they have repeatedly violated the treaty,and been caught, which reinforces the world opinion that they are planning to make bombs.",null,1,cdnkqx7,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,new,4

upvoter222,"You can probably find a more technical definition elsewhere, but basically, intentional grounding is a penalty committed when a passer (generally the quarterback) throws an incomplete pass to avoid being sacked (tackled behind where the play started).  There are specific rules dictating what qualifies as intentional grounding.

For example, it's not intentional grounding if the incomplete pass was headed towards an eligible receiver.  In other words, even if it's really obvious that the QB threw the ball knowing it would bounce or end up out of bounds, it's still legal if there's a receiver nearby.  Throwing near an eligible receiver is only required if the QB is in the ""pocket"".  The pocket, in ELI5-terms, can be thought of as the part of the field directly behind the linemen or big blockers up front.  

If the QB is outside the pocket (ie. scrambling around the field), he does not have to throw the ball near a receiver.  However, the ball has to be thrown beyond the line of scrimmage, further forward than where the ball was snapped.  

If a player is penalized for intentional grounding, the offense moves back either to the location of the throw or 10 yards backward, whichever is longer.  There is also a loss of down associated with this penalty, so if you intentionally ground the ball on 1st and 10, it can become 2nd and 20.  Also note that although it looks like it should be called, the rules do allow a QB to immediately spike the ball without a penalty to stop the clock. ",null,0,cdngrqs,1ri1fo,explainlikeimfive,new,3

Sloloem,"The difficulty is that politicians are allowed to take donations in a number of different ways and it's very difficult to prove that any of that money has been exchanged directly for a political favor.  Put simply, if you are running for a legislative position you may receive several thousand dollars from various entities in the freight shipping industry because they believe in you.  Most politicians want to be re-elected, so there's an expectation that if you act in the best interests of the freight shipping industry you will be able to get that money again next election cycle.  At no point did someone say to you that we'll donate to your campaign if you vote against this proposal to increase truck thruway tolls...that would be a bribe.

Lobbying even further complicates the issue because these are people who are allowed to sit down with a legislator on behalf of their business and literally tell them that they should support certain laws.  They're regulated and can't literally say they will pay for their law, but there's a lot of fuzzy gifting and other favors that lobbyists can provide...plus you're earning the good will of a party with deep pockets that may be more likely to donate to you when you're next up for election.

That's why you can't tell a police officer you'll give them money to let you out of a ticket.  HOWEVER, what you can do is donate to a Police Benevolent or Patrolman's Benevolent Association which are local unions that represent police officers in an area.  Now while this is anecdotal and partially bad-cop circlejerking, in my experience a police officer is far less likely to cite you if your car is displaying a PBA sticker implying you've donated.

unpopopp,"Sorry for the length, but I want to weigh in here, because this simply is not a fair comparison. Police and legislators serve different functions, and ""bribing"" them raises completely different questions.  
 
It is true that there are much stricter laws for bribing a police officer than for bribing a legislator.  Lobbyists are much freer to cajole, wheedle, and overawe legislators with gift and meals and donations. (Note, though, that there are limits, sometimes strict ones. Whether those limits are enforced enough is a separate question)  

But how else could you do it? The whole point of legislators is to hear the arugments of their constituents and come to some conclusion about what policies to support.  Even if you blocked every dinner and every donation, people with an interest in particular policies would still, to paraphrase the First Amendent, do what they could to petition for the redress of greivances.  Maybe it would mean using more attractive lobbyists, or organizing protests, or something else, but it would invariably be more than is available to the average person like you or I.    
 
And, to a certain extent, that's okay. The protections are supposed to be built into the system elsewhere. Rather than making it easier for the executive to go after politicians they don't like (""oh a union member held the door open for you? Bribery!""), we have many legislators, who have to act publicly, and are subject to re-election.  We have courts that can curtail or overturn improper laws, and a free press that can try and shame the truly corrupt. We have constitutional limits on what the legislature can do. And, most importantly, we have elections. This is part of the reason why lobbying tends not to be about convincing people to change their minds and vote for you, but helping people who already support you to make an effort.  
   
A police officer is completely different.  They aren't making policy and carefully balancing the interests of constiuents, who may fundamentally disagree on what's right.  They are enforcing the law. Rather than the highest values being debate and deliberation, the highest values are impartiality and fairness.  You can't vote a cop out of office for being corrupt (usually), there's much less public scrutiny, and the situation itself is often quite different, by which I mean if you bribe a cop to let you go, you go free. If you ""bribe"" a legislator to make a speech, you may lose or win regardless.    
 
And, here I would go back to the rules that are in place to prevent undue influence on legislators.  These rules are usually rules that are designed to prevent the kind of non-policy influence that legislators wield, being stricter when it comes to firms that might win a contract because a Congressperson called on their behalf, or to block people from donating money to get immediate benefits.  
 
**TLDR;** Slipping a $50 to a cop to get him to overlook a crime is radically different from bundling the donations of likeminded people as a way of getting a legislator to support a particular policy goal.  
 
Also, just as a note, I personally think that there is way, way, way too much ""moneyed interest"" influence in politics, and that major reforms are necessary and should be immediately implemented.  But I don't think that it is correct to equate all lobbying with bribery, any more than one would equate all dieting with steroid use.

Likewise, if, at a given temperature, the air is holding more water than it should be, then water will condense on a cold surface.

There is little limit on how much can actually condense onto a surface - as long as it is cold, and there is an abundance of moisture. However, in the _absence_ of a replenishing source of moisture, there can be little or no condensation. For example, if you bring out a cool shot glass into a hot summer day, you'll notice condensation build up over time. If you put a normal glass over the shotglass, such that there is no air circulation, there may be limited condensation - condensation only occurs as long as there is excess moisture in the air.

So in an enclosed garage, even with no thermal insulation, simply limiting the amount of air reduce how much frost can build up.

Now, to address the other point: temperature. Even a completely uninsulated garage can retain _some_ heat. All objects emit some form of thermal radiation - usually in the infrared range. This emitted radiation can be absorbed by other objects. A car, for example, can emit radiation that is absorbed by the ground. The ground, in turn, also emits radiation to the car. This means two objects in close proximity can maintain a thermal equilibrium.

If you park outside, however, any radiation emitted to, say, the house on the other side of the road, will be dispersed due to the [inverse square law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square_law) - it's harder to maintain equilibrium. Any radiation emitted to, say, the night sky, is guaranteed to pretty much never return. That's a net _loss_ in energy.

This means that, simply by providing four sides and a roof, you can retain _some_ amount of heat longer than if you parked outside. This is one reason cars parked in sheds with no door can have frost build-up only on sides where it's exposed (especially at the turn of the season, when it isn't really _that_ cold to develop frost elsewhere).",null,0,cdnjxwi,1ri0xe,explainlikeimfive,new,3

And if your garage is attached to the house, it gets both insulation and heat from the house, as well as the house blocking the wind from part of the garage.  Also, even though your garage is ""uninsulated"", the walls of the garage do provide some intrinsic insulation.

GentlePandoran,"It's all about the ""dew point"" which is the temperature at which dew will form on grass and bushes...and your car left outside. So for example maybe it's 50 degrees outside overnight...but the dew point is 53 degrees. This means that your car will get wet from dew at 53 degrees. But if it's 50 degrees outside and the dew point is 40 degrees, you car will NOT get wet overnight. Neither will the grass nor bushes be wet. 

Dew point is a humidity factor. The monsoon season in Phoenix, Arizona, for example, is calculated strictly on the dew point. Once it reaches a certain number, monsoon season has arrived...and will stay until that number goes back down, indicating that monsoon rains could arrive on any given day. 

Just like how high humidity will make your cold drink sweat and leave water rings, dew points high enough will make your car outside wet. It's that simple.

Check your local weather station for the dew point temperature. That way you'll know if your car is going to get wet at night or not.

So it's imperative that urgent RCTs be performed on black African women, in order that they too might enjoy the potential benefits that men gain from circumcision. Once again, it's not ethical to run these RCTs on white western women of course.

If the research is positive (hopefully), then perhaps WHO will recommend female circumcision along with male circumcision.

Like male circumcision, there are plenty of peer reviewed studies that show female circumcision is not a barrier to sexual orgasm and enjoyment. Some studies show that orgasm and enjoyment are reduced; and some show no effect.

You'll often come across members of the medical community saying that FGM has no ""health"" benefits, and if women have their clitoris amputated, then their sex life comes to an end. Then they say that MGM has lots of ""health"" benefits and that men's sex life is not affected.

But it's a myth that many women who have suffered FGM are unhappy and cannot have great sex lives. That's why they queue up to have their daughters' circumcised. Plus there are many so-called potential ""health benefits"" - such as a 50% reduction in HIV/AIDS.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris

The visible part - the glans clitoris - is only a small part of the whole clitoris. So when a woman suffers partial or total amputation of the external clitoris when undergoing FGM, only a small part of her clitoris is removed. Thus she often can enjoy a full and satisfying sex life.

The real pain of braces is far less acute, and far more annoying-- when they replace the wire with something really stiff, she's going to get that awful ache as the new wire starts to bully her teeth in the right direction. It's not pain, just eternal uncomfortable pressure on your teeth.  (Actually, it lasts a few days after each wire-change.)

Throne3d,"Speaking from past experience, braces which are not removable do not really seem to have sharp points on the individual brackets (the metal pieces glued to the teeth), except for on those brackets where elastic bands could be required (in my case it was the third tooth from the middle on both sides, on both the top and bottom of the mouth).

The wire, however, which is attached to / threaded through these brackets, is made of some sort of memory alloy which (when bent away from its ""set"" position) will try to bend back to what it was ""set"" to (the 'correct' shape of the mouth / layout of the teeth).

Sometimes the wire is not cut enough towards the back of the mouth where it pokes out at the end of the brackets, and is (usually) able to cut the inside of the mouth. If the gum scrapes along it (while chewing or speaking, for example), it is likely to damage the inner lining of the cheek. 

Alternatively, as the teeth move into position, the wire may end moving around in the braces (as it is not fixed into position, from what I can tell, but instead is kept close to the brackets by being enclosed). This could cause it to be fine when the orthodontist first puts the wire in, but then get worse as you go along (until the next time the braces are 'tightened' / rewired).

Oh, and as /u/Sunfried has mentioned - there are two main types of pain with braces, in my experience. A sort of ache which is usually worse just after them being rewired (and for a day or two afterwards), and the cutting pain which the ends of the wire cause.

Rubber bands are put on those hooks in order to exert pressure and correct the jaw.

To be honest, to say that no one has come up with a solution to the problem is bull crap. You just didn't research on the matter enough. When I did put my bracers, I was allowed to choose from multiple designs. I chose titanium, mini bracers which resemble the classic ones - just smaller. However, there were all sorts of other materials and designs. There was these ones made of some kind of a ceramic material, which was the same color as the teeth and the manifacturer claimed that they are way smoother. The most interesting ones where a type of bracers that were glued to the inside of your mouth, rather than the outside. Initially, I though of getting these, but my dentist told me that the classic design is the most efficient.

If your little girl suffers from the bracers, there is another clever solution - dental wax. You can get it from every drug store/pharmacy etc. It is a bit like chewing gum, but more dense and hard. You just take a bit from the dental wax, roll it into a ball and stick it to the the places that cause pain to your little girl.

The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth, like others have noted. However, they also have to be cut to fit her mouth— sometimes if the wire is too long, they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain. This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire, bending the tips of the wire, or using dental wax as others have suggested. I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself- it's a few cents to them, free to you, and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter. 


As to why it's metal, there are several other statements that essentially address the issue. The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth, yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire. Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheap—there simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility, cost, etc. Unfortunately, cutting metal leads to sharp edges, unless it's treated with something to smooth out the edge. As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out, they don't do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut.

rule_Britania,"Both UDP and TCP are protocols that sit just above the IP layer. To put this in context you need to look at the OSI stack: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model. But essentially each layer wraps the one above it with some more information such as where it is meant to be going, how big it is etc.

To really understand what is happening here, you need to know at the most basic level what an IP address is and what a port is. So an IP address is your internet facing address. Forgetting lots of clever tricks where people/computers can share IP addresses (c.f. NAT, LAN), every computer has a unique address. But within each computer there are lots of processes running. This is where port numbers come in. The operating system needs to know which process to send the data to, and that is signified by the port number. Now IP has no concept of ports, so you need a protocol on top of that to contain the port information. This is UDP.

So the UDP header literally contains a 'source' port and a 'destination' port. The other two fields which are required are 'length', to tell the computer where this packet ends and the next begins. And a checksum just to add some level of reliability about the port numbers not being corrupt.

So UDP is the most basic way of sending data between processes across a network. TCP adds a LOT of other things such as congestion control, flow control and reliability; all of which UDP doesn't have.

TCP is very concerned about the integrity of the data sent. UDP not so much - as long as it gets there, even if you lose some data on the way, its not that big of a deal.

Think of it like this - you have some data that goes out over the internet. It gets split up into packets 1-20.

With TCP, you have to wait until you get all 1-20 packets - if 19 goes missing, you request it again, until you have it. Then you put 1-20 in order, and voila, there is your data.

With UDP, you can be missing packages 10-15, who gives a shit. I have 1-9 and 16-20, lets put together what we can and ask for the next batch.

TCP is very good when data integrity matters - file transfers, for instance - a missing packet or two can cause data corruption.

UDP is very good when speed matters - video, voice, etc. Losing a few frames to packet loss doesn't matter. What does matter is not wasting time waiting for those lost packets to arrive, or requesting them again. Who cares? Get what data you can, the user is more concerned with the voice/video happening with minimal lag, rather than to be super smooth.

Democrats tend to want the national government to have a larger role in people's lives.

On social issues, they support support gay marriage, women's rights in abortion (pro-choice), and stem cell research. Democrats usually support protection of the environment, and thus are not as open to drilling for oil domestically. They are often seen as the more ""anti-war"" party, but that hasn't always been the case. Democrats will be more likely to cut defense spending.

Republicans are called ""conservatives"" because they mainly support traditional values and beliefs. Republicans normally do not support government involvement in economics, and want the free market to regulate itself. Thus, they often do not support higher taxes on the wealthy, and often believe in flat tax rates for all. They strongly oppose gun control and legislation which limits these rights. In regard to social issues, Republicans often do not support gay marriage, stem cell research, and are often pro-life. Republicans are more willing to drill for oil and natural resources on American soil, even if it means environmental harm. On foreign policy, conservatives support a strong military and will support military action overseas more often than not.

OnionSquire,"When you sleep your body releases a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). What GABA does is effectively paralyze your body, or at the very least, your brains ability to move muscles. This occurs during REM sleep when you're dreaming; it's to prevent you from acting out your dreams, your body expends next to no energy in this state and consumes very little oxygen. This is only one reason why you don't fall off the bed though. REM sleep, when you're actually dreaming, only happens in 90 minuet intervals and only lasts a precious few minutes. So that dream you had where you were skate boarding down a big hill that lasted for hours, only took up a few moments of your actual time. 

There are 5 stages to sleep. N-REM 1, N-REM 2, N-REM 3, N-REM 2 again, and REM. During this cycle, outside of REM, your body and mind are effectively awake. You're not aware of your surroundings, but you're aware enough to know when there's an edge near you, or a predator, and you move away. Incidentally, if you ever get the feeling like you're falling when you're going to sleep, this occurs in N-REM 2 where ""sleep spindles"" happen. A sleep spindle is a sudden massive burst of neural activity that usually jolts a muscle and wakes a person.

If you change bed, say from a double to a single, at first you might roll over and out by accident, because you're used to having more space and your brain hasn't learned the new boundaries yet.

i_accidently_reddit,"To understand this, we need to look at the history of writing in the west.

In the modern day western world, we use the Latin alphabet. The Romans however first wrote in Greek.

But maybe you know, just how much of a chip the Romans had on their shoulder about not being seen as as smart and as cultivated as the Greeks. So while Greek still was lingua franca in the Roman Empire, they got really obsessed with their own culture and language and tried very hard to make Latin the dominant language in the Mediterranean.

And of course, developing a own typography goes a long way in setting the two languages apart. This led to what we now know as the Latin alphabet, excluding J, W and U, and all upper case.

Seeing however, that it is quite tedious to write all those big capital letters all the time, the written language evolved into what is called a uncial script.

All the letters are still majuscules, but the beginning of a sentence or a important wort is capitalized. so essentially its smaller capital letters, if that makes sense?

Now this is were the fun part starts: typographers are a weird bunch of people, they are both artists and geometers. Back then, every written text was basically a piece of art, with the capitalised letters being carefully ornated, trying to reflect the tenor of the writing. And the typographer himself knows how the properties of some letters within the text, impact the whole synthesis of his art work.

And seeing that he has some sort of artistic freedom, he just cant allow a A, H or R to destroy the natural flow of text he is trying to convey.

Fun fact on the side: there are Latin papyri dating back to around the turn of the eras, that include lower case letters for the before mentioned a, h or r.

So from there on, it is basically just years and years (two thousand and counting) of improving on the given letters. And this is still happening, for example the upper case S used to have two lower case letters, "" s  "" and "" ſ "" which we got rid of basically just recently, in the beginning of 20th century. Or the english ""th"" used to be the a rune called thorn and fell out of favour in the middle ages.

so **TL;DR:**
Romans wrote Latin in Greek.

Now repeat that over hundreds of words and all you have are hundreds of different rectangles where the only difference is their letter length. It all comes down to word recognition based on something called ""shape contrast"". 

For example the words ""PENNY"" and ""PENCIL"" are hard to differentiate quickly when they're all caps. However, ""Penny"" and ""Pencil"" are much easier due to the shape contrast of ascenders and descenders.

After van Gogh: [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autumn_Rhythm.jpg) is also considered art.

ELY20 (explain like you're 20):
Before van Gogh, what mattered was the subject. The painting had to look like the object it was supposed to represent. An artist was only good when creating a variation on a subject matter.
After van Gogh, the intent of the artist became more important. The painting no longer had to represent a specific object. Van Gogh is part of a larger move towards abstraction where the final painting is only the end-product of a longer process. The [Starry Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) is a picture of a starry night and the way van Gogh felt before that scene, both at the same time. That is why the psychological aspect is so important in understanding his paintings. It would take the work of other great artists before full abstraction became recognized as a form of art.

TedTschopp,"TL;DR:  Van Gogh is considered good because he tricks you into thinking you are seeing a painting of a flower, when in reality you are looking at abstract brush strokes.

Let's take his [Irises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gogh,_Vincent_van_-_Irises_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) painting.  The reason he is so considered to be so good is that the painting above generates inside of people the impression of seeing a field of Irises while not actually using all the forms and colors of an actual purple [Irises](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BWtpA40ghG4/TaNyV4qcyCI/AAAAAAAAASk/6-5q4Rq2hHY/s1600/purple_irises.jpg).   

To see where this started; painters at one point were basically cameras and someone like Martin Johnson Heade produced a painting called [Birds and flowers](http://www.painting-analysis.com/oiseaux300.jpg).  Then people like Monet started to question this dogma with paintings like [Nympheas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nympheas_71293_3.jpg).  When Van Gogh and other painters at his time came around they pushed these questions harder and with more rigor than those before.  Following Van Gogh people like Picasso pushed this idea even further [Flowers in a Grey Jug and Wine-Glass with Spoon](http://www.artgalleryabc.com/images/stories/P/Picasso/picasso232.JPG).  In all of these images you get the idea and feeling of a flower and that is what an artist does.  Its not their job to reproduce a flower as it is seen.  Their job is to make you -feel- like you saw THE FLOWER.

Silent letters can happen because the way people spoke a word changed and the way it was spelled didn't (if you think about how hard it was, in older times, to make new copies of all the existing books, you can probably appreciate why people didn't make new copies of all their books every time the pronunciation of a word changed).

Or they can happen because two words got shoved together (Wikipedia's example is ""cupboard"", which literally started as ""cup board"", but as one word started to run together until the 'p' was silent).

And so on and so forth; silent letters usually tell us something about the history of the word and the language it appears in, though exactly *what* they tell may require some digging.

As for two-letter combinations (digraphs), commonly it's because there wasn't one letter that exactly had the sound.

'Phone' is a good example: in ancient Greek the letter ɸ (phi) represented a sound that was like 'p', but ""aspirated"" (breathy -- as you make the 'p' sound, also breathe out so that the breath also makes a sound). There wasn't anything in the Latin alphabet corresponding to that sound, so 'ph' was chosen for transcribing Greek words.

But the sound of the Greek ɸ evolved to where, in modern Greek, it's close enough in sound to be interchangeable with the Latin alphabet's 'f'.

Most of that winds up flowing into the Colorado River. The river is dammed near Las Vegas -- Hoover Dam. The city has grown rapidly, and in fact less snow and rain has fallen in recent years than in the past. From this combination, the water levels behind the dam have fallen rapidly.

Further downstream, the same Colorado sends water to San Diego, Imperial Valley (farming the desert in Southern California), and Phoenix (which also has insane farming considering it's in a desert).

As a consequence of all this water diverted for human use, the Colorado River no longer flows to the ocean (it naturally outlets into the Gulf of California, between Baja and the rest of Mexico).

This isn't an allergy, per se--allergies refer to a specific set of reactions (IIRC there are people who actually are allergic, but they are much more rare).  However, these gluten intolerant individuals do have a valid medical reason why they should not eat gluten.

There are also lots of people who are always looking for the latest health trend, though.  These are generally well-meaning people who are misguided.  They typically have a friend of a friend who is gluten intolerant who had some great health benefits from cutting gluten out of their diet, so they figure they ought to take the ""healthy"" step and cut it out from their diet, too!  This has all the logic of you getting transfusions when your friend has lost a lot of blood--getting a transfusion is a good move for them and has valid medical reasons, but it just doesn't make sense for you.

Fairleee,"The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history - it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures, because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing - this universally agreed thing is called a standard. There are a number of different standards, and sometimes we don't have a single one. Consider something like transferring data between devices. The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer, but it isn't the only one - however, because it is so popular, most devices will have a USB port.

In terms of distance, these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do - basically, if we didn't have a standard system of measurement for length, then mass production of components couldn't exist, which would mean that we wouldn't be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform way.

The meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length. This is similar to the celsius system of temperature, which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system. However, the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough, or constant enough, to be fully acceptable. So, part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant. To measure time, a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom - I can't remember details off the top of my head. For distance, the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain (incredibly tiny) period of time.

As for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere, yes, there is! There is a prototype meter (kept in France, I believe), and a number of almost identical (with the tiniest, tiniest variations, and the variations of which are recorded) meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards. So basically, precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter. Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these, and so on, and so on. 

So, a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate, but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing. However, if you are doing a job that requires a very, very, very high degree of accuracy (such as precision engineering), then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration. And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the world.

Some factors that influence this difference include eating and lifestyle habits between men and women, the size of the individual (often times bigger people require more effort from the heart to push blood and thus more fatigue and ware), size and composition of arteries where larger arteries found in men are more susceptible to atherosclerosis, inflammation and blockage. When it comes to symptoms, women posses a much larger tolerance to pain.

Git_Off_Me_Lawn,"On defense you usually have a 4-3 or 3-4 formation.  The first number is the number of players on the line of scrimmage, and the second number is the number of linebackers.

That's seven of our eleven players.  There's generally 2 safeties (defensive backs with special names) to prevent big plays and 2 other defensive backs to defend receivers.  That formation would be fine for a run but terrible for a pass play.

Let's say the offense brings out 3 wide receivers on a fairly obvious pass play.  You can't effectively cover them, the tight end, and the RB who may be coming out of the backfield with just 2 people specifically covering receivers and your linebackers may not be all that good in coverage.  So what you might do in this case is trade one of your front seven players for another DB.  That's called a nickle package because you now have 5 dedicated DBs on the field (your three cornerbacks and two safeties.)  A dime package is trading two of your front seven for extra DBs (two nickles makes a dime).

The difference between zone and man coverage is that man to man coverage has a defensive player specifically assigned to cover a specific offensive player.  With zone coverage the defense is in charge of a specific area on the field and defends anyone who enters their zone.

The pros and cons of man coverage are that you need really good cornerbacks to lean heavily on this type of coverage, but if you have the talent you can completely shutdown an opposing receiver the entire game.  For zone coverage it's pretty good at not giving up big plays because everyone tries to keep the receiver they're covering in front of them, but there's holes in a zone defense that can be read by receivers and QBs to gain yards even if they're not big plays.

Generally both teams get enough time to see personnel groupings and plan around them before the play starts.  If the offense originally called a run up the middle but the defense brought in a bunch of heavy run stopping players, the QB might audible to a play action or quick screen pass.

For example - 1 blade does not work because it'll rip itself apart (imagine spinning a large bucket around yourself while staying on the same spot. the bucket will pull you off your feet). 2 blades fix this problem somewhat but they are not as efficient. 3 blades are great and way more balanced.

Now the size consideration comes mainly from the fact that it's important for you to turn the blades as fast around as possible (to generate electricity) and not how much air you can actually collect. The size and shape of the blades balances between the strengths of the materials, costs of construction and maintenance and power generated.

The Galaxy Nexus simply stopped being supported as Google now has multiple devices to support, it has already supported it for a very long time, long past its prime, and the Galaxy Nexus is no longer a leading developer device.

Why porting Android to a device is a hassle is because it's not as simple as just compiling it against a certain version of the OS. Pretty much all of your time is spent making the kernel work properly with the new version of the OS. This can be hard since some of the code and features are proprietary and require either authorization or custom modifications from the companies that manufacture or design a component (like the GPU or WLAN chipset) for the device to even boot or support a new feature in the OS. Even if somehow all the pieces fall into place, and all the companies submitted brand new code with all the required modifications (or gave their code for Google to modify) it would still require extensive testing and polishing for a general release.

josh4rim,"**Jaw Impact**

A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin around. This quick motion of causes trauma to the brain that knocks the recipient out leaving him unconscious. Points on the jaw that are especially vulnerable to knockouts are the sides of the chin, and where the jaw is attaches to the skull.

**Acceleration and Deceleration**

When the jaw is punched, the head quickly accelerates around. After a fraction of a second, it quickly decelerates as muscles, tendons, and bones prevent the head from spinning any further. The brain inside the skull is floating in fluid. It accelerates slower than the rest of the head. This forces it to crash into the inside of the skull when the head stops.


**Brain Trauma
**
When the brain slams into the inside of the skull, it suffers trauma. It then bounces off the inside of the skull and slams into the opposite side. This causes even more trauma. Depending on the force of the punch, this can happen several times before the brain comes to rest inside the skull.

**Nervous System Response**

The trauma to the brain stimulates an overwhelming number of neurotransmitters to fire at the same time. This essentially overloads the nervous system sending it into a state of temporary paralysis. The person who is hit in the jaw loses consciousness and his muscles relax. The injured person falls to the ground with no memory of being hit.

**Recovery**

A person who is knocked out by a punch to the jaw suffers a severe concussion. It can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes to regain consciousness. It all depends on the severity of the brain trauma. In mild cases, the person who is knocked out can shake off the punch with little more than a headache. In severe cases, brain trauma from a knockout punch to the jaw can cause cerebral bleeding and death.

It's a bad analogy but you get the point I assume.  
This is how brain transplants are possible without damaging someone's brain.  
This isn't the only reason however, as the brain also perceives you getting hit as a threat that you could possibly make worse by acting out of fear or knee-jerk reaction.  
So your brain hits the wall of your skull, decides ""If I'm working too hard while this keeps happening it can cause serious damage so I'm going on standby until I feel safe.""

The result of knockout is in any case a physical reaction where the body physically switches back to survival mode by disabling secondary physical body functions such as seeing, smelling, moving. Sometimes the body already does this to prevent further damage by say assessing and processing any mental or physical (most often sudden) blow to its perception of reality (you can get knock out as shock, no physical blow recieved here), so this can happen as a precaution where physically your body doesn't necessarily needs to shutdown these secondary functions. 

BTW, going more directly into your question, assuming 'trend game' is something like people kneeling down and suddenly stand up to faint; this is like physically draining the oxygen from your head, people sometimes do it by kicking each other in the lungs or stomach too, by suddenly standing up your brain notices decrease of oxygen in bloodflow and shuts down to save the energy for primary function, sort of survival reflex.

PRATFO,"I don't know about any of the explanations that the brain ""shuts down"" for protective reasons, I just don't see the adaptive benefit to this unless you're arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult. This simply is not the case, if anything, the blood flow is increased following impact. This is the basis of second-impact syndrome. When there is concussion, brain function is altered, resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time. Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate. As a result of this dilation, there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edema.

As to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness, I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement. There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal. The details probably aren't worth going into. But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries. This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness, likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants, such as the Moro reflex, which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change. This reflex originates in the pons. 

ELI5: Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem, where the arousal network is. This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed, this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem, this is called the fencing response.

SoWhatIfImChristian,"Just like a lot of the posts here have explained, it has to do with either you brain receiving trauma or damage, an overload of sensors or insufficient oxygen levels reaching the brain. 

Whether it be getting hit on the jaw, being in a car crash, etc, all of this causes a fast acceleration to your head. Your brain is suspended in fluid and there is nothing else that keeps it apart from the skull. When sudden acceleration or deceleration happens, it will cause the brain to smash against the skull. This will cause trauma or damage and result in being ""knocked out.""

Another way can be when your brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters. Whether it be pain, flashing lights (epilepsy), and so on, if the brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters it will overload and shut down for it's own safety. 

In the case of an oxygen deficiency, do people remember the ""game"" where people used to play by choking each other until they pass out? In order for the brain to function, it needs a continuous stream of oxygen being . When oxygen is cut off, it results in cerebral hypoxia. When you get choked either by someone else, a belt, a rope or anything, it cuts off the blood supply to your head. The oxygen is carried through your blood, thus it results in cerebral hypoxia. If this lack of oxygen/blood is cut off long enough, you will die. Even if you don't die, it will possibly result in permanent brain damage. ",null,0,cdo18uy,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,new,1

HDMI Carries a digital signal. The electrical message only needs to be clear enough to transmit two different states. One, or zero. What is a better cable going to do? Make your ones more onesy? Your zeros more zero-ey?

**With HDMI, the signal is either going to be 100% perfect, or it wont show up at all.**

ShingamiOfSmarm,"To reduce it to the 5 year old level, 2 reasons-
First and foremost, Almost all connections used nowadays are digital.  coaxial cable use an analog signal, but that's usually just to carry a digital signal over long distances (IE, to your cable box).
The difference there is analog acts like a wave.  It weakens the further it travels and the worse the medium.     if it gets weak, the end result is fuzzy.
Digital, though, is just 1s and 0s.  Literally. A series of on states and off states.
If that comes through weaker, it's still just 1s and s.  
So, with digital, it's an all or nothing thing, so, signal quality does not matter as much.            
Secondly,  and this one is why people get so about it, is that all those quality enhancements on monster cables? They are complete lies.  Gold plating does nothing to enhance signal, and almost nothing to enhance the connection.  If they used gold the whole way through, it would, but it would also make the cables heavy and far too expensive to be profitable.     
The extra rubber around the outside? it does nothing for the signal.  Just makes the wires more physically durable.    
Those fancy connector heads? all for show.  They do not enhance signal at all.        
In short, monster cable has always lied about why monster cable was better; In modern times, even if they're promises were true, they'd be irrelevant, because the way we send signals does not care about strength much anymore.          
Oh, and the 200 monster cable is not only indistinguishable in quality from a 4 dollar one-

This means that in order for food to get down it, it has to pass over the trachea's opening. If it goes down there, it can obstruct your airway, and you choke (to death is optional).

Normally you don't choke. This is because of a handy flap of tissue at the top back of the trachea, which flops down and covers the opening when you swallow. Most of the time this works and you don't choke, occasionally it doesn't. When it doesn't, the food will undergo one of a few possible outcomes.

It'll usually be expelled by coughing; The lining of the trachea is very sensitive to foreign objects.  For very small particles (or water) it'll pass down into the lungs. Here it will usually be destroyed by macrophages (little cells that absorb stuff, a lot of them hang out in the lungs for just this purpose). Option 3 is that it doesn't come out at all. This may or may not be fatal. For example, bones from meat can lodge in an airway and not actually kill you (although you're at high risk of infection).

afcagroo,"There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.   
   
To broadcast a radio signal, we make an antenna that will resonate at the frequency we want to send. This is done mainly by controlling its length, so that as a wave travels down to the end and bounces back, it does so in a way that provides constructive interference (rather than destructive). The wave in the antenna creates a field that propagates out into space as an electromagnetic wave.  When it hits an antenna of the proper length, it induces a wave in it, and again constructive interference helps to keep it strong enough to be amplified and demodulated.  
  
Electrical current doesn't follow the path of least resistance.  That is an oversimplified saying that is not accurate.  Electrical current follows *all* possible paths, with more current going where there is less resistance.  
  
But in an antenna, there generally isn't a lot of current flow, because there's no place for the current to go. What happens is that the electric *field* propagates down the conductor.

Today, the face of the music is of the performer, because that's what we all can see. It's distributed via TV, radio, and mp3s. We hear the one artist's performance, not one song performed by the local musicians in each town.

maestro2005,"Okay so, nobody here is right.  Not even doovidooves with his 110 upvotes.  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording, and ""classical"" versus ""modern"" isn't the right way to break things down.

First, some terminology.  I'm going to refer to it as ""Classical"" versus ""Popular"".  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music (e.g. Gregorian chant), certain types of Renaissance music (motets, madrigals, etc.), the Baroque period, the Classical period, the Romantic period, and modern periods that we don't quite have the historical context to classify yet.  It continues to be written today.

Popular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created, which today involves the rock combo with guitars, basses, drum sets, keyboards, etc., but includes folk music all the way back.  It actually predates Classical.

Popular music has always been meant to be easily imitable.  In the days before recording, it was meant to be played/sung by amateur musicians in the home, or around the campfire, or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be.  It's simpler music, not that impressive in its composition, so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer.  And usually, there aren't that many performers, which makes it simpler still.

Classical music is not meant to be easily imitated.  The forms are longer and more complicated, and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master.  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits.  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor.  We marvel at the composer's ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece.  We still marvel at the performers, but we marvel more at the composer.  Many people can both write and play Popular music.  Few can play Classical music, and even fewer can write it.

Recording and distribution has changed things a bit.  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular (we do still use that but not exclusively), we can record the world's best Popular musicians and distribute that recording.  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction (see: Metal).

And Classical music has certainly leveraged catchiness to become popular (see: Mozart operas).  So the lines have always been a bit blurry and may have gotten blurrier recently.  But that's the basic distinction.",null,5,cdnlzvj,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,new,39
49ersFaithfulForLife,"Commercialized music is more about marketing an image and selling an identity than it is about the music itself. It's easier to take a good-looking singer, stylize them and build a brand around their face and name, than it is to do with the songwriters who may have a less marketable image. In some cases, especially in hip hop, the producer's name may be well-known and liked enough that they'll make a point to associate it with the album, but this is an exception to the rule.

For the most part, the music industry doesn't want you to be consciously aware of the fact that the majority of the music you hear isn't written by the performers, but by marketers in suits and ties applying a formula fine-tuned to maximize the likelihood they'll get your fifteen dollars for the album. That doesn't look as good. Yeah, most consumers know or have been told this is the case, but it's not something the consciously think about every time they listen to a song.

I also don't intend to imply that all classical music is complex, as a lot of it is compositionally lackluster as an average pop song today.

Although your question specifically asks about the different standard with classical composers and ""modern music,"" I'd like to correct you a bit.  You might be too young to remember the explosion of the singer/songwriter movement of the 1960s/70s.  Prior to then, almost all pop artists just sang/performed other people's songs.  As artists like Buddy Holly, to the Beatles came around...audiences discovered the unique profundity when an artist performed their own work.  Bob Dylan was the first major artist to really cross this bridge--a number of artists popularized his work (e.g. Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--Blowin' in the Wind, The Byrds--Mr Tambourine Man, Jimi Hendrix--All Along the Watchtower) but there was no mistaking how powerful an artist Dylan was once you heard him (with all this non-commercial idiosyncrasies) perform his own compositions.

What you're talking about mostly happens, I think, in [""Popular"" Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music) (I hate that term) and Jazz, where bands often cooperate in composing and performing their own music. For example, take the whole of the Beatles catalogue. The vast majority of the songs will be John+Paul compositions.

So when you do have stuff that's not actually written by the performer, it's really not that well known.

It's worth noting that this isn't always a black and white distinction. Look at famous Louis Armstrong songs.

It's simple, the composer of the classical piece is of course the one to have his name associated with the piece, he/she wrote it. 

The popular artist may not have written the song, but they are performing it, they are the artist and it is on their album. It *does* say on albums who wrote the song. But you know it by the artist who performed it and it appears on their album. For example, it wouldn't make sense to say, ""Thriller"" by Rod Temperton, because it was ""made popular"" by Michael Jackson. Thriller is a part of Michael Jackson's catalogue because it was written specifically ""for him."" He performed it on his album. 

Imagine saying, I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Burt Bacharach. That doesn't make very much sense, but ""I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Dionne Warwick makes sense because she is the performer. Stating the composer tells nothing about the particular version of the song for popular music, where on the other hand: I 'm going to listen to ""Moonlight Sonata"" the performer is not as important because each version will be the exact same rendition of the piece written by Beethoven, who also made it popular. 

It doesn't have anything to do with the times being different or money, orchestral music is still composed today, but it's the composer's piece, therefore his name is on it.

Classical music has no lyrics, and therefore the only person who stands out is the conductor (someone who doesn't actually play or write the music, rather, interpenetrates between the two).

Granite_Maggie,"The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise. Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.

Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.

Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.",null,21,cdnb1pa,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,new,66

""Among the many potential environmental triggers for T1D, diet has been considered a significant contributing factor [7], [22]. Of the various dietary factors, gluten warrants special mention because epidemiological data suggest that early exposure of infants to cereals containing gluten may increase the risk of T1D.  Rodent studies have supported this claim [24]. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how dietary gluten could facilitate the development of T1D. In the current study, we explored whether alterations in the gut microflora could potentially explain the pro-diabetogenic properties of dietary gluten.""


Celiac is a life threatening response to gluten.  However there isn't much science investigating the responses that aren't as pressing.  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance, which is characterized by a host of symptoms including ""bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain. It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo, among many others."" (from the wiki for gluten sensitivity).  ""Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food."" (from the celiac wiki) The response to gluten obviously falls somewhere on a spectrum, while a lot of the symptoms and pathology of those with celiac and gluten intolerance are the same.

To address your question.. Why do people go on a gluten free diet?  Well, there is obviously a pile of evidence indicating that its consumption correlates with a host of negative health outcomes.  To which part of that pile any one person pays attention may vary, and they may only have heard that such research exists and not done any investigation personally.  But nonetheless, often times the best way to determine if a dietary intervention will benefit you, is to implement it on a personal level and see what happens.

Just like a vaccine, when you have antibodies against something your body sees as harmful, they stick around as your soldiers and fight for you for a long time. If you got fat/sick/unhealthy while simultaneously eating a bunch of gluten, your ""soldiers"" don't want you to go back or continue down that dangerous road and fight for you anytime they see gluten.

The theory is that autistic children have a hyper-sensitivity to foods containing gluten and that they process peptides and protiens differently than other people do. The idea behind the use of the diet is to reduce the symptoms that come with autism.

So..there's tons of studies for this, and tons against it.  I dont work with autisic kids but my son is autistic and we do things with the autism society here in my town, so i know MANY special needs kids and their parents that are advocates of this theory, and say it helps.

I'd attribute the boom in gluten free products to this theory coupled with the rise of kids with autism, awareness of celiac, and health nuts in general.

Apparently due to the creation of genetically modified crops of wheat to make the wheat more resistant to pests and the fact that this heartier strain of wheat has essentially spread everywhere it is the only wheat available. Hence you're hearing about more people who can't properly digest what was a staple food for thousands of years. Though gluten is in other things such as rye, oats, and maltodextrin (which may be a wheat product) so I'm not terribly sure how those fit into the hearty wheat theory.

One caveat however is that if you do not replace wheat bread and other gluten products with a comparable gluten free product (which are often higher in calories and sugar) then the likelyhood is that you will have actually entered into a low/lower carb diet than you were eating previously and maybe even a lower calorie diet purely because you are avoiding foods with gluten and haven't replaced them with something else. Low carb diets do have a great track record for weight loss. Whether it is a healthy method or not is a matter of some debate.

On the flip side, the gluten free diet (as in what you eat to live and sustain yourself long term) is imperative for people with Celiacs who are directly allergic to it, and some other conditions like crohns which are deeply irritated by the gluten protein, and it can also be beneficial for those who have or suspect they may have other digestive sensitivities as they work with their doctor to eliminate possible causes.

In no case is purchasing a gluten free product a necessity for eating gluten free as the number of foods that are naturally gluten free is enormous, but it does make the transition easier for some.

Enchanted_Bunny,"Too many people think ""survival of the fittest"" means ""survival of the most physically fit"" or ""survival of the biggest, baddest, and meanest.""  In reality, being ""fit"" means that you are able to survive, that you ""fit"" into you environment. 

Human beings are far from the most physically powerful animals. A human living alone in the wild is putting himself at great risk and has a statistically lower chance of surviving. So, our evolutionary survival strategy is cooperation. One human in the wild might be weak, but 150 humans? The chances of survival drastically increase. Throughout history we have seen countless examples of the society that cooperates more out competing societies that focus on the individual. It's how the Romans were able to defeat the Gauls so easily. A single roman soldier couldn't hope to defeat a single Gaul warrior. But put two or more of those discipined Romans together, and something happens.  They become stronger than two individuals. They become a synergy: where the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Thus, the people who have a natural inclination to cooperate with each other are more likely to survive and pass those traits to their offspring. Now to your question. 

In order to survive and thrive, a stable home is needed. Our ancestors survived due to a stable home and family unit. The desire for a stable and lasting home was passed down to us. Nowadays it doesn't matter as much but for most of history having a permanent and stable home was crucial to your development.

Rain is water vapor in the form of a cloud condensing and becoming either a liquid (rain) or a solid (snow, ice that will melt on its way down and become rain). Water vapor prefers to have a surface to condense onto, such as dust or smoke or other water droplets.

You see a cloud full of water vapor coming on your radar, which these guys sell. You send up your plane. The plane releases smoke into the cloud a bit before it passes overhead and the water vapor in the clouds starts condensing and becoming rain.

MistaSchlong,"Ok, so you know about digital devices.  Think about a binary switch: something that just turns on and off.  That's what a neuron does: it just turns on and off.  At the end of a neuron, there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too.  These signals are made of molecules, and we call these molecules neurotransmitters.  We won't need to talk about these neurotransmitters, but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them, they're really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn on.

OK, your brain is made of neurons.  (It's also made of other types of cells, but the most simple, straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail.)  ""Knowledge,"" is stored in these neurons.  Now, because a neuron can only, essentially, turn on and off, the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easier.

Making the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms.  You can make the neuron more ""sensitive"" to neurotransmitters.  (This can, for instance, happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor.)  Likewise, you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing ""sensitivity"" to neurotransmitters.

Note: you may have heard of the term Action Potential.  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns on.

Now, knowing that a neuron can turn on and off, and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off, I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar.  Chords are made up of notes, and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings.  Basically turning them on or keeping them off.

However, and this is the key, with just a few chords, you can play millions of different songs.  It's just about how the chords are played; the timing, the tempo, the coordination.  Similarly, the firing of neurons, on and off, in combination, generates recall of stored knowledge.  And knowledge is stored in how easily or difficult these neurons are fired on and off.",null,0,cdnep8v,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,new,3

airor,"The memories are stored in the pattern of sequences your neurons fire throughout your brain.  

A single neuron will tend to fire at a rate determined by the neurons attached to it, so groups (cortical columns) of neurons tend to fire at the same time and at a steady rate.  This rate can be influenced by other groups of neurons firing at nearly the same rate such that the two groups start to synchronize.  Patterns form as the different rates compete for synchronization throughout your brain.  

Some of your neurons are directly connected and influenced by sensory input and tend to sync to that input.  Due to the feedback of all the other neuron groups the input can be predicted: the pattern is recognized and other groups start performing the pattern that is the expected future sequence of input.  The brain is built to allow for many layers of this pattern recognition dance, each layer ""predicting"" the future output by simply repeating the patterns that occurred the previous times it received that input.

When the pattern is 'confirmed' and the input really does follow the expectation, the two groups stay in synchronization and new connections are made to strengthen that pattern.  When dissonance occurs and the input does not match with a group, the connections to that group weaken.  So in effect your brain evolves the connections between neuron groups that correctly predict the future.

How is that a stored memory?  There are areas of your brain that can 'fake' sensory input into the system and let it perform it's dance.  This ability gives us the power to imagine situations and remember previous input.  The feedback and the flurry of patterns that emerge as we 'think' is horrendously complex and not well understood because we can't reproduce how it actually works.  But in principle it is the fact that certain areas of our brain react to internal input 'simulated' inside our minds that give us our self awareness and memory.",null,0,cdnismc,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,new,2

Perhaps someone can elaborate on this). ",null,0,cdna1yw,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,new,9
DeweyCheatemHowe,"The expense comes from legal fees and expert fees. 

Once the state declares it's intention to seek the death penalty, a defendant will automatically be appointed not only an attorney (assuming he's indigent), but probably a couple attorneys as well as a mitigation investigator. That person will go back to the defendants roots and dug up everything they can from the persons life that would help sway a jury to recommend life. There will likely be a sanity commission to determine whether he is competent to stand trial, consisting of several doctors. 

The state is also hiring experts, and will be spending extra man hours to ensure everything goes exactly right so a later court has no reason to reverse. Same thing goes for the trial court. 

So all that happens before trial. Day one of trial starts an exhausting version of the standard jury selection. Before the normal process starts, each juror may need to be media qualified (have they been biased by prior coverage of the case), and will need to be death qualified (whether they could vote for death under some set if facts or are they too against the death penalty to consider). Only then can the attorneys start regular jury selection. 

Trial will probably run 1-2 weeks. If guilty, then the jury comes back and hears testimony about the mitigating an aggravating factors (this is where that investigators work becomes relevant). Then they will vote on life/death. 

If death, (at least in my state) the defendant gets an auto appeal to the state Supreme Court. He will be appointed a different attorney for this, who will have to learn the case, go through the whole deal. Defendant argues anything and everything that he says went wrong from the moment the crime happened. 

If affirmed, he can petition the US Supreme Court to hear his case. Unlikely here. Then he starts state post conviction. New attorney, goes back to arguing constitutional challenges in the same court he was convicted. If affirmed, back to state Supreme Court and the petitioning the US Supremes.

 If he hasn't managed a new trial yet, he will file a petition for habeas corpus in fed district court, again arguing constitutional issues. If affirmed, he can go to the appellate court, and then petition the US Supreme Ct again. 

Only when the supremes deny his petition or affirm does his conviction become ""final."" Meanwhile, this whole time he's been housed in an ultra secure area of the prison by himself, rather than in the GP. 

Every appeal (except US Supreme Ct and maybe US Appeals) are of right. He gets them regardless, and taxpayers are paying his attorneys and fees (think of all the copies, for instance). If any court finds a a significant error, process restarts. Also, it's in the defendants best interest to fight to delay all of these, waiting for new rulings, new facts, or just more days on earth. 

Most defendants will then file some sort of 1983 claim alleging that the method of execution is unconstitutional. Usually some interest group pays his fees here, but the people still pay the state and the federal judge that'll hear it.

Brelya,"The death penalty in most states results in a bifurcated trial where the same jury (most of the time) sit through two ""trials"". The first is the guilt phase where they decided whether to convict a person.  The second is the penalty phase where the State and defense counsel each present relevant evidence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances so that finally the jury may decide whether that particular defendant should get the death penalty.

Defense counsel should invest a lot of time in looking for mitigating information prior to the case even going to trial because if convincing enough and if in the right place, the State may waive seeking the death penalty.

In some states the decision to impose death is then automatically reviewed by the State's supreme court for a proportionality review. They decide whether this person truly deserves the penalty in light of every other defendant that has received it.

During this time, appeals and post-conviction motions run wild. The defendant can assert many claims such as : ineffective assistance of counsel, unfair trial, etc. There are many avenues to have not only state courts but federal courts to review the case and claims the defendant might have. In every instance the State most likely will defend their position.

The prosecution (State) is financed by the state government and where the defendant is being represented by public defenders, that is also financed by the state government.

benofepmn,"After a lengthy jury trial with two phases, one for guilt and one for punishment, that results in a death sentence, the defendant has a lot of due process rights to exhaust before he can get executed. First, is a direct appeal to the state's high court. After the conviction is affirmed, the defendant can then ask for postconviction relief such as a writ of habeas corpus. When that is denied, he can appeal. If the denial is affirmed on appeal, his state remedies are exhausted, but he still can't get executed. 

Now, he can go to federal court and ask for habeas corpus relief. When that is denied, he can appeal. Then he can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. When they choose not to hear the case, the defendant often tries desperate measures such as contesting the method of execution or claiming that there is newly discovered evidence that warrants a new trial.

All these appeals and due process take time. Transcripts of proceedings need to be ordered and created. Briefs need to be researched and written. Oral arguments are heard. The courts' written decisions need to be researched and written. This results in these appeals taking years.

An innocent person who was sentenced to life in prison could come out twenty years later when DNA evidence shows they were innocent, or the guilty party comes forward, or they could successfully appeal. That's not *ideal*, of course, but the point is it's not irreversible, where the death penalty is. If someone's been sentenced to death, you want to get all your appealing done *before* the sentence is carried out, and you have to delay it for as long as possible to ensure no one is going to come forward with new evidence that could potentially re-open the case, and also you *want* to delay it for as long as possible - you're going to demand every single appeal and retrial and whatever you can because at the end of all that you're going to die. You're going to be the biggest pain in the arse you possibly could.

Add to this the fact that the death penalty isn't legal in most countries, and in the ones that it is which are also a functioning democracy (the US) it's only legal in a handful of places. Say you commit your crime in Texas and flee to the UK, even if you're arrested in the UK you've got to be extradited back to Texas with is an extremely lengthy and therefore expensive process. The touchy nature of the subject is a real hindrance, since lots of countries believe the death penalty is immoral and may refuse to extradite someone if they believe they would face execution, in the same way they do for potential torture victims.

Also, ""life in prison"" is not always *life* in prison. Where I'm from, ""life in prison"" more often means 25-30 years although you can be sentenced to a ""whole life order"", which means there's no possibility of parole. It can easily take fifteen, twenty, thirty years on death row before the actual execution, maybe even more. So although the cost of an execution itself is pretty low, you're already adding that to what's essentially a life sentence, and that's before you take into account the cost of thirty year's worth of legal work.

Once this happened, the Soviet Union saw a great opportunity for an ally: a communist nation led by a widely popular and charismatic leader (Fidel Castro) on the front doorstep of your arch-nemesis.

The missiles in Turkey were widely believed to be pointed at the heart of Soviet Russia, as Turkey is in a strategically valuable spot for doing so with ICBMs. The Soviets needed a counterbalance to this, and they saw it in the form of Cuba. 

What went down in a nutshell is that the U.S. noticed these huge missiles 90 miles from their coast, and through diplomatic maneuvering (and a naval blockade of Cuba) by President Kennedy and his entourage, convinced the Soviets to back off and remove the missiles in exchange for the missiles in Turkey being removed (they were later replaced by nuclear submarines anyways). No one wanted a nuclear war, despite the large amount of dick measuring that went on in the Cold War.


I'm not exactly sure what you mean in how the Cuban Missile Crisis connected into Vietnam. Vietnam was a completely different situation, and *official* involvement did not start until 1964, two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis. While the latter was more of a direct threat to America itself, Vietnam was somewhat more of a political gamble to stop the spread of communism, as had been done in Korea (though only halfway). As far as I know, Fidel in Cuba had little interest in Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh was more concerned with reuniting his country, though I'm sure they would have rooted for each other.",null,0,cdnbvj8,1rhek9,explainlikeimfive,new,4

1 Which countries were involved in the deal?
: The permanent members of the UN's Security Council - US, UK, Russia, China and France. And IRAN.



2 Why is IRAN seen as a threat?
: The middle east is a messy and volatile place and situations may flare up almost immediately. Besides, the IRAN government was overthrown by Islamic fundamentals before and so the UN is apprehensive that it may happen again.



3 What has the deal achieved?
: It is actually a six month agreement before the deal is finalized. It has ensured that IRAN may proceed developing nuclear refining for energy production and prevents it from developing weapons. The trade sanctions have been lifted until the final deal is drafted after six months.

In return Iran gets billions in ""aid"" money and lifting some sanctions the international community has placed on them, mostly because they were developing nukes. They bought Iran off.

Italy, by comparison, was full of old cities with narrow streets. Their economy was hurting because they had to recover from being on the losing side of WW2.  Scooters are small, inexpensive and take a fraction of the gas that a full-sized automobile does.

2) Infrastructure - Italy is old. Very old. The road system was built up on the assumption that most people would be on foot or a donkey, so in many places (especially smaller villages out in the country), there are streets a car can't even get down. 

And in the cities, as the population grew and more people bought cars, the traffic became (and still is) terrible. A scooter can scoot (naturally) through traffic jams, down unpassable back alleys, pedestrian-only streets, etc. 

And, last but certainly not least:

3) You don't need a real driver's license.

PKMKII,"Assuming you're just talking about the filming process itself, and not things like DVDs, advertisements, merchandise, there's three main stages to film production. Appropriately enough, they are called pre-production, production and post-production.

Pre-production is when they set things up so that the actual filming goes smoothly. This usually means things like storyboarding (rough drawings of how scenes are expected to look), getting an production office set up, and hiring crew for the film.

Production is when the film itself is being shot. This is both scenes shot on location, and on sets.

Post-production is the last stage. This is when things like the films background music gets added and mixed, some lines that weren't clear in the filming get re-recorded (and sometimes added entirely with off-screen characters, or characters whose mouths aren't visible at the time). This is also when things like special effects and computer graphics get added. There's also more simple stuff, like editing the film.",null,0,cdn9hw4,1rh9u2,explainlikeimfive,new,1
jayman419,"There's a lot of variation in how a movie gets made. Here's one general example of how it could happen.

For starters, Spielberg doesn't always write his own stuff. So the first thing he does is look for inspiration. Then he gets together with a writer to come up with a treatment. He takes the treatment to the studios and tries to sell it.

Assuming the studios want it, they'll ""greenlight"" it ... that is, draw up contracts, assign a budget, and agree on certain dates (like start of production, completion of principle photography, target release date, ect). They'll usually have ""notes"" or suggestions, like asking him to work with a particular writer or using the film as a vehicle for a star they have under a multi-film contract.

Once the contracts are signed, pre-production starts. This is where the script gets hashed out completely. At the same time, people are sent out to scout locations. Sometimes they plan of filming on location, other times they just take pictures to build the sets somewhere else. They start working on wardrobe concepts and set dressings and all that jazz.

Once the script is pretty close to finished, Spielberg give his shortlist for actors to the casting agent, and they see if any are available. If not, they move down the list and/or hold open casting sessions. Meanwhile, he starts storyboarding the script and comparing it to the location info that his team gathered up.

Once the actors are set, they agree on a date to start working, and then begin actually building all the sets and securing the rights to film in the locations they've chosen. They also hire a studio to start early work on special effects, like the big space battle and the alien ships or whatever.

They will bring the actors in for costume fittings, promotional shots, and script readings. They might walk through the sets and talk about the scenes that will go on there, and spend a little time getting to know areas that they're supposed to be familiar with.

The big day comes. They have the sets looking just the way they want, the actors are in their trailers, the script is good and the actors are satisfied, craft services have snacks out for everyone, the lighting department has everything perfect, the camera crew are set, it's the start of principle photography.

This is the easy part. You have a list of shots that need to be completed. They're usually organized for convenience, rather than the order they'll appear on the screen. Like if you have three scenes in a particular house that all take place at different times in the movie, they'll all be filmed in the same general time-frame, with wardrobe and lighting and set changes as necessary.

There's also a second and sometimes a third team of actors and directors working on things like tracking shots (where you can't see the actors close enough to notice it's really their stunt double) and insert shots (like a close-up of Batman grabbing something off his utility belt) where it doesn't really matter whose hand it is.

Once all the shots are ""in the can"" they move on to editing all the footage together into a film. The actors are free to go work on other projects. Now Spielberg is in a little room with his editor, a screen, and a tool for cutting and splicing film. They look for the best takes, and the best lengths for each scene. It's usually around this time that scoring and special effects work begins. (Some bigger FX-heavy movies, they send the scenes for special effects as soon as they have the actor's parts shot, instead of dumping the whole film on them at once.)


So he has FX shots coming in on a regular basis, he has the composer coming in to look at scenes and get a feel for things, and then returning with music, which he adds to the scenes. If necessary, he'll bring the actors back to shoot new scenes or record new dialogue. Maybe the wind was muffling the mic, maybe he decided he needs a scene where someone else builds a mashed potato mountain, stuff like that.

Once he has the cut he likes, he shows it to the studio. The contract will determine who has the final say in the film's edit. Spielberg has a lot of clout, so he generally will get his own way. Some films go to test at this point, where they bring in an audience and gauge their reaction. This might result in new edits or other changes, and it can also take them back to reshooting scenes again if necessary.

Once the studio, the audience, the director, the producer, the editor, the composer, and everyone else is happy, they create a master print of the finished product. This is usually the version of the film that gets screened at festivals and such. 

Around this time is when director and actor commentary gets recorded, usually at some festival or other promotional event.

Then the studio takes the master and uses it to print the copies that get sent out to theaters. This is generally about the time TV advertising starts. The promo shots were probably already released, but they'll use some of those to make posters and print ads and whatnot. 

The studio has a deal with theater chains, where they get a certain cut of ticket sales (on a sliding scale, the more recent the film, the higher the cut the studio takes). They send out the films, the people pour in, they buy lots of popcorn and snacks that the theaters actually use to stay in business, and the reviews start.

Meanwhile they use a copy of the master to get the DVD/Bluray production going. They slap in the commentary and other special features and schedule a release date.",null,0,cdn9iwx,1rh9u2,explainlikeimfive,new,1

If air never moved anywhere and stayed in the same place all the time, then airspeed and groundspeed would be the same thing. However, air also moves! We all know that. We call it wind! The airplane is a part of the air mass in the same way that a fish is a part of the water mass.

So if our airplane (a sky-fish!) in the air is flying north at 50mph through the air, and the air itself is moving 10mph *south* relative to the earth, then we have two speeds happening to our aircraft. We are going north at 50mph through air, but only 40mph over the ground, because the air itself is pulling us back as we move forward!

Groundspeed allows us to calculate how long it will take us to arrive at a given destination, and is particularly important so we can make calculations for fuel consumption. Our airspeed is important because the plane will behave differently in the air depending on its speed. Too fast and we could stress or damage the airframe. Too slow and we risk losing lift and ""stalling"", which is basically falling out of the sky (don't worry, we can recover from those easily!).",null,1,cdn8ayt,1rh898,explainlikeimfive,new,9

justthisoncenomore,"There are two reasons why moving things ""with your mind"" without assistance, some kind of augmentation, or a physical connection is ""impossible"".

1.) There is no mechanism.  In order for something to move, some kind of force has to act on it.  Visualizing something moving doesn't itself create a force, and there's no known way, other than moving your arms/legs/robotic prosthesis, or ordering someone to move theirs, to jump that gap.  

2.) It takes energy.  Even if you had a mechanism, unless you're violating the conservation of energy, you'd need to somehow transfer energy to the object to be moved/manipulated. This might seem trivial if it's just moving a pencil, but if you want to be able to lift a 200 lbs person, or a 10,000 lbs boulder, you'd need to expend at least the number of calories that would be required to move it through normal action.

1) The military has recently withdrawn en masse out of two different wars. In the past often a military would simply leave behind the arms and make news ones because its cheaper than shipping them back, refurbishing them, and re-equipping their force with old weapons. However, US has gotten in trouble over the last few decades arming local forces with hand-me-downs. Also, equipment now is so sophisticated handing it over to a locally implemented tribal police force with little knowledge of technology and zero skills in supply-chain to maintain it would be useless. But they still try. This doc explains that situation pretty good as it unfolds in Afghanistan. 
http://www.vice.com/en_ca/vice-news/this-is-what-winning-looks-like-part-1       
So in the end its just easier to ship it all back, and practically give it away to police departments for them to store and maintain, as the arms industry will only continue to pump out new models and its cheaper to keep the plants running then shut them down during peace time. 

2)The far out, tin-foil wearing, don't trust the man reason for Queensbury, NY buying this ""  http://hosted.ap.org/photos/2/2a149782-fd92-4dfd-9a24-8eed63182933-big.jpg "" is an increased sense of anxiety within local governments over large scale destabilizing events. 9/11, The London bombings, and the Boston bombings coupled with the possibility of climate change causing issues of scarcity (a topic major nations think-tanks have been considering for awhile).

pythonpoole,"Cell phone plans can either be on-contract or off-contract (also known as 'pay as you go', 'month to month', etc.).

With an on-contract plan: you must agree to sign-up for the plan for a specified length period of time (e.g. 2 years). If you try to cancel the plan early, you may be charged a very large penalty fee for terminating the contract and/or may be required to give the phone back. With on-contract plans, the phone cost is subsidized by the plan cost (so you get the phone for much cheaper [sometimes even free], but you pay a higher monthly bill and must agree to a term contract).

With an off-contract plan: you typically own the phone, you pay on a monthly basis and can cancel at any time without penalty. Since you typically have to buy the phone outright if you choose an off-contract plan, it means you will have to pay much more for the phone (many smart phones cost over $500!).

The next distinction is between Voice and Data plans. The voice plan is what allows you to make calls and send text messages. The data plan is what allows you to access websites, email, and use Internet-based apps on your phone. If you have a smartphone without a data plan, you will not be able to use even basic apps for your phone because any app that gets data from the Internet (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) will be non-functional. So basically you need both a Voice Plan and a Data Plan. 

Most mobile phone companies offer combined/hybrid plans that come with both voice and data, but some companies make a clearer distinction between the two by making you choose a voice plan and then picking how much data you want added to the voice plan. Some companies also offer shared plans where you and family or friends can share the same data plan (for example) but maintain separate voice plans.

Note that data plans are measured by how many megabytes (or gigabytes) of network/Internet data you can transfer over the cellular network per month. If you exceed that amount, you will be cut-off or charged enormous overage fees (so be sure to choose a data plan that fits with how much Internet usage you require). Note that data transferred over Wi-Fi does not count towards your monthly data limit, so you can use as much Wi-Fi service at home (or at schools/businesses that offer Wi-Fi) as you want without incurring overage fees.

Yes, Canadian cell phone bills are much more expensive than those of other countries (e.g. European countries) for a few reasons. One reason is lack of serious competition in the marketplace, but another major reason is that the telephone system works differently in North America as compared to the rest of the world. Specifically, in North America, it's up to the cell phone account holder to pay for incoming calls whereas in other countries it is up to the calling party to pay (a premium rate) for calls to cell phones. So basically the cost of North American cell phone plans in general is more than other countries because they have to include the additional cost of incoming air-time.

Also, Canada (or maybe just BC) have made it illegal to charge cancellation fees! It used to cost $400+ to cancel early, but now most companies use a Tab or incorporate your phone costs into the ill (if its on a 2yr term) for example...a phone valued at $240, over 24 months...they will subtract $10/month off what you owe one the phone, so if you cancel early you just pay what is remaining on your phone balance.
Regarding what someone else mentioned about voice and data...it could be that you CAN use data without having it n your plan, but don't be surprised if you get a bill for $200.

Many Ukranians see entry into the EU as a step forward in economy, job creation, mobility, development, etc.  This is because several postsoviet states, including the baltic states and Poland, have experienced growth and prosperity over the past couple decades because of the EU.  Things like increased foreign investment to develop infrastructure and create jobs and better chances for emigration would directly affect the standard of living for the individual.

Ukraine is a major postsoviet state.  It is contiguous with russia.  Russia is attempting to create a regional organization cum economic bloc comparative with the EU to compete with it and increase its influence.  However, being part of this is not well thought of in Ukraine, well, in most postsoviet states because Russians, who dominated the soviet governments, badly mismanaged nationalisms and resource distribution under the soviet system.  For non-russians, the soviet system was, in a simplified analogy, simply a new imperialism.  As well, Western Europe has more capital for investment and more opportunities to offer.

If Russia cannot convince the Ukraine to join its regional organization, it basically means the organization will be geographically fragmented and, well, not very sensible.  Russian politicians have put political pressure on the Ukraine to join their bloc rather than the EU by threatening to renegotiate their gas sales, which the Ukrainian energy infrastructure is dependent upon.

Pros - It's open source. People can change the code however they want. So you get a lot of different options in terms of how your desktop works.

As the link you give points out, an itch can be caused by a very small stimulus, while eczema can affect large areas of skin, which seems to make the two different.

However, eczema is an irritation of the skin that is usually more minor than that which would cause pain. The explanation of itches that you link to emphasized the size of the thing causing the itch (or rather the number of pain receptors being affected), but the important thing is that the pain receptors can be stimulated not only by small *things* but also to a small *degree* over a larger area (as is the case with eczema). More generally, itches result from an irritation of the skin, and the dryness, crustiness, and inflammation of eczema are a type of irritation, so they cause itches too.

Interestingly, the things that cause itching for people with eczema (dryness, irritation, flaking) can also cause pain if they get severe enough -- very dry skin can crack and bleed, showing that an increase in the *intensity* of irritation makes the difference between an itch and pain.",null,0,cdn66d9,1rh0q9,explainlikeimfive,new,3

ManShapedReplicator,"It's a bit hard to explain this without talking about some neurotransmitters and portions of the brain, but the most important part is what these neurotransmitters *do*, so don't worry about memorizing the names or anything.

Alcohol:

1. Increases effects of *GABA*, causing sluggish movements and slurred speech.
2. Inhibits *glutamate*, causing more of this sluggishness and ""slowdown"" effect.
3. Increases the amount of *dopamine* in the brain's reward center, which makes you feel generally good and happy.
4. *Dopamine* also increases confidence and sociability.

Marijuana:

*THC* (the primary active chemical in marijuana) fits directly into ""slots"" in your brain called *cannabinoid receptors* in a number of places. The different effects of marijuana are caused by THC flooding into different parts of the brain, including:

1. The ""reward center"", making you feel good and happy
2. The *hippocampus*, causing relaxation and decrease in stress, and impairing memory
3. The *cerebral cortex*, impairing higher cognitive functions
4. The *basal ganglia*, causing interference with with movement control
5. The *cerebellum*, interfering with bodily coordination

So we can see that there are some similarities between the effects alcohol and marijuana, in that they both stimulate the brain's reward center to make you feel good, and they both interfere with coordination and movement to a degree. However, marijuana does not cause the same type of sluggishness and slowing down as alcohol, since it is stimulating different receptors (different ""slots"") in the brain.

Britain wanted to get in on Australia, well, probably just because it was near the Dutch Indies, major spice exporters, an incredibly important piece of the economy of the era.

The natives were never a particularly significant political or military force.  Colonists never really had a protracted war for territory against them, like in the Americas or say India.  Many died from disease, and, because they weren't very powerful, colonists had little respect for their sovereignty.  Like indians in the US, they played a fairly small role in the formation of an Australian state.  

After world war 2, britain was absolutely bankrupt, and it became popular to decry colonialism as a morally corrupt system, so there was little reason or capital to keep administering Australia as a colony.

buds4hugs,"32-bit processors can process 32-bits of data at one time, while 64-bit processors can process 64-bits at a time. Imagine a 32 lane highway versus a 64 lane highway where each car is lined up in every column, and spaced out evenly in every lane, going the same speed. On the 32 lane highway, only 32 cars could cross a single point at a time.

A difference in speeds between one 32-bit CPU and another can come down to how fast they run. Given the example, this would be how fast the cars are driving. If the highway was 60 mph, the volume of cars crossing the line per second would be less than that of an 80 mph highway.

HungLikeAVillain,"They move 64 bits of data at a time, instead of 32 bits, and generally have 64 bit addressing, too, making them capable of (more easily) accessing more than 4GB of RAM, without some kind of paging scheme.

There are many kinds of CPU.  Hopefully a better understanding of what makes them 'tick' (literally) will help.

We also see wider, faster buses, where you might even be doing 256 bits of DMA (direct memory access) transfer at a time, such as from main RAM to a GPU's RAM, or to a CPU's internal cache.  Of course, these DMA operations tend to grab several values, consecutively, so you only have to 'ask' 1/4 as often for the the common case of needing several things, next to each other.  Of course, all of this super-parallelism has a cost.  Driving this communication takes power.  The noise these things make in the electromagnetic spectrum can be a big problem.  The longer the parallel traces on your board, the more they act like inductors, and capacitors under various conditions, and they start to interfere with each other at the high frequency 'clocks' that CPUs want.  So you see short traces, and short distances between CPU, RAM, etc.

A single-core 128 bit CPU would probably take up as much space on a chip as at least two, and possible up to three 64 bit cores, and lots of 32 bit cores, and consume a lot more power for every 'clock'.  It would also 'suck' for gaming, simulations, and multimedia, versus having more cores.  Making room for more CPU and GPU cores on the same chip is a better use of space, power and speed, for most consumer applications.

To add 64 bits with the ALU (arithmetic logic unit), a 32 bit CPU must do two add operations, the first being an 'add with carry'.  It also has to load that 64 bit value from RAM in two parts, instead of one, and store them in two parts.  However, the 32 bit CPU doesn't need as many conductors (and pins) to interface with the outside world, to do it.  Each of these operations can be thought of as a 'clock tick', or 'clock' of the CPU.

A 'clock' can be understood by what happens in 'microcode', within a CPU.  A CPU breaks every operation down into many simpler operations.  Each of these operations map to a 'bit' of microcode.  Like paper on an antique player piano can cause one or more keys to press at the same time, every row.

So one bit would set the address bus to a value, one bit would gate a value from the data bus (A 'bus' is a set of conductors, in parallel.  A 64 bit CPU might have a 256 bit data bus, and a 48 bit address bus, or other oddities like that.  An 8 bit data bus has eight conductors.  A serial one has two (data + ground), though many have more (e.g. 'clock', device detection, additional serial 'channels)) into register 8, identified by several bits, one bit tell the ALU to add values of register 8 to register 7, and post the result in register 0... lots and lots of bits.  Several of these operations can be done at once.  

Such as, assuming we have an instruction to ADD R8 to SP[0], and a simple CPU of old...

1. Load address register with SP, clear the write flag, gate data register to ALU 0, Gate R8 to ALU 1, increment microcode address

2. Wait state for RAM access, increment microcode address

3. ALU ADD (flags set as side effect), increment microcode address

4. Move ALU result to R0, increment microcode address

5. Fetch next CPU instruction (which breaks down into the data fetch, set the microcode address, etc.)

And so on, the one 'instruction' breaks down into many simpler instructions that are akin to throwing switches, that cause things to happen, according to a long, parallel string of bits from the microcode ROM.  

More bits wide means more stuff to 'switch', and more space, and more power, and more heat.  To do the same 'Add 3 to Y' operation that a 32 bit CPU would do, still needs all of the '64 bit' parts to be active and powered up, and moving around lots of 'leading zeroes'.

In many more devices, nowadays, you get a mix of high and low performance CPU cores.  Some that always need to be processing things quickly, but don't need to be doing complex things, can be simpler and therefore made to consume less power, since every bit of logic you have inside the CPU is eating some juice.  Double the bits, double the amount of logic up and down the CPU.  Practically every I/O device has its own, specialized CPU, with RAM and ROM of its own.  Even seemingly trivial things, like a USB gizmo, usually has some kind of simple embedded 'brain' to handle the communications and housekeeping.

It is unlikely we'll get consumer PC 128 bit CPUs soon (but never say never), since we've nowhere reached the limits of 64 bit processing (16 billion-billion bytes of addressing, and similarly crazy data ranges), and the current trend is more and more CPUs on a single die, to do more stuff at the same time.  Each doubling in register width nearly doubles the amount of logic needed to run the CPU (and space on the chip), which constrains the number of 'big register' CPUs you'll want.  There are CPUs with very wide ALU and FPU (floating point unit) registers, specially built to do 'bignum' math, to crunch those matrices so your polygons line up.

Now then, a floating point operation may need dozens of 'clocks' to do a simple multiply, but the extra time to load two 64 bit values into microcode is a couple of clocks, give or take how long the 'wait states' for RAM access are, whether it was in the cache, etc.  Something that can be done at the same time as other FPU operations, which are generally done independently of other microcode operations, just as an integer operation within the ALU may be.

But a modern GPU (graphics processing unit) is a kind of CPU, that usually has 'lots' of FPUs and dedicated matrix math (linear algebra) units, as well as lots of pixel units to do the peculiar mixing of visible light 'values' and darkness convincingly, and quickly.  So though it takes longer to do these operations, you need to keep feeding it lots of data to keep all of the parts of it busy.  Since everything is more close to 'purpose built' for these operations, the GPU does the operations way, way faster than the general purpose CPU.

Is it better to have one 128 bit core, or four 32 bit cores?  That depends on what you're doing.  Most consumer devices need to be doing several things at the same time.  Running the network connection, rendering the graphical user interface, being responsive to the user, dealing with all kinds of other I/O, etc.  For most user applications, having the computer be responsive and friendly with multiple cores is more important than grunty, number-crunching, step by step speed of one super-fast CPU to do one thing, and the heat issues and physical issues of trying to make that one core 'super-duper fast'.

HungLikeAVillain,"Another way to look at the 128 vs 64 bit thing is, to represent the size of the observable universe in millimeters would require about 100 bits of precision.  

If we take 93 billion light years (diameter of observable universe), and convert it to millimeters, and figure out how many bits that would be...

Log2(8.79829142 × 10^29 millimeters) = about 100 bits of precision for a mantissa.

So give that one bit of sign, one bit of sign for the exponent, and you have 26 bits left over to distribute for the exponent power... in case you need to express a location to 67 million times bigger than the universe, or way, way smaller than the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.

So if you work with atomic-precision cosmology, 128 bits would be pretty useful.

On a tablet, running 'Angry Birds'... not so much.

Though the 'standard' for 128 bit floats sets a much smaller exponent, and a 112 bit mantissa.  Because let's face it, sometimes you need sub-micron precision across merely many thousands of times the diameter of the observable universe.

To rest your eyes, close them gently and cover them with the palms of your hands, cupped to cover them without squishing but still giving them a break in the darkness.

Kony leads the Lord's Resistance Army, a violent religious group that is known for creating thousands of child soldiers and child prostitutes and for breaking apart many more families. Unfortunately, we don't know too much more than that. Because he's a criminal and on the run, the facts about Kony are mysterious and questionable. For example, did he create 60,000 child soldiers, or 30,000, or far less? What countries did he operate in and when? Kony was rumored to be dead multiple times, although he's actually still alive--he might be about to surrender to the Central African Republic government, but even that is questionable.

However, the video about Kony 2012 didn't address any of this uncertainty and used outdated and exaggerated information to convey its message. One of the largest flaws was the focus on Uganda; while Kony has spent quite some time in Uganda, he hasn't been there in years, and has instead spent his time in various African countries. Essentially, the video was far more propaganda piece than it was documentary. Furthermore, the charity funding isn't very good quality; few enough of the donations went to stopping Kony or helping his victims.

Kony 2012 brought JK to the public's attention, but the poor quality of the messenger caused the movement to flop. People who had never heard of the issue watched the video and became passionate about stopping Kony; when they learned that they had been misled, they dropped the cause entirely (to be fair, it's a foreign political issue that the average American can't do much about anyway.)

allahsnackbars,"The computer is essentially a small device called the CPU (Central Processing Unit) plus other devices which the CPU can communicate with. Since those peripheral devices are optional, we'll discuss the simplest emulation possible and then I'll explain how it can grow to become more complex.

So it all starts with _just_ emulating (there are a lot of ways to sandbox object code it doesn't _have_ to be emulation but the general process is the same) a CPU. The CPU is a device which retrieves a series of _instructions_ from a source and responds to those instructions. Instructions can be a series of statements (done in order) like so:


Add 5 to x


add y to x


subtract 6 from y


Where X &amp; Y are small sections of memory inside of the CPU. In a real CPU (the x86\x64 architecture) these instructions are a lot more complex and there are also many more complex instructions.


These instructions and encoded into a series of bits and then stored in a location (usually the RAM) where they are read from by the CPU. The CPU uses a series of logical hardware gates (and, or, xor etc...) to decode these instructions and perform their respective task.


To emulate the CPU, one does the exact same thing, except rather than using a physical CPU, they are using a program which reads a series of bits, decodes them as instructions and executes them in a sandboxed environment (emulating also the temporary storage locations X &amp; Y.)


Now that the CPU has been emulated, and as the CPU is the device which reaches out and communicates with the peripheral devices (USB interfaces, SATA\IDE (storage), VGA (video) the communication with the emulated CPU can also itself be emulated.


This results in emulated RAM, etc.

You can, at any given point in time, imagine a box. You might paint this box pink with white stripes.

Now, you decide to imagine several boxes, all pink with white stripes. You can imagine as many such boxes as you can remember at a time. The more complex the boxes get, the harder it might be to remember them all and keep them all out there at the same time.

A VM works in roughly the same way - you have one physical machine, one set of physical hardware. The VM Software works to create a 'virtual' machine, that lives in its own little sandbox and accesses a portion of the hardware you have. You might have a quad core CPU and 16 GB of RAM. You could then set up a VM sandbox with 1 core and 4GB of RAM. You could do 4 of those sitting side by side without any issue at all.

Your example is very common - you have a physical server, and rather than trying to set up multiple booted OS's on that server, you virtualize - now instead of needing one server per OS, you just use VM to do it instead. This is easier, and management can make life easy as well - I can set up a base image (the pink box with stripes) and just start new VM instances with that pink box, and know it will look like all the other pink striped boxes.

Depending on how its configured, you could have multiple users remoting into multiple virtual machines. You could *also* remote into the physical machine. A sysadmin would likely have control over the physical machines *and* virtual machines, while the users might only have access to one or more virtual machines at any given time.

What I've used VMs for personally is I have a stock Ubuntu image I have through VMWorkstation. When I need to do web work, I spin up a new VM to play with. Once I have it stable, I save that down as a new 'baseline' image. Now if I ever needed to re-create that baseline apache build, I just create a new VM machine from that image.

If I need to mess around with something, I just clone from my existing VM Machine, fuck with it, and if I break it, its no big deal, I still have my original setup safe in an image.

Depending on my hardware, I might be able to run many VMs at the same time. Maybe I can only run a few of them at the same time.

sir_sri,"&gt; I've read that you need to do a SEO and make back ends? 

What *YOU* need is to find a company in your area that does SEO, and pay them to do it for you.

So a couple of things to keep in mind:  any time SEO actually works it means the search algorithm is defective.  So you're gaming the system only until someone fixes the algorithm.  That said, you gotta do what you gotta do, and Google specifically makes a defect in its search algorithm - called adwords, and they're happy to sell you access.

The SEO company is going to do a few things, they're going to follow a guide like this one (not mine)

http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/05/12/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-google-adwords/

and they're going to buy a bunch of adwords for your business with your money.  Basically this is a competitive bidding process, if you're competitors are doing the same thing you're going to be stuck in a bidding war.  Sorry to say.  There are a few minor things that need to happen here too, your website will need to be properly configured to be easily searchable by google and have the right keywords in it.  

The second thing that's going to happen, and this is really what you need a SEO for, is you're going to start getting reviews of your business, you're going to need mentions in blogs etc.  Fairly basically this is the bread and butter of SEO.  Making shit up.  How many yelp reviews does your business have?  Whatever it is, multiply it by 10.  Lots of people had 4-5 star experiences at your business.  It doesn't matter if you sell coffee that smells like sewage, dozens or hundreds of people love it.  

The next thing that needs to happen is that you're going to do advertising beyond just 'google'.  Probably this is obvious enough, but if such things exist you're going to want to have your site featured on 'meta' sites.  Things like a local business association - you're now a member and you have your webpage linked.  You have a facebook page, a twitter page an instagram page etc. that are all full of keywords and that point to your main website.  The more legitimate places host ads for your site, the more google will see things pointing at your site the higher you will rank.  

The reason I recommend finding a local company is that it's important to have someone you can meet face to face with, that knows the local geography, terminology and your competitors.  If people in your area do searches based on neighbourhood names or street names or something else you need to know that, and a local outfit is more likely to be better at that than some random company in another state/province/country that doesn't know anything about your area or your business.

SEO is the title of someone who is capable of making your website appear (if it and your services are good enough) in the first page of Googles search results. It means Search Engine Optimization and while these forms of making google work for you are changing, most SEO's are up to date on how everything works and can make the ""interwebs"" a safer, nicer, easier place for you to work.

The networks are expected to check themselves and if they go too far from what a common person would find offensive, the network may lose advertisers or face FCC fines. The networks push the limits when they feel it is safe to do so. For example, the TV show Friends had been wanting to say ""vagina"" in the show, but the network censors, for the first few years didn't allow it. After a few years and many scripts trying to slip the word in, the censors decided to allow the word. I can't remember what the title of the episode was, but the scriptwriters tried to get the word ""vagina"" into every scene. 

Another example is 2003, Young and the Restless. There was a scene filmed in which a male actor showed full backside nudity.

The line between politicking and doing ones job as an elected official is not trivial to draw.  The US has rules about what can and cannot be paid for, but ultimately if a politician flies to the other side of the country, gives a speech and talks to a bunch of legislators and then has a dinner where everyone at the dinner just happened to spend 1000 dollars a plate to be in the same room how much of the travel costs etc belong to whom?

For the president, security is basically with him whatever he's up to.  There's no way around it, and there's no reasonable way to expect him to pay for those sorts of costs.

sir_sri,"&gt;Are they just not even trying to pay their taxes?

Well sometimes that's the case. 

The thing is, as others have pointed out, being rich is actually quite complicated.  Most rich people build up to the process, you own a local store, then you own 2 stores, then 5, then 50, then 500.  Or you invest in one place, then 10 then 100 or whatever.  Or you just own one business and that's it for your career.  

Athletes, celebrities and lottery winners all have a problem, athletes particularly because you are at a young age with no experience with money handed a fortune.  You don't know what to do with it and you don't even know who to ask.  So you try and hire accountants and lawyers and the problem is you don't have the skills to know the good ones from the bad.  Most americans can't do their taxes coming out of highschool for a 30k a year job, when it's 3 million earned in lots of places with all sorts of complexity you basically hire an accountant, follow their advice and hope you don't fuck it up.  Assuming you know enough to even do that. 

Wesley Snipes got himself an advisor who didn't believe income tax was legal - which as you can imagine the IRS does not agree with.  So Snipes was in a world of trouble.  

Now in the case of athletes they are in the worst of it, because your career doesn't usually gradually slide into oblivion, you make 10 million dollars one year, and 0 the next, or you get injured part way through, cannot play anymore, and suddenly your lifestyle that expected making  X million dollars before you retire at age 30 now has you trying to make do with 15% of X.  Or 2% of X or whatever.  And you're boned.  

Actors can just keep working, even if you get less money you at least can make something by doing more movies and commercials and you can make bad movies or take your clothes off, do stage work etc.  

Lottery winners and athletes though, they have no idea what to do.  The guy at H&amp;R block you pay 40 bucks to do your taxes isn't going to talk to you if you have millions in income.  So you need advisors and you have very poor prospects for long term income.  

Add to that divorces, failed business ventures, theft by crooked advisors and well, you get the idea.  When you have a lot of money and you get a pet project (think 38 studios) that you hope will keep you going for years and it fails suddenly you can't pay your bills and part of that ends up being taxes.

Snafu_Coaxer_2013,"A lot of these answers ignore the fact that that profit rarely translates into the ability to takeover other companies if you're a listed, public company. Spyker, for example, bought Saab (briefly), despite Spyker being a tiny company.

The reasoning is completely economic. If your cars are cheaper and you sell more, you're going to have bigger facilities and spend more on things like research. Lamborghini (if they were independent) aren't going to have the scale to effectively invest in R&amp;D without outsourcing it. But R&amp;D can be pretty much equally used by all car marques (i.e. it would be more efficient for Volkswagen and Lamborghini to share research as their research needs aren't all that different).

So a company with a lot of facilities like Volkswagen or BMW is going to be able to make better, cheaper cars than a company like Lamborghini. But that's not why people buy Lamborghini's, they buy them for the name and values of the brand: they buy them because they want a sports car with the character of a Lamborghini. So if Volkswagen made a car to compete with Lamborghini, it might be faster and more efficient and cheaper, but it likely won't make much of a dent in Lamborghini's sales. If Lamborghini makes a good car, it will probably cut in to Ferrari's sales, however.

So from that, logically, If Volkswagen bought Lamborghini, Lamborghini would better compete with Ferrari, and Volkswagen itself wouldn't lose any sales because their brand doesn't compete in the same markets as Lamborghini. So Lamborghini makes better cars, and Volkswagen gets more market coverage for their entire portfolio. ",null,0,cdn9hhs,1rgppg,explainlikeimfive,new,2

So, you get worse doctors, more bureaucracy, and generally lower standard of health care for those who were enjoying the best health care.

Some pros include the power to protect rights of workers, ie, to prevent an abusive boss from hiring only specific groups of people or from firing specific people based on unreasonable claims.

However, unions can allow easier access to striking, which can massively damage a business, because the union wants to gain some sort of benefit to its members. In a school union (I can speak from personal experience), it can lead to teachers refusing to write recommendations, refusing to help students, come in early and stay late, etc., if the school boards are not cooperative.

thatssoright,"Unions in the United States came about as a response to some particularly harsh working conditions that workers were subjected to back in the late 1800's-early 1900's when the industrial revolution was getting into full swing. Mostly manufacturing and labor intensive jobs. Workers were treated as interchangeable. In some cases they were paid in  Company Money that could only be used in company stores. Essentially, you belonged to the company. Labor Unions began as a natural response. The individual may be interchangeable, but the workforce as a whole is not. This led to some very bloody confrontations before the US government eventually stepped in and the existence of a labor unions and protections were added. Other countries have their own similar stories with somewhat equivalent time-frames.

The pros of having a union - In theory, all workers are treated equally and fairly. The company makes an agreement with the employees and the union is supposed to safeguard that agreement. Things like working hours, overtime, work conditions, training, disciplinary measures, layoffs and terminations are all usually spelled out in a legally binding contract. In some of the skilled trade professions (Electrical, Plumbing, etc) being Union Certified used to mean you were current on your training, and generally knew what you are doing.

The Cons - Everyone is treated and viewed exactly the same, regardless of how hard or well they work. The pay scale is the same for everyone in the same job title as you and the only way to earn more money is to work whatever overtime is offered. EVERYTHING is based on seniority. If there is training available but not everyone can attend at once, better hope you have high enough seniority. Volunteers for overtime? Better hope you have been there long enough. Layoffs? Better hope you aren't one of the low guys on the totem pole. Job opens up in another department? Not yours if the the guy who sleeps half the day and can barely do his job puts in for it and has even one day more seniority than you.


I am a bit biased against unions. I worked in one for 3 years and then worked along side that same union for the next 12. From what I could tell, they do nothing but push mediocrity. I regularly heard union stewards tell people to stop working so hard because it made others look bad. When companies started outsourcing, the response was to show the company just how good an idea that was by organizing work stoppages on a regular basis. Most unions have become just as bad as the big businesses they rally against. They protect their own interests and not the interests of their members.

Having said that, I am mildly surprised (and I think it speaks to the mindset of most unions) that non-government union membership hasn't started to go up in the last 5 years with how large corporations have been treating the employee base. ",null,0,cdn7qun,1rgngc,explainlikeimfive,new,2

eideid,"First off, your definition of species is a lie which continues to be repeated, particularly by high-school science teachers. There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. Most organisms aren't sexual and even then, there are countless examples of organisms which can and sometimes even do interbreed with fertile offspring, but their populations are generally separate enough that we treat them as separate species (for an example, look at polar bears and northern grizzly bears).

In paleontology, the general rule is, ""Is there another thing out there which has been discovered which would be difficult to distinguish from this thing that I just discovered?"". If we were to find modern dogs in the ancient archaeological record, we would think they were all separate species, but we currently think of them as all members of a single species. There have been fairly recent reports of skull analyses which might call into question how many early hominid species there really were. It's all just best guesses with a bit of academic politics thrown in for good measure.",null,1,cdn1mg6,1rgmpx,explainlikeimfive,new,3
DoggoneCat,"While I agree with eideid's comments, I'm going to take a little different approach, starting first with extant species. Where eideid says, 
&gt; ""There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. ""

I would say that there are several acceptable definitions of species, and all are rather context dependent. If two species are asexual but closely related, how do we determine if they are species or subspecies (races or breeds in some contexts, but not others)? What about two groups of organisms that appear nearly identical but are separated (say on different continents)? They can't (naturally) interbreed. There are literally dozens of scenarios we could suggest to snag someone stuck on a simple definition. So, we use morphology, behavior, and increasingly, genetics, to test hypotheses about the relationships between extant species. I don't know that I'd call the decision-makers, ""high prestige scientific committees"". A single author, publishing a convincing set of evidence may decide to split a previously single species into 2 or more. If her argument is sound, and the data support it, ""consensus"" in the scientific community may simply be that other authors cite the work and accept the argument. Some taxa have a richer history of committee decision however. Birds have long had a devoted following, and there are numerous large and prestigious organizations which have committees that review the literature on taxonomy and vote on what the official relationship will be. So each year, the American Ornithologists Union publishes an update to their official checklist based on the decisions of the committee. 

When we consider extinct species we have much less data to go on, both quantitatively (the number of fossilized examples of a putative species) and qualitatively (the different types of evidence). There are no behavior observations, though we might make some inferences. There may be no usable genetic material. There are rarely skin, or feathers... anything to compare looks. We might only be left with a partial skeleton. At that point, paleontologists measure, and compare, and hunt for more fossils and do the best they can to make informed decisions. Often, someone coming along 10-100 years later, having much more data at hand, will revise those initial findings to a greater or lesser degree. It is messy, and somewhat subjective, but the idea is to apply any and all new, relevant information and to try and let the data suggest the most parsimonious answer - that is, the simplest answer is generally the most likely unless you have data to the contrary.

* Anyone who claims that gluten is not part of a human's natural ""diet"" has a lot to learn about human food systems. Basically everything we eat, be it plant or animal, has been domesticated and artificially selected for over the past 12,000 years, this includes grains and rice. Peppers, almonds, olives, corn, wheat, rye, quinoa, rice, oranges, lemons, pineapples, bananas, broccoli, potatoes...everything is domesticated, selected and altered from their wild counterparts. Seriously most people would not even recognize wild plant foods for what they are. 

* One thing to watch out for: gluten-free foods tend to also be highly processed, and thus may not be better for you - high in sugar, sodium or whatever else - always read the label. 

* Humans are omnivores and as omnivores we can eat a very varied diet. There is no one single ""best"" or ""right"" diet for humans. This is good news for us because we can tailor our diets to meet our individual needs like allergies, intolerances, personal morals or beliefs, local customs and traditions etc. However, there is often a certain level of ""use it or lose it"". If you start cutting out certain foods (like dairy or gluten) you may never be able to go back to eating them. For example; [lactase persistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence) is the continued activity of the enzyme lactase in adulthood. Since lactase's only function is the digestion of lactose in milk, in most mammal species the activity of the enzyme is dramatically reduced after weaning. However in some human populations lactase persistence has recently evolved (~10,000 years ago) as an adaptation to the consumption of non-human milk and dairy products beyond infancy. The majority of people around the world remain lactase non-persistent, and consequently are affected by varying degrees of lactose intolerance as adults. The important part here is that the continued activity of the enzyme is also partly dependant on the body being exposed to lactose in adulthood. Thus a person may have the genetic predisposition to consuming milk into adulthood, but without any lactose products they will become lactose intolerant anyway.

""Dr. Serrador and team recruited 13 healthy adult volunteers. They were asked to sip ice-cold water through a straw, so that the liquid would hit their upper palate. Blood flow in their brain was monitored using a transcranial Doppler test.

They found that the sensation of brain freeze appears to be caused by a dramatic and sudden increase in blood flow through the brain's anterior cerebral artery. As soon as the artery constricted, the brain-freeze pain sensation wore off.

The scientists were able to trigger the artery's constriction by giving the volunteers warm water to drink.""",null,0,cdn205n,1rgkmr,explainlikeimfive,new,2

eideid,"There are several things in effect here, but the biggest one is an issue of surface area to volume ratio. If you have a cube with sides of length 1, then its volume is 1 and its surface area is 6 with a surface area to volume ratio of 6 (ignoring units). Now imagine a cube with sides of length 2 with volume of 8 and a surface area of 24, giving it a surface area to volume ratio of 3. The bigger things get, the lower the surface area to volume ratio gets.

This has a large impact on how well the energy from changes in momentum is felt. Relatively more mass for a similar area of surface structure means it takes less of a change of momentum to reach the surface structure's breaking point. This explains many characteristics we find amazing regarding small creatures, such as the immense strength of ants compared to their body weight. It also means that they can have chitenous armor all over their body and still be agile. It is also why smaller animals have a much easier time surviving falls from great heights, or why it is so difficult to injure a flying insect with your hand.

An additional issue is that this surface area to volume ratio means that your hand swinging toward a flying insect which is going to cause a lot of wind has a greater impact on your target which is going to further cushion the impact of your hand.

matingslinkys,"One of the issues with anti-depressants is the order in which they can treat the symptoms of depression. Depression comes with a whole grab bag of symptoms, and they are all linked but separate in a complicated mess that is different for each person, and can respond differently to medication in each person.

Often one of the most significant things that can affect a person with depression is a lack of motivation, an overwhelming lethargy that leaves them unable to perform sometimes even the most basic of tasks. This is the reason that the advice ""just snap out of it, get up and do something"" is so useless to folks with depression. The illness cruelly takes that option away, by filling a person with leaden thoughts and an inability to even contemplate taking the next few steps in their recovery. I have worked with people who have sat soiled on a sofa until someone physically moved them to the bathroom to clean up, people who have not eaten in days being unable to summon up the energy to see the point in getting something to eat. 

This lethargy and lack of motivation is linked, but separate to any suicidal ideation. People may have suicidal thoughts, or they may not, or they may develop suicidal thoughts only when in the very depths of a depression, when the lethargy has already kicked in. Sometimes a person may entertain the idea of killing themselves, but be unable to summon up the energy to put together a plan to do so (after all, many suicide methods require some sort of supplies, which means getting dressed, leaving the house, and interacting with people to purchase things, or may require the effort of driving to somewhere or other such activities. Sometimes even just the effort of making a decision and coming up with a plan to kill yourself is just too much to overcome).  

Now, here's why people suffering from depression should always have someone to help keep an eye on them when they start a course of medication. Sometimes with modern anti-depressants the first symptom that reacts to treatment is the lethargy. All of a sudden the person who was unable to leave the same position on a sofa, or in a bed, for days on end is able to get up in the morning, or to summon up the energy to have a shower, or to go out to the shops...

You can see how this is the start of a positive recovery for many people; however sometimes the suicidal ideation does not go away at the same time. So what happens is that a person is still very much in a place where they wish to end their life, but now they have more energy and motivation. And therin lies the rub. 

I must stress that this is not the case for every person with depression, perhaps not even for most people with depression, everyone is an individual, and everyone reacts to both depression and treatment in different ways. Antidepressants are without a doubt good things that help many many people to recover, but sometimes they come with a risk that needs to be managed, and that's why they put those warning on the packet.

**TL:DR**    Sometimes Antidepressants can give a suicidal person the energy to notice their suicidal feelings (and sometimes act  on them) by bringing them out of a lethargic state in which they may not even have realised they felt that way. ",null,0,cdn1zrg,1rgj2f,explainlikeimfive,new,7

ZenDragon,"This might not seem intuitive, but in the case of antidepressants, a person with depression may have passive thoughts of suicide but insufficient energy/motivation to actually go through with it. When antidepressants are suddenly introduced, a number of things can happen. It may give them just enough drive and energy to actually carry out their suicide plan. It might not react well with their body and make them feel even worse, prompting more thoughts of suicide. Some antidepressants are possible to OD on, giving the person a new convenient way to kill themselves. Someone starting on antidepressants for the first time may have only recently come to the conclusion that they have a mental health issue. Becoming conscious of it may make them feel even more pathetic or hopeless. For these reasons it's very important to monitor a person starting a new antidepressant drug, or if you are taking one yourself, to frequently tell people how you are feeling and not hesitate to talk to your doctor if they aren't working out for you.

Primarily, cultures all over the world are very different. But often they are very obviously different in aesthetics, social constructs, social behaviours etc. So, when these cultures, which are very obviously far removed from standard western-centric views of the world, start having weird traditions then it's not very shocking.

Japan, however, on the very surface, often looks very familiar. The architecture of their big cities, the absolute basics of the school system, the absolute basics of the working world seem very familiar. Not to mention that Japan, over the last 50 years, has adopted and modified many foreign brands and images meaning that, on the surface, Japan can feel very familiar.

However, it absolutely isn't. It's entire social mentality is extremely different to what you may expect from a Western mentality. As such, its social norms can produce seemingly absurd things.

The only way to get a telescope to allow you to magnify *more* is to build a telescope with a bigger primary.  But there is a limit to how big the primary can be.  The biggest refracting telescope (the kind with a lens as the primary light-gathering element) is but a few tens of inches across.  A bigger lens becomes obscenely expensive to make, incredibly difficult to make, the more chromatic aberration (the different colors of light don't all focus at the same point) can occur, and even small imprecisions ruin it.  The solution is to use a mirror.  

But even a mirror has limitations, cost and sufficient precision become limiting factors.  The Hale telescope was the biggest at 200 inches for a very long time, until we began finding ways around these limits--a primary made of two smaller mirrors whose information is combined by computer; a primary made in segments each of which is aimed by computer to have a common focal point, etc.  We've been able to produce mirror telescopes tens of meters across, now, and such large primaries can support some really impressive magnification, but there are still limits.",null,0,cdn05wx,1rgir2,explainlikeimfive,new,3

Any number multiplied by a number that is divisible by 3, is also divisible by 3. (eg. 4(3)=12 is divisible by 3).

andgiveayeLL,"So, the goal of interpreting a statute is to figure out what Congress intended.  You want to know what the legislature wanted to prohibit, or incentivize, or regulate.  

Scalia, like every other judge and justice in the country, thinks that we should look to the text of the law to figure that out.  This is always the starting point.

But, most judges think that if there is something in the text that isn't clear, we can look to other sources to help resolve that ambiguity when all of the tools we have to interpret just the text itself fail.  These judges are willing to look at things like legislative history (what does the committee report for the bill that led to the creation of the statute say about the ambiguity?).  Some but not all judges will also try to use their own common sense and experience to reconstruct the purpose of the statute, drawing from as many sources as possible.

Scalia, however, thinks that we should stick just to the text.  He says that the answer is in the text and nowhere else.  He will not look to legislative history 99% of the time (he has done it twice to my knowledge).  He will not engage in some inquiry into the overall purpose of the statute as he reconstructs it.  All he cares to look at is the text itself, plus a dictionary (but he likes to use old dictionaries, like Webster's Second instead of Webster's Third).

Basically, he is a textualist, who tries to figure out the intent of the legislature through the text alone.  There are lots of tools to interpret text that he uses (just like all other judges).  These are called the ""canons of statutory interpretation"".  I'll walk you through an easy one

One straightforward canon of interpretation is called ""noscitur a sociis.""  That means ""a word is known by the company it keeps.""  This canon tells us that we are going to look at words around an ambiguous word in a group of words to try to make some sense out of it.  So in the list, ""No person shall possess: cotton candy, Skittles, ice cream, or treats,"" the word ""treats"" is ambiguous.  What if to me, salad is a treat.  Am I forbidden from possessing salad? No, because just using the text, we can figure out that the legislature did not intend to prohibit salad.  All the other items in the list are sweet things that are bad for you in large quantity.  Salad isn't like that.  So it's not a ""treat"" for the purposes of this law.  

Scalia uses tools like these to figure out ambiguities in language of statutes.  So does every other judge.  The difference is that Scalia prefers to stop with just the text.  But if there is an ambiguity that this tool and other tools like it cannot resolve, most judges will look to other sources.

CatRelatedUsername,"Size and role.

Destroyers and frigates are small ships (commonly called escorts), typically meant to keep enemies from harassing the big ships. Currently they are interchangeable, but destroyers used to be the smaller of the two, and focused on anti-submarine warfare, while frigates could bring down larger ships when operating in packs. Also, frigates and destroyers could operate alone, due to their small size and higher maneuverability.

Battleships (along with cruisers, battlecruisers, and dreadnoughts) are what are known as capital ships, and are meant to provide a boat load (pun intended) of firepower. One-on-one, they can outshoot any other ship other than enemy capital ships. The largest ones typically served as the chief admiral's ship, and almost always operated in fleets with smaller ships because of their slower speed. In addition, they often served ended up being statements of nationalistic pride (particularly the Yamato, the Bismark, and the Missouri during and after WWII).

Larger capital ships have largely been replaced with aircraft carriers (which are also capital ships), as aircraft are much more useful in combat that the main guns of a battleship. Cruisers are still used, although they are now more of a large escort ship used for firing cruise missiles, rather than a capital ship in their own right.",null,0,cdn073l,1rgfxj,explainlikeimfive,new,10
QuickSpore,"It depends on what era you are talking about.

In the age of sail 18th and 19th century.

* Battleships / Ships of the Line - These are the big warships that would fight fleet to fleet battles.
* Frigates - These are large ships that are faster than battleships. They are out scouting, fighting pirates, escorting civilian ships, and occasionally joining in the big fleet battles.
* Corvettes/Sloops/Brigantines/etc. - There are also a lot of little ships with various roles running around.

As ships developed and got armor, bigger guns, and power plants things changed.

* Battleships - These were the biggest nastiest ships in the various navies.
* Cruisers - These replaced frigates. Faster than anything they can't outshoot and nastier than anything they can't outrun. While the battleships clumped together for big battles, the cruisers were running around doing most of the ""work.""
* Destroyers - When torpedoes were invented they changed the game, now a small boat could carry a weapon that could sink a Battleship. So these ""Torpedo Boat Destroyers"" would screen the fleet from anything little. They had a lot of small guns (couldn't hurt a Cruiser) to blow up little boats.

By WWII this was largely still the same.

* Battleships - Still the same.
* Cruisers - Still the same, but most now carried torpedoes for an extra punch.
* Destroyers - Mostly these had become the Torpedo Boats, with a dozen torpedoes they could pack a big punch in a small size. And because they were smaller and cheaper they picked up a lot of new jobs. They were given sonar sets and sent sub hunting. They were given radar sets and were back on the far edges of the fleet looking for other ships, and more importantly planes.
* Frigates - These were smaller Destroyers, usually dedicated to a single purpose. An anti-sub frigate for example was pretty much a sitting duck to a surface ship or an air attack.
* Carriers - These were the new big kid on the block. Able to find and sink ships before the other ships knew they were there, they completely changed warfare.

In the post WWII era things have changed somewhat

* Battleships - These are now obsolete. Only the US operated them for very long. In the days of missiles bug guns are of limited value. As this moment. There are none operating.
* Cruiser - This is a bigger destroyer. Only the US and Russia have Cruisers any more.
* Destroyer - This is the main ship now. Capable of dealing with any threat, they are large (much larger than the WWII destroyers) ships and form the core of almost all fleets.
* Frigates - These are still the Destroyers' little brothers. Less capable and usually dedicated to a single purpose.
* Carriers - There are a lot of different types carriers out there. The US is the only one who runs the massive super carriers. But both the US and other fleets operate smaller carriers for Helos and small planes that don't need runways.",null,0,cdnf0av,1rgfxj,explainlikeimfive,new,4

eideid,"It affected Europe proper in countless ways. Here are just a couple of examples:

Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart) of Robin Hood fame and one of the most celebrated kings of English history participated in the third crusade. He drained the royal coffers and depleted the English defensive army, navy, and labor force to go fight in the holy land. Richard eventually died and his brother John became king and in his efforts to raise funds in order to pay mercenaries to defend the realm from France and Burgundy he started a civil war which led to the Magna Carta.

The Teutonic Order was a collective Germanic army which was supposed to be preparing to fight in the crusades, but ended up doing most of their fighting around the south-eastern baltic with the Prussians, Lithuanians, and Livonians (modern-day Latvia and Estonia). When they finished with their war, they ended up just ruling the place until a Polish/Lithuanian alliance finally had enough of it a few centuries later.

For the average person, the crusades was just one more reason the local nobility might call on them to fight and die or surrender up more of their agricultural production.

A lot of the concepts that make the Internet today and from that original DARPA-net. So as this evolved into the Internet, it makes sense how the initial addresses were handed out. You had .mil for military, .gov for non-military government, .edu for universities, .com for companies (like IBM), and .org or the various other entities. Those were the groups and companies involved in the original development.

Eventually the military went its own way, but the Internet (the network connecting all these entities) had achieved a life of its own. It was simply too convenient for IBM to be able to ""email"" files to MIT and so forth. And in the years before about 1990 there were a lot of different competing standards. There were multiple messaging applications, you had linked folders called Gopher and there were search applications like Archie to help you find things on Gopher.

But it all changed when the World Wide Web was developed and all that came with it: the browser, links, sites, etc. that form of the Internet was so user friendly it finally burst into public awareness. Prior to that Internet use was limited to a few businesses and university students. Now especially with the help of early ISPs like AOL anyone could use it. And the business world flocked to take advantage of the opportunities it offered.

**So who owns it?**

Mostly the various ISPs and some other cabling companies you have never heard of. They pay each other to access each others cables. Or they sign reciprocation agreements, you can use my wires, if I can use yours. And in a lot of places the government owns a lot of the cables as well. That is how some countries can control content. They either own or can lean on the owners of the connection points. You gain access by paying an ISP for their wires, and they via their agreements give you access to the others.

The US government was seeing how good for US businesses this whole Internet thing was, they spun off the last bit they controlled: assigning names and addresses.

tabarefield,"If you stand in front of a normal window in your house at night (inside the house, with the indoor lights ON), you will be able to see your reflection in the glass quite clearly. A car's mirror takes advantage of the same effect.
The mirror is not ground flat -- the front glass surface is at an angle to the back (mirrored) surface. So if you looked at this mirror out of its casing, it would be wedge-shaped with the thicker edge at the top. When you ""flip"" the mirror, the back mirrored surface actually points toward the dark ceiling, so you don't see that image. What you see instead is the image reflecting off the front of the glass, and this is much dimmer that the pure reflected image so it does not hurt your eyes.
To prove that this is what is happening, take a flashlight with you one night and play with your mirror (while the car is parked in your garage, preferably). Flip the mirror and shine the light at the ceiling (or sometimes the floor) and the fully reflected image will overwhelm the front-surface reflection so you can see the ceiling.

Optical systems can be incredibly complicated and are subject to produce very bad results from errors of very small magnitude (i.e. your eye is a millimeter to long or short). Source: Optical Engineering Student... yeah it's tough, and it's amazing that anything has evolved eyesight at all.

~~~~~

Why our eyesight is worse than, say, an eagle's?
An eagle depends more heavily on its eyesight for survival (scanning the ground far below for prey while flying by at great speed), therefore over the evolution of the species of eagles we are familiar with, a genetic mutation that resulted in better eyesight almost always resulted in a better chance to survive and reproduce. 

In humans on the other hand, at a certain quality of eyesight (roughly that which we currently possess) an improvement in eyesight no longer improved chances for survival; we already saw well enough to run and hunt on foot. Therefore, genetic mutations resulting in better eyesight- even though they were just as likely to happen and most likely did happen- were not made ubiquitous in our species by natural selection.",null,0,cdo52zt,1rgb09,explainlikeimfive,new,1

Why do we have serious bee allergies? Assuming it is hereditary, it gets passed down because we have epi-pens and medicine that allows people with this allergy to live beyond a bee sting and pass the trait down. If we didn't have this, people would get stung by bees before having the chance to reproduce. Not that I wish for this to happen AT ALL, but if all people with bee allergies just died, it's likely that this allergy would be largely eradicated from humanity. Worth it? Probably not.

Likewise, if we were nomads had to hunt for our food to survive, people with nearsightedness would be toast. They'd die before having the chance to pass their traits down. Now glasses and modern society allow people to live with eye problems and pass those traits down. If everyone who needed glasses (a LOT of people) suddenly died, the human race would be more ""fit"" (in the Darwinian sense of the word) and basically better off. But it doesn't matter because quality of life if you have money is basically the same. And we can't kill hundreds of millions of people.

The other thing is with old people. As life expectancy grows, the organs tire and grow weaker, which is why more old people need glasses. So that's the other element.

mattymck,"relatively, a couple thousand feet is NOTHING in terms of closeness to the sun. The sun is some 93million miles away, a mile or 2 wont make any difference.

But the main reason why its colder is because of the air pressure. For gases, a change in pressure means a change in temperature. Depending on the conditions, there can be a lot of ways to look at this. One is that pressure is an outside force, and pumps energy into the thing it is pressurizing. Looked at that way, it's natural that gas molecules under high pressure would be at a higher energy level than gas molecules under less pressure. Another is that with a decrease in pressure gas often increases in volume. If the same number of gas molecules are in a bigger space, they don't jostle into each other as much, and their total kinetic energy is spread out over a larger area, lowering the average temperature.

Air molecules at low altitudes are crowded together in cities. Rough, unpredictable, they're likely to bounce off each other, and run riot through the streets, and go to nightclubs with guns stuck in the waistbands of their jean shorts. They're at a high energy and that makes for a high temperature.

Meanwhile, high altitude air molecules wander in solitude, a pack on their back and a cranky yak carrying their tent behind them. They have more space to wander around in, and because they don't bounce off each other as much, because they're not crammed into a small space by the pressure of the air above them, each square inch has a much lower temperature than sea level air.",null,0,cdmxdsj,1rg91e,explainlikeimfive,new,5

restricteddata,"So there are four main categories of practical nuclear energy one can consider for spacecraft using technology that we have in hand today (i.e. no fusion):

* Nuclear reactors as nuclear thermal rockets. This has been [studied extensively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA). Basically you run a propellant (i.e. hydrogen) through a hot reactor. It can be made to work, it's just very expensive and it is very heavy. There are a lot of proposed ways to do this, but all basically work in a similar way.

* Nuclear reactors as electricity sources, to power e.g. ion engines. [This too has been studied quite a lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Prometheus). Again, heavy and expensive, but probably not a bad choice though for spacecraft meant to go pretty far in space. This is the sort of thing you'd use for an in-space thruster as opposed to a rocket.

* Radioactive decay to power electric sources ([RTGs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator)). The are pretty good for providing compact electrical sources. They _are_ used extensively for things like the Mars rovers or satellites. Basically they are radioactive materials that are very hot, and that heat can be converted to electricity. Apparently the idea of using these as heat sources in rockets has been studied, but generally they have just been used to power apparatus (or ion engines) of things that have already been launched into space.

* Exploding nuclear bombs. [Also quite studied](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)). Downside is you have to make and blow up a lot of atomic bombs to make it work. Politically not very feasible. Expensive. Up-side is that it is one of the few really feasible ways to get big ships to go really fast over long distances.

Why don't we do any of these except for RTGs? It's probably not so much that any of the other designs are infeasible (except maybe the exploding atomic bombs one, for political reasons), other than the fact that they are expensive (though all space travel sort of is). 

It's more likely the case that _nobody is at all interested in building long-range, heavy-duty spacecraft_. That is, the space-faring nations built up a space infrastructure around liquid fuel rockets, trying to achieve tasks that are pretty easily achieved through liquid fuel rockets — putting up satellites, for example. You don't need nuclear rockets to put a satellite, or even the Space Shuttle, in space and you probably don't get many advantages out of doing so — certainly no advantages worth the cost of switching systems for. 

The place you get the real advantages are if you are talking about craft that is meant to travel really long distances or with really heavy weights. But nobody is doing that, because it would be more expensive than any government is willing to pay for in order to achieve. ",null,0,cdmxesj,1rg6y8,explainlikeimfive,new,2

LondonPilot,"Unlike other forms of transport, spacecraft don't have anything to push against (air, water, etc). The only way they can move is by rockets - by throwing some kind of exhaust gas out in one direction, which moves the spacecraft in another direction.

Nuclear energy doesn't create any exhaust, so it wouldn't be suitable.

Aside from that, nuclear power requires a lot of weight (to cool the reactor and contain the radiation), and it's incredibly difficult (ie. expensive) to get that much weight into space. (This is probably the same reason we don't have nuclear powered aircraft.)

StupidHockeyPlayer,"&gt; As a type of road, a boulevard (often abbreviated Blvd) is usually a wide, multi-lane arterial thoroughfare, divided with a median down the center, and ""roads"" along each side designed as slow travel and parking lanes and for bicycle and pedestrian usage, often with an above-average quality of landscaping and scenery. 

&gt;A street is a public thoroughfare in the built environment. It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. ... The word ""street"" is still sometimes used colloquially as a synonym for ""road"", but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction.

&gt;Traditionally, an avenue is a straight road with a line of trees or large shrubs running along each side, which is used, as its French source venir (""to come"") indicates, to emphasize the ""coming to,"" or arrival at a landscape or architectural feature. ... In US and Canadian urban or suburban settings, ""avenue"" is often simply a street name used to differentiate some streets from others, along with ""way"", ""road"", etc. Thus a community might have a ""Maple Avenue"" and a ""Maple Street"" to avoid confusion between addresses. In some cities in the United States (most notably in Manhattan, New York City), there is a convention that ""avenues"" run in a north-south direction, while ""streets"" run in an east-west direction, or vice versa. 

&gt;The word lane has several meanings, including and especially: 
1. a narrow road or street, usually lacking a shoulder or a median; this is typically applied to roads in the countryside, but can also be applied to urban streets or areas that used to be streets, such as Drury Lane in London, the Brighton Lanes, or the Cathedral Lanes in Coventry. 
2. a portion of a paved road which is intended for a single line of vehicles and is marked by white or yellow lines. 

&gt;In Northern America and Australia, the term also may refer to rear access roads which act as a secondary vehicular network in cities and towns. Large cities in the U.S. states of Nevada and Texas tend to apply the term to many arterial roads. &gt;

MaximumAldwyn,"Raw speed and raw capacity are valid measures of a computer, but not the only measures one must use to guage 'overall speed' or 'seat of your pants' speed.  There are many different speeds within a computer.

Prior to [Solid State Drives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive), hard disk technology really hadn't been changing in it's fundamental workings.  Sure, you can cram more stuff onto a disk, but the way it accessed it was, more or less, the same: a spinning platter with heads on top of it.

The speed of those disks, for most all home PC models, remained the same as well for many years: 7200rpm.  This creates what is called a 'bottleneck' - An area of slowness where things get backed up.

if your CPU can process eleventy billion things every single second, but is still being fed its data from the exact same hard disk as a CPU that can only process 42 million things a second, you won't really see a noticeable difference in speed by simply by watching it. This is because by the time the next chunk of data is retrieved from disk, both CPUs have already been sitting around waiting for it. Sure, the faster CPU had been waiting 'longer', but they were both still waiting; sitting there doing nothing

Much like a chain is is only as strong as its weakest link, a computer is only as fast as its slowest component, and that has most often been the hard disk (taking cd/dvd drives out of question, since those are not used as a core component of a computer, and one can easily use a computer without one).  There are other bottlenecks inside that magical computer-box, but the the hard drive speed is a good one to illustrate the point.",null,1,cdmwtpr,1rg5st,explainlikeimfive,new,3
Northwait,"There are a few causes for dropping performance. Using your computer generates lots of activity on storage, deleting and creating small files, and eventually your file system gets fragmented. 

Fragmentation is best thought of in a non-fragmented state. Imagine your 20 page term paper printed out but in a nice neat stack. If you need to read it, you look for the stack and you have it all there. Now imagine your paper is split up into a few pages over here, a few pages over there. Then, to read your paper, you have to go and fetch all of the pages from the many places it's held in order to look at it.

Keeping your system updated will cause that to happen with system files. When your computer was freshly built with an os installed, all the code it executes to do daily things is roughly located close to each other, near the same spots on your hard drive. If one of those libraries gets updated, it was to download and install the new one before removing the old one, and now you have fragmentation BETWEEN files and not just regular files. Think about your term paper and some of the research books. If all the stuff you checked out from the library is nearby while you're doing your citations, it's pretty quick. If you had to make a trip to a different library for each citation, it's going to get awful slow.

Then there are updates themselves. Newer, updated versions of your software might have security fixes, but they also tend to have more features or take some advancements in technology (cpu speed, memory, etc) for granted. On the surface, Word 2013 doesn't do anything for your term paper that Word 2010 couldn't, but it has new features and the code simply does more stuff when you're editing and working on your paper. Now multiply this for the hundred or so programs running on your machine at any given time (check your task manager and select ""show processes from all users"") and you can imagine how the system performance degrades over time despite being exactly the same as it was.

Ideally, if you never update your system and try to keep it defragged, it won't start lagging down.

Your notion is right about what a refund is, it's the amount that has been withheld from your paycheck that exceeds your tax liability.  It can also include refundable credits, most notably the Earned Income Tax Credit
The reason you have taxes withheld through out the year is because the government has figured out that people are not to be trusted in handling their own finances and many people would get to tax time and not have the money available to pay taxes.
Ideally, the taxes withheld would exactly equal the total liability but because everyone's finances and therefore applicable taxes are different it's just not possible to have a one size fits all so it's just easier to go with an estimate.
When you first start your job you fill out a w-4 the amount you have withheld is based on this form.
If I'm being cynical I'd say the government prefers to give refunds for two reasons one all the people that never bother to collect their refund, and two the government gets an interest free loan.  But there are plenty of people who end up owing at the end of the tax year too.
If you wind up owing over a certain amount you will have to pay fines.  And of course if you can't pay your liability in a timely fashion there is interest and penalties.

They used the rock to sharpen the stick. Then they used a stronger rock to break another rock and put little bits of it on a stick.

As time has passed, the rate at which technology improves has increased. We built better tools to make better things, which allowed us to make better tools.

But the main thing that's fueled this massive boom in tech in recent years (like 1970 til now) is the integrated circuit, and the fact that [the number of transistors double about every two years](http://www.mstech.com/nh-it-blog.php?show=171).

Eventually that turns from a broad curve into a straight line up. 

So either we create advanced AI, which solves problems we don't even know we have, or the rate of technological change slows down.

sir_sri,"&gt;Why has technology developed so quickly in the last 10 years in comparison to the last 100 years?Explained

The short answer is that it hasn't.

new technologies come out and there's a period of exceptionally rapid growth where it goes from a parlour trick to a major technology, and then it settles into a long period of slow progress.

Aircraft went from from a rickety pile of wood that was more likely to kill you than get you from point A to point B to a something actively used in serious combat in about 12 years.  20 years later and you had aircraft that sort of looked like today's commercial aircraft, though with propellers rather than jets.  Then jets caught on and there was another burst of development and then... we've had 40-50 years of progress but not rapid leaps and bounds.  

Metal ships are something similar, the first iron ships started showing up around the 1840's (with varying degrees of metal-steam-wood-sail).  By 1860 there was a ~9500 tonne ironclad sea going warship, HMS Warrior.  She's still afloat at Portsmouth in the UK if you ever go there.  By 1912 (Titanic) the biggest ships were almost 60 000 tonnes.  That's absolutely huge progress, but since today we regularly build ships over 100k it doesn't seem like such a big deal.  But that was tremendously rapid progress, especially considering how long it takes to build huge ships and make ports and for them.  

The first hot air balloon was basically a death trap.  Within 10 years they were dropping bombs with it, eventually they were the size of an aircraft carrier and could carry a couple of dozen passengers across oceans.  Then they were replaced by heavier than air aircraft. 



What happens is that engineering and innovation catch up to science.  The underlying principles of most of what goes on in microprocessors is E&amp;M and Quantum mechanics, we've had those understood pretty well for the better part of 70 years, but the microprocessor didn't really take off until the 1970's.  So it's rapidly catching up to the limits of our understanding of the science, and in 20 years or we'll probably start to hit a wall where you cannot make a microprocessor based on traditional semiconductor physics work any better.  Someone will figure out how to build a quantum computer we'll have a race to reach the limits with that, and then it will be slow marginal improvements for a while. 

Certainly things like the printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, the internet all speed up communication and speed up development, and there are a lot more people alive than there were at any previous point in history (word pop in 1800 was about 1 billion for the first time, by 1900 it was like 1.6 by 2000 it was about 6 billion. ) so there are a lot more scientists doing a lot more science with much better tools.  

But technology tends to go through spurts and things we think of as unchanged for ages started out as some ridiculous magic trick or gimmick then someone had a revelation about what you could do, and that rapidly progressed to something, and then did very little for a while.  

One of the common questions here is why do batteries suck and microprocessors increase so rapidly.  Well between 1800 and 1900 batteries went from being a misunderstood lab experiment to an actual technology people understood and could use.  Basically from the first battery in 1800 until the mid 1830's no one had a clue what was going on.  Then someone figured it out, made better batteries, that actually worked and could be improved on reliably.  By 1860 we had lead acid batteries, which are still in use in cars and the technology basically went unchanged from 1860 until 1970.   From 1800 to 1860 there were huge advances, and then many decades of very incremental progress.  Expect something similar with lots of the tech you see as so incredibly awesome from the last 10 years.

In the event that actual frost nip set in, this would be even more sensitive, as you have tiny crystals beginning to form in your cells, like little shards of glass......and, smacking them, rubbing them, or scraping them would be like SMACKING, RUBBING, or SCRAPING your neutral temperature hand against shards of glass.

When it is cold, your nerves are VERY sensitive to the temperature, as it ISNT numb yet, and still....blood flow is slowed down tremendously. In fact, your body has begun ""vaso-constricting"" all it's blood flow AWAY from your hands and feet, then the arms and legs, resulting in nerves being pressed upon by the less suple skin and vascular tissues.

(think of it like this....your hand swells---you cant get a RING off your finger. SO, you get told to run your hand under cold water---really cold water for about 15 minutes. The ring should slide right off...if not, you may need to run hot water JUST on the metal ring for 1 minute to re-expand the metal. This is because when your hand is cold---it is actually smaller. the only thing that gets bigger when cold is WATER---every thing else gets smaller)

red_pharoah,"It has something to do with heat conduction. When you're in the cold, your body is literally losing heat to attempt to maintain your internal body temperature (this is why hypothermia is a thing). Your skin becomes cold and your muscles start shivering to generate heat.

Whwn a room is completely closed, heat starts building up slowly due to micro organisms and their anaerobic respiration, and if there are humans or other creatures in the enclosed space. Eventually, the room becomes warmer than the outdoors( this always happens regardless of outside temperature, it is based on air convection and the amount of people in relation to the space they occupy, I.e. a small minibus with little openings and few people will get warm as fast as a larger closed room with 100 people inside.)

When you are cold and you enter the room, your body rushes to replenish the expended heat and starts absorbing heat from the room. Even though the heat may not be relatively ""warm"", it is higher than your current skin temperature and therefore feels warm (try putting your hand in cold water then warm water, it will feel like hot water).

The numbers were selected in part for convenience.  Most things we encounter in our daily lives like weather stay in the 0-100 range.  That's easy to work with.

The thing to remember is that there's no such thing as negative temperature.  With Farenheit or Celsius nothing changes as you go from -1 degrees to +1 any differently than when you go from +10 to +12.  To put it another way, all temperatures are effectively positive.  To deal with this, for the purpose of scientific equations, a scale is used called Kelvin.  Simply put, there are no negatives on this scale.  Absolute zero is 0K and it goes all the way up from there.

Recently, a deal was put in place after negotiations between Iran and multiple other countries.

The method the U.S. used in the 40s (along with other methods) and Iran is trying to use now requires building thousands of very high tolerance centrifuges that spin at thousands of rotations per minute and separate out the uranium from the other impurities. These are setup so gas goes from one to the next separating out finer and finer tolerances. The centrifuges spin so fast that if the machining if off by nanometers they will destroy themselves. Think about how a washing machine will clunk if the cloths are off balance. Now spin the drum at several thousand rotations per minute/second and have it off centered. 

Most countries don't have the internal industrial capacity to build these centrifuges, nothing else requires such fine machining. And the countries which do try not to sell them, at last  So part of the trick is to either buy them for some other purpose then retool them for uranium while not screwing them up, or develop the tools to make the tools to make the centrifuges to such fine tolerances.

Entropius,"The **Weak Force** is what's responsible for radioactive decay in atoms.  The force has 3 carrier particles, W^+ bosons, W^– bosons, and Z bosons (kinda like how photons are the carrier particle for electromagnetism).  Their electric charges are (respectively) positive, negative, and neutral.  The force's range is pretty limited because the W and Z bosons are massive particles (unlike electromagnetism which has great range because photons are massless).

The **Strong Force** (not to be confused with Strong Nuclear Force), is what holds Quarks together, and quarks are what make up protons and neutrons.  The carrier particle is the Gluon.  The force's range is infinite.  Also, while this may sound extremely weird, it actually gets *stronger* (not weaker) with distance.  If you pull 2 quarks far enough apart, the energy required to do so is so great it will result in you spontaneously creating new quarks.   For this reason, it's impossible to ever see a single quark existing by itself.  Also, the Strong Force has charges, but unlike Electric charges that are always + or –, the Strong Force has 3 charges:  Red, Green, Blue.  These “*color charges*” have absolutely nothing to do with real world colors, physicists just named the charges after colors because the way it worked reminded them of how colors work.

The **Strong Nuclear Force** (not to be confused with the Strong Force), is what holds neutrons and protons together in an atom's nucleus.  The Strong Nuclear Force is also known as the Residual Strong Force.  The most simplified way to understand it is like this:  The Strong force between quarks in a proton or neutron “*leaks*” out, and that is what binds a neutron to a neutron, or a proton to a proton, or a neutron to a proton.  This force is NOT infinitely ranged like the raw Strong Force is.


So in summary, 3 quarks are held together by the **Strong force** to make a single proton or neutron, and some of that force leaks out as the **Strong Nuclear Force** and holds together groups of protons &amp; neutrons.",null,2,cdmv3y5,1rfzhj,explainlikeimfive,new,5

Bince82,"EDIT: Entropius explains it way better but I'll leave my response up for posterity.

I struggle with the same thing but I can give you my limited understanding. 

You know about gravity and electromagnetic force, right? Those forces are pretty well understood and apply very well to the things around us. The problem is, when you look at a smaller, quantum scale, we notice things happening that gravity and electromagnetic forces don't explain. The strong and weak forces are what govern the very small.

Strong force: So you get the whole atomic nucleus made up of protons and neutrons, surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons, right? So what holds the positive protons in a nucleus together (positively charged so should repel right?) in a particular element together? What holds the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons? Well, the answer to this is the strong force. And we don't really know WHY it exists, but we do know that it does exist. Quarks are held together by gluons, which was once explained to me as ""springs"", meaning they keep them together, but as the quarks are pulled apart, the gluons resist much like a spring would. Trying to pull apart particles held together by the strong force requires a lot of energy and also produces a lot of energy, and this binding force is used for nuclear fission.

Weak force: Weak force is also a quantum phenomenon that works over a longer period of time. It is what is responsible for radioactive decay of an element and also the energy that is released by fusion (which occurs naturally in our sun). I don't know much past this other than the force carrier is the W and Z boson. It is the force used to explain how fusion and radioactive decay occur.

Fat people have more muscle than their skinny counterparts. However, there are two general types of muscle. Slow, long acting muscle and fast explosive type muscle.

Therefore they may not have the fast musculature necessary to perform classic feats of strength such as arm-wrestling or carrying very heavy things.

BitCoin is set up in such a way that any individual ""coin"" acts, for all intents and purposes, like a physical thing.  As in, you can't make a copy of it (like, say, an MP3), and when you give one to someone else, it's now not yours and you can't run a hard drive backup or something like that to get it back.  They achieve this with several clever uses of cryptography (which gets complicated pretty fast).

So the mere fact that BitCoin acts like physical coins and was the first one to become popular is probably the reason why they're in demand (and therefore worth so much $$).

pythonpoole,"BitCoins have value simply because we (people in general) agree and trust that they have value.

If I start accepting monopoly money as real currency at my store, other people know (and trust that) they can come to my store and purchase goods with monopoly money. Because I accept monopoly money, another person may start offering a currency exchange service for others who want to convert their regular currency (e.g. US dollars) into monopoly money so they can purchase goods at my store. Likewise, the currency exchange may also convert Monopoly money into regular currency (e.g. US dollars) because they know there is a market for monopoly money and people are willing to buy monopoly (to purchase goods at my store). I also want monopoly money because I believe in the future many stores will begin to accept monopoly money (after following my example) and the value of monopoly will continue to increase as a result.

Now imagine this scenario on a much larger scale with thousands of stores accepting Bitcoins as payment and many different exchanges offering currency conversion to and from Bitcoins. That's basically what's happening. Enough businesses have started accepting Bitcoin and there are enough exchanges to convert regular currency into Bitcoins that people have started to trust that Bitcoins do actually have value and can be used to purchases goods, so the value continues to appreciate over time. 

The people who originally accepted Bitcoins were doing so at a very high risk. They had know way of knowing whether Bitcoins would hold/appreciate in value over time or whether the market would crash and die.

pchiodo,"OK, let's break this down:

*Why did dialup tend to be offered in 256kb/s and 512kb/s and what was the difference in how the extra(or less) speed was delivered? Why did we have to ""dial"" to the internet and how did that work? With modern modalities, why do we no longer need to ""dial"" into the internet?*

The term ""Dial-Up"" was in reference to when people used a standard phone line to connect their computer to the internet via a modem - These only made it to 56K which is a limitation of standard telephone modem communication. With modern connections, it is always on, therefore no dialing is necessary. Dialing was necessary in the past as most people used their one and only phone line to also connect to the internet. If you wanted to make a phone call, you had to ""hang-up"" the internet.

*Why did DSL hit the Mb/s speeds, but not be able to truly compete with coaxial speeds? Why are filters needed on the modem lines when using DSL?*

DSL Came along and piggy-backed a single on a standard phone line. Utilizing a much higher frequency delivering much faster speeds. Still over the same standard twisted pair phone line. The higher frequency requires the filter or you will hear a constant buzzing on phone calls o the same line.

DSL has limitations due to being on a twisted pair. Coax is also limited, but only at much higher speeds. Currently in the 100MB range.

*How can Comcast(or others) provide different speeds and switch packages without having to come out to adjust your line or do some wizardry inside your home? Is it that the highest speed is provided but they electronically manage/throttle what is delivered to your house based on what package you pay for?*

Most of the speed is limited by the connecting equipment outside of your home. The modem you have is generally capable of passing data at 100M, but is limited to how fast it can get it from your ISP. The ISP can throttle your connection from the node, thereby offering different packages based on what you are willing to pay. They can also reprovision your modem shoudl the need arise. Ultimately, if you surpass the capability of your modem, they will likely send you a new one with more capability.

*Why is fiber optic the fastest available connection now? What makes it capable of delivering 1000Mb/s whereas coaxial, DSL, or dialup cannot? Will it be capable of delivering more than 1Gb/s in the future or will we need another modality to surpass that?*

Fiber uses light to transmit data. So far we haven't found anything faster than light. Currently the limiting factor for fiber is the connection equipment. 10GB is currently supported for both internal and external networks. It appeasr that for the forseeable future, fiber will be able to deliver any speed the connecting equipment can provide.

not_literally_doofus,"Basically, here's the idea behind a dial-up modem: Say you have a computer in your house and your friend has a computer in theirs. You want your computer to communicate with theirs. You both have a landline phone, but that's it. So what do you do?  

You could put the computer's speaker and microphone up to the phone and dial your friend's house. Then they could pick up and put the phone up to their computer's speaker and microphone. You can have your computers communicate data: maybe a high tone for a 1 and a low tone for a 0 or something.  

Faster dial-up modems use more sophisticated methods of encoding data, but they still have to use the same basic landline telephone technology, and end up being limited to about 56kbps. You have to dial into the ISP, because you're literally making a phone call to the ISP so your computer can communicate with theirs.  

DSL uses copper wires just like regular phones, but it uses them differently. Data transfer over DSL is much faster, but has a much, much shorter range. To get DSL in your neighborhood, the ISP has to build a facility within like a mile of your house. Then your DSL modem communicates with their facility, which uses a bunch of expensive infrastructure to ultimately communicate with the rest of the internet.  

Cable uses the same coaxial cable that cable TV does. These wires can transfer data a lot faster than DSL (think of how many cable channels you can have with just one wire. That's a ton of data capacity). They can basically just turn up the speed whenever they feel like it. They may require an upgraded modem or something, but current-gen modems are no where near capacity for what speeds Comcast offers.  

Fiber optic is the fastest. It uses tubes of light to communicate data. I don't know what's faster out there, but fiber is pretty fast. If you need more speed, you can just stuff some more tubes in the bundle.",null,0,cdmu2vw,1rfw6b,explainlikeimfive,new,2
bulksalty,"One can rescan film at a higher resolution but at some point the higher resolution just means enlarging grain.  

Resolution varys for film stock, so there isn't a single answer, but most estimates place 35mm cinema film resolution around or just below the resolution of 4K (8MP in digital photogaphy speak) most estimates are around 8-15MP for standard 35mm film (cinema uses a smaller portion of the film area than still photography so there's less resolution).  

If one used 16mm film (not too common today but occasionally still used-Hurt Locker was a big movie filmed with 16mm) the resolution would be considerably lower, while if 70mm film in either standard or Imax (considerably larger) orientations the resolution of film is likely higher than 4k.

TheCheshireCody,"[According to David Mullen's comment in this forum](http://www.reduser.net/forum/showthread.php?59036-Resolution-of-35mm-film-and-70mm-IMAX-film), 70mm would resolve to roughly 9.3K. [David Mullen is a professional and highly credentialed cinematographer in film and television](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002470/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), so I would tend to trust his information.

There is a critical distinction that needs to be made, though, in that 4K is not actually 4K, or even close, by the same measure that 1080 is 1080. 1080 measures vertically (top to bottom), where 4K measures horizontally (side-to-side). It doesn't take a genius to tell that TVs are roughly twice as wide as they are tall, so a 4K resolution measured horizontally amounts to only about ""2K"" measured by the standard scale that has been used *in every measure prior to 4K*. To be perfectly precise, the exact number for a 16x9 set would be **4096 × 2304** (compared with **1920x1080** for HD). So, where psychologically the term 4K makes you think it's four times the resolution, it's actually only approximately twice the resolution.

Given that, and the fact that Red 4K cameras are referenced, I would speculate his ""K"" numbers are horizontal measurements, so really about 4000-4500 lines of resolution measured vertically.

Film grain is the actual chemical elements which capture the images onto the film (like the pixels on your computer monitor, but much smaller). Different film stocks (models of film, basically) can have smaller grain, allowing for more information to be captured by the same size film. To directly answer your question, there is an actual limit which is defined by the actual film grain.

We pasteurize milk to kill harmful bacteria. Pasteurization is one of the most beneficial things we do for public health, and it involves heating milk to temperatures that kill bacteria. Think of it like making sure you don't eat raw chicken or other raw meats. Actually, think of it this Thanksgiving, if you (or a family member) is cooking a turkey. People use a meat thermometer to make sure it reaches a certain temperature so that it's safe to eat. That's basically what we do with milk before distributing it for sale to the public.

Raw milk isn't pasteurized and can contain harmful bacteria (like e. coli and listeria and salmonella) that can make you really sick.

Haringoth,"Tissue types, depth and wound pattern primarily.

Picture ripping a sheet of paper in two. Fixing it is as simple as aligning the two sides and refastening them together. Now try punching a hole in the middle of the sheet, this is even simpler, as it closes itself and needs little alignment. Finally, cut a circle from the center, about the size of a quarter. This is a misery to fix, as new paper must be matched, and aligning it is a bitch.

These are three common wound types - A laceration, puncture and abrasion respectively. Assuming a clean break, a shallow knife incision perhaps, sealing the wound is straight forward. The tension of the skin serves to ""pull"" together the wound, and it is a simple sealing of the gap.

Punctures are even simpler, though they tend to run deep. In this, very little tissue area needs to be reconstituted and as a result, it is traditionally very quick.

In an abrasion however, whole chunks of skin are missing, and must be ""rebuilt"". This occurs slowly, as skin grows from existing skin towards the center, at a slow rate.

Deeper wounds can hit other tissue type, muscle or fascia primarily, and these require repair on top of any external healing.

Far from what the media would lead you to believe, Black Friday (which is the day after our Thanksgiving) isn't usually that crazy. Admittedly, it is insane at some mega retailers like Walmart and Best Buy, but not elsewhere. I've gone to some stores in the early hours of the morning to get a free gift card or whatever, and there's usually about 20 people standing in line in the cold. We all hang out together, talk about our Thanksgiving, discuss our Black Friday plans, sip on hot coffee, that kind of thing. Usually, a sales person will come outside about 20 minutes to opening. That person will give us each a number. Everyone who has a number gets the freebie, so there's no incentive to push people over to get in the doors. When the doors open, we walk in line to the store, collect our free item, and then browse the sales. When we check out, we are usually given a bonus gift card or coupon as incentive to come back that week. That's pretty much it.

strOkePlays,"Oh god... this is almost not an ELI5 concept, because you must have the concepts of math and logic available, and no amount of simplifying will change that....

With that said, here goes. There are two main kinds of encryption: symmetric, and asymmetric.

Everyone knows *symmetric*; if you put a password on a Word document, that's symmetric encryption. The password encrypts it, the same password decrypts it. Useful, but vulnerable to a lot of things, including someone else finding out the password.

Asymmetric, which public key encryption is the best-known example, doesn't use a password. It uses *keys*. The relationship between the keys is simple and straightforward: they do the opposite of each other.

There are two things you want to do to a document: *encrypt* it, or make it unreadable, and *decrypt* it, or make it readable again. In symmetric encryption, the ""password"" does both tasks. In public key encryption, you have two keys, and each does one at a time, and **only one at a time**, of those operations. If you use Key A to encrypt a document, you can't use Key A to *decrypt* it, it won't work. You can only use Key B to decrypt it. And vice versa; if you encrypt with Key B, then only Key A will decrypt. **Never ever ever can you use just one key to do both things.**

So smart people worked out that if you keep one of the keys secret, or *Private*, and expose the other key to everyone, or *Public*, you can accomplish two cool things:

* You can invite people to send you secret things. They encrypt with your Public key, and the encrypted file is safe. The public key can't do *both* things at once... if you use it to encrypt, it's useless to decrypt. So any sneaky spy bastards can steal the encrypted file but they can't decrypt it, only the other key, the Private key, can do that.

* You can send out messages encrypted with your private key. The message is NOT secret, because the public key is... public. Anyone can decrypt it. But that public key can *only* decrypt things coded by the private key, so they know it's from you. And remember, it can't do both things! If they change your message and try to encode it again, with the public key, well, that public key can't then decode it (it can never do both things), so everyone knows it's *not* from you. This is the basis for **electronic signature**.

Now, as for ""how does it actually work,"" there are two answers: logic and math. The logic answer is, there are some problems that are very easy to solve, but very hard to *unsolve*; we call these one-way functions. The simplest, classic case is prime factoring (there's a fantastic little algebra equation that lets you do a cool trick with prime numbers). It's very easy to multiply 67 x 107 and get 7169. But because 67 and 107 are prime numbers, they are the ONLY numbers that divide evenly into 7169. It's challenging for a human to look at 7169 and realize it's 67 x 107. It's even challenging for a computer, though computers are so fast they'd brute-force it instantly.

When you start looking at numbers like 8080031, and wondering what two numbers it factors into, it gets daunting for a human, though a computer still doesn't care. Where the computer cares is when the number looks like 77546620056920588113012600033948388271650013, and you have to figure out what two numbers it factors into, even computers start sweating. And numbers get much bigger than that.

Even so, we're getting too good at teaching computers to do it, and quantum computers will practically spit out the answer, so we are finding other one-way functions...elliptic curves, for instance, are very promising.

I'd add links, but a) other posters have already done so, and b) there is absolutely no such thing as ELI5 for the actual math. Good luck!",null,0,cdmwhjz,1rfri7,explainlikeimfive,new,3

One thing that can be tricky to understand is the concept of trapdoor functions. These are functions that are difficult or impossible to reverse without more information. Believe it or not, you were taught one of these in elementary school; you just didn't know it. Mathematicians call this function ""modulo"" (usually shortened to mod). Regular people call it ""take the remainder"". The mathematical equation 7 mod 3 = 1 just means that 7 divided by 3 equals 2 with a remainder of 1. You can't ""unmod"" an equation without all the numbers involved because some of the information necessary to solve it has been thrown away (the 2 in this case).

sp31415926535,"Imagine that you (I'm gonna call you Bob) and I (Hi, I'm Alice!) want to talk to each other securely, so that if there's someone else is listening to everything we say (call her Eve), she can't understand what we're saying to each other.

For this to happen, we'll need a [shared secret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret) - a piece of information that only you and I know. If we had such a secret, we could use it as a password for a regular, symmetric encryption algorithm (say, [AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)) and encrypt everything that we say. Now, if Eve can hear everything we say to each other, how can we come up with such a shared secret?

Here's one easy way ([Merkle's puzzles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%27s_Puzzles)).

I (Alice) create a million short messages, along the lines of

* Password number 1 is cat

* Password number 2 is dog

...

* Password number 123 is kitty

...

* Password number 1,000,000 is rabbit

I then generate a million random passwords. I'm gonna use short passwords though, say, no longer than 10 letters each (you'll see why!). I encrypt each message with a different password, then throw away the passwords, and send all these encrypted messages to you in random order.

You, Bob, pick one message at random. Pick any message you like. Knowing that my password is short, you can [brute force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)... well, just try all 10-letter passwords and decrypt the message you picked. You call me over the phone, and tell me - hey, Alice, I've happened to pick message number 123, so use password number 123. And now we have a shared secret! We both know to use kitty as the password, because I have the original list of passwords, and you've read of the messages I've sent you.

Eve would have to break about half a million messages before she stumbles upon the message number 123, so she has to do a lot more work than you did. Hopefully, she can't do it quickly enough and by the time she's done with it, we're done talking and enough time has passed so that the topic of our conversation is no
longer a secret.

Easy, right? Now, this isn't an algorithm that people use in practice (you can read about [Diffie-Hellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), [RSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29), etc. if you want), but I hope it illustrates the concept well enough. In any case, there must be something that is easy for you to do knowing only something that you know (your private key), but hard to do for anyone who doesn't know your private key.

On the other hand if your market is parents that can afford a book that will keep their toddler occupied for a little bit of time, your absolute numbers are much smaller and so you need to increase your price to compensate.

So they have a 7$ a month fee and a minimum $50 deposit to open it up. To waive the monthly fee, you need one of the two:

* $1,500 minimum daily balance, or
* $500 in direct deposit per month

So lets say that works for you - you go into Wells Fargo and ask to open up a Value Checking account. You have cash on hand, lets say $250.

You will need at minimum:  

* Drivers license or state ID (Photo ID is a must)
* Social Security Number

You will at first talk to a Teller, who will then get you to a Banker - sometimes they have a desk just for new accounts.

Anyways, you do some paperwork, they run some checks, and usually within a few hours, you have your bank account! A debit card will take a few days to arrive, typically, but some banks can issue them on the spot. 

Now, you have your checking account and a checkbook. Ask for a Direct Deposit worksheet or form - it will have info you will give to your employer, who can set up Direct Deposit for you. If you get that $500 in per month, bingo! No more monthly fee.

That's the basics - depending on how much you are storing, what banks are available, and what sort of advantages they provide, you might want to shop around and see what works best for you. Large banks have the advantage of more ATMs, small banks or credit unions might have better fee structures or other benefits.",null,0,cdmrmf5,1rfoka,explainlikeimfive,new,4
ka0t1k,"nearly all banks offer the same checking account type. to open an account they generally require an initial deposit of $25 to $100. There is no fee and the money should be available in your account immediately if paid in cash or in a couple of days if it's a transfer. the one downside to having a checking account is that if you dont have a direct deposit set up for the account or a balance of $1,500 then they will have a monthly charge around $10.

The Blockchain is a big list of which addresses hold what balances. Each block hereby represents a set of updates to be made to the balances. By following the blockchain from the Genesis Block and applying all transactions that were validated in each block in the correct order, you arrive at the current status quo.

Each block contains:

A timestamp

The hash of the previous block as a reference (except the Genesis Block)

At least one transaction: The coinbase transaction and any other that were validated

The Merkle Root

The block's own hash

Difficulty statement

**As many miners compete to find the next block, often there will be more than one valid next block discovered. This is resolved as soon as one of the two forks progresses to a greater length, at which any client that receives the newest block knows to discard the shorter fork. These discarded blocks are referred to as orphaned blocks.**

When a transaction is submitted to the network, it is passed on peer to peer by all clients. Upon discovery miners will put it on their list of transactions that they want to verify and update the Merkle Root.

On Blockchain.info you can track a transaction either by requesting the page directly with the transaction hash

TheRockefellers,"The ""wildcat offense"" is an offensive formation in (American) football.  It's a single-wing formation, meaning that (most of) the linemen and backs line up on one side of the center.  In the wildcat formation, the ball is snapped (usually) to a running back, usually to rush the ball with an option to pass. The QB lines up at a different position, or may not even be present at all. In some trickier iterations of the wildcats, the ball may be snapped to any one of 2-3 players, which keeps the defense on its toes.

One of the big advantages of the wildcat is that it effectively gives you more men on a rushing play. In a typical running play, the QB receives the snap and hands it off to the running back, then just kind of watches (instead of blocking). By snapping to the RB directly, you cut the QB out of the equation, and have more boots on the ground to block (or if the RB elects to pass, you have another receiver).",null,0,cdmrq6m,1rfnrq,explainlikeimfive,new,6

People often mix up Serotonin (the feel good hormone) with Dopamine (the reward hormone) and it should be noted that they are two distinct, different chemicals with different effects. 

Because it is a stimulant, side effects include jaw clenching, dry mouth, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping.

aeo2013,"As with almost all foreign policy pronouncements, you should consider what audience is being targeted and what the speaker's incentives are.  In this case, there are good strategic incentives for Israel/Netanyahu to appear hardline on this deal.

First, Netanyahu's domestic political situation is dependent on him being seen as hardline on Iran.  He has staked his reputation on this position and so, *whatever deal was agreed to*, he has to appear more hardline than that.  So, even if he actually thinks that this is a good deal, or a step along the way to a good deal (good in terms of what Iran would eventually accept), he has to publicly appear ""pissed off"", using OP's language.  

Second, there is the international audience.  The P5+1 negotiators (from the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany) will be able to get a better deal from Iran if they can point to a hardline Israel stance and say to Iran, ""Look, look at the pressure we are under here.  If you don't want Israel to reject the deal (and maybe unilaterally bomb your nuclear facilities), you are going to have to give a better deal"".  The P5+1 negotiators also seem more reasonable and moderate next to a hardline Israel.  

In addition to strategic incentives, there is a thing called ""fundamental attribution error"".  Briefly, this is a psychological phenomenon that all humans are subject to to some extent, where you think that you are a good person and forced to do bad things by your environment, but other people do bad things because they are bad people.  So, even though Israelis trust themselves to only use their nuclear weapons defensively, they think that Iran would use nuclear weapons offensively, even if that means effectively committing suicide (through nuclear retaliation).  This means that they are far more concerned about *ensuring* Iran doesn't have nuclear weapon capabilities than is reasonable/rational.

Israel not getting what they wanted from the US in regards to an issue like Iran is very unusual, and so they're likely just as upset about that as they are the actual terms of the deal.

On a more personal level, the Israel Prime Minister (Netanyahu) has generally campaigned on the idea that Iran is an imminent existential threat that can never be reasoned with,  and that his leadership is the only hope that Israel has of surviving.

Those opposed to a Iran gave up some of the bargaining power.  Currently, there are economic sanctions (penalties) against Iran to pressure the country.  The recent deal agrees to reduce the existing sanctions and to avoid creating new ones.  In exchange, some feel Iran's not doing much, so the US is surrendering its position of power for very little.

Concern that Iran will continue to make efforts to develop nuclear weapons despite the deal.

Issues relating to Israel's involvement in the negotiations.  Specifically, negotiations existed for months before anyone from Israel was informed.  Israel wants its views considered when negotiations with Iran take place.

Interpretations on what the deal says about Iran's nuclear future.  Israel doesn't just want nuclear progress halted.  It wants development stopped completely.  According to the Iranians involved in the deal, the agreement strongly implies that recognition that the country has a right to nuclear capabilities.  This is directly against the views of Israel.  

Limitations on what Israel can do.  In the past, Israel has made unilateral strikes against perceived nuclear threats.

Yes, there's definitely a biological aspect to it: Obama's skin is darker than his mother's and lighter than his father's, and that's controlled by his genes. However, genetics stop after mandating this and a few other traits.

Despite that, being black in America is quite different from being white in America. Black people face many challenges, opportunities, prejudices, and other surroundings that white people don't. In our society, black people tend to face more of the challenges and prejudices than is their fair share. Looking black comes with baggage. 

The fact is, Obama looks black. Without knowing his ancestry, I would guess that he was black or mixed, but never completely white. And therefore, he's been through life treated as a black man, regardless of his family tree.

So, when people refer to Obama as black, this is what they're talking about: he looks black, *and this is relevant because it affects how he grew up.* When people refer to him as half-black, they're giving more credence to his specific family tree; both are, in a sense, correct.

DavidLieberMintz,"I'm seeing a lot of jokes and people referencing the ""one drop rule."" Race cannot be determined biologically. There is no gene for black, white or Asian etc. There are, however, genes for the pigment of your skin, the color of your eyes, how curly or straight your hair is and on and on and on. It is the combination of all these physical attributes that we as a society use to invent and reinvent race.

Obama is considered black because that is the racial group he chose to identify with. Given the time and place he was raised, I'd say he didn't have much of a choice. But the key concept here is that race is something made up by people. YOU have just as much a say in your race as society dictates.

Consider the following.
Bob is a teenage boy who's father is black and mother is Puerto Rican. Bob and his parents live in a major US city. If the neighborhood Bob grew up in is predominately Hispanic, he will most likely identify with that group because he sees himself as Hispanic. Whether he looks more Hispanic or more African American certainly plays a role in making his race, but it is not the determining factor. What if Bob grew up in a black neighborhood? What if Bob grew up the wealthy suburbs? You can understand how this might change how Bob sees himself.

This will probably get buried, but I hope it helps you understand where race comes from!

Let's start with Fair Use 101.  Fair Use is an exception to copyright law that basically says you're allowed to use copyrighted materials as long as what you're doing falls within the Fair Use guidelines.

Why is the Daily Show allowed to do it?:
Fair Use specifically allows for others to use copyrighted works for ""criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research.""  11 U.S.C. Sec. 107.  If the Daily Show had to use five words to describe itself, I'm pretty sure the majority of those words would be in the description of fair use.

Why is Led Zeppelin so hard to find on Spotify even though radio stations play it constantly?:
This really isn't a fair use question.  The radio stations likely have a contract with whomever owns the rights to the Led Zeppelin songs whereas Spotify does not.

How does Girl Talk get away with what he does?
The simple answer to the Girl Talk question is that he hasn't been sued yet.  I don't know enough about fair use law to comment on why, exactly, he hasn't been sued.  

What he is doing may or may not be fair use and, until he is actually sued, we will not know the answer to that question.

Given that blood has a [storage life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_bank) of 35-42 days, this means you can significantly impact the blood bank's supply if you cross match for every surgery.  In order to get around this, people use type and screen instead if there is a very low likelihood of needing a transfusion (usually &lt;1%).

Type and screen is where you draw blood and have it as a sample labelled under your patient ID so they can use it to cross match blood or what not.  They will check the RH and ABO type, but it won't actually be tested against an actual blood specimen.  That said these blood clots have a limited life span, roughly 48-72 hours after which its no longer reliable to use in a cross match test.  So yes you can still know your ABO/RH pattern, but they won't be able to take that pre-checked blood and cross match it against blood in a jiffy should you need to be transfused.

_watching,"One thing to remember OP is that SCOTUS cases aren't always that simple. The justices don't work by going, ""does this fit what the party says is our political agenda? Welp I'm voting such and such a way then.""

How a justice decides is generally informed by their interpretation of the Constitution. You can read the opinions of justices on cases to see how they interpret it.

Generally speaking, as I understand it but don't my word for it please read up on your own on this, justices either have a ""strict constructionist"" interpretation (a restricted reading, basically 'go by exactly what the paper says') or a more loose interpretation that tries to find intent behind the document.

Of course, one could say one interpetation is more liberal or conservative, and this is what the president will care about when appointing a justice - does their interpretation back up my politics?

Of course, this interpretation business is heavily influenced by personal beliefs that also form political beliefs. I just want to point out this stuff. It's not like the justices are political entities like Congress members are. For instance, Scalia is very conservative, but was a fierce defender of video games as free speech. 

This is really rambly...

BrooklynLaw,"Generally, ""conservative"" opinions limit the federal government's power while ""liberal"" opinions expand the power of the federal government.  ""Conservative"" opinions interpret the Constitution literally and derive meaning by looking at the intent of the people that wrote it.  ""Liberal"" opinions generally treat the Constitution as more of a living document with a meaning that changes as the country changes.  

The Obamacare decision is a good example.  The question was whether the government had the constitutional authority to enact and implement the federal regulation of the national healthcare system.  The decision, which upheld the bulk of Obamacare, was seen by some as an expansion of the traditional role of government, and was thus considered a ""liberal"" decision.  Another example, the District of Columbia vs. Heller case, looked at the extent of the federal government's power to regulate private gun ownership.  The court found that the existing gun laws were beyond what the constitution allowed, and thus reigned in the power of the government.  In determining what the Second Amendment meant, they looked to what the founding fathers understood the Second Amendment to mean at the time they wrote it.  This decision was widely seen as a ""conservative"" decision.  

There are many exceptions, like the case Gonzales v. Raich, which dealt with the federal government's regulation of private marijuana production.  The ""conservative"" Justice Antony Scalia concurred with the majority, but his opinion supported an effective ""expansion"" of government power.  In this case, the ""conservative"" nature of his opinion could be said to fall in line with ""conservative"" political philosophy, which is different from ""conservative"" jurisprudence.

The space shuttle orbits the Earth because the space shuttel has a lot of sideways velocity.

Throw something straight up into the air and it falls back down to earth. Throw it away from you and it travels a short distance before falling to the ground. Effectively, it has travelled a tiny part of the way around the Earth.

Throw something with much more force it it will travel much farther before it hits the ground - that is, much farther around the Earth. If you could throw something hard enough, it would travel over the horizon. It would then have further to fall to Earth because the Earth has curved away underneath it.

Let's head up outside the Earth's atmosphere so that there is no wind resistance to slow our object down. Now fire it parallel to the ground and hard enough that the distance it falls in any given time is equal to the distance the Earth drops away underneath it. The object will then go repeatedly around the Earth. It is in orbit.

This is nothing to do with the Earth moving away from the object.

BrooklynLaw,"When the United States was made, there was a lot of differences between the states, as there still is today.  So in order to preserve those differences, the Constitution made a list of things that would be controlled on a federal (national) basis, and let the states make up the rules for everything else. The federal government is, in theory, a limited government, with all of its powers spelled out in the Constitution.  Any power not described in the Constitution is reserved to the states.  

For instance, the Constitution says that the federal government can declare war against another country.  Alabama cannot declare war because this ability is specifically given to the federal government under the Constitution.  Conversely, the Constitution does not list, in the powers of the federal government, the ability to generally police the population for crimes.  This is why you have 50 different rape laws and no federal definition of rape.  Alabama may have a different age of consent than what Maine wants.  There are tons of differences, but the fact that the federal government cannot do whatever it wants is the reason why there are 50 state constitutions with state legislatures making different laws.  This is also the reason why some federal laws are occasionally declared ""unconstitutional,"" because the Constitution specifically limits Congress's power to make laws in certain areas.  

The preservation of limited federal powers to the benefit of the states is to make the states experimental labs for different policies.  New York has much harsher gun laws than Florida, and policy makers can look at the results of those different laws in deciding how to move forward.  

The wikipedia article is very focused on the specific cases that expanded and contracted the dual federalism principle, and this could be confusing.  But all you need to know is that the Constitution spells out the federal government's legislative powers, which are limited, and anything not spelled out in the Constitution could then be legislated by the states or the people.  One more thing, the supremacy clause is important because it says that federal laws trump state or local laws.  So in areas where the federal government can legislate, if a state makes a conflicting law, the federal law trumps the state law.  A state is allowed to make supplementary laws that go beyond what a federal law says so long as it is not in conflict.  For instance, the United States congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect certain minority groups.  Many states have their own civil rights laws that mirror the federal law, but also include additional protected groups.  This is fine so long as it doesn't conflict with a federal law or the constitution.  

If you have more questions about the actual cases in the Wikipedia article let me know.  The cases are pretty interesting in learning how we got from a very, very limited government to a much less limited one today, but if you are just interested in the basic concepts, the article could definitely be confusing.

copiestopresponse,"Ok, they are actually called Roma, you wouldn't call an African a Nigger, so don't call them Gypsies, especially to their faces unless you enjoy being knifed on a Parisian street (I witnessed this on my first day in France).

Roma were basically nomads who migrated out of Central Asia to Europe. Due to the nature of nomadic life family is everything. Given Europe's history of tolerating non-white, non-Christians the Roma became very dependant on trusting in their family to survive.

Fast forwarding to today and you have multiple ethnicities of Roma who are distrusted by society and from birth are taught that Roma can only trust other Roma, and even then they are not fully trusting of Roma who aren't tied to the family.

The whole thieving and cons thing is not a stereotype, as that implies that it is based on a false assumption. Roma do frequently exploit non-Roma for a living, in their culture non-Roma exist to oppress them and to take advantage of outsiders is part-revenge, part-business, stealing from other Roma is frowned upon, stealing from the Family is pretty much asking to be killed/crippled/ostracised. In other words to them you're just an asshole with a wallet of money that belongs to them.

Don't think for a moment that a) they live as happy families, or b) that all of them do this. Roma families are suspected to have slightly worse rates of abuse than society, but due to their nature any police enquiry is going to be met with silence, I've heard unconfirmed reports of father's or uncles prostituting teenage girls, physical injury being used to punish and other such cases but its important to remember that a lot of stuff people say about them is hearsay, but they are effectively a culture of a different age.

As for b), well its not unheard of for some Roma to grow tired of the lifestyle that is associated with them. Moving out of it for them is hard as they have been taught to only trust the family, losing that support network is hard and often they will have to hide their background from outsiders to avoid bigotry and discrimination, especially in Europe.

Also a curious thing to note is that being multi-lingual is pretty common with them. I can't say if they have any cultural emphasis on learning other languages, but I can guess that it helps with regards to defrauding people.

snpp,"There are two kinds of gypsies (Well more, but this is like you're five) I will be focusing mostly on Roma since they're the ones I know things about.

There are the travellers from Europe, and there are the Roma.
The Roma is an ethnic group with hazy origins because they don't tend to write things down. The most common theory though is based on their language sharing roots with Indian languages, and posits that they must come from there if we go back far enough.

Both of these groups are travellers, and don't settle down very often. As a result most of them don't have jobs (Although they often take temporary employment), get educations (The British and Irish are really trying to get the travellers to stay in school, but they resist it), pay taxes, build things, or any of such things that we as non-travelling people have decided is productive.
So how do they feed themselves you ask? 
Government benefits, temporary employment, exploiting the local nature, and crime.

Now for the Roma this is based in a culture that doesn't acknowledge the laws of the countries they're in, preferring to follow their own internal rules. (In fact, some of the Roma clans don't acknowledge non Roma as people, and thus don't acknowledge that they have such things as property rights)
This understandably makes these countries and people react with hostility towards the Roma, who can then confirm their idea that these countries and people of ours blow chunks and they want nothing to do with them. So they keep travelling, they keep doing things that Europeans find unacceptable, and the Europeans keep reacting with hostility.
This hostility in the past has included everything from attempted genocide to asking them to leave.

Further, traveller culture often involves things that we as settled people find morally reprehensible, and vice versa obviously. Which doesn't help their image.",null,0,cdmqmrp,1rfhda,explainlikeimfive,new,3
ShinjukuAce,"They call themselves the Roma, or Romani.  They don't like the term gypsy for a few reasons: (1) it has become associated with an exotic image of caravans and colorful dresses and crystal balls that they say does not accurately reflect what their communities are like today, (2) it was derived from the incorrect belief that they came from Egypt, when in fact they were initially from India (more on that below), and (3) to ""gyp"" someone means to cheat them.

The Roma initially came from India around 1000 AD.  They were Indian Hindus who were fleeing the Muslim conquest of northern India.  Their languages and traditions even today have a lot of Indian and Hindu influence.  They migrated through the Middle East into Southeast Europe, and then many of them migrated from there into other parts of Europe.

In Medieval Europe, they developed a way of life that was migratory.  They would migrate around rural areas doing different services for the rural populations, like running carnivals, fixing wagons, knife sharpening, and fortune telling.  As dark-skinned and non-Christian outsiders, they were viewed as suspicious.  They were blamed for crime, rightly or wrongly, and were often persecuted and driven out of different countries and areas, and they were enslaved in Romania for hundreds of years until the 19th century.

They found their traditional way of life out of place in an urbanizing Europe.  Today, most are settled and no longer migrate.

The Nazis targeted them for elimination along with Jews, and it's believed that 500,000 Roma were killed in the Holocaust, and some scholars think the number is over 1 million.

In Europe today, there is a huge tension between Roma and the native populations.  With the European Union allowing freedom of movement, large numbers of Eastern European Roma have moved to Western Europe, where they are blamed for crime, begging, scams, and leeching off the welfare system.  Europeans often have personal stories about Roma crime against them or friends or family, and in any Reddit thread about Roma, you'll hear many of them.

On the other hand, the Roma and their advocates claim that most of them don't steal and beg, and that their entire community shouldn't be blamed for the actions of a few.  They also claim that many of them do want to work and get educations, and that the continuing hostility towards Roma, and the extreme poverty under which most Eastern European Roma live, is what excludes them from mainstream society and drives many of them to petty crime.",null,1,cdmux31,1rfhda,explainlikeimfive,new,3

The ELI5 answer is that two things are going on: the people with illegal jobs are settling their disputes the only way you can when you can't sue someone or call the cops (the first book I mentioned), and the people with legal jobs are suffering from PTSD and other stress-related breakdowns (the second book).

**Illegal dispute settlement:** Let's say that a friend or business partner or a family member of yours gets shot, or robbed, and you think you know who did it. The problem is, you can't go to the cops, because the reason you know is that you're involved in some illegal business, because that's the only job you can get that pays enough to feed your kids, whether it's doing illegal oil changes in the alley or pimping or running an uninspected, unlicensed catering firm or dealing drugs, and if the cops investigate your story, you're going to jail and your kids starve. So what are you going to do, let the guy who did this to your friend get away with it?

**Breakdowns:** Even the people who do have legal jobs are working way more hours than you can imagine, at jobs that don't pay enough to afford transportation, let alone health care or child care. As were their parents, which means that they're doing this despite having had to raise themselves. They and their families have also typically had to spend at least some time couch surfing, which means leaving their kids with lots of unfamiliar adults, which means that disproportionately large numbers of them were molested, raped, and/or tortured as children. Probably somewhere between a third and half of the working poor in America have PTSD or an even more severe mental disorder, for which they cannot obtain any legal treatment at all. The only treatment available to them, if they pursue even that much, is to try to treat their own symptoms with illegal narcotics, and that never goes well, and exposes their kids to even more risk, making the next generation's PTSD even worse. There is basically no way to raise healthy children in a working poor environment, not without at least some help from people who are much luckier in their circumstances and a lot of luck yourself.

Oil used for power generation is oil we can't use for anything else.  Fossil fuels are expensive, nuclear power is (relatively) inexpensive.

That doesn't mean they need slightly enriched uranium (they don't really need enriched uranium at all), that doesn't mean they need plutonium etc.  Which would be for nuclear weapons.  But of course they need those too, as Israel has them, Pakistan has them and appears to have an agreement to sell them to Saudi (saudi being an enemy of Iran) and the US has them.  If you want to ensure sovereignty of your country you need to point nuclear weapons at Washington, Los angles and New York.  

Japan has about 127 million people, so it's a fair bit bigger than Iran, but they have turned off ALL of their nuclear power.  That has made them post their first trade deficit in 28 years.  Oil and Natural gas are expensive, Iran is better to have some nuclear power and sell more of those to everyone else.  

The thing with nuclear power is that it has a long deep and complex pipeline to get going, along with the political squabbling.  Iran is going to want wind power and solar power too. But no one is going to complain about that, so they can go and buy those things the moment they're ready.

The physical part, which would be considered withdrawal, is bad. But if you don't have a psychological reason to want to do something than you will not want to start back up.

For example, I was on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs for a year and quitting was difficult, withdrawal was a bitch. But I don't have cravings for these drugs as they don't create psychological rewards for me personally (although anti-anxiety drugs like benzos can be extremely addicting).

Iirc cigarettes target the reward centers of your brain, so cessation of smoking will cause jitters, anxiety, frustration, and other manifestations from lack of nicotine (the addictive chemical in cigarettes). 

For long term heavy drug users (such as alcoholics/heroine addicts) you form a physical dependency to the drug. Basically, your body gets used to having the chemical compound in the blood and tissues, and reaches homeostasis (a natural balance) with the chemical and your body systems. This is when you lose enjoyment of the drug and just use it to not feel terrible. Withdrawal symptoms occur when you use a drug for a long time, your body gets used to the drug, then your remove it. 

Picture it this way. Lets just say in general drugs turn on or turn off parts of your body. When you take the drug for a long time, parts of your body are turned off or on (such as opiates and pain receptors). When you remove the drug, the part that was previously turned off turns back on (and even can turn ""hyper""-on) and the parts that were turned on can turn off. It throws your entire body into a frenzy and you get very sick.

thepatman,"&gt; it seems to me overkill that police officers use handguns with high capacity clips, while being trained to ""aim for center mass"" in order to quickly kill their opponent.

Let's correct this misunderstanding first: police officers do not 'shoot to kill' - they shoot to eliminate the threat.  

Your scenario starts with a misunderstanding of technology and the applicability of less-than-lethal(LTL) force.  First, most LTL options aren't disabling - which means that the threat still remains.  A person who is pepper-sprayed or maced still has their weapon, and can still fire with good accuracy.  Tasers **may be** disabling, but also may not be.  Often, people can take two or three shots from a taser and can still function.

For nearly all LTL methods, the deploying person must be quite close.  Pepper spray, mace and batons all require the officer to be within three to six feet of their opponent to deploy.  That's far too close for comfort when the other person has a gun.

Police officers are(usually) cleared to shoot when the subject displays the ability to use deadly force(gun, knife, et cetera) **and** the intention to use it.  Once someone with a gun indicates they're going to use it, by pointing it at the officer, reaching for it, or whatever, the officer isn't taking a chance that pepper spray or a taser are going to disable him.  They need to use the fastest, most effective disabling weapon - a gun.  It is far, far more likely that the gun will disable him than anything else.  ",null,0,cdmqjpc,1rfelk,explainlikeimfive,new,8

sterlingphoenix,"As others have mentioned, police do often carry non-lethal means.

But when they fire a gun, when they pull a trigger, the mentality has to be ""I am trying to kill someone"". Why? Because pulling a trigger is the ultimate extreme measure. It is absolutely not to be taken lightly. You don't shoot a gun to disarm a person, or scare someone, or hurt them ""just a bit"". Guns are lethal, and they should be thought of as such. And avoided whenever possible.

Now, as to why we're seeing a lot of reports of police shooting people (sometimes excessively), well, there are a few factors to that. 

First, there's the whole thing where the news isn't going to report ""Police today did not shoot a suspect"". I'm pretty sure there are dozens of non-lethal police interactions a day. Or hour. Or minute, depending on where you live. I read the police blotter for where I live and there's occasionally a chase, but that's it (and yes, I am in the US).  

Second, yeah, there does seem to be a rise in the ""shoot first, ask questions later"" mentality. 

But the thing about that is, being a police officer is *dangerous*. If they go into a dangerous situation, they're going to react to it that way and be ready to defend themselves. I don't know that we want to send police into those kind of situations and train them that it's better for them to get killed by a maniac than to shoot someone they perceive as a threat. And police officers probably feel threatened a *lot*.

afcagroo,"First let's talk about a .wav file.  Take a sound and capture it with a microphone (or a bunch of them, or their equivalent input devices). The microphone converts the sound (vibrations of the air) into [electrical voltages](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/Speech/mr/images/PZM_waveform.gif) that vary (quite quickly) with time. Use an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) circuit to convert that time-varying voltage waveform into a series of numbers. For example, 0000 could represent 0 volts; 0001 could represent +5 millivolts, 0010 could represent +10 mV, etc.  Stick that series of numbers into a computer file and you've pretty much got a .wav file. (Not exactly, but close.)  
  
Depending on how often your ADC [sampled](http://manual.audacityteam.org/m/images/0/0e/Waveform_sample_rates.png) the waveform and how fine the voltage steps are (the ""number of bits of resolution""), your .wav file could get kind of large.  So you use some special techniques to compress the file and make it smaller.  One major technique is to analyze the sounds and remove high frequency components that humans can hardly hear.  The mp3 algorithm applies a bunch of tricks like that to make the computer file quite a bit smaller. (It also degrades the quality of the sound somewhat in the process...mp3 compression is ""lossy"", meaning that when you reverse the process, the file you get back isn't quite the same as the one you converted in the first place.)   
  
To turn an mp3 file back into sound, reverse the process. Reverse the mp3 techniques to create a .wav -type file, send those numbers to a Digital to Analog Converter chip (DAC), and send the resulting voltage waveform to a speaker (probably using an amplifier first to make it louder).

barryspencer,"Well, it's difficult for me to explain what a migraine is without violating the ELI5 rule that we aren't supposed to express an opinion or argue a point of view. Trouble is, I'm the only person with my view of migraine.

My view: migraine is caffeine withdrawal headache.

Migraine / caffeine withdrawal headache is caused by adaptation to caffeine followed by abrupt withdrawal from caffeine. 

Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors. The nervous system adapts to caffeine by becoming more sensitive to adenosine. When caffeine is abruptly withdrawn, the caffeine-adapted person is left excessively sensitive to adenosine, and as a result the adenosine system malfunctions. Excessive adenosine receptor activation causes the headache and other symptoms of migraine / caffeine withdrawal headache.

Adenosine is a neurochemical that performs many functions. It dilates blood vessels in the head and neck. It also causes pain peripherally (outside the central nervous system): a tiny drop of adenosine placed on the skin causes a red spot (due to vascular dilation) and localized pain.

What causes migraine-related photophobia and phonophobia:

Adenosine is released from neurons (nerve cells). The major sensory apparatus of the head (retinas, olfactory bulbs, vestibular apparatus and semicircular canals, lips, dorsal surface of the tongue, and tooth pulp) contain dense concentrations of sensory neurons. During a migraine, those densely-packed neurons emit adenosine. Excessive intercellular (between cells) adenosine causes sensory neurons to malfunction. That's what causes the sensory disturbances associated with migraine.

A migraine doesn't ""achieve"" anything. The human nervous system resists plant toxins by various methods including neurochemically adapting to a toxin best it can. Caffeine is a plant alkaloid neurotoxin some plants make because it interferes with the normal functioning of the nervous systems of insects and thereby protects the plant by inhibiting the ability of insects to eat the plant. Humans who consume caffeine adapt to caffeine by becoming more sensitive to adenosine. That adaptation allows us to function fairly normally despite the interfering presence of caffeine. Unfortunately that same adaptation also renders us susceptible to withdrawal symptoms when caffeine is abruptly withdrawn. Nearly everybody uses caffeine, a headache-causing drug. Not surprisingly, therefore, humankind is plagued by headaches called primary headaches, including the severe headaches called migraines.",null,0,cdmurnf,1rfc7z,explainlikeimfive,new,2

AmonDhan,"&gt; And how the heck do we even measure how long a 'second' is??

Originally it was 1/86400 of the length of the day. But the problem with this definition is that the length of the day is not very stable. It can change [by an earthquake](http://www.space.com/11115-japan-earthquake-shortened-earth-days.html) and gets a little slower on average every year by the ocean tides. The length of the day has increased 2 hours in the last 600 million years.

As you can imagine, physicists do not like a unit of measure that changes every year, so they redefined the second so that it does not depend on the rotation of the earth. The definition changed over time, but it is now defined measuring some properties of the caesium 133 atom.

This new definition was used to establish Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). And this is the time most clocks and computers try to sync to. As the new second definition is not in sync with the Earth rotation, it happens that the UTC clocks and the solar clocks get slowly different readings. Once every 6 months this error is measured and when this error is more than 0.5 seconds, a second is added or subtracted to UTC at midnight. These are called leap seconds.

subdividing by 60 makes sense because it contains all the prime factors of 12 and it is also divisible by 10. it unites multiple numerical systems in whole numbers for easy conversion in a time where the decimal system was less dominant. Also many counting systems had a 60-system for high counts doable with 2 hands.

BolshevikMuppet,"The United States has what is called ""dual sovereignty.""  Basically, both the state and federal governments are their own fully-functional governments, and can have their own set of civil and criminal laws.  This can take four forms.

(1).  Many crimes exist at both the state and federal level (most forms of fraud, arson, extortion, bribery, kidnapping).  So, if I engage in fraud in Colorado, I could be charged with violating both the state law against fraud, *and* the federal law.

(2).  There are also many crimes which exist only on the state level.  There is no federal law which governs (for instance) murder or rape if done within a state.  Both of those apply only to crimes within ""the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.""  So, if I commit murder in Colorado, there is no federal law I could be charged with.

(3).  There are some crimes which exist *only* at the federal level.  Like treason, or violations of customs laws, copyright violations, or counterfeiting.  So, if I commit counterfeiting in Colorado, I cannot be charged by the state of Colorado, but would be charged by the federal government.

(4).  There are lots of things legal at both the state and federal level.  Basically, anything that isn't a crime.

So, what happens if you take situation (1) and turn it into situation (3)?  The short answer is that the federal government can still enforce its laws, but cannot compel the state to help.  So, the FBI and DEA can still investigate and seize drugs in Colorado, and the U.S attorney can still charge medical marijuana sellers under the Controlled Substances Act.

The cold air 'sinks' because it is more dense, and the hot air 'floats' up because it is less dense. 

Outside, the air around you has a lot of air above it, pressing down on it, giving us an air pressure. But the air higher up has a lot less air above it to press down on it, so the air pressure is a lot lower up there. It's an area of physics called thermodynamics, roughly speaking (ELI5), if the pressure of a gas drops, so will the temperature.

Hot air rises creating columns called thermals and cold air comes in to replace it (these are hot weather gusts), and they produce the fluffy white clouds as they condense, however as they rise they decompress, so drop about one degree celsius every 80~100m (law of gases).  Plus the sun keeps heating the ground which heats the air.  So we still have cold air aloft and hot air in the bottom and this curculation.

Outside gravity pulls heavier gasses closer to the earth increasing their pressure. As you go up only some gasses are light enough to get that high so they are allowed to spread out more, when they spread out the pressure goes down which makes it get colder.

daveisnotafk,"Society punishes murder because people form society based on what's known as social solidarity. When society is formed, different levels of what is acceptable are thus produced.. for example:

folkways are things that people do that receive a sort of 'minimal' punishment. For example.. in society if you are driving, and I am an 'asshole' driver that cuts you off dangerously, you may give me the finger, and swear at me in your car, and that's it. 

Moreys (pronounced moe-rays) tend to revolve around more taboo things, so for example, walking down the street with no pants or underwear on, or incest. They are worse on the scale of bad things because it's considered taboo. 

Now we get into the fun stuff, where does murder fit? Well, in society's generally accepted beliefs and values, there's a few types of 'crime' lets just say. Deviance and Crime. 

Deviance is basically where a person violates a More or Folkway (mentioned above). Their actions are not approved by society, but are very low compared to crime. 

Crime is often considered when a person violates a value or belief in society where it must be punishable by law. So, to wrap it all up, why does society punish murder? Well, murder isn't something that you can really compare to as say, vandalism, or walking down the street half naked. Society set up laws based on our culture, values, and beliefs, so although you could 'punish' someone by giving them the finger, killing them would not be permissible due to laws society sets up. 

**tl;dr**: Why does society punish murder? Because when society is formed, so is our culture, values and beliefs. Society forms laws that govern what is and isn't acceptable, and what is or isn't punishable by law. This isn't something to appease the family of the deceased, it's just how society works.

Most feral bees from the American SW south, and in the southern half of Florida are Africanized bees. Beekeepers keep them and local people have learned to deal with their unique behaviors. There are feral hives of Africianzed bees in central Miami, being 30ft up in a palm tree until someone goes over and kicks the tree repeatedly they aren't a problem. 

Africainzed bees are the same species as European honeybees just a different subspecies. Without lab tests they are indistinguishable from European bees. And since they breed freely with European bees our Europeans bees have almost all picked up African traits. 
The Africanized bees are more defensive not more aggressive. They defend the hive with more bees and are more likely to follow an attacker a longer distance once aroused. They also tend to nest in places that Europeans won't which causes more disturbances. European bees like tree cavities. Africanized ones will nest in the ground, like in the water meter, they will nest in electrical transformers or any cavity big enough to hold them with a small entrance. This means that people are more likely to find them, and accidentally disturb them than European bees. Imagine being an electrical worker in a cherry picker opening an box on a pole and finding a nest of bees. It doesn't really matter if they are Africanized or not if you cant get away. But its more likely he will find Africanized ones in an unexpected place like that.

Africanized bees also tend to swarm more. This means they form new hives more often and maintain smaller hives making the possible nesting locations larger. They are also willing to abscond, just pickup and leave a bad nest site and relocate, so it is more likely that they are found in an unusual place they just moved into.

afcagroo,"At the lowest level (almost), it runs due to the actions of transistors. Transistors in digital logic circuits are used mostly as switches. You want the transistors to be either all the way OFF (no current flow) or all the way ON (lots of current flow). And you can use the output of one transistor to control the input of other transistors, so you can construct a complicated circuit by wiring them up in certain ways.  

Using just a few transistors, you can build very simple logic circuits to implement binary digital logic (called ""Boolean"" logic after the guy who invented it).   
  
For example, imagine a light bulb hooked up to a battery through a switch. Switch on, light on; switch off, light off. Now imagine that there are two switches in a row, A and B. The light is only on if A and B are both in the on position. This is what a digital logic AND gate does! If you hook the switches up differently, you can just as easily make an OR gate (A OR B turns on the light). Label a switch backwards and you have a NOT gate.  
  
It turns out that you can build any digital logic function with a combination of just a few simple circuit types, such as AND/OR/NOT (you can actually do everything with just one, but no one really does that). By combining those simple circuits, more complicated circuits can be made (such as an adder, a multiplexer, etc.). You can use those circuits to make even more complicated ones. Like a CPU.  

It's like if you had a bunch of little Lego blocks, and you could use those to make larger Lego blocks, and you could then use those to make even larger Lego blocks, and so on. Today's integrated circuits use more than a billion transistors to make something that is very complex, but it is built up out of very simple things. Transistors are great for building these things because they are small, fast, reliable, cheap, and don't use a lot of power. These are all important properties when you are trying to make something that uses a billion or more devices.  
  
After you've built a bunch of different chips and put them into ""packages"", you solder those packages onto a Printed Circuit Board (such as a PC motherboard). The PCB has copper traces on it that act like flat wires to connect things together. (It is cheaper, simpler, better performance, and more reliable to use a PCB to do this rather than a bunch of individual wires.) It even has many layers, and connection vias going between layers or clear to the other side of the PCB. So now you can connect up different chips that do different functions, like CPU, memory, graphics, etc.  

They ""talk"" to each other via the traces on the PCB according to certain pre-determined rules, called ""protocols"". Kind of like the circuits, these protocols are built up in layers, with the lowest level protocol defining what signals mean ""0"" and what signals mean ""1"". These protocols get pretty complicated, and allow the different components to pass very complex information back and forth.   

The different parts of the PC have different functions, with the CPU acting kind of as the main brain and control center. It gets program instructions and data sent from the hard disc to the memory and then to it, manipulates the data as dictated by the stream of instructions, and sends data out to where it is needed. But the CPU does what it does according to the digital logic that has been built into it. 
  
  
  
Now that everything can pass binary information around and do things with it, what remains are ways to represent information, and describing how to do things to it. The latter is where programming comes into the picture...programs describe, eventually at the binary level, how to manipulate information that is in digital form.  

And pretty much everything can be digitized, more or less. A sound can be measured very very rapidly, turning its waveform into a series of numbers. An image can be represented as many rows and columns of tiny dots, each one having a color and intensity, and each of those colors and intensities represented by numbers. And numbers can be represented in binary so that digital logic can do things with it...transform it, transmit it, etc. ",null,4,cdmn634,1rf8u9,explainlikeimfive,new,66

So in Computer Science, there is this concept called 'abstraction', which is basically saying, 'you can ignore the details of how stuff under you works, and just know it works'.

By posting on Reddit, you are engaging in this because you don't really know how a computer goes from binary (1s and 0s) to a full, feature rich website.  And that's OK.  You don't have to know.  You just need to know that typing stuff in a box and hitting 'post' makes text show up.  That's abstraction.

So, it's well known that computers speak natively only in 1s and 0s, which would more accurately be described as a switch (on and off) instead of a 1 or a 0, but that's splitting hairs.  Know that each 1 or 0 is a 'bit' of data

So if your entire number system included just 1 and 0, how would you represent 2?  how about 20?  200?  What about the letter 'a'?

So a byte (8 bits of data) representing the value of '0' would look like this:  00000000.  '1' would look like this: 00000001.  '2' would look like so:  00000010.  And 3':  00000011.  And so on...

So, a byte being 8 bits gives us room to express 256 different *things*, and this is the foundation of basically everything.  A really common system to represent different *things* is ASCII.  In ASCII, each value represents a character and a complete table can be found here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters

----

A small aside here.  A lot of older games, especially NES games had a bunch of items that only every went up to 255.  This because it was stored as single byte in memory (or an 8 bit variable.  It's the same thing).  0 to 255 makes up the whole 256 values you can have, and going any higher is impossible.  That's the significance of that number.  

In more modern games, when numbers are really buggy, you might see a number like 4,294,967,295 or -4,294,967,295.  That's the upper and lower bounds of a 32-bit variable, so when you see whacky numbers around that, it's usually a result of an overflow error of some kind.

----

ASCII is about the 4th layer up from pure hardware in the really thick, onion that is computing.  Eventually, you develop programs where we say, 'Hey, the first 2 bytes of this document are going to represent what color shit is going to be!' and then we can say, 'Hey!  The first 6 bytes of this file is going to describe the font size, the color, and the distance between new lines!'.

This happens over and over again, adding new layers of complexity over the next 40 years, and we eventually end up with the shitstorm that is what we have today, and it's all possible because of abstraction.

Programmers generally don't know shit about computer hardware, because they don't need to.  You generally only know as little as you need to about your domain because knowing about every layer of computing simply isn't possible.  Hell, they generally don't know much about the specific layer they are working on.  I'm a .NET developer and I can tell you fuckall about how memory is managed in a computer, outside of the very basics of it because I don't have to worry about it.  Or if I want to generate a random number, I just say Random.Next(0, 100) and I know I'll get a number between 0 and 100.  I have no idea what is actually happening to get that number though.

Abstraction.  It's fuckin great.

mredding,"/u/afcagroo has the best answer here, but I just wanted to add that to be clear, a computer has no concept of a zero or a one, this is just an analogy for the flow of current or the lack thereof.

Computer programmers and computer scientists are less interested in talking about the flow of electricty or not, and it's too hard to be that pedantic.

We use the idea of zero and one for more than the flow of electricty or not, we use it to refer to a transistor emitting current or not, whether capicators (fundimental electrical components most often used to physically construct RAM) hold a charge or not, magnetic media (hard drives) being north or south pole, and more... All these things can be spoken of as either a zero or one, and what's physically going on is hardly the point when we discuss computation. The idea of numbers and counting is just an abstraction that represents the physical reality of how computers work.

captainskybeard,"It starts with the CPU. At this point, the ""logic"" is still hardware based - very tiny physical circuits that can transform data in a very basic way - multiply or add and subtract, for example.

The ""language"" the CPU speaks is a little different for each family of CPU. For example, it's different between 32 and 64 bit CPUs, mobile vs desktop, etc.

A computer program at its most basic level is said to be in assembly language, the language of the CPU. This is very difficult to read for humans. It is a series of these simple instructions we talked about earlier. Yet, every single application, game, and kind of program eventually boils down to assembly language.

We make assembly language by taking a high level programming language and running through a compiler. A compiler is nothing more than a very complex translator - translating from high level coding to machine instructions (assembly). A high level programming language like c++ for example, will be readable by humans and use things like if/else constructors, for loops, etc.

These are layers of abstraction. They go up yet higher, you can have a very high level language like Python for example, that deals even less with the low level system.

Really the highest level of abstraction is the user interface, with a GUI being the ultimate level of abstraction.

So, GUI -&gt; high level programming language -&gt; assembly language -&gt; physical CPU logic",null,8,cdmpjbx,1rf8u9,explainlikeimfive,new,12

So for example to browse reddit the HTML is the data that is loaded into the browser. The browser renders that HTML. To do that the browser  has instructions that effectively say: when I see X piece of data render Y on the screen.",null,8,cdmng4r,1rf8u9,explainlikeimfive,new,11
dts316,"At very bottom, like others have mentioned, you have circuit board with transistors with ""0"" as OFF (low current) or ""1"" as ON (high current).  Using this as a building block 0001 could represent numeric value of ""1"".
This is what CPU or machine understands, and hence machine language.

All CPU's come with set of instructions in the form of architect's machine code (machine language).  For example, set of instructions might consist of: 0001 as ""1"", 0010 as ""2"", 0011 as ""3"" and 1100 as ""+"" (addition) then 1100 0001 0010 would translate to ""add"" ""1"" and ""2"".  Which would output 0011, value of ""3"". 

However, this becomes unbelievably unreadable as you try to program more sophisticated programs.  So, low-level languages came.  Think, ""Assembly"" in early days of computer programming.  It's close to machine language but it bridges machine language with human readability by using mnemonic codes.  For example, instead of writing 1100 for addition you simply type ""add"".  And when Assembly language ""assembles"" it translates the word ""add"" to 1100 for you.  Now you have ""add 0001 0010"".  Low-level languages have whole set of operations.  I can explain more about different operations and symbols but I believe it would be beyond the scope of this. 

So, using the assembly or other low-level languages to bridge between machine and human readability, Operating Systems are made.  Microsoft Windows uses some assembly language for very low-level programming and C/C++ for higher level.  Once you have OS running you can begin programming in higher-level programming, such as C/C++ or Java, for more sophisticated programs like web browser or microsoft word.

Why do we use binary? 

Because that's all a computer can understand at the lowest level.

If we consider language, why does ""hello"" mean what it does?  Seems like a dumb question, but we have this string of characters h-e-l-l-o and somehow we interpret that to mean a greeting.  It's because we have an established code.  Why do we know that the letters g-o-o-d-b-y-e strung together mean a farewell?  Again, it's a code.  

Well, machines at the lowest level can only understand on and off (electrical current present or not present).  So we have to represent everything in binary to a computer.

This is not entirely bad - journalists don't know a lot about most topics and bloggers who are actual experts and don't try and reduce concepts to a 6th grade level end up being better than journalists on the whole.

But as was pointed out, journalism in TV/Radio etc. is much different.  For several centuries almost all journalism was Print.  Then along come radio and TV.  TV journalism worked well in the past because it was necessarily condensed and there were rules about 'fairness' in the US or the BBC in the UK.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine  is a summary of the US rules.

BBC still exists and it still going - as an arms length government agency it goes through periods of bias but ultimately they succeed because they first and foremost must report the truth, or parliament will rake them over the coals.  

The end of Fairness doctrine in the US has meant that rather than neutral independent journalists news now can have activists and advocates and pundits.  These are  people who present opinions in the style of a journalist.  

Where BBC can send people all around the world to do serious stories about countries americans  never heard of the big 24 hour US cable news networks aren't going to spend money on that.  They're chasing money, so 2-3 hours a day worth of news got spread into 24 hours of repetition and filler.  

Enter the Internet.  The internet undercut everything about journalism.   Traditional print media, which tries to sell ads on print and basically distilled news into a once every 24 hours or once a week type segments was crushed by instant reporting and experts (and non experts) who would weigh in on any topic for free.  Sort of like reddit. 

Big cable news networks have agreements with huge masses of local stations, but they're all too slow for the internet.  Packing equipment into a van and driving somewhere can take an hour, on the internet the first vulture gets the best meat, meaning a citizen journalist with a cell phone camera is going to win.   

The internet also provides essentially unlimited space for all manner of ideas - even things that are complete nonsense.  There's no way to enforce any sort of quality standards on the internet.

Real journalism takes time, not always very much, but in an era of instant gratification 24 hour news filling air time with speculation and babble, and the internet rapidly undercutting print the opportunities for serious journalism as a paid profession are seriously weakened.  Some of that is good quite honestly - being able to collect and organize actually serious experts on topics who can say serious things is a huge boon to humanity, adding a journalist filter to that made everyone worse off.  But most of the time you need journalists to figure out who the actual experts are, and to do serious reporting on serious issues, unfortunately that isn't as good for the bottom line as screaming stupid people filling air time.

The atlantic or Harpers or the New Yorker don't have the same reach they do today as they used to before the internet was ubiquitous. Getting published is hard because you have a smaller number of such publications, and fewer people willing to read an entire long-essay or book to get what they could get from USA Today in 800 words. 

Furthermore, what people look for in news has changed - news articles have to be fast in order to keep up in the internet era, so artistic or descriptive investigations are replaced by fast releases with skimmed details and quick-and-dirty pieces.

This is not to say that all articles are like this, but if you look at the media scramble that happens after any major disaster, you can see that the type of 'journalism' that most people see is very slap-dash.

Here is a list of different dating methods:

Absolute methods

Absolute dating methods rely on using some physical property of an object or sample to calculate its age. Examples are:

Radiocarbon dating - for dating organic materials

Dendrochronology - for dating trees, and objects made from wood, but also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates

Thermoluminescence dating - for dating inorganic material including ceramics

Optically stimulated luminescence or optical dating for archaeological applications

Potassium–argon dating - for dating fossilized hominid remains

Numismatics - many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record

Archaeomagnetic dating - Clay lined fire hearths take on a magnetic moment pointing to the North Pole each time they are fired and then cool. The position of the North Pole for the last time the fire hearth was used can be determined and compared to charts of known locations and dates

Lead Corrosion Dating.

Amino acid dating

Obsidian hydration dating - a geochemical method of determining age in either absolute or relative terms of an artifact made of obsidian
Rehydroxylation dating - for dating ceramic materials

Relative methods

Relative or indirect methods tend to use associations built from the archaeological body of knowledge. An example is seriation. Ultimately, relative dating relies on tying into absolute dating with reference to the present. One example of this is dendrochronology which uses a process of tying floating chronologies of tree rings together by cross referencing a body of work.

In practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of stratigraphic relationships.

Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers

Paleomagnetism: the polarity of the Earth changes at a knowable rate. This polarity is stored within rocks; through this the rock can be dated.
Tephrochronology: volcanic ash has its own signature for each eruption. In a sedimentary sequence the associated material within the ash layer can be dated, giving a date for the eruption. If this ash is found anywhere else in the world, a date will already be known (bearing in mind transportation time).

Oxygen isotope chronostratigraphy: this is based on the climatic stages displayed in SPECMAP relating to different cold and warm stages experienced in deep time; for example, point 5.5 in the SPECMAP chronology describes the peak of the last interglacial 125,000 years ago.

Colbolt,"There are lots of methods to date fossils but the two main ones are radiometric dating and carbon dating. Carbon dating is only useful for carbon based objects such as shells or trees and can only be used to date objects up to 50,000 years due to it's half life. Carbon dating uses C14 isotopes, half life is the time taken for the isotopes to decay, we can work out the remaining amount of C14 isotopes left thus giving the age.

Radiometric dating is mainly for fossils because it's very accurate and can date objects that are millions of years old due to it's half life. I believe it uses U/Pb isotope ratios due to their massive half life and U can be vary common is bodies of rocks.

user1492,"Cricket is very similar to the game of baseball.

In baseball there are two phases to the game: a contest between a pitcher and batter, and a contest between the batter and fielders.

During the first phase the pitcher throws the ball towards the catcher.  The pitcher wins if he can pass the ball over the plate three times without the batter striking the ball.  If the pitcher accomplishes this, then the batter is out and is replaced by another batter.

If the batter strikes the ball then we enter the second phase of the game - the contest between the runner and the fielders.  The batter is attempting to complete the circuit about the 4 bases without being ""out.""  He is ""out"" if:

1) The ball is caught on the fly;

2) The batter is tagged while running between two bases; or

3) The batter is ""forced out"".

If the batter reaches a base (and is not forced) he can remain on that base while another player advances to bat.

Cricket is basically the same.  There are two phases to the game: a contest between the pitcher (""bowler"") and batter (""batsman""), and a contest between the batter (""batsman"") and fielders (""fieldsmen"")

In the first contest the bowler is trying to get the ball past the batsman.  But it's not about strikes, he is trying to knock over a stick (""wicket"") behind the batsman.  The batsman may use his bat to deflect the ball from striking the wicket.  If the bowler knocks over the wicket, the batsman is out and must be replaced.

If the batsman strikes the ball we move into the second phase of the game - the contest between the batsman and the fielders.  The batsman is ""out"" if:

1) The ball is caught on the fly;

2) The batmen are between the wickets and a wicket nearest the runner is knocked over.

After the wicket, the biggest difference is that there are only two bases (""wickets"") in cricket.  There are two batsmen (and two bowlers), one at each wicket.

When the ball is struck, the batsmen score runs by switching positions.  They can do this as many times as they want (or until a wicket is struck).  But they don't have to run if they don't want to.

Most of the SNMP systems I've dealt with were more for monitoring and graphing trends, and alerting when thresholds were hit on the system(s) being monitored. 


Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an ""Internet-standard protocol for managing devices on IP networks"". Devices that typically support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and more. It is used mostly in network management systems to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.

SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications.",null,0,cdmpdrc,1rf4qo,explainlikeimfive,new,4

HabseligkeitDerLiebe,"""Socialism"" is an ill-defined word, first of all. In the US (and other places like France) it is used to describe a system where the state regulates the markets to archieve political goals.  
One of these goals usually is providing healthcare to the people without having the people pay the doctor directly. Or high wages for workers. But the state doesn't actively trade on the market.  
This system is called ""social-democracy"" in other places, like the German-speaking nations or Scandinavia.  
In these places ""socialism"" is what the Soviet Union did (and what Americans tend to call ""communism""). It's actually what the Soviet Union said it was doing (USSR = Union of **Socialist** Soviet Republics). There the state actually owned (most) of the production facilities and the products so it could dictate prices, there simply was no free market at all.

The nations in the EU are more or less ""socialist""/""social-democrat"", in the way that the state regulates things like healthcare or education in a way that these don't have prices that are regulated by the market to the end user (usually these are free) but the prices of physical goods are regulated by free markets.

S-corporation -- all profits and losses flow through the corporation to the shareholder tax return -- only one taxation level -- the $100 profits earned above will be treated as shareholder income and only taxed at shareholder level, so $100 profits result in only $35 tax with producer/owner keeping $65 -- known as pass-through entity because the profits and losses pass through the entity (as though it didn't exist for tax purposes) to the owner.

A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold.

There are different ways you can incorporate gold into a currency: 

- In the gold specie standard the monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin, but other coins may be made of less valuable metal.

- The gold exchange standard usually does not involve the circulation of gold coins. The main feature of the gold exchange standard is that the government guarantees a fixed exchange rate to the currency of another country that uses a gold standard (specie or bullion), regardless of what type of notes or coins are used as a means of exchange. This creates a de facto gold standard, where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself. 

- Finally, the gold bullion standard is a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but the authorities agree to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for currency.

Larger chains might get a better deal, depending on where they're getting their supply from, so they get more play room with their profit margins and are able to drop prices when needed to get ahead of the local competition. 

Location also plays a factor. In my city here, there are a few stations (Domo, mostly) who have locations on major routes, and operate a very bare bones operation, but generally offer a much lower price than any other store in the city, since their traffic is much higher.

Johnhaven,"The cost of fuel at the pump is determined by the price the gas station buys it for. Which, generally, is determined on a daily basis. The gas station owner buys their fuel from a distributor, marks it up a modest amount (seriously, this is usually only a few cents a gallon) and resells it. The gas station across the street that is a few pennies more isn't necessarily trying to make more money from their fuel, they simply may have purchased their fuel at a price that necessitates the resale price at what you see at the pump. 

Gas stations do not change their price of fuel based on market fluctuations, they change their price of fuel based on market fluctuations that are passed along to them when they fill their in ground tanks so they can't make adjustments to fluctuations until the next time they buy fuel. If fuel dropped ten cents in the last week, they may be able to skim a few pennies per gallon off the top but they still need to charge at least what they paid for the fuel to recoup costs until the next fill up at which time they would pay a much lower price and then pass that savings along to you. 

Contrary to public opinion, higher gas prices actually lead to less profit for gas station owners. As prices rise, consumers become more scrutinizing of prices at competing stations than they normally would so station owners have to cut prices to compete with each other leading to smaller profit margins per gallon than they would otherwise see.

Kanye West may not be the best rapper out there, but his songs sound good (to most people), and they sound good because he produced them.  He's produced lots of songs for other rappers, like Jay-Z.  

If you were more interested in the role of a rap producer in general, basically most producers will start off with either a sample of music or a general drum beat and build a song around it.  A sample is a snippet from another artist's song that is altered in a way to incorporate it into a new original song.  Take Kanye's song ""Gold Digger,"" he started with a sample of Ray Charles's ""I Got a Woman"" and incorporated it into the song by looping it and laying it over a beat.  He created the drum beat in a similar fashion, using sampled drum sounds, but he likely didn't sample those himself.  Many producers can buy large batches of drum sounds as well as other instrument sounds from independent sample libraries.  If you gave 100 music producers the same sample from Ray Charles ""I Got a Woman,"" they may end up making 100 very different songs, of which, chances are, you'd end up liking Kanye West's the most.  Just like giving 100 chefs the same ingredients, chances are the best chef will create the tastiest meal.

They have a very strictly defined set of beliefs that are codeified in an old book that all followers are expected to believe quite rigidly. On top of all that, monotheism has been dictating Western society for well over a thousand years, and whilst it used to do a lot of good, it's easy to look at it's place in modern society and say we don't need it any more, let's get rid of it, giving an avenue for criticism.

Polytheism, first and foremost, isn't as visible a target. It's also not embedded in our social structure; you might complain about some puritan law being passed by Christians but you can hardly complain about some Hellenic pagan belief that isn't doing anything to guide politics and force your behaviour. Less than that, and as a pagan I'll admit somewhat subjectively, polytheists are often more accepting and less dogmatic. Having a pantheon of gods makes it possible to accept that other people's beliefs can have merit, that your worldview makes sense to you but maybe other gods do exist outside your sphere of worship. We don't try to stamp out unbelievers or followers of other religions There's also absolutely zero mandate to preach and attempt to convert. We live and let live, do our own thing in private, and don't attempt to influence society beyond seeking acceptance. That's largely why people don't feel the need to go out of the way to criticize us. On top of all that, it's difficult, because we're not organised religions with a central authority to bitch about and directly criticize, it's just individuals doing their own thing.

Not that we should be above legitimate criticism. As a norse pagan, we have a problem with racist bullshit amongst our numbers.

The rating agencies rated them AAA (the same rating as bonds issued by the US Government), due to the fact that each MBS has mortgages from all over the country. The models that the rating agencies used assumed that there would not be a general decline in home prices across the country. 

It's actually more complicated than that, because what the bankers really did was bundle together hundreds of mortgages and then they separated it into different securities in a process called ""traunching"". In essence the security was split into several layers, all the losses would be born by the riskiest layer first, then the second riskiest layer, then the third, etc. In order for the final layer to have any losses every single other layer would have to be wiped out. Those layers were rated AAA by the rating agencies, even if the underlying mortgages were crap (for instance if the owner of the house doesn't even have a job).

The problem was that everyone assumed these securities were safe, so banks would hold them as ""Capital"" or the cushion used to absorb possible losses. These securities turned out to be pretty much worthless, and many banks found themselves essentially bankrupt. 

There is even more to this, as AIG and other banks sold ""Credit Default Swaps"" on these traunches of mortgage. This was essentially insurance that said ""If the homeowner doesn't pay you, I will"". The sellers of this ""insurance"" had to pay up and nearly went bankrupt (or would have if the government didn't bail them out.

The question is, however, why did all this happen? Some people would blame it on greed, but that would be like blaming an airplane crash on gravity (can't claim that analogy as my own). In my opinion, it was the housing bubble that caused the crisis, as banks and potential home buyers thought that prices could never go down and therefore all the investments described above were extremely safe. 

So why the housing bubble? In my opinion, we printed an astronomical amount of money that ended up being funneled into the home building sector.",null,9,cdmmfr7,1rewgh,explainlikeimfive,new,11

There are lots of different branches of economics, Austrian, Keynesian, Mainstream, Post-Keynesian, Chicago, Marxist, even Feminist economics, and depending on the model you use you will get a different answer to the question.


Basically banks gave people lots of loans to buy houses. The price of houses kept going up so people bought houses as an investment (i'll buy it for $10 today and sell it for $15 next year, and use the $5 I made to pay back the loans). One day the market crashed, and houses that were worth $10 one day were all the sudden worth $5. Since some people were counting on making money later from their houses (which kept going up in value) to pay back the loans, when the market crashed they couldn't pay back the loans, and all the money the banks loaned out basically disappeared. This crash which really hurt the banks eventually hurt the stock market, and then hurt the whole economy. 

That's about as simple and objective as I can make it.

HarryLimbs,"&gt;But how are they conteolled?

Say there are only three companies with only one factory each in the world that produce cars.

Normally, their stock value is dictated by the general state of the economy - the better it is, the higher is demand and vice versa. In the times of stable economy, more cars are being bought, thus more profit is being generated by the factories, thus the dividends from the stock are higher, thus its value is higher.
During bad times, when the population's purchasing power goes down, less profit is being generated, there are less dividends from the stock and its value is lower.

Now, let's assume that one of the factories has burned down. It is going to take time and money to rebuild it, thus there will be very little profit to be had, thus there will be very little dividends from the stock and thus its worth will plummet. At the same time, the worth of the other two companies' stock is going to rise up, as decreased supply and competition will be working in their favour, allowing them to dictate prices more freely while making more sales than they usually do.

Now, each of the two remaining companies has each presented a new car. Company A came up with a really great car that will definitely be very popular. Company B came up with a really shitty car that won't be popular. Company A will have its stock value increased due to the expected number of sales, and company B will lose some of its stock value due the poor prognosis of its new car sales.

The currency is backed up by the state of the economy of its country. When US economy is on the rise while EU is facing problems (like Greece), the dollar to euro ratio grows in dollar's favour.

Throwcrastinator,"While I would want to elaborate on the background of nuclear proliferation in Iran (Assassination of Mohammed Mosadegh, Bushehr, Natanz etc.), that would take quite a while, and frankly, I'm lazy. So lets make this quick.

&gt;1) Why are we scared of Iran's nuclear operations? Even if they create a nuclear weapon, it seems to me extremely unlikely that they will be dropping the bomb on countries? Does the world seriously consider that Iran might drop a nuke on a western country?

Well, you are right, It would be highly unlikely that Iran would even dare announce that it is creating nukes, more than actually use them. Such an announcement would only invite more sanctions, wrecking their economy, 

and as far as usage is concerned, I doubt ANY nation would want to even CONSIDER using nuclear weapons, as nuking any other country is plain suicide, and WILL warrant retaliation from either the said nation, or any of it's allies. This was the basis of the cold war, the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. (Google it if you wanna know more)

Now the point is, Iran making nuclear weapons will most definitely spark a nuclear arms race in the middle east, which is something which the P5+1 does not want. Considering the Israel-Palestine situation, and much more recently, the situation in Syria, it is safe to say that the region is unstable. If Iran were to enrich weapon grade uranium, well, chaos would ensue.

Moreover, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, or the IRGC, the national guard of Iran, has several links with Hezbollah, Hamas, Jabhat Al Nusra, and various other 'terrorist' outfits and non state actors in the regions. While nation states wouldn't bother using these weapons, the western world sees a real threat in nuclear terrorism. Iran could potentially supply these groups with weapons grade uranium and wreak havoc. 

Furthermore, Iran is setting a dangerous precedent to other countries, in possibly violating parts of the NPT, which could worry the P5.

&gt; 2) The recent nuclear deal from what I understand is to delay Iran's nuclear operations for six months in return for removing sanctions. How is this a historic deal? They will be at ""it"" again in six months. I guess I do not understand how this is beneficial in the long run. Six months seems like nothing.

It's historic because, in the years since 1979, this is the closest we have got to, in getting Iran to quit their nuclear program, and this is a much better result than the failed six party talks with North Korea. This is beneficial for both Iran and the world, because
i) Lesser economic troubles for Iran, due to the removal of sanctions
ii) Gives the P5+1 more breathing space, and of course, more time to engage in talks.

In the long run, these six months could mean more talks with Iran, which could result in better relations with Iran and the west, and seeing that diplomacy is one of the weaker departments of our current dealings with the Middle East, this could be extremely beneficial. 
With this, one could be more confident of the complete removal of sanctions on Iran, which would mean a lot to both Iran and countries (like Germany) involved in trade with Iran.

Aside from that, one of the primary symptoms of depression is feeling useless and worthless. In primitive hunter-gatherer societies where everyone contributed much more from a younger age, it's very likely that depression would be even less prevalent in the population.

Since the gasses are still burning in some cases, the suppressor can also make it harder to spot the ""muzzle flash"", which can be important for military applications.

A large part of the sound of gunfire with a high velocity round is the ""crack"" of the bullet as it travels at supersonic speeds. Suppressors can't do much to stop this, so if you want a quiet shot, you have to use subsonic ammunition which travels slowly.

garrettj100,"OK, if you want a visual way of looking at this problem, imagine you're starting out in a x,y grid at 0,0.  And now imagine there's a circle inscribed around the origin (0,0) with radius = 1.  That's called the *Unit Circle*.

Now, let's take it a little further.  Imagine that you've got a horizontal line going from 0,0 up toward 1,0.  That line defines a created from the angle it forms with the y-axis.

When it's at 0 degrees, then it's a horizontal line and you're not defining a triangle rather than just a horizontal line.  But as you increase that angle θ (imagine the minute hand sweeping **backwards** across a clock face) you define a triangle.

The *hypotenuse* of that triangle is the line emerging from (0.0) at angle θ.

The *adjacent* side of that triangle is the x-axis, going exactly as far to the right as the hypotenuse goes.

The *opposite* side of that triangle is a vertical line, dropping down from where the hypotenuse hits the edge of the circle.

Here's a diagram of what I'm talking about:

http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa09/Rosonet/EMAT%206690/essay2/rosonet_unitcircle2.gif

Now, it's pretty easy to see what the sine, cosine, and tangent functions do.  They calculate out the ratios between the opposite and adjacent sides relative to the hypotenuse, but in this example, the hypotenuse is conveniently stuck at exactly 1, so you can see the opposite and adjacent sides of the triangle growing and shrinking.

There's also a ""shorthand"" way to remember the values of the sine and cosine functions at important angles:

* sin(0°) = (0/4)^0.5 = 0
* sin(30°) = (1/4)^0.5 = 1/2
* sin(45°) = (2/4)^05 = 2^0.5 /2
* sin(60°) = (3/4)^0.5 = 3^0.5 /2
* sin(90°) = (4/4)^0.5 = 1

These values are part of the continuous function, sin(x):

http://i.stack.imgur.com/ghCG1.gif

________________________

* cos(0°) = (4/4)^0.5 = 1
* cos(30°) = (3/4)^0.5 = 3^0.5 /2
* cos(45°) = (2/4)^05 = 2^0.5 /2
* cos(60°) =  (1/4)^0.5 = 1/2
* cos(90°) = (0/4)^0.5 = 0

Here, for cosin(x)

http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/cos-graph_clip_image003.gif

This last image is **particularly** valuable, as it's showing the values of cos(x) as they relate to the vertical value of the triangle's *adjacent* side in the circle.  I couldn't find a corresponding image for sin(x).  If I had, it would've probably had to have the graph of sin(x) above or below (instead of to the left/right) of the circle.

________________________________


There's one last thing to keep in mind.  Often, sin, cos, and tan values aren't shown for 30°, 60°, 90°, etc...  Instead they're shown for values like π/6, π/2, or π.  Why?  Because there are two commonly used *units* for measuring angles.  The first is degrees.  But sometimes people use a unit called *radians*.  The reason they use radians?  Because radians work out such that an entire circle is 2*π radians.  Why?  Because for a unit circle, that just so happens to work out as the circumference of the full circle as well.  It's not an accident.  The idea is you can trivially determine the circumference of the arc defined by an angle by expressing it in radians.",null,10,cdmhdui,1reilz,explainlikeimfive,new,14

Fairleee,"The default position for humanity on any topic is, 'do nothing'. If there is a particular problem that needs to be tackled, you need to somehow motivate enough humans that, instead of defaulting to doing nothing, they do something. We can see this on a micro-level. I'm sure a lot of kids don't want to go to school; they'd rather stay at home (this is the 'do nothing' option). The aim is to get them to go to school, i.e., 'do something'. So, how do you do this? A combination of carrot and stick: you promise them both long and short term benefits that going to school offers (long term includes better jobs and therefore standard of living resulting from an education, short term includes seeing their friends, being offered activities that they enjoy such as music, sport or drama etc.), and have both long and short term 'punishments' in place if they don't go (missing out on education harms their future education and career prospects, repeated absence increases likelihood of social services getting involved, absence results in discipline from parents in whatever form - being grounded etc.). The end result is, the kids are motivated to go to school because doing something will yield a net positive result (both in terms of rewards and by not being punished) compared to doing nothing.

When it comes to climate change, the science is agreed that humanity is having an effect on the climate, and this effect will likely to be detrimental to humanity (of course we aren't going to destroy the planet, but we can make it far, far harder for humans to live on). But, as with anything, our default position is, 'do nothing'. So, we need politicians, business leaders, societal leaders, religious leaders etc. to take a stance, that something needs to be done, in order to motivate us to do something rather than do nothing. Unfortunately, the things we need to do are pretty hard - it would involve massive reductions in the amount of fossil fuels we use, widespread curbing of CO2 emissions by factories and vehicles, major investment in green technologies. Furthermore, we aren't likely to see the benefit from this for some time, so it is hard to motivate people with promises of future benefits without some short-term, immediate benefits. Of course the benefits will be there - less air pollution, better designed cities, disruptive technological development etc., but this is years down the line. In the meantime, there will be a cost to pay. You know how much we like to buy cheap things? Put in place carbon reduction requirements for business, and those cheap things will get a lot more expensive.

However, these issues are not insurmountable, if we have a consistent message from society's leaders that they are necessary. Unfortunately, there is entrenched opposition to this, from people who are benefitting from the status-quo and don't want to see it changed (looking at you, Big Oil). They are responsible for putting out two messages; firstly, that there is not sufficient evidence that the problem exists (which isn't true), and secondly, that the cost of it will massively outweigh the benefits. They use a number of techniques, including exploiting people's well-known propensity for conspiratorial thinking by suggesting that all academics are part of some shadowy plot designed to pull the wool over the world's eyes in order to continue receiving funding (FYI, the amount of funding that goes into climate change research is nothing compared to the oil industry's annual revenues). People who oppose the human cause of climate change don't try to disprove human-caused climate change, and don't need to - besides, they can't. But, by muddying the waters, by insisting on the need for further research, that the evidence isn't there, that models climate researchers users have some flaws, the general public does not have the education they need on climate change, and therefore there is not enough impetus to do something. Because the people aren't demanding that something be done, politicians, business leaders etc. don't need to do something. Yes, there are calls to do something by a number of groups, and some things are being done (Germany for example is massively investing in green energy), but there isn't sufficient will to carry through on a broad enough scale to make the changes that are needed.

rearviewclouds,"The short answer is no.

The longer answer is way longer than this post, but it starts something like this: 

You hit the nail on the head with one of the reasons - transplant surgery is ""major"" - there are risks involved with all elements of the surgery:   anaesthetic, the laparotomy  (i.e. it is 'open' surgery), and the surgery is technically difficult and fiddly. 

To be allowed to donate your kidney in the first place, you must be in sufficiently good renal (and otherwise) health to operate on just the one - essentially, you are pretty much perfectly healthy, just with one kidney. Thus there is no need to subject a ""healthy"" person to the risks of a major operation/anaesthetic and the challenges of post op recovery (infections, blood clots, pneumonia etc etc)  


Another big reason is that organs need a blood supply to survive, and decay starts as soon as the blood supply is lost.  In transplant surgery there are strict time limits for taking organs out of a 'donor' and being put into a 'recipient'. Sooner is better. 

After a certain time, the organs undergo irreversible changes that mean they won't be able to usefully operate, even if they were put back in another person.   Organs are put on ice until they are ready to be plugged into the donor, which limits the rate of decay of the organs, but damage from a lack of blood supply is always inevitable. (Google things like ""cold ischemic time"" and ""warm ischemic time"" for further details.)

Essentially, most of the donors are patients in ICU environments who are 'brain dead'.  They are on 'life support' which means that machines have taken over the job of keeping the airway open and providing oxygen/nutrition to the body. Blood is still pumping around their body, getting to the organs (kidneys, liver, heart, lungs etc) - but not the brain.  

So the kidneys are still alive and working, and are suitable to be put into someone else. During the transplant retrieval operation, this blood supply is cut and the organs are removed. Ultimately, the donor dies during the donation surgery. Clearly, this is a huge thing to consider for the donor's loved ones - one of the many reasons organ donation is such a complex area. 

(The other main scenario is a 'live donor' situation such as you are talking about - where the donor has an operation to retrieve the organ,  thus normal blood supply is maintained right until the operation to donate)

So... in our scenario - it would be technically possible to get your kidney back, if the person you gave it to became brain dead in an ICU type environment. 

But you would be doing fine without it.

(Organ transplantation is a huge and complex topic - this is only the beginning of the explanation. The ethical/spiritual side is also fascinating)

anubis_of_q,"Unfortunately no.  When your kidney goes into the recipient, their body immediately starts attacking it.  Doctors do some testing to help reduce the amount of damage host does to the donor kidney (HLA typing), but it doesn't check for everything, which is why transplant patients are placed on immunosuppressive medications (medications that reduces the immune system of the host). 

Those drugs are also toxic to the kidneys as well.  So its a balance between drug toxicity and immunosuppression.  Thus, the kidneys will undergo damage, and over a period of years will become dysfunctional (people with transplants do not return to normal life-expectancy, it is just temporarily elongated).  Longterm causes of mortality of people who undergo transplantation will be that they either die of the infections secondary to immunosuppression, diseases secondary to the cause of the original disease requiring the transplant, or kidney failure from drug or host damage.  

so in the end the risk of the surgery does not outweigh getting the kidney back.  You would be hardpressed to find a surgeon who would be willing to do the surgery.  

Now i do remember an article published awhile back that stated that a transplanted kidney was retransplanted into another patient who needed it (not back to the donor), because the cause of death was irrelevant to the kidney itself.  The first host also had the kidney for a short period of time. But this would be the exception rather than the rule

lmckl1,"Hey reddit. I work for organ transplant. Although it is not outside the realm of possibility for this to happen, if you were in need of a kidney you would likely receive one from another donor. There are a few points to take into consideration:

-The kidney you donated will likely be in rough shape from years of anti-rejection medications and other meds the recipient is likely on.
-How functional is your own remaining kidney? If you're fine and don't need a transplant, they are not going to do it. It is no small surgery.
-Speaking of surgery. Do you want another one. Many living kidney donors end up having complications after their donation such as large hernias under their incision site. When receiving a kidney, it is attached to your abdominal aorta, so you would have an incision site at your belt line.
-What did the recipient die from? If they died from renal failure, you probably don't want that kidney back.

I can only think of one organ donor that I've seen that has also been a recipient- but their heart was going for transplant, so that's probably why.

When you are spinning in one direction for a while, the fluid (which acts like any liquid) is pushed to one side (opposite the direction you are spinning). Little hairs in your ear pick up on this and send signals to your brain which allow you to perceive the spinning. 

Do this long enough and your brain reacts like it would to any stimuli that is constant--it starts to ignore it. This is because it would be overwhelming for you to always be aware of things stimuli that are constant anyway (for example, you're not really aware of the feeling of your arm resting on a table after a while). Anyway, since your brain is ignoring the stimuli caused by your spinning, your body assumes it is in a state of normalcy. Then, when you stop spinning, all of a sudden the fluid is back to normal and throws your brain out of whack. This is what causes dizzyness.

So basically, in your scenario, you're spinning at the same rate as the floor, but in the opposite direction. Your net spin, therefore, is no spin at all.

MCHaker,"A credit card isn't actually a necessity, though it is usually one of the first things that come to mind when people think about credit in general. There are a lot of ways to build your credit, from paying bills on time, leasing a car or renting a home from an agency that reports to credit bureaus. As you mentioned, though, the initial step while purchasing or leasing something is usually a credit check. Another good way to build credit is to take out loans for which you have the assets/cash on hand to immediately pay back. It is good to have a somewhat substantial payment history, but you can pay them back right away (just be sure there are no early repayment fees). 

I believe you are asking why is having credit better than having no credit history at all, while assuming that if you have no credit history you are not living beyond your means and can afford what you want to purchase. The problem with that is that businesses, such as banks, have no way of knowing whether or not it is actually you that is the responsible party funding your lifestyle. Many people rely on parents or whoever for money, so giving a mortgage (for example) to someone who is perhaps relying on someone else for money (or at least can't prove a reliable track record for making payments on time) would be an irresponsible business practice and would almost surely result in financial loss. In summary, if you can afford what you want to buy, and that object is a house, buy the house out right and do not take a mortgage out. That shows that you can't afford the house, but you can afford a mortgage.

If you don't want a credit card, paying off student loans or a car loan can help build credit. Having no credit history doesn't give a creditor the idea that you don't buy things you can't afford.  Lenders for mortgages might examine your expenses to income ratio and that's going to be a clear indicator of that anyway.

Having a credit card doesn't mean that you live beyond your means.  They can provide liquidity and opportunity costs when used properly.  A BAD example is using a credit card to buy a huge TV because it's on sale--that's not helpful at all.  

But for a good example, I keep very little savings in a liquid account.  Most of my savings are in ETFs or Mutual Funds.  So that way I theoretically can earn a good return on my savings as opposed to the ridiculously low interest the banks pay.  If I have a major unplanned expense (car needs new tires?) I will usually just charge it to my card and pay it off in the same month when I get my next paycheck.  If there's a major difference in what I can come up with from my check, then I'll withdraw money from my stocks.  

Keeping a running balance on a credit card is only a good plan if it's a lower interest rate than you'd get from something like a home equity loan or some other non-revolving account.

In the most basic sense, it works like this-
Insurance companies charge everyone a certain amount each year. In return, if you have a problem, they pay for it. If you don't have any problems, the insurance company keeps your money.

It's profitable because most people don't actually spend as much as their insurance coverage each year. So overall, the insurance company makes money. 

As a system, it works because the insurance company can manage the cost of the relatively few unlucky people that get hurt a lot, by using some of the profits from the relatively healthy people. But people still want the coverage, because if you're the unlucky guy that breaks both legs and needs to spend 200k on surgery and recovery, you're screwed without insurance.

So at room temperature and pressure, water molecules pull on each other enough to sort of stay together as a liquid.  If you heated the water, which gives the molecules a lot more energy, than the attraction among the water molecules wouldn't be enough to hold them together, and so you'd get water as a gas (steam).

So now we have hydrogen and oxygen.  Hydrogen and oxygen are both fairly light, so it doesn't take much energy to get them moving pretty fast.  More importantly, the pull between two individual hydrogen molecules or oxygen molecules isn't particularly strong.  There's a bit, but not very much.  So, at room temperature and pressure, they are both gasses. 

But when you put them together, you get a very different kind of molecule.  The oxygen atom in H2O pulls hard at the electrons in the hydrogen atoms that attach to it, giving you a molecule with much stronger magnetic ""poles"" than the two elements when they are apart.  

As a result, the pull among all the water atoms is much stronger than the pull among the hydrogen atoms or oxygen atoms when they were apart. Thus, you end up with a liquid, rather than a gas at the same temperature and pressure.

police-ical,"Wires are a common analogy for neurons, the main cells of your brain (and the rest of your nervous system.) It's a fair comparison: neurons are long and thin, rapidly conduct electricity to carry signals, and even have a coating of insulation.

Neurons communicate with other neurons at points called synapses, where they almost but don't quite touch. Instead, one neuron sends chemicals called neurotransmitters to the next neuron; different chemicals make the next neuron more or less likely to keep the signal going.

Whereas most body cells divide to make more of themselves, neurons mostly only come from neural stem cells. By adulthood, your brain has (almost) all the cells it will ever have. As a result, you can't rely solely on making new neurons to make new memories, learn new things, change your emotions, and such.

Synapses, on the other hand, can be made or eliminated (and strengthened or weakened) throughout your entire life. This process of changing the connections between brain cells is what ""rewiring"" broadly describes. In that sense, rewiring happens anytime you learn anything, make a new memory, or even use an old memory; it happens every minute of the day. People commonly use ""rewiring"" to mean something more like ""changing my patterns of thinking or behavior in the long term,"" which is obviously a little harder than making a new memory, but still very much possible. We'd have given up on cognitive-behavioral therapy a long time ago if it weren't.

Big picture: Given that you have maybe one hundred billion neurons, each with thousands of synapses, the total number of connections is likely in the hundreds of trillions. This helps give an idea of how the brain, which resembles a three-pound blob of fatty Jello, can be responsible for everything you've ever felt, learned, or experienced.",null,0,cdmfldp,1redsm,explainlikeimfive,new,3
uberneoconcert,"""Neurons that fire together wire together."" If you have a memory that brings to distressed feelings, every time you take yourself through the memory, those feelings will be even more strongly associated with the memory, even if your memory becomes faulty. The worst part of this type of memory is the association with out of control emotions that may escalate too quickly so you feel physically bad as well. 

Anyway, what you can do in this case is to break the memory into parts, like movie clips, and in between clips, imagine a moment that is strongly positive: like locking eyes with a loved one or your puppy, so you get a little oxytocin. Then play the next step back, rinse, repeat. Do it a few times and the memory won't play all the way through anymore so easily, nor will those negative emotions escalate like they did before.",null,0,cdmfx0w,1redsm,explainlikeimfive,new,2

That's less than $1500/month for a single person, and just under $2500/month for a household of three.

I live in Brooklyn and have made about $800/month for the last six months while stupidly trying to save a failing company.

**How people get by:**

* Roommates. Even if you aren't poor, if you aren't *rich* you probably have roommates. If you tried to rent alone you're unlikely to find anything, even an illegal windowless basement apartment in the outer boroughs that floods when it rains, for less than $1000/month. Get three or four rent-paying adults together, and the cost per individual starts to go down. If you don't know anyone in NYC you could move in with, check Craigslist room-share ads.
* Every room can be a bedroom. My boyfriend and his roommate shared a one bedroom; my boyfriend had the bedroom, his roommate's mattress was in the kitchen, which was the only other room they had. My apartment is officially a 3 bedroom with a basement; we subdivided the basement with curtains and turned it into two more bedrooms.
* Think small. When I first got here, for $500/month I slept in a 6ftx9ft windowless room that was legally classified as a closet.
* Think alternatives to conventional apartments. A friend of mine really wanted to live in Manhattan, and not have roommates. For $650 he rents a small dorm-style room with shared bathroom and kitchen in a building otherwise mostly populated by elderly Chinese immigrants.
* A lot of artists also rent ""studio space"" that isn't legally zoned for housing, then ""secretly"" sleep there. But they have to be pretty discrete, can't have a visible bed or anything that obvious. I've known some who set up lofted ""storage space"" that hides a futon mat behind rows of paint buckets. Bathroom is down the hall, and there is no kitchen or shower, so get a hot plate and a gym membership so you can shower there.
* Forget Manhattan; the outer boroughs are much cheaper. Average commute is 45 minutes; bring a book. 
* Debt. I racked up a lot of credit card debt when I first moved here, buying stuff like food and toilet paper and my train card. Recently I went a bit further into credit card debt, sold my car, borrowed money from relatives, and finally had to cash out what little retirement savings I had. Hopefully I'll find a new job before that runs out.

Luckycharms323,"The Federal Reserve (Fed) is actually not a United States entity.  The Fed board of governors represent the private banks in each of their 12 different regions.  The Fed essentially operates as any other business except their assets (dollars) get printed any time they wish.  With these assets they buy certain liabilities such as treasury bills (foreign and domestic), gold, and lately, mortgaged backed securities. Once purchased these become part of their balance sheet.  

The Fed has two main objectives - to stabilize interest rates and keep unemployment low.  There is debate whether any thing they can do has any effect in the short term.  However in the long term, there is evidence that they can pull off these objectives.

Your question is rather open ended and the topic is very deep, but I assume you are asking because of the the qualitative easing programs that have been going on since the start of the financial crisis.  The Fed's balance sheet has quadrupled since the beginning of the financial crisis.  This is unheard of in the history of the Fed.  The two main liabilities that have been purchased with all this printed money have been mortgaged backed securities and US treasury bills.  The reason that these two liabilities were purchased is to maintain low interest rates of US t-bill and get toxic housing assets of the balance sheet os the banks.  The reason that inflation has not exploded is because, although this money is out there in the economy, it is not being used for many everyday transactions yet.

There is much debate about what would happen if some of the liabilities default but as we have never seen an inflated Fed like we do today it is impossible to say what the actual consequences would be.  I believe not much would change and they would just print more money and buy more liabilities.

Cold fusion: being able to sustain a nuclear fusion reaction (e.g. combining to Hydrogen atoms to get a Helium) at room temperature.  It's called cold fusion, because room temperature relative to a nuclear reaction (think the sun) is pretty fucking cold.  It's a change in the atomic structure of matter.

Cold welding: Taking two metals that are really fucking smooth, and touching them together to make one continuous piece of metal (e.g. taking two piece of steel and permanently sticking them together) at room temperature.

BolshevikMuppet,"Well, the first thing to understand is that at all times in every modern economy, the government is constantly printing money.  When people talk about the negative effects of ""printing money"" they're talking about ""if we print too much of it, things could go bad.""

But let's take a step back.

If your economy is growing (and we like growing economies) some amount of growth in the money supply (printing money) is good.  If the economy grows, but the money supply doesn't, you're going to have deflation.  Money becomes worth more, and people are less likely to invest, bad stuff happens.

So, you want to keep adding money to the economy because the economy is getting bigger.  Slight inflation (money becomes worth less, everything costs slightly more) is a good thing for economic growth compared to the alternatives.

So, within reasonable constraints, the U.S can continue to print money until the end of time (or the robot uprising) without ill-effect.

**So, what's concern?**

Well, there are two things that can go wrong if we have too much inflation.  First, there are consistent concerns about ""hyper-inflation.""  Basically, the currency gets so inflated that it becomes essentially devalued, and the economy suffers hugely.  It's not just about wages increasing alongside costs (they would) but that there ceases to be any confidence in the economy.  People stop working, stop selling, stop using money.  And that's bad.

The second concern is a loss of confidence in buying American debt, which would be really bad.  When America runs a deficit, we sell what are called ""bonds"" to individuals and countries.  Those bonds have to be paid with interest at the end of their term.  When investors are confident that we pay our debts, they continue to buy bonds at low rates.

But, imagine for a moment that you lent me $5 yesterday (enough for a gallon of milk), with 20% interest.  Today, the money supply doubles and while I still owe you $6, but a gallon of milk now costs $10.  The value of the debt goes down, because my debt has been ""monetized.""  It will cost me less in terms of how much work I have to do, or goods I could buy, in order to pay you back than you spent originally.

It's why in any loan, you'll see that it is written as ""LIBOR + 5%"" or ""Fedfunds + 7%.""  They peg the interest rate to inflation.

But, imagine for a moment you lent that money to the government.  You might look at the devaluation of their currency and say ""screw this, they're trying to devalue their debts, I won't lend them any more money.""",null,0,cdmdt4f,1re8n7,explainlikeimfive,new,3

A cow is like a human. We are both pretty much bones, muscles, and fat. 

The more a muscle gets used, the tougher the meat is. So if someone was gonna eat a human, arm meat would be pretty chewy. So would leg and thigh meat. 

Since the animal's legs and neck muscles do the most work, they are the toughest/chewiest/least tender

The butt of the cow (known as the round) is the fairly cheap cause cow rumps are hard and muscly and have little fat so the meat is tougher. 

Ribeyes on the other hand come from the upper rib cage area, which does not support much of the cow's weight, so they are perfect. A little bit of fat (intramuscular fat aka marbling) and tender soft meat makes this a delicious easy to eat cut of meat.

Lastly, there's playback.  Like the phone's microphone, the speakers are also sub-par.

The number of people who need transition-related care is far smaller than the number of people who need dental work, and the consequences of not being able to transition are incredibly severe, so part of it is about getting maximum return for minimum expense.

(For example, my home province covers several specialist services that aren't available there... but those procedures have to be performed in-province to be eligible for coverage.)

Trans people are a small, stigmatized minority group that the general public doesn't understand, so even if a group of us gets together to pool our scanty resources and do something about the situation, public backlash is usually so extreme that provincial gov't will throw us under the bus to appeal to their non-trans constituents who are yapping about our ""lifestyle choices"". To government, it's win-win: we're officially covered by provincial health (so the province looks good on paper from a human rights perspective) but in practice, it's incredibly difficult to get care (so as little funding as possible actually goes towards helping us and the uneducated voters don't get their shorts in a twist).

Light is an excitation of the EM Field, and photons are quantized excitations (essentially the wave acting as a particle).  The vacuum of space, like everywhere else in spacetime, is permeated by these Fields.

Another Field of recent interest is the Higgs Field - excitations in the Higgs Field are what (probably) give rise to mass.

BB, Bb, bb. Her baby got the bb combination. This is the only case where the blue eyed b will not be masked by the brown eyed B(i.e. the baby will have blue eyes).

Look at it this way: for there to have been no incest of *any* degree in your family tree, your grandparents must not have been related to each other at all.

sir_sri,"&gt;What exactly is incest? 

Different cultures and societies define it slightly differently - but it's basically when you have sex with a close relative (importantly, when you have children with them).  In most of the world that would be relations closer than first cousins, but first cousins is ok.  (So parent and child or siblings or half siblings).  

&gt;How do the first 2 humans and their immediate descendants mate?

The first two 'humans' were a parent and child, and there's no reason to think they had children with each other.   

Some biologists would probably get annoyed at my terminology here, it's been a while - basically population groups can interbreed and not produce offspring at all, produce fertile offspring, or not.   Modern humans are far enough removed from any of our primate relations that we can't produce offspring at all (nor can people and Cats even though we are both mammals). But human population groups gradually evolved and the point of what counts as a modern 'human' is somewhat arbitrary, one day a child was born that was a modern human, but looked pretty much the same as mom and dad, and that child had children with someone who was of the same species as mom and dad, but that child was also across the threshold for being human, and they kept having children with other members of the overall tribe - and a few generations and everyone is a 'human' and not what immediately preceded but looked a lot like humans.  

About 200 000 years ago the 'parent' species of modern humans existed - Homo Sapiens http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Homo_sapiens, modern humans are a subspecies of that, so if any of them existed we could likely have fertile offspring with them, though they seem to have been replaced somewhere between 200 000 and 90 000 years ago by modern Homo Sapiens Sapiens (yes the repeated sapiens is deliberate, and yes, that's us).  Somewhere in there or contemporary to Homo Sapiens where Neanderthals - who might be the same subspecies or might not.  

If you were living at the time you wouldn't have know the 'first human' as being necessarily particularly distinct - evolution is a slow gradual process involving large populations and propagating genes through those populations (or eliminating genes from those populations).  Some future anthropologist could look at you and say you mark the first line of a New species as separate from your parents - where we draw lines for historical species is somewhat arbitrary and it's not like we have fossil records for every human like thing that has ever lived, so there's no clear break of 'one generation is this another generation that' it's more of a 'this fossil from 40k years ago is enough different from the one from 160k years ago that we call them different'.

Since they think that spirits are not bound by human limitations and are thus never in morally grey areas, but either ""pure"" good or evil, they consider the concept of ""real"" magic to be toying with insanely evil forces whose evil far surpasses that of any humans, and is thus dangerous to even humor the concept. They consider fiction that glorifies ""witchcraft"" then to be opening the doorway to kids getting into it. (even if they think it's a game, and not real.) 

This is further exaggerated with the advent of new religions like wiccanism or some forms of neopaganism, where some practitioners call themselves ""witches,"" and pretend to have a link to historical witches, and be a similar belief system. Since historically witch was a name for people seen as evil and utilizing evil forces, some Christians now think that those people are indirectly playing with the same forces, and thus at severe risk.

The big difference now though, is that in QM nothing is certain. Our world is now based on probabilities. What is the likeliness of finding an atom at a certain energy or a wave penetrating a barrier?

One of the key principle of QM is the uncertainty principle. The more precisely we measure one aspect of a particle (like its velocity) the less certain we can be of another aspect (like location). Think of it like this. If I want to measure the location of something, I'm have to see it. How do I see something? I shine a light on it and observe it. Now if I shine a light on a car, it won't do much to the speed of the car, will it? And my measurement of the cars location is very large, say on the order of inches. Now the flip side. I shine a light on an electron to see where it is. Well I saw it, but now the photons (particles that make up light) hit the electron and off it speeds. I no longer know it's speed. Thats because I have to measure its location to a lot more precision, say microns, so my knowledge of its speed must be larger.

BolshevikMuppet,"It's an oversimplification.  The biggest division between liberals and conservatives is in how freedom is understood. 

Liberals define freedom as freedom of choice: in order to say that I am truly ""free"" to do something (or have the right to do something), it must be that I actually have the practical ability to do it.  So, if we say that students have the right to go to college, we have to make it that a student can actually choose to go to college.  Liberals certainly believe in restrictions on government power.  But they are more concerned about the inequalities and inequities of life, and are willing to use the government to give everyone the same *choices*.

Conservatives tend to define freedom as freedom *from* interference.  If I say that I have the right to own a gun, that doesn't mean the government has to buy me a gun, it just has to get out of the way when I want to buy one.  Conservatives certainly believe in government protection of basic rights (prohibiting, and prosecuting, murder, burglary, rape, etc.).  What conservatives are more worried about, though, is government infringement of rights.

But the liberal argument is *not* government should be indiscriminately bigger.  And the conservative argument is not *the government ought not exist*.  Both are premised on what they view as the rights and freedoms government should ensure. 

So, take abortion.  To a conservative, it is no different from murder.  The government does not allow the intentional taking of a life by another.  To a liberal, it's simply not murder, and instead is a medical procedure we must provide a *choice* for women to make.

Gay rights is a lot trickier, since that's really more of a moral and religious thing.  But, at the end of the day, the Conservative position on it can be phrased as:

""Government exists to protect basic principles, ethics, and the beliefs of society.  Government can tell you that you can't murder me, it can tell me that I can't steal from you.  It can tell us all to adhere to basic principles of decency and ethics as decided by society at large.

nwob,"Because during the 20th century, the terms 'liberal' and 'conservative' changed in the US.  The previously conservative Democrats took on the term 'liberal' and changed it's meaning, primarily beginning with the New Deal in response to the Great Depression.

Liberal ideology means that, by and large, people should be free to do what they want.  But freedom can be characterised as both *""freedom from""* and *""freedom to""*.  To explain those terms, Republicans often talk about 'freedom from government', whereas Democrats often consider the idea of people having freedom of opportunity, as provided by free education/healthcare/etc.

In any case, the terms are essentially meaningless.  In American politics (which I can only presume is what you're referring to), conservatives frequently want Federal government to stay out so that State governments can regulate their way over people's sex lives (in terms of abortion control and opposing gay marriage) while opposing gun control, whereas liberals would prefer government to 'stay out of the bedroom' and loosen recreational drug laws but many would quite happily advocate increased gun control.",null,2,cdm9wp1,1rdxu8,explainlikeimfive,new,4

bunker_man,"Strictly speaking, gay rights IS more government. ""Rights"" in this circumstance is a list of thigns that people in society would be forced to do for you, not (for the most part) more things you would be personally allowed. It is in theory decreasing overall freedom, not adding any. (For instance, insurance companies would be forced to treat you like a collective unit.) A libertarian answer would be not having any civil recognition of marriage at all. (This one is a bit up for debate, but you get the idea.)

However, the real answer is that those are general issues. It's not like the actual thing they disagree about is how big they want the government. They have different ideologies, which OVERALL one of wants less government, and the other wants more. Conservatives think society is something people just exist in, and the government is there mainly to make sure people don't do anything severe to hurt eachother, but beyond that they are allowed to do as they want. Modern (american) liberals view society in the form of interaction between adult groups which the goal of government is to push into equal standing. 

So conservative morality is more about personal morals and actions; often in your own circle. Liberal morality is about group circles interacting. Which is why conservatives accuse liberals of not understanding or caring about personal morality, or children (abortion, lenient views of how much divorce harms children, etc.) And liberals accuse conservatives of not understanding that if their group has it better then they have to equalize the group situation. (gays, welfare, etc.) One of those requires a much bigger government than the other. (Or at least is generally assumed to.)

And of course there are different ideologies that are a combination of the sides. Centrism, libertarianism, communitarianism, etc.

If the people never paid them they would just let them be.

GrapePlasma,"Ok we'll it's a lot to talk about but you can imagine it like this. 
There's your intravascular space full of blood and its constituents. Then your extra vascular space which is basically everything else. When you burn your finger on the frying pan and you get that fluid filled blister, it is basically fluids from your IVS that migrates out in response to the injury. Google transudate and exudate for more info on why fluids from the IVS might seep through the blood vessels to the other side. 

The two compartments are separate. So you aren't just filled with blood. In acute inflammation for example, your white blood cells must respond to the injury or pathogen. So lets say you get a splinter  your WBCs will want to eliminate the threat. But they are in the IVS so they actually migrate to the walls of the blood vessel and squeeze out of the vessel through the cells of the vessel wall to reach the EVS. 

Now for what is between your organs. Your lungs are covered by a double layered membrane called pleura. And it's double layered so it has a potential space between the layers filled with a fluid. It's to reduce friction. To imagine how it's double layered, imagine a balloon that you blow up. Then you press on side of the balloon until you reach the other side. That's sorts how the lung bud develops. It pushes into the balloon and eventually the balloon is just a double layered membrane surrounding it. Between your lungs is the mediastinum which has its subdivisions. Basically the heart and its pericardium etc, the trachea, oesophagus, various nerves (vagus, phrenic etc) reside between your lungs. 

The GIT is a little more complicated. But it also has a similar concept like the pleura but its called the peritoneum.  Interesting fact: the peritoneum is completely closed in males but in females it just goes around the uterus and is incomplete lower down. If the peritoneum covered the entire female reproductive system, then the baby would have to bust thru that on its way out. So technically you could blow into a vagina and air would seep into the peritoneal cavity. It's not as crude as that but p there are procedure involving introducing air or fluids to check for leaks, if I'm nit wrong.

All parts of your body have proteins, and without them, you could not function. What gives these proteins their abilities is their unique shape. Proteins are really one long chain of amino acids bent in various shapes depending on the order of the aminos. At certain extremes, pH extremes, and other situations, these proteins unwind back into their original shapes. At this point they are useless.



In most mammals, proteins much sooner when in contact with heat than with cold. The 20 degree change is enough to ruin those proteins so your body responds.

Thaimeancurry,"History and politics grad here: WW2 has been broken down into a very simple story that is easy to tell to kids. Most wars or genocides are very complicated. Both sides have arguments, both sides caused it to some degree, no one is completely innocent. Often the winners are more in the wrong than the losers. But with WW2, the losing side was completely and utterly wiped out and erased from existence. Because the war is painted as everyone verses Nazis rather than Germany, which still exists and has people and feelings, there is no need to tell the story anything other than black and white.
(Just to clarify, I am by NO MEANS defending nazis, simply that their annihilation makes the basic story a simple one to tell compared even to WW1)

So the basic story of WW2 is simple for school kids to understand: Hitler and the nazis try to take over the world because they are evil. The basic story of the holocaust is simple too compared to other genocides. Hitler tried to wipe out an entire race of people just because he didn't like their faces essentially. In other genocides I've studied, while the actions are no less horrific, the details are murkier. There is usually a civil war or some other huge internal upheaval in the country. There is a lot of violence and death and destruction other than the genocide, and it can be hard for observers to tell what exactly happened. The holocaust was also very coldly organised. People were singled out for a particular reason, rounded up, imprisoned, starved and murdered on a massive scale. Life was more or less as normal for the rest of the population while Jews were stripped of everything. Compare that to the Khmer Rouge which was trying to purge 'subversive elements', and essentially picked victims on random whims and slaughtered masses. People still don't really understand what happened there. 

The final reason is the nature of the victims. Jews have always lived all around the world. The trait that singled them out for murder is shared by many people in many places. In other genocides this isn't the case, the people picked are very localised, and don't really live anywhere else. How many Tutsis do you know? Or intellectual Cambodians? Or Bosniaks? How many of them are middle class Americans? Not many I'd guess. The holocaust is remembered because it was relevant to powerful groups who wanted it remembered. A genocide that happens to middle class white westerners makes more of an impact on the world than one that happens to Africans or Muslims.

Inside the large part of history, the enemy in WWII of the current western civilizations was committing genocide on a massive scale.  People were disposed of in mass quantities because they were seen as inferior and sub-human.  Sure, there have been many genocides throughout history, but nothing happened on the scale of the holocaust.  6 million (or more) people were exterminated because a small group of powerful people decided they shouldn't continue living.  On top of that, the Nazis couldn't get rid of the Jews quick enough, so they invented ways to kill them more quickly, cheaply, and efficiently.  Many people argue that Stalin killed more people and should be talked about more in regards to his evils, but while he may have caused more death and suffering, nothing was as systematic and deliberate than Hitler's holocaust.  The American school system probably wants to highlight the fact that so many people died because a small group came into power, under the will of the governed, and caused so much destruction.  Judging by the values a majority of Americans have of civil rights, they'd probably want to emphasize the Nazis terror in order to make it less likely to happen in the United States under our noses.",null,0,cdmdegm,1rdvms,explainlikeimfive,new,2

In contrast, internet via satellite is a two way street, and the satellite is 22,000+ miles away from you (give or take.)  This induces a fairly large amount of time between your request, up to the satellite, back down to earth at the station, and THEN on to the internet to go get whatever it is.

In a healthy eye light coming in from a particular direction will be bent by the lens so that it focuses on a specific point on the retina. That's the colour/intensity you perceive coming from that direction. Do that all over the place and you have yourself an image.

In someone with near/far-sightedness the focus point of that light is either in front of or behind the retina. The part that hits the retina from some direction is a small blob of light. This blob overlaps with those from nearby directions, so one spot on the retina sees light from a whole region of space, leading to blur.

Scenario_Editor,"[Wiki section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_solar_cells#Cell_temperature)

So your run of the mill solar panel works because the electrons in the silicon are separated into two layers. There is a bottom layer of electrons with the silicon itself (the valence band), a layer of no electrons (band gap) and a top layer of electrons that move around (conduction band). A photovoltaic cell works be having a photon (light particle) come in and give its energy to an electron in the lower layer so that it can jump from the inner layer over the layer of nothing and into the top layer where the electron can move around and essentially create a current. [This is also why silicon  is called a semi conductor, because it conducts in some situation and insulates in others]. 

Now, that band gap (the layer of nothing) is partially dependent on temperature. Temperature is sort of like the average energy of all the electrons, the majority of which are in the lower valence band. A higher temperature means that they will have a bit more energy and the band gap will be smaller, so you'll get more current out of your cell which is good.

 Bandgap has its fingers in many pies though, and changing the temperature is changing the bandgap. Changing the bandgap will change the highest possible voltage that the circuit can have. Higher temperatures end up having lower maximum voltages

[This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:I-V_Curve_T.png) pretty much explains what happens with temperature. Higher temperatures mean higher current and lower maximum voltage. The voltage rapidly decreases though, so you can think of it as either on or off, and so you'd generally want higher temperatures. At any rate, the effect is fairly marginal.

Most things, as they get hot, act as if they have a higher resistance to the flow of electricity. But why is that? One explanation I see is that hot atoms jump around more than cold ones (that's the definition of ""hot"" on an atomic level), so the electrons have a harder time flowing around the atoms.

Basically, it's a parody religion. It was started in the late 70's as a ""for-profit"" religion (""We are the only organized religion that's proud to pay our taxes!""). It's a combination of theology, conspiracy theory, subversion of middle-class and ""mainstream"" values, and (let's face it) lots of acid. For example, they incorporate yetis, UFOs, Lovecraft,  and ""frop"" (i.e. hallucinogens) along with parodies of standard theological tenets, such as redemption and salvation. As such, a caveat: a lot of Subgenius lore is very, very bizarre and a lot of it doesn't make sense.

While they make fun of religion across the board, there are obvious parallels to Christianity and Scientology:

Jehovah 1 is the central deity, which is portrayed as an alien being. 

J.R. ""Bob"" Dobbs is as close to a central prophet as one can get. He has died and revived many times. his face (a 1950's style father figure with a pipe) is probably the most recognizable icon of the movement.

Followers are working to accumulate ""Slack,"" roughly equates to what you would think--the more you acquire, the more you can have a life of leisure with minimal work.

All church members are descended from yetis; non-Subgenius members are called ""pinks.""

Local groups are called ""clenches."" A service is called a ""devival.""

Church members claim that ""X-Day"" is the day that dues-paying church members will be whisked away by aliens to the Planet X as a sort of Valhalla. That day (July 5th, 1998), of course, came and went, with the explanation that it was actually 8661 (it was upside down, you see). Still, a pretty good reason to party each year.

Church of the Subgenius was popular in the counterculture. You will occasionally see the iconic pipe-smoking Dobbs in various works, especially in the 80's (Paul Reubens was an adherent, so you can see the icon in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure). 

That said, while it's clearly a parody religion, it's a bit too scattershot for mainstream people to really consume and so never really flourished after its heyday.

diMario,"It is a bit different than that. In normal physics, when you don't measure something you don't know the value of whatever it was that you did not measure.

When you *do* decide to measure the value (you *observe the system*) you find one single value. You deduce that it did have that particular value all along, even at the time when you hadn't measured it yet. Furthermore, when you repeat the measurement you expect to find that exact same value, no matter how often you measure it. Within tolerances of accuracy.

In quantum physics, this is not the case. You can make measurements, and each time you measure something the outcome can be one of several possible values. The first measurement yields 3, the second and third measurement yield 7, and the fourth measurement yields 3 again. You cannot know in advance what value will be measured, only that it will be one of several distinct values that follow a certain statistical distribution.

This phenomenon is explained by assuming that before the measurement, the quantum physical system has *several different values for the same quantity at the same time*. In quantum physic speak we say that the system can be in different states at the same time. We do not know what state it is in until we make a measurement (observe the system) and as we make more measurements, we will find different values grouped according to some statistical distribution.

Now, the experiment involving Schr&amp;ouml;dingers cat says that a certain elementary particle has or has not decayed during a certain time. If it has, the cat is poisoned, if it hasn't, the cat lives. Because it is a quantum physical system, we say that the two states (decayed particle/not decayed) both exist at the same time for the system. This translates into the cat being both dead and alive at the same time prior to the measurement. Only after observing the system, one would find that the cat is either dead or alive.

eternalfrost,"It probably would not rot in a biological sense. There would be no oxygen available, and the tomato would become freeze-dried fairly quickly in the vacuum of space. These are both conditions used in commercial food packing to prevent spoilage.

However, it would degrade rather quickly for other reasons. Space is a harsh place. Without an protective atmosphere, one half gets the full force of the sun's heat while the other is in bitter cold. This is the same sort of reason that Africa is very hot while Antarctica is very cold; but magnified to even more extreme levels. This is why most satellites are wrapped up in that shiny foil looking stuff (a space blanket). They are very good at reflecting heat. They bounce heat from the sun back away into space and bounce your own heat back in towards you; this helps keep the satellite a constant temperature instead of swinging all over the place.

daveisnotafk,"TFSA's and RRSP's do have similarities, and differences (I assume you're Canadian)

Let's talk about RRSP's:

RRSP stands for Registered Retirement Savings Plan. Basically, these are more or less savings funds that you set up before you retire, in hopes of creating an income stream for yourself in the future (thus by, converting it to a RRIF 'income fund'). How it works is that you are taking money out of your earnings and putting it away until you retire. Any money you put away then gets 'deducted' from how much you earn in a year. So for example, say you made $30,000 this year, and you've put $10,000 into your RRSP. The government will tax your income as if you've only made $20,000. Pretty neat huh? By doing that, you have the opportunity to put money into an investment (free of taxes), allowing it to grow (yet again, free of taxes) until you retire. Once you hit a certain age ( I believe it's 71 ), you're essentially 'too old' to maintain an RRSP, so you'd have to move your funds into what's called an RRIF (registered retirement income fund). Once you have your RRIF, you can start withdrawing the money you've saved all your life... and pay tax on those withdrawls. 

So if you can deduct so much money from your income tax, doesn't it make sense to put away .. 80% of your annual income in an RRSP so you can enjoy awesome tax breaks? Nope! Doesn't work quite like that. Every year, the government sets a limit as to how much you can put away in your RRSP. It's about ~18k-21k (double confirm with your bank, or financial advisor) CAD or up to 18% of your income. Now, not everyone can afford to put away that much money, so the money that they didn't put away the year before, carries away to the next year. So say if the limit last year was $8000, and you put away $5000; you still have $3000 limit that can carry forward to next year. If the limit next year is $9500, you can put up to $9500 plus your previous year's left over limit... total $12500. 

If it's your first time buying a home, you can take up to $10,000 from your RRSP in a program set up called the ""home buyer's plan"". It allows you to take a tax-free loan from your RRSP's as long as you pay it back within 10 years. This helps you put towards a down payment on a home for yourself. 

If you're in a bind and you need money right away, any money you take out from an RRSP will get taxed as added income. So say if you needed cash, and you took $10,000 out of your RRSP, and your annual income is $30,000; you will be taxed on $40,000 worth of income (nasty!). 

RRSP's are good because they can help you reduce your tax rate if you contribute enough. 


TFSA's

TFSA's are a new 'invention' that allows you to invest pre-taxed dollars, allowing it to grow tax-free. There's no limit as to how much you can put, because the money you put in has already been taxed.

How has the money been taxed already? Simple. When you file your annual income taxes, any income you make is subject to your marginal tax rate (the rate at which you pay taxes based on your income level). 

The government is allowing you to deposit money, and letting it grow tax free. The cool part about this is that since you've already paid your taxes, the withdrawls are tax free. 

What about the fees for managing a TFSA? Most banks have what's called ""zero load"" or.. ""no fee"" accounts that you can open. They are no fee, and also offer low interest rates. If you go with a higher end fund with another fund company, you may be charged a DSC (deferred sales charge) based on the provisioning of the fund, for a set term, before it becomes 'free'. In the sense of a bank though, it's pretty much zero fees. There's other things to consider too, such as MER's (management expense ratios) if you're going with a fund that requires a higher degree of management, but like I said, if it's at a bank, it's not likely you'll incur those expenses. 

Last thing to note, RRSP's and TFSA's are not some ""off the shelf"" product you can just go out and buy. Most people are mislead to believe that you just go ""get an RRSP"" or ""get a TFSA"". It doesn't work like that. 

RRSP's and TFSA's are merely CONTRACTS WITH RULES THAT YOU FOLLOW. A financial institution, be it a bank, or investment firm can offer RRSP or TFSA's on ANY of their funds.. be it a savings/chequing account.. a bond, a GIC, money market fund, mutual fund, ... virtually anything. 

For example: 

Person A's RRSP is based on a GIC.

2) The richer countries tend to have strict immigrant laws or limited opportunities for Immigrants.

China has a population issues of its own and has limited room for immigrants outside of certain cities such as Hong Kong, where immigrants are usually domestic servants. South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are similar to Hong Kong in that that immigrants don't have much opportunity beyond domestic servants (edit: This does not include already rich individuals immigrating to Singapore and other locations to avoid taxes).

That covers East Asia. If you also meant India and the Middle East ....that will require a little more explanation.  ",null,6,cdm6e15,1rdmbt,explainlikeimfive,new,9
sir_sri,"&gt; but asian counties have stayed asian why is that?

Define 'asian'.   China has been the most populous country for several thousand years (depending on how you count india), people don't move there, people move from there.  And they have ended up in a lot of  places.  

China (well parts of it) along with Korea did have problems with Japanese 'immigrants' - in the sense that the Japanese moved in and tried to massacre people  and take over, and Japan and Russia and China clashed over territories in northern China for a while, but Japan was late to the colonization game.  

India is an artificial construct by the british (as is Pakistan and Bangladesh)- the various predecessor states had movements of people and religion and in many cases at the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.  And they had a mass migration with the partition of india that packed up a huge chuck of hindu's and muslims and shuffled them all around.  

But generally you don't immigrate to places that have a lot of people already - that sort of defeats the purpose.  Vietnam, Malaysia the Philippines etc. have all had chinese immigrants (some more recent than others) but there's not a whole lot lot of it.  

And that's kind of it.  Japan didn't really become a power capable of colonizing until the 1860's - and they invaded China and Korea (and left after WW2).  Up until 1820 or so basically the entire world except china and south east asia was under the thumb of one imperial power or another.  After the Napoleonic wars Spain lost control of central and south america, but then the Europeans started making moves on Asia - the Asian powers never really had the chance for a lot of immigration, as the europeans were usually not letting them in, and there was no where you'd want to go in south east asia - except malaysia that needed labour for tea and then rubber.  

To have migration you need to be rich enough to leave, but poor enough that you don't want to stay - and need to have somewhere that will take you.  Chinese workers and Japanese were able to move with very unpleasant restrictions in the mid 1800's but they were not really full citizens most places they could go.  Everyone else was either too poor to leave, under the thumb of a colonial power or not welcome.  And most of the time that applied to Japanese and Chinese as well.

bunker_man,"The short version is that western countries decided they need to let in more immigrants, and eastern ones didn't. In part this can be traced to America, since America was always built on immigrants flooding into it to build it up, since the times of it's creation. So western countries having a tie to America kind of internalized this ""we need immigrants"" mentality, where as other places generally still do not want too many. That, and of course after WWII, they wanted to strongly divert from anything that seemed like a racist policy.

Also worth noting - I don't think anything would have flavor without water.  If your tongue was completely dry, would you taste anything if you were to sprinkle salt, sugar, cinnamon, etc. on it?  I haven't tried it...but I'd assume not, since little to no dry chemicals would react with the nerve receptors in your taste buds.  More generally, I'd say that (most) all interesting chemistry takes place in aqueous environments, i.e. when reacting chemicals are dissolved in water.

Like others have said, you can get different flavors in tap / bottled waters because of what's dissolved in them, but there isn't much flavor to pure deionized H20.

So you probably will find soda to taste better than water, since it tastes really sweet. Your brain hasn't really caught on to the idea that sugar is everywhere, since that's a very recent change. Therefore, soda is a jackpot. Drink it - all of it. You might not find another source of energy like this for a long time.

Water is nice and all, but you probably aren't that thirsty. If you're not thirsty and there's plenty of water available, you won't see any reason to drink more.

neilk,"Well, our ancestors *did* think that water had taste; look at the number of places called ""sweet water"". But that just denotes particularly clear, mineralized, oxygenated water. However, even today, many people who give up sugary treats report that even water starts tasting sweet. So maybe water really did taste sweet to our ancestors. That said, I think the sweetness of good water is still pretty subtle.

Maybe the premise of your question is off. Is it true that we acquire a taste for the things we need? I mean, look at this list:

* Water - no taste
* Air - no taste
* Protein - no taste (Most of the flavor in meats comes from fats, blood content, etc. Pure protein powder tastes like nothing.)
* Carbs - often no taste (like refined flour)

Ultra-valuable food items like sugar and fat have tastes, but they're kind of one-note. Although we still crave them, nobody would say that olive oil is a more intense taste than say, oranges.

This suggests that taste and odor are guides to getting the rarer elements and vitamins we need, as well as avoiding the stuff that is bad for us. And because humans are weird, we've decided that some plants' chemical weapons against us are ""spice"".

Also more, using a credit card allows you to gain benefits associated with the card.  In example, using a credit card with 1% cash back.  Everything you buy is 1% off.  Free money!  Although you need to pay your credit card off every month to make use of these benefits.

TimeTravellerSmith,"In general water is a resource like anything else.  Think of it like oil, it's usually in the ground (via aquifer or something) and has to be pumped out of the ground and to the location where it'll be consumed.

Basically what happens is a company buys the rights to the land where the water source is located, and therefore own the water supply.  Since they own the supply they can control how much it costs for people to be able to use the water.  IIRC/AFAIK* what Nestle does is they make really shady deals in really poor areas for land right after doing water surveys.  They end up ""discovering"" the water later and charge the poor regions an arm and a leg to be able to use the water.  The other thing I think they do is offer to ""buy"" water rights and land from people who have the supply but can't access it (pumping facilities, infrastructure) to get them going and then once they build all the infrastructure they do one of two things once the rights expire.  The first is that they ""buy"" the land and when the locals get it back there is some fancy legalese that says that they only own land to a specific depth (which just so happens to be outside the water table) and Nestle retains the ownership of the aquifer.  The other thing they do is buy the rights for a limited amount of time, build the infrastructure, and once the rights expire and it goes back to original ownership Nestle retains all the infrastructure and either charges a ton to sell it or for the locals to lease it from them indefinitely.

The water utility comes to our buildings between 60 and 80 psi. This is achieved by various pumping stations that maintain the pressure. Once we get the water, we calculate how much pressure is needed to overcome the force of gravity. We have to have enough pressure on the top floors to flush toilets and power sinks. The way that we maintain this number is through what we call a ""domestic water pumping station.""

Most of the ones where I work consist of 2 pumps (each with its own motor) and a controller. The controller houses all the computers that regulate the pump motors. Long story short you tell the computer what pressure to maintain and it checks the current pressure (using a pressure sensor) against the number you told it (called a ""setpoint"").

The other thing would be that pricing would be adventitious for the customer if they charged a small fee for the ticket and then paid a lot on the fuel used.  So if fuel is cheap during certain times of year or it's a short flight, or a smaller plane or whatever then the price might be better since the fuel cost might be lower than just charging regularly.

TimeTravellerSmith,"From a business point of view, if they can't adapt they die.  Especially if they can't shift to the new media formats.  Newspapers would have to charge for online subscriptions but can't compete with other free online sources of news.  They end up out of business.

Same could be said of production companies for things like HD DVD vs BlueRay or VHS vs BetaMax.  Some company who ""prints"" movies ends up investing in one or the other and when a winner is declared the companies on the losing side lose on their investments and can't afford to re-tool, and thus go out of business.  With stuff becoming more and more digital this isn't really a problem anymore though.  I'm not sure how much different it is to burn an HD DVD rather than a BluRay and the other way around.

You also see it with rental companies like movie stores.  With the ability to get just about anything online via Hulu, Netflix or On Demand there is no real use for the Blockbusters of the world.  Same could be said of libraries for print media.  If you can download the ebook on your iPad or Kindle then why would you bother going to the library for borrowing a book?

From a customer point of view it's a similar story.  How would you like it if you invested several hundred dollars in a nice turntable and VCR only for them to be replaced by CD's and DVD's?  Now you can't buy vinyls and VHS tapes anymore so you re-invest in a CD/DVD player.  Ok cool, now DVD's are getting phased out for BluRay and Digital Streaming.  So *now* you need to *re-re-invest* in a BluRay player along with a computer with a good internet connection or media-box to stream online stuff.  Now that you've got all this shiny new equipment nothing uses component, composite or coaxial but instead HDMI.  Now you need to replace your perfectly functioning TV with a newer one that can support the new peripherals and to actually gain use of the HD picture.

So from a consumer perspective it's a constant tech arms race to be up to date with whatever the new supported format is and being able to actually use it.  You need to keep buying and replacing otherwise perfectly functioning hardware because now it's obsolete and you can't use it with new stuff.

From a consumer point of view this should be leveling out pretty quick.

sir_sri,"&gt;I heard that the fabricators that Intel uses to create their processors are top secret, but is that keeping foreign companies left behind to play catch up?

Intel is basically one fabrication process ahead of everyone else in the industry, including AMD which is sort of a US company (they are based in the US, publicly traded but a major interest is owned by Abu Dhabi).  

In the history of computing equipment IBM, which has been around since before computers, was the big dog.  They bought any 'business machines' that seemed to be useful to them, including european ones.  As time went on and you had branching of the industry most of it went to US companies closely connected to IBM (not necessarily allies but competitors too).  Where IBM owned the business market Microsoft (which got its start working for IBM), and Intel made stuff for IBM computers.  Then someone came up with the idea of an IBM clone (I'm being vague that's a whole history tale unto itself) but Intel and MS took off, AMD formed to compete with Intel and Nvidia hit it big when 3DFx imploded. 

Prior to the 1960's there were some big microelectronics companies in Japan (that still exist in one way or another), as well as smaller ones in the US.  Siemens, the german megacorporation has always been involved in some ways but they seemed to leave the integrated circuit business mostly to other people.  

So that's kind of it.  IBM bought local because they could rapidly develop with other local oufits.  Taiwan particularly has picked  up a LOT of high quality manufacturing of semiconductors, but the big guys for a Long time were Intel and AMD's manufacturing (what is now Globalfoundries) which are mostly US and Europe.  The east asian stuff all came later.

Japan has always had a toe hold in the market - particularly storage, but Intel processors were so much better than anyone else that no one can compete with that market, and since Intel owns x86, well, Intel owned the computing business.  ",null,0,cdm5s6q,1rdcjg,explainlikeimfive,new,3

BNugget,"You should probably read some suggestions on /r/personalfinance. In general, as a first card, your options are limited. You are going to end up with a high-interest, low-limit card. Ideally, your first credit card is one that you will use every month, and will pay off entirely every month, to build credit. You don't want to incur the interest fees, so you need to pay the bill in full (this also keeps you from spending beyond your means). Also, if there is an annual fee on the card, you don't want it.

You may want to talk to your bank about a secured credit card to get you started. In this scenario, you give the bank a deposit (the security) for the card and after while  they'll give it back.  

Store credit cards are often not hard to get, but are limited to the store. For example, my first card was a Victorias Secret card with a $700 limit, which I chose because at the time I shopped there at least once every few months.

Rewards/cash back cards are my personal favorite, but may be tougher to get. These cards reward you for using them, and if you pay the card off each month, this is just free money. There are plenty of websites discussing the pros and cons of various cards. You want to choose a card that works with your spending. I chose an AmEx Blue Cash card because it pays a decent return on grocery/gas, so I use it for that. My bf who was just starting out went with a Chase Freedom card.

There are some perks to using a credit card: most credit cards will cover the accident insurance on a rental car if you use the card to pay for the rental. Also, a lot of them offer extended returns/accidental damage policies, so look into that (and this means, use the card to buy your electronics and breakables).

Like others have said, treat it as a debit card and don't spend more than you can pay. You have to choose the right card for your spending habits in order to get the most out of it. ",null,1,cdm639g,1rdcew,explainlikeimfive,new,3
brazendynamic,"Use it for whatever you want, but pay it off. I use mine fairly regularly, but also try to keep the balance low or at $0 because of interest rates. 

When you're looking for a credit card to get, look for something with no interest for the first year. That way you're not paying interest in your first year and can get used to having the card and understanding how credit works. It's NOT free money. Don't let yourself look at it like that. You have to pay for it all eventually, and it will destroy your credit if you don't. Don't just pay the minimum every month, either. Especially once the interest kicks in. Then you're just paying the interest, will never get the balance down, and you're ultimately digging yourself into a hole. Occasionally, sure. Some months suck and you can only afford the minimum. But always do your best to go higher if you leave a balance. Trust me. I ruined my amazing credit because I was poor and relied on credit cards, but then I couldn't always afford to pay them.

Don't pay an annual fee for a card. There are PLENTY of free ones out there. I've had both Chase Freedom and Chase Slate cards which are free and were interest free for the first year. I got rid of my Slate card when I paid it off, but still have the Freedom card. It accumulates points that I can redeem for tons of stuff, depending on the point balance. Personally, I like that.

It really depends on what you want. The Freedom card is great for just a credit card. You get the card plus the point system. Some cards offer different rewards, whether it's for flights or trips or what have you. I recommend going with a really basic one for your very first card, but it's up to you and what you like/need. You can often find comparison sites that'll tell you interest rates, any rewards, annual fees, etc. bankrate.com has a comparison tool, so does nerdwallet.com, and countless others. Or pick a company (Chase, Capital One, etc) and you can often look at what all of their cards offer.

TardisDyskinesia,"I guess there are two things you want to think about. The type of card and your limit. 

**Type of Card**
The standard is a Cash Rewards card. You should probably go with one that has no Annual fee. I graduated in May and got a Cash Rewards card from my bank with 1% back on all purchases. I've never heard of less than that %-age, but you can do better. I got a Costco membership and the American Express that they have gives me 3% on Gas, 2% on Restaurants, and 1% on everything else.

**Limit**
I started out with a limit of $500, but once I started getting paychecks, this was way too low. You don't want to max out your credit card, so try to get a limit that is higher than what you earn in a month, maybe twice what you earn. It's actually better for your score to use a lower percentage of your available credit, so you should probably go as high as you can. If your bank won't let you go higher, you can try to get another card.

Once you have a card, you can start putting whatever you need to on it. Keep track of your balances, make sure you don't overspend, and pay the bills every month. It's simple.

**Other tips**
I manage all of my accounts with Mint.com. It's a lot easier to log in one place and see how I'm doing financially. It also tells me when my bills are due, so it's much easier to keep track. Never miss a payment.

You can also (but was not recommended by my bank manager who I sat down with when I applied for my first card) set it up such that the CC bill is auto deducted from your checking account, essentially making it operate exactly like a debit card.  He didn't recommend it because it's a control issue, it might withdraw at a bad time of the month or withdraw an incorrect amount, or if you *are* planning on not paying the card off because of an emergency expenditure then you'll overdraw your checking account.

Usage wise use it like you would a debit card but be mindful (like when people here say use it for utilities) that you don't max it out by mistake.  For example by the time you pay for groceries, household supplies, etc you might be pushing the $400 mark in a month and when you suddenly throw in another $200-300 in utilities you'll be pushing the max.  Just be careful and work out a budget, then keep track of how much you spend.  Make a simple spreadsheet in Excel or something and when you buy something, keep the receipts somewhere and once a week tally everything up into the spreadsheet to make sure you're within budget.

Also, if you can try to find something with rewards like cash back so you can get 2-5% back on things like gas or groceries or general spending.

Homeopathic remedies are solutions that have been diluted to such an extreme that they contain not a single molecule of the supposed active ingredient. Now the original homeopaths knew very little about atoms and molecules (and hence that their dilution practices are somewhat extreme), but 'modern' homeopaths have attempted to solve this by proposing 'water memory', which always reminds me of a line from [Tim Minchin's *Storm*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U): ""*[sarcastically]* Water has memory! And while it's memory of a long-lost drop of onion juice is infinite, it seems to forget all the poo it's had in it.""

AmerigoVesa,"Homeopathy was invented when what we consider to be real medicine was just getting started. Back then, most things that a ""doctor"" did for you would kill you. Homeopathy became popular because it did not hurt you, and you might get better anyway if you let things run their course. It is based on the idea that something which mimicked the symptoms of a disease could cure it. For example, if eating a certain kind of toad caused a person to break out in hives and develop a fever, that would be the thing which cured a disease that had the symptoms of fever and hives. But the new thing here was that it wasn't the thing itself that did the cure, it was the energy of the thing. That is why you had to put the thing in water, shake it a special way, then keep diluting it: the water ""remembered"" the thing, and that is what cured you. What you had left by the time all the diluting and shaking was over was basically pure water. This would ""cure"" you only in the sense that it would keep you away from a doctor long enough for a disease to run its course so maybe you could survive.

Do not confuse herbal medicine and homeopathy. While there are a lot of problems with so called herbal remedies, they are at the very least based on the idea that some active ingredient in a plant or whatever could counter act a disease. A good example of this is willow bark, which led to aspirin. Homeopathy, by its very nature can not work that way, because it has been diluted past the point where any of the original ingredient is left. ",null,1,cdm2etc,1rd99h,explainlikeimfive,new,4

When two waves are at the same spot, they interact and interfere, but both are still there.

So if you had a box of perfect mirrors and a source of light inside it, you would have it bouncing around eternally, with more and more and more photons inside but never having too much.

However, in our world, there are no perfect mirrors. Whenever light reflects out of something, a portion of it is reflecting but another portion os absorbed and turned into heat.

Then Germany made clear just how far they were willing to go to win - that included being willing to Ally with Mexico against the US and roll the US back to the pre 1848 borders.  They were also willing to shoot anything that might be shipping arms to the UK.  That wasn't acceptable so the US got involved, because if it didn't americans were going to get killed selling stuff, and if the Germans won there could conceivably be a massive extremely powerful and dangerous german army liberating a huge portion of the western/south western US.  

In WW2 the situation was similar but different.  The US had massive financial interests in germany (including significant loans to the german government and banks), and largely (correctly) felt that France had to some degree brought this upon themselves.  The problem was that germany was sinking US ships (even when  the US was neutral), and Japan was threatening US interests in the Pacific - although the Japan/China thing could easily have gone the other way and China allied with Germany and Japan on the allied side.  Most of the western countries didn't really like the soviets and so given the choice letting the germans and soviets beat the hell out of each other seemed  like it wasn't such a bad plan.  Particularly for the US who could scavenge the remnants of the british and French empires at the end of it.  

In both cases the US was involved whether it wanted to be or not.

Then came the end of the war and the breakup of british and French Empires.  The soviets were happy to communist up any state willing to join them, which left a problem for the US.  The US needs customers and resources, and the soviets where going to eat up future customers  and supplies of resources.  If it hadn't been involved in the world it would have essentially handed most of the worlds supply of oil and rubber, and potential customers for cars and aircraft to the soviets.  That would have been problematic. 

And so it is today.  The US is big and rich,and depends on large swathes of the world to buy its cars an computers and airplanes, and other swathes of the world to make it cheap socks and sell it oil and whatever else it needs/wants.  

The relative balance of power in the world has changed too.  In 1950 the US was the third or 4th largest country (depending on how you count the Soviet union) but it only had about 3x the population of the UK or France.  Today that's more like 6.  So the relative state of the world means that the US is  proportionally much larger than it was compared to other developed powers - some of the poor countries have grown a great deal faster than the US (pakistan, bangladesh, brazil, lots  of africa), but  they are not yet capable of securing trade lanes or defending other countries.   And therein lies the problem, the US very much depends on stability in the world, so does most everyone else, but now the US is so big it pretty much has to be involved because the list of options  to do it without the US is quite limited.  Europe aims to challenge the US as a global power, while at the same time being an ally - that would let the US take on a lesser more cooperative role, but unfortunately the EU can't organize  itself out of a paper bag .  


&gt;more often than not when their presence was neither needed nor ultimately helpful.

While that was true in Iraq, round 2, that was an exception rather than a rule.  The US has been needed in a lot of conflicts, Korea, somalia, vietnam, Iraq round 1/Kuwait, Columbia, the Balkans etc.  Even if you (correctly) think the way the US handled some of those things was utter incompetence and made things worse it had legitimate interest in trying to be there.  Trying to do the right thing is a lot easier than actually doing the right thing.  

There are also lots of places the US has been needed where it hasn't gone, most notably Syria, where it appears Assad and his Iranian and Russian backers are going to win.  That lack of intervention may be based on the (probably correct) assessment that the US would just fuck it up, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have served US interests to have had the FSA take over 2 years ago.

The common working man doesn't want to be thrust into the trenches unless there's a really good reason.

When WWI broke out, public opinion was against getting involved in the war. European nations had been trying to destroy each other for hundreds of years, why should we spend our resources and sacrifice our young men just because they can't get along? (Not saying I agree with this argument!)

Less than 30 years later WWII breaks out. Now, WWI was really, really ugly.  At the time it was called the Great War and it shocked the conscience of the world. It's no surprise some Americans didn't want to get involved. There is even a retarded school of thought that says we shouldn't get involved because Hitler is not really that bad!

There is no ""besides being a board game"".  All it is is a board game.


&gt;and why is it so good?

It follows a specific design philosophy associated with [German-style board games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game).  In a broad sense, this includes things like a total lack of player elimination (so no one has to sit around bored for an hour while everyone else keeps playing), both public and hidden scoring criteria (so no one is the obvious loser until the very end when you tally the score), randomized board configurations (allowing for greater replay value), a greater emphasis on strategy over luck, and less emphasis on direct player conflict.",null,7,cdm0sa8,1rd5ld,explainlikeimfive,new,36
Taken4GrantD,"Gives a unique gameplay, with the exception of the robber, a piece that lets you steal a resource and block a tile, all competition is passive, you can't hurt your opponents, you can only really get in their way.

People_Are_People,"As a huge Catan fan I just want to add a few points to why I think it separates itself from other games.

1) I think game perfectly balances luck and skill in a way that keeps everyone involved. Your strategy can only put you so far ahead because you do not know what resources you will end up getting. Unlike hardcore strategy games a beginner who understands the rules will not be put so far behind a seasoned player that they cannot win.

2) You are involved in every single turn. Games like monopoly and risk can be hated because when you are not moving you are basically sitting around. In Catan you have the possibility of benefits and there is ""action"" on every move. This keeps everyone involved in the game which prevents the ""whose turn is it I don't even know"" problem.

3)It always is progressing towards the end. Everyone knows the monopoly game where money is just being pushed around in no end in sight. In Catan unless there is a super high fluke in low percentage numbers or robbers, the resources are always progressing towards the end goal so there is never any dreaded board game purgatory. 

4) Because of the changing layout and randomness of the board every game can be different so every game could have different successful strategy. 

Seriously I could prob go on and on with other reasons these were the first few I thought of. If you have never played give it a shot if you can. I fell in love after the first time. If you are playing with friends, ask them to honestly give you some advice on where you should put your first cities and strategies so you have a decent chance. Hopefully they aren't dicks and will tell you the obvious places although this strategy can be debated.",null,2,cdm2kva,1rd5ld,explainlikeimfive,new,13

blandrice123,"You begin with two settlements on an island gameboard, lush with rich forests, wheat fields, deep mines, quarries, and tracts of grazing land.  By roll of the dice, luck and strategy dictate what resources you receive each turn and, therefore, the infrastructure of your empire. Perhaps you will gather the brick and wood necessary to build long, impressive roads between settlements, or the eclectic variety of resources needed to raise a large and fearsome army.  Maybe you will expand your empire, creating new settlements- all of these bring you closer to victory. 
But beware the others who inhabit the island gameboard with their own budding empire states.  They seek the same goal as you: to settle the wild island of Catan and dominate its resources.  Despite this competition, you must often seek to forge alliances and open trades- a stack of wood for a bundle of wool or some brick for the wheat to feed your people.  Alliances beget rivalry, and treachery is always underfoot.  In a single turn a once-close ally can trade to you the ore you need to upgrade your settlement, only to turn around and build a road through what you thought was your territory, effectively destroying your well planned strategy.

EvOllj,"It is a VERY compressed and easy version of the Basic mechanics of the Civilization board game (that inspured all civilization computer games). About gathering resources, trading and expanding on the same island with limited space but with no moving entities besides one single ""barbarian/pirate/robber"" that can be teleported by everyone. The lack of movement on the game map, besides expanding roads villages and cities, saves a lot of time playing a civilization-like game that is spend on free trading.

Hexagonal tiles give one of 5 different resource types when their number is rolled in a turn. numbers are rolled with two w6, making 7 most common and some tiles worse. But 7 is a bad stealing/blockading event against the greediest players, limiting fast expansion. resources are gained by players cities on tile corners. cities of a player must be connected by roads on tile borders. a city/village usually has 2 or 3 ressource gaining tiles next to it. resources buy expansions or options/upgrades/structures but they are very resource specific, forcing to trade or wait. this gives each resource type various specific optional uses. the maps border usually has evenly spread npc-trading-posts that give one of any for 2 speficit resources, or 1 of any for 3 of any (of the same) resources. but borders have no resource-gaining tile. each turn allows to trade with the active player.  the game is a race for the best spots.

The luck of the dice is countered by trade embargoes.

What made the game explode is its combustibility and modifyability, adding other victory conditions like building world wonders or having a few moving entities per player.

Enchanted_Bunny,"It is a board game in which each player builds up an ""empire"" of sorts made of roads, settlements, and cities until one player reaches 10 victory points and ends the game. 

Why is it so good? Let's compare it with a more standard American game: monopoly. Think about what happens when you play monopoly. It starts off okay. Then one person gets eliminated. Then another person gets eliminated. Now only two of the four players have any stake in the game'a outcome. The two eliminated players have the choice of staying at the table and spectating or going off and doing their own thing. The two person slug fest can last for hours and a lot of the time the game is just given up on. It's no surprise really as the game in its original iteration (the landlords game) was designed specifically *not* to be fun. It was meant to be a teaching tool of the folly of capitalism. 

Contrast this with settlers of catan. The German style board game design philosophy that catan follows is designed to keep all players engaged in play until the game ends. Catan specifically has several different methods and strategies that can lead to victory. So if for example you just aren't getting the materials you need to build that road or city you need to score points, you can buy developments cards, or if you roll a 7 you can steal cards from someone else.

yellowsquare,"In the US at least, the reason why monetary compensation is not offered for whole blood donation is because money is too good of a reason to donate. Many studies were conducted, and long story short, intravenous drug users were donating blood to get drug money. The American Red Cross and other blood centers around the country do not want intravenous drug users to donate their blood because of the very high risk of those people having undiagnosed hepatitis or HIV.

Plasma centers (like Biolife and CSL) are allowed to offer monetary compensation because they use that plasma primarily for research purposes, and isn't put into patients' bodies (usually). Some parts of the plasma can be used for medical purposes, but that's after being highly processed and screened.

Now the next question you might ask is why don't blood centers just screen all the blood that's donated so they can still pay money? The answer is they do, but the national blood centers have decided to take this extra step to ward off potential high risk donors in order to build redundancy and (therefore security) in the field of blood banking. 

Taking someone's blood and putting it into someone else's body is a dangerous process, and the entire system from donor to recipient is layered with redundancy in an attempt to make the process as safe as possible for recipients.

The notion that plasma is used ""mostly"" or ""usually"" for research is misguided.  Next time you're in a CSL center count the beds, count the chairs in the waiting room, do some multiplication.  That one company collects millions of liters of plasma every year.  Nobody is doing that much research.  The primary driver for increasing collections is the manufacture of Intravenous Immunoglobulin.  It's a great therapy for the people who need it, and it costs a fortune currently.  Plasma also makes therapies for burn victims, hemophiliacs/other blood disorders, fibrinogen ""glue"" used in surgery, lots of stuff.  Many types of vaccines are manufactured from plasma also.  These are all for-profit pharmaceutical products.  (Good products that are important therapies for the people who receive them, not boner-pills, but not 'research' either.)

There are some specialty facilities around that do perform mostly targeted collections for research purposes or reagent manufacture, so you weren't necessarily lied to if someone told you a particular donation was for research.


On the actual question, there are many additional rules applied to plasma donors that are not applied to volunteer whole blood donors that are part of the quality control system approved/inspected by the FDA and add safety to the compensated donation process.  If a whole blood donation center wanted to jump through all these additional hoops, they could most likely be licensed to perform compensated collections as well.

1) You must have a permanent home address within a defined area (generally 50-60 miles) of the facility.  Your address must not be on a list of known long-stay motels, flop houses, half-way houses, missions, etc.

2) There is a nation wide list of every person who has ever had a positive HIV/Hepatitis test in any plasma clinic that is checked.

3) You must donate twice, so there are two sets of viral test results.  If you only ever donate once, that bottle goes right to the incinerator.  This is why you get paid more for your second visit!

4) Plasma donors must have annual physicals by an actual doctor or approved substitute.

5) Plasma collection facilities must report their positive test result rates to the national association.  They face audits and corrective action if they exceed normal levels for the population.  This incentivizes them to do a good job screening and not let in questionable donors to make more money.

6) Plasma clinics are required to share information with all the other plasma clinics in their area about who is donating when, to stop them from donating more often than allowed.  This is more to protect the donor, but it does identify and eliminate people who are desperate to score cash quickly.

They're called the *centrifugal* force and the *Coriolis* force (you may have heard of it in the sniper mission of Call of Duty 4). So instead of F = ma, you technically should use F + F(Coriolis) + F(centrifugal) = ma. But luckily the centrifugal force is extremely small at the surface of the Earth and the Coriolis force only really affects things that are moving very quickly, so they're not too important in everyday life. That's why we can usually pretend that we're in an inertial frame (in other words, we can pretend the Earth isn't rotating) for simple physics problems.",null,0,cdm7kht,1rd2ik,explainlikeimfive,new,2

To understand what I mean by ""paired"" and ""unpaired"", look up orbital filling and the pauli principle.  Each orbital can have two electrons of opposite spin.  If all orbitals are filled in this way, there will be no net spin in the system.  So you need an orbital with only one electron to create a net magnetic moment.

While you can visualize this as the electron spinning this isn't really whats happening, but I feel that for this explanation we don't need to go any further. This spin can be either + 1/2 or -1/2 depending on which direction the spin is in. A spin of +1/2 negates a spin of -1/2 .

2.The electrons in atoms populate atomic orbitals, and the way they fill these orbitals depends on the aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principle.

3.When the electrons populate the orbitals in such a way that there are unpaired electrons left over. As in some of the electrons don't have their spin of +1/2 or -1/2 negated, then the material is paramagnetic.

bigfish42,"There's been a ton of research on this, and there are at least five big drivers: Waste, Price Insensitivity, Technology, Market Pressures, and Regulation. 

Something like 30% of our health spending is pure waste. Well, worse than pure waste because of the risk of negative outcomes (hospital acquired infections, death, etc.). This can be from all kinds of things, from outright fraud to doctors and systems simply covering their butts, to doctors agreeing to treatments that patients asked for so they don't lose their future business. 

If you understand supply/demand models, I hope that you know a bit about price sensitivity. There is an assumption of a downward sloping demand for healthcare services with respect to price paid (higher cost -&gt; less demand for it). The trouble is that the payor is not the same as the recipient of the service, and neither is the one who makes the recommendation. Here, the one that recommends the treatment is often the one who gets paid for doing things (the doc), the one who pays often just gets a bill for what has been done (the insurer), and the one who receives the service (the patient) just pays their copay - a cost that has little to do with the total price of the service. 

A huge driver of costs is the ""arms race"" of the latest technology. This has all kinds of drivers that are worth diving into - like our current patent and approvals process - but I'll leave that for the inevitable flood of comments. The consequence is that doctors and health system spend a massive amount of money on new technology that patients demand that has little (if any) positive effect on outcomes.

In terms of market structure, there is massive fragmentation among providers. And they are the ones who have to buy supplies. Since there isn't one big purchaser of supplies (including meds, devices, durable medical supplies, etc.) and there are just a few major players for specialized (and patented) supplies, the providers have little bargaining power to keep costs of supplies down. The higher costs from less market power get passed on to customers. Additionally, consumers - patients - don't have any real power, except through their insurers, to keep costs down. (But if there exists a patients' union, let me know!)

Finally, regulation. It costs a lot of money to comply with all of the regulations. This goes from staffing (doctor training is massively expensive and heavily regulated), to job designation (there is generally a very well-defined scope where an individual can practice), to required emergency care (see EMTALA) driving up the cost of bad debts, and even to requirements related to safety. These all cost a lot of money, and those costs all get factored in when the providers set their prices. With the general price insensitivity, and lack of customer power, these costs generally go straight through to increase the cost of care.

It's messy, but those are the top 5 IMO.

Ahrius,"A few reasons: ER/COBRA, Malpractice and Medicare.

Basically, every so often, the government decides that the reimbursement rate (what the Dr. takes home) goes down by 20%. Once this happens, ALL the other insurances follow the same practice.

In the USA, medicine is the ONLY profession that gets a GOVERNMENT MANDATED PAY CUT. As a result, doctors may try to compensate by ordering a more expensive test or doing an extra procedure, because:
a) he's trying to be thorough for the sake of friends/family
b) he's trying to be thorough so if something happens, he can't be blamed
c) he's trying to put food on his table because the gov keeps cutting his pay

Malpractice is another huge issue - a physician's work can and will result in death sometimes. The family wants to blame someone because that's more comforting than accepting that there was nothing else that could be done. Doctor's get sued left and right and if there happens to be a guilty verdict involved, that doctor's career is over. Sure, we pay insurance to cover this and technically it's alright, but no hospital will ever hire that doctor again. Since death is involved, the verdict's tend to be high in number, so malpractice charges a lot. As a result, things cost more because doctor's have bigger bills to pay.

Finally COBRA law - if you walk into an ER, you cannot be denied because of poverty. So you get treated. Something as small as a cold or requiring a multi-million dollar procedure, you get treated. But who eats the cost?

The hospital.

The cost of running/maintaining machines, ordering tests, buying materials, etc. all goes to the hospital and they have to front the bill. That's why there's an issue with illegal immigrants. Many illegal immigrants who do hazardous labor jobs get into accidents and go to the ER. Illegal immigrants also have no insurance (because they're illegal), so they visit the ER for everything. 

Essentially, hospitals pay for illegals to have free health care. The hospital then passes that cost on to the insurance companies by raising the prices of their procedures. The insurance then raises your premium to pay for the new prices. 

TL;DR - Malpractice, COBRA, and MEDICARE make it hard to be a doctor.

dvfw,"1. **Licensing** - Medical schools, pharmacies and hospitals are heavily licensed. This drastically reduces supply of doctors and hospitals, while demand increases, leading to higher prices. It also reduces competition leading to the same result.
2. **Regulations** - Burdening businesses with regulations forces them to increase the costs of their goods, and often kills smaller competitors, contributing further to monopolies. An example is the FDA. After the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the FDA Act were singed in 1962, and by 1976, the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated $24 million, 10 to 20 times as much as in the early 1960's, while development times had climbed from a couple of years to the better part of a decade. These amendments also caused longer production times, causing many deaths by making consumers have to wait for new drugs. Prior to the Kefauver-Harris Bill of 1962, the average time from the filing of an IND to approval was seven months. By 1967, however, the average time to approval had increased to thirty months. Time to approval continued to rise through the late 1970s, when on average a successful drug took more than ten years to get approved. In the late 1980s and 1990s, times to approval decreased somewhat, but are still eight years on average, far higher than in the 1960s.
3. **Subsidies** - The US has heavily subsidized the sick - with, for example, Medicare and Medicaid - by providing them special benefits when they are sick. Subsidies create more of whatever is being subsidized. This encourages carelessness and dependency on government, as opposed to responsibility and self-ownership. Also, corn syrup, a leading cause of obesity, is subsidized heavily. The worse health problems that result, cause more demand for health care, and higher costs.
4. **Employer-provided insurance** - When insurance is paid for by someone else - in this case, the employers - customers are not likely to shop around for the best deals, and they will overuse health services. This increase in demand leads to higher costs.
5. **Patents** - Patents basically grant a monopoly on the production of a certain patented drug. Monopolies, as everyone knows, lead to higher prices.",null,0,cdmfbtn,1rd0ud,explainlikeimfive,new,2

Bears are not intelligent like humans because they don't need to be in order to survive - yet you are also assuming that they lack intelligence. Animals have many cognitive abilities that approximate humans. They can use tools, solve complex problems, they hunt, they have long-term memories and form strong bonds with other group members (especially social animals).

**How did we develop our cognitive system?**

[Cooperative breeding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_breeding) is a social system where mothers require help from others to raise their offspring - all human cultures exhibit this trait and this developed because we are bipedal and have [trouble giving birth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_breeding). Combined, cooperative breeding and the motivation to share mental states leads to [shared intentionality](http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/pdf/Publications_2007_PDF/Shared_intentionality_07.pdf), which is the ability and desire to work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, as well as understanding that others are aware of your intentions. Cooperative breeding in primates to date is observed only in callatrichids and humans, both of which exhibit shared intentionality. What sets apart humans from other cooperative breeders with shared intentionality is our ancestral ape-level cognitive system. The unique combination of social cognitive skills, ape-level cognitive skills and shared intentionality led to the development of our species-specific traits, including language and enhanced cultural transmission. Our ape-level cognitive skills stem from freed grasping hands, our tool use and ability to solve complex problems.

In other words: Ability to use tools and solve problems + complex social system that involves cooperative breeding + shared intentionality = human cognitive abilities.",null,0,cdlys55,1rczau,explainlikeimfive,new,6

nwob,"There are a few components to this question.  Substances used in nuclear fuel are *radioactive*, which means that they are unstable and their atoms gradually break down over time into lighter elements and other particles.

When they do this, some of their mass is changed straight into energy.  The famous equation E=mc^2 describes this relationship.  For every gram difference between the starting materials and the end materials in a nuclear reaction, 8.98755179 × 10^13 joules are produced.  That's apparently about a seventh of the energy the average hurricane releases in a second, which, if you consider the size of a hurricane, is quite a lot. It's also the energy equivalent of eating 92 million mars bars.

They do by releasing three different types of radiation - alpha, beta and gamma.  Alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons, and are the same as the nucleus of a helium atom (don't worry about that specifically, but I'm including it for completeness), beta particles are electrons, and gamma radiation is high frequency electromagnetic rays, similar to visible light but much higher in energy.

Alpha, beta and gamma radiation are called *ionising*, and it's this property that makes them dangerous.  These tiny ionising particles can penetrate into our bodies and disrupt our cells (most notably our DNA), damaging them and potentially triggering cell death or cancer.  Alpha particles are the most damaging but can't get through your skin.  Beta particles sit somewhere in the middle, and gamma particles are lowest energy but most penetrating.

In nuclear fission, we split uranium atoms. When the atoms split, they break apart and release energy (which we use for boiling water to steam. We then use the steam to make electricity).

Fission occurs when a neutron hits a uranium atom. When we split the atom, we get more neutrons out to continue the reaction. (This is why it is called a chain reaction).

The split uranium atom becomes 2 random smaller atoms. These smaller atoms are usually radioactive. Some of them are so radioactive that as they give off radiation, they heat up everything around them, similar to a microwave.

The split atoms are so radioactive that they are dangerous for humans. They need to be constantly shielded.

&gt;A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, while 74% thought there had been a cover-up. A Gallup Poll in mid-November 2013, showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought Oswald did it alone.

The Warren Commission was the official investigation which took place soon after the assassination.  Their report concluded Oswald acted alone. Many consider the Warren Commission to be a cover up, and for that reason there was eventually another investigation.

The other main Congressional investigation was done in secret from 1976-1978, this was called the House Select Committee on Assassinations.  Their final report concluded that Kennedy was very likely assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.

This comment is just a very simple introduction. This is a huge topic, and it is also a topic that had become a minefield of disinformation.

Regardless in the ketone body form it still needs to be metabolized but is able to be transported through the body in this form.

In a cartoon that appeared in Harper's Weekly in 1874, Nast drew a donkey clothed in lion's skin, scaring away all the animals at the zoo.

So you have a touch screen, battery, RAM, memory for storage, a motherboard, processor, various wireless cards (for WiFi, cellular radios for 2g/3g/4g/etc, bluetooth, NFC, and others), usually a small camera sensor or 2, and some ports to plug stuff in.

A lot of these individual parts can be combined onto a single chip- such as a SoC, or system-on-a-chip, which can combine things like the processor and video card onto one chip.

.40 was developed as a compromise between .45 and 9mm. It has a lower recoil for faster target recovery, but has a higher energy than 9mm. However the difference between .40 and 9mm in terms of real world power was unnoticeable, and the .40 has been losing popularity.

Once NATO existed, it made sense to standardize munitions within NATO militaries.

My policy is to name the volume for the date it was made (YrMnDy format), and always use a strong password. 

1) Create a volume large enough to hold the folders you want safely saved. 2) Copy (drag) those folders into the volume. 3) Unmount the volume, which yields an encrypted file that on close inspection is digital gibberish. 4) Copy this file to the auxiliary drive.

You can now delete the original encrytped file from your host.

I keep three weeks of backups, discarding the oldest each time through.

This has the advantages that: 1) if your host gets destroyed, you can install TrueCrypt on the replacement, copy the lastest file from the auxiliary to the new host, mount the volume, and copy the folders out of it onto the new host, and 2) your backups are protected with 256-bit AES encryption without having to encrypt the auxiliary drive.

To hold such diverse interests together, an important tactic is focusing less on what unites the party and more on why the opposing party would ruin everything, making party defection a scary prospect for coalition members.

The US trajectory has been tending toward policies of social permissiveness combined with economic non-intervention since the end of World War II. The most recent major political realignment occurred beginning in the mid-1960s and finalizing, roughly, with the election of Ronald Regan in 1980. Since then, both parties have been pushing their agenda where it agrees with the national trend and reluctantly retreating in areas which are in opposition to it.

An ""econimically liberal, socially conservative"" party would be economically interventionist (against the trend) and socially impermissive (also against the trend).

bloonail,"Metal, as with the other objects in your surroundings will tend to achieve the temperature of the ambient air. There are some subtle differences. Things that have a light cover that are exposed to infra red light, even in small amounts - will tend to be bit warmer. Just at the surface. This is because the fabric both obsorbs infra-red and insulates it from the deeper material. Its difficult to measure but a thermal camera would show that.

Its maybe more interesting to point out what happens when you touch an insulator, fabric, wood or tile that's a few degrees colder, Lets says 20 Celcius versus 33 for your feet. In that case the surface reflects back heat, your skin mostly doesn't touch the object and only a few points in the surface of the tile, kinda speckled, will immediately become the temperature of your skiN. You'd heat the a tile a floor just a bit walking on it - a high speed thermal camera following your walk should show the whorls of your footprints on the surface for a few seconds afterwards. If you rested in one spot you'd quickly feel warmer under your feet.

With metal the same walk would bit by bit cool your foot in a very small layer. This would feel cold because the surface of your skin would be matching the 20 Celcius floor as you walked. You are heating a greater volume of the metal floor because its a conductor. A thermal camera will show your feet barely heating the surface of the floor. Your steps would disappear quickly behind your feet as you walked. The floor may reflect in the infra-red back at your foot but that's more than compensat4d for by the heat you've lost through conduction. you can lose or gain heat only through radiation, conduction and mass transfer. Only the first two matter in this case.

Sitting on a good insulating chair for a while, or on something that's been exposed to infra red light, even just a bit, like by a lamp, will feel warm, even if the chair is mostly 20 C because your body will quickly heat the surface up to your body temperature, and then warm it further because the chair cannot dissipate the heat your body is generating.

Try putting your hand in some cold air (like your fridge), noting the preceived temperature, and then putting your hand in some cold water that had been in that same fridge for a while. You'll note that when you put your hand in the water, it feels a lot colder than when you put it in air of the same temperature.

This is because water is much more efficient in drawing heat from your hand than air is, and the amount of efficiency to conduct heat away could be called a cooling factor (this is also the reason that metal objects feel cooler in your hand that plastic objects - metal is much more heat-conducting than plastic is).

So, when some heavy computer or other equipment generates a lot of heat, sometimes air as a heat conductor just won't do. That's when they incorporate water or another liquid in a cooling system (much like automibiles).

Another advantage of a liquid based cooling system is that it is a lot quieter. Rather than having a couple of big fans create a mini hurricane and producing a lot of noise, you can conduct the heat away from the hot elements (like the CPU) and cool it elsewhere using bigger, slower rotating (and therefore quieter) fans.

There's also so-called heat pipes which gained in popularity as of late. Heat pipes are specially constructed hollow pipes that are very efficient in conducting heat away from the hot elements, with the advantage of not having water-filled pipes or rubber hoses running inside your computer that can start to leak (because electricity and water don't mix particularly well).

The faster the cpu clock (more cycles per second) the more heat generated.  Older processors just had big metal fins that acted as heat sinks.  The fins increased surface area that contacted cooler air and led to faster cooling.
When that was not enough we started using fans to force cooler air into the processors and that is what most of us have in our computers today.
When that is not enough we can use water cooling.  Water conducts heat better than air so it is better at cooling the processor.
Parallel processors (multi-core) allow you to achieve better performance at lower clock speeds which saves power and reduces the heat that you need to dissipate.

During the Cold War, the west had very limited exposure to Soviet bloc countries, and the little exposure they did have were mostly men.

Most portrayal of eastern European women of that period amounted to a bad Zsa Zsa Gabor impression, down to the overuse of her trademark ""darlink"".  Soon it grew into a trope even bigger than Zsa Zsa...if you wanted the audience to know the foreign sounding woman was a spy working for the Russians, you gave her a deep voice, a carefree socialite air, and had her say ""darlink"" a lot.

This trope combine with another, the idea that Eastern European women were more masculine.  Soviet propaganda reinforced the notion of gender equality, prominently showing women in traditionally masculine roles, like factory workers, soldiers, and astronauts.  Later, the success of female athletes in international competition reinforced this notion.  Some, like Martina Navratilova, had a more masculine appearance by virtue of being a athlete, while others, like many of their Olympians, used male hormones to enhance their performance, which truly did deepen their voices.

MockRocDoc,"As someone else here said, the simple answer is that the roughness prevents enough surface contact to make a strong mechanical bond, but there is also a deeper reason.  Before getting to wood I will say that this does happen with some solid materials under the right conditions.  Copper can 'friction weld' to itself.  Well polished metals can do this much more easily because of the type of bonds they form.  

Wood is a composite of strong bonds and weaker bonds.  If you could sweep away the weak bonds you might be able to create strong bonds in their place.  Think of firing ceramics.  The water holds the clay together, but if you heat it you drive the water out and eventually form strong bonds between the clay particles.  There is more to it than that but it is a reasonable example.

I can be a little more specific about the bonds and why this is so difficult with wood.  The strongest bonds in the wood are likely chains of carbon which have hydrogen on the sides of the chain.  Hydrogen weakly bonds to water which also weakly bonds to itself.  It would take a lot of energy to strip the water and hydrogen out which is mostly why this won't happen.

marmelukes,"First off they're solids. Solids exist in a mostly or completely rigid state and they don't have a lot of free energy, so they're not good at forming new bonds quickly.

Second, they're biological. Biological bonds are not energetically favorable. Your body expends serious amounts of energy to grow or even just maintain their form. When you no longer have the energy to fight this entropy you're dead, and you begin to decompose. Decomposition is your chemical bonds breaking apart, bit by bit.

Therefore, two pieces of dead wood can not fuse without some sort of goofy process taking place. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's not normal.

Liquids can only fuse because they are less rigid and have more free energy to form new bonds. In water for instance the H2O is constantly making and breaking bonds. Forming H30 and H0 and switching back. However if you sap energy from the system and turn that water into ice, it forms a more rigid structure that is less capable of fusing.",null,4,cdm5q85,1rcljv,explainlikeimfive,new,15

This universe is made of tiny things called atoms.
Atoms are made of even tinier stuff.
Some atoms are positively charged, some are negatively charged, and some are neutral. 
When you rub two objects together, you're actually rubbing off some of the negatively charged stuff from one object to the other. 
This is is called ""static electricity"" because the electrons [negative] aren't really moving, they're just being sort of brushed off.
Negatively charged atoms always wants to stick to positively charged atoms.
Neutral atoms always want to be left alone.
Because all things are made of atoms, and some atoms are positive and some atoms are negative, you end up with clumps of atoms called molecules. 
Molecules exist in three main states.
&gt;Solid
&gt;Liquid
&gt;Gas

Gasses have a lot of energy stored inside them, [valence] so much energy that molecules are flying and bouncing around everywhere. It's easy to mix gasses because there's so much room and chaos between molecules. 

&gt;Liquids are much harder to mix together because the molecules in liquids have less energy than the molecules in gasses and there's not much space for the molecules to move around. Some liquids like oil and water will absolutely refuse to mix together because they repel eachother, and water is heavier than oil.

Solids rarely ever want to mix with other solids. In fact it's incredibly difficult for a solid to mix with anything because the molecules in a solid aren't moving at all. The molecules are at such a low level of energy that they sit around hugging eachother like me and Jess on Sundays. 

Because wood is a solid, it's hard to mix it with more wood.
However, it's easy to excite the wood fibers on the surface of a piece of wood, and get it to stick to another piece of wood with static electricity. 
&gt;OR you could even use some semi-liquid molecules in a higher state of energy called glue, to raise the fibers on the surfaces of two pieces of wood and get them stuck together and wrapped in a solid once the glue dries.

The saving of so many troops enabled the UK to remain in the fight but the loss of so much heavy equipment meant that they were a bit more lightly armed than they wanted to be for a while.  

Goering, commander of the Luftwaffe (Air Force), stated that his aircraft could destroy the British at Dunkirk, so Hitler ordered the Heer (army) to hold.  His Wehrmacht (military) commanders had been worried that the Heer was being overextended and was in danger of being cut off if the French or British launched a counter attack so Goering's boast provided a needed excuse to get the Heer to stop and regroup. The RAF (Royal Air Force) fought the Luftwaffe in the skies over Dunkirk and prevented them from destroying the BEF.

The push forced these Northern forces back and, in order to save the BEF it was ordered to fall back on the Channel ports and evacuate - of these Dunkirk was the only port open which the BEF, together with parts of the French army, fell back on. It was about this stage that non-combatants and non-essentials were evacuated.

When this happened the Belgians (until their surrender) and the BEF held the right flank and the French most of the rest of the line. This then got smaller and the French army took over more of the line to hold it.

The evacuation took place mostly from a jetty on the port which was suitable for large warships to get into. Men also went on the beaches and even up to their necks in water - this leads to the famous little ships of Dunkirk which does what it says on the tin: small ships, crewed by civilians from all over the South coast of Britain including London picked up men off the beaches and sailed them either to waiting warships or back to England often under air attack. 

Towards the end of the evacuation French troops were also evacuated in part because most of the BEF had gone and also for political reasons. 

For reasons unknown to this day Hitler halted his Panzers and left the job to Goering and the Luftwaffe. The RAF's home squadrons - which were desperately needed for the inevitable defence of Britain - fought to keep the German planes from the beaches but because of both cloud cover and the need to shoot the bombers down before the reached the beach (for obvious reasons) meant this battle went largely unseen by the troops leading to accusations of the RAF not helping.

How Dick became a nickname for Richard is known and is one of those “knee bone connected to the thigh bone” type progressions, somewhat similar to how the word ‘soccer’ came about.  Due to people having to write everything by hand, shortened versions of Richard were common, such as ‘Ric’ or ‘Rich’.  This in turn gave rise to nicknames like ‘Richie’, ‘Rick’, and ‘Ricket’, among others.  People also used to like to use rhyming names; thus, someone who was nicknamed Rich might further be nicknamed Hitch.  Thus, Richard -&gt; Ric -&gt; Rick gave rise to nicknames like Dick and Hick around the early 13th century.

While few today call Richards ‘Hick’, the nickname ‘Dick’ has stuck around, and of course has come to mean many other things as well.  Its persistence as associated with Richard is probably in part because around the 16th century Dick started to be synonymous with ‘man’, ‘lad’, or ‘fellow’, sort of a general name for any ‘Tom, Dick, or Francis” (which by the way appears in Shakespeare’s Henry IV, written in the late 16th century, with Dick at this point firmly established as an “every man” name).

aer71,"Your body evolved to rest on your back with your head on a flat surface, or on your side with an arm supporting your head. If you lie flat, facing up, your head/neck/torso will be correctly aligned. Most people don't need a pillow at all, and unless you have an existing condition which requires extra support, you might want to try sleeping without a pillow.

Babies don't have pillows partly because their larger head-to-body ratio means that a pillow would distort their necks even more, but mainly because of the danger of rolling over and suffocating.

eideid,"A bank's function is to underwrite good debts and fund them by borrowing either from depositors or other institutions. It gets paid through the fees and interest it charges, but a substantial portion of this has to be used to cover debt which turns out to be bad. In order to do this, it has to maintain a fund of cash (or cash-like) assets which the bank draws on when debts it has underwritten are not repaid by the debtor. If a bank writes way too many debts which fail, this fund can be exhausted and the bank becomes insolvent.

The predominant view of regulation prior to the recent financial crisis has been dubbed 'micro-prudential' in that it cared about ensuring that each bank was stable independently with the belief that a bunch of individually sound banks would result in a sound banking sector as a whole. A major factor in the severity of this financial crisis was that more mainstream banks began using methods of shifting risk around such as credit default swaps which made their individual books each look very good, but which made the banking system as a whole more vulnerable to failure. This has led to calls for regulation which has greater awareness of these systemic risk dubbed 'macro-prudential'.",null,1,cdltyc4,1rcjpb,explainlikeimfive,new,6

fuckyousigmoidcolon,"Some strains of bacteria have the ability to transfer resistance between them via plasmids. When you do not finish a course of antibiotics, you not only leave the mutated resistant strains alive, but you also leave the ""regular"" strains alive too. The mutated strain can then pass on its resistance to the regular strain, which in addition to the selective pressure mentioned in other comments makes it more likely for that strain to survive, reproduce, and pass on their drug resistance.

It's therefore incredibly important to finish your treatment, as treatment times are usually calculated in order to minimise the risk of this sort of thing happening. Unfortunately we are reaching a point where antibiotic misuse has caused a lot of drug-resistant strains to pop up, and we're running short on treatments for them.",null,1,cdlvcef,1rcjnq,explainlikeimfive,new,2
