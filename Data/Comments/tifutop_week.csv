If the body of the email was written professionally and didn't need to be reworded before forwarding on to the GM I would just edit the message so the title is different, and maybe add little to it so if there is an edit time you have an excuse(since you can access it from home and it is just a draft).

mcj2,"10 months ago I was in the opposite position (almost exactly; I have been friends with this girl for more than 10 years, I started dating someone, she confessed her love... except we were never physical).  

I can't speak for your girl obviously, but from my perspective this is what I thought about the situation:

I appreciated how difficult it was for her to admit that to me, knowing that it likely wouldn't change anything (at the time, I had been dating the ""new"" girl for about a month).  I understood the desire to put it all out there, and if I were in her position I likely would have done something similar.

However, in my case this girl had about a year that she could have come to me with her feelings (while I was single).  It wouldn't have changed my feelings since to me our relationship is strictly platonic, but it would have been a little more respectful of MY feelings.

She said she needed space when I let her down as gently but clearly as possible, and I obliged.  For awhile, we didn't speak.  A few months later she reached out and we began texting/g-chatting (small talk, mostly) infrequently.  Now our relationship is as close as it likely ever will be to ""how it used to be"".  In fact, I hung out with her and another friend last night (without my gf present) and it felt very comfortable for us both.

Ultimately, I am glad she told me her feelings since I know how much strong (quiet) feelings can eat away at a person.  I do wish she had come to me before I was in another relationship, but I have no ill feelings towards her for it. 

TL:DR, friend confessed love to me, it was awkward for awhile, but comfortable friendship was not ruined.  IMO, you didn't fuck up but you should have said something before you found out she was seeing someone else.

Iron__mind,"The way I see it is you've got the awkward part out of the way, now you've got to try and relax a bit (I am fully aware that will be virtually impossible) and concentrate on not making things more awkward.

Give her a bit of space to get her head round it, keep yourself busy (you can be pretty productive when you're trying to avoid something) and when she's ready to talk try to act like you didn't say it. Don't deny it but just try to be friends like you were before, show her that this is not the end of you being friends and hopefully she will feel at ease.

When it does come up (pretty sure she'll want to talk about it eventually), apologise for blurting it out like that and for putting her under pressure especially as she'd just told you about some other guy. Tell her how hard it was to tell her because you don't want to ruin your friendship, explain how you've recently realised your feelings for her are not purely platonic anymore and ask her how she feels about it.

When you've heard her thoughts, ask her what you can do to not lose her, ask yourself this while you're at it.

1. Clear area around toilet of baskets and such

2. Find plunger and plunge toilet. You tube it if you don't know how

3. Flush excess water and toilet paper once the clog is gone (you'll hear it go down). ( If you turned the water off, here's where you turn it back on. Be ready to turn back off in case it didn't work. ) 

4. Dry everything up with paper towels. If you must use regular towels, try to find dark/old ones

on the positive side, you don't have to pay the money all at once, nor do you have the option to (if you had the money in your bank account). the government will take that money out of your paychecks that you get from the national guard. you can go on some government site (i forget and am too lazy to look) to adjust the rate at which the government takes the money out. if i remember correctly, the default is 50 dollars per paycheck.

Suffice to say, I was extremely embarrassed.",null,0,cdn3a6d,1rfdwz,tifu,top_week,4
somedudeshomie,"this reminds me of a very bad new years party I went to a few years ago. there were like 15 of us in a 2 bedroom duplex with over 400 $ worth of booze, no big deal right? the party itself wasn't bad, cops were called at 10pm for a noise complaint on new years (if I recall it was also a friday) but that was easily dealt with. so were all passed out after all that nonsense and I wake up to an odd noise...I'm kinda like what the fuck is that? holy shit it's cold in here and that's...WHAT IN THE FLYING FUCK?! I kick my now soaked blanket off and this dude continues taking a piss on the couch I was just sleeping on. out of all my screaming at this dude only 1 person in the house wakes up to say ""stop it hippie (that's what we called him)"" then promptly went back to sleep. really helpful. so now I'm cold and my legs are soaked in piss and it turns out that a window got left open in the owners bedroom which was locked with him sound asleep and not giving a fuck that I'm pounding on his door, awesome. well fuck it ill just take a shower right? nope. 1 chick is passed out with her head on the toilet, another passed out in the shower. ended up just sitting there for a couple hours until I heard pounding upstairs and found out the owner was trying to beat the window closed as it had frozen open and managed to wake everyone up in the process so I could take a shower, even got hooked up with a pair of pajamas so I didn't have to run home smelling like piss...ah good times right there.

Anyhoo, it sounds like you were trying to give the guy a bit of friendly advice, and it got blown out of proportion. Letting him know to have a backup plan in case he was fired isn't the same as telling him he's about to be fired. 

And where, out of that conversation, did he get the idea that you were gunning to take over everything? He must like to jump to conclusions. If you've only been there a week, why would you make a claim like that? That was a rhetorical question, as I don't see where you mentioned anything like that. 

Did you explain to your boss how the conversation *actually* went? This kind of thing is very common in the workplace. You're in a position where you are the new guy, and kind of low on the totem pole. This co-worker of yours used your conversation as a means to make you look bad to your boss, since one doesn't usually have a lot of credibility when first starting at a new job. This co-worker feels threatened by your presence, and so they're doing whatever they can to damage your credibility with the boss. 

It's generally a bad idea to talk to co-workers about anything beyond ""Hi, how are you today?"" or ""How about that weather we're having?"" Anything else you say, someone will find a way to use it against you. I've lost a bunch of jobs over stuff like this.

noncreepymama,"this will be a very unpopular opinion, but I want to throw it out there. even though you have no sexual desire for these women, they are still offering you emotional support for your grieving that perhaps you should have been seeking from your wife, or like you mentioned, a counselor. your wife may see this as an emotional affair. i.e. ""why didnt you come to me to talk about and deal with your grief?"" 

i am not knocking having female friends, but i would certainly be hurt if I were her. however, if there is proof that its all just been platonic friendship, then i think she would hopefully understand the circumstances that you're in (the grieving period) and that you wouldnt have been so chatty with these ladies had you not been dealing with the loss of your mom. 

i ditto the ""write down the whole thing to explain and let her come to you after she has time to think about it"" and again, be careful with the emotional relationships you have with other people as well. it can occasionally open a door to ""more"".

tends2forgetstuff,"Over 20 years of marriage here - tell her you are SORRY, and admit all. It is amazing how much saying you are truly sorry can do and then don't get impatient with her as she processes all that has come at her. It has multiple parts 1) lady friends she didn't know about [why the hell not?] and 2) not sharing your grief with her [why the hell not?] so it will take some serious patience on both parts to get through this. You have to talk and talk some more about this with her - talk until she is satisfied - not you -- her. Tell her you want to go to therapy about the grief and that you would like her to go with you a time or two to be involved with you. It may be that other issues pop up during therapy or during your talks with her. Relationships last through being open - secrets are relationship killers - if you doubt you should tell your spouse then it's a problem and needs to be addressed or stay the hell away from it. Ask her if she wants to meet the friends when she is ready - even if it's just look at their FB pages at this point. You need more transparency to get through this. Be patient and willing to repair - and do the work - relationships take work. Our theory has always been - do you appreciate and love the person enough to stay and do the work to be with them?

While it isn't cheating or anything terrible in the grand scheme of things, it is true that you lied through the omission of what is obviously a part of your everyday. Deleting the texts make you look even more deceitful.  Don't give me the shit about liking a clean text folder.

Sarlax,"Not telling her was a breach of trust on two levels: First, you didn't trust her to maturely handle the fact that you have good female friends. Second, you actively concealed it for a decade.

It's also very suspicious, especially as you posted in the thread that you purge your inbox all the time.

I think there's only one way forward: Offer to introduce her to all of your friends. Tell her you understand that hiding them was inappropriate and that you want to make it right. Be serious about this offer, and talk to her about it *before* ""clearing"" it with your friends. If you want her to trust you, you have to make her emotions the priority in this case.

Further, if you're playing the ""I was depressed"", along with your trust issues with her, you should consider couple's counseling. 

Finally, don't be defensive about any of this. You're the one who hid these relationships.

As an aside, how actively were you hiding all this? It sounds like a lot more than just ""not mentioning"" it. 700 texts in October is about 23 messages a day. I can't imagine you were able to text that much unless you were deliberately concealing it from your wife.

noncreepymama,"this will be a very unpopular opinion, but I want to throw it out there. even though you have no sexual desire for these women, they are still offering you emotional support for your grieving that perhaps you should have been seeking from your wife, or like you mentioned, a counselor. your wife may see this as an emotional affair. i.e. ""why didnt you come to me to talk about and deal with your grief?"" 

i am not knocking having female friends, but i would certainly be hurt if I were her. however, if there is proof that its all just been platonic friendship, then i think she would hopefully understand the circumstances that you're in (the grieving period) and that you wouldnt have been so chatty with these ladies had you not been dealing with the loss of your mom. 

i ditto the ""write down the whole thing to explain and let her come to you after she has time to think about it"" and again, be careful with the emotional relationships you have with other people as well. it can occasionally open a door to ""more"".

tends2forgetstuff,"Over 20 years of marriage here - tell her you are SORRY, and admit all. It is amazing how much saying you are truly sorry can do and then don't get impatient with her as she processes all that has come at her. It has multiple parts 1) lady friends she didn't know about [why the hell not?] and 2) not sharing your grief with her [why the hell not?] so it will take some serious patience on both parts to get through this. You have to talk and talk some more about this with her - talk until she is satisfied - not you -- her. Tell her you want to go to therapy about the grief and that you would like her to go with you a time or two to be involved with you. It may be that other issues pop up during therapy or during your talks with her. Relationships last through being open - secrets are relationship killers - if you doubt you should tell your spouse then it's a problem and needs to be addressed or stay the hell away from it. Ask her if she wants to meet the friends when she is ready - even if it's just look at their FB pages at this point. You need more transparency to get through this. Be patient and willing to repair - and do the work - relationships take work. Our theory has always been - do you appreciate and love the person enough to stay and do the work to be with them?

Sarlax,"Not telling her was a breach of trust on two levels: First, you didn't trust her to maturely handle the fact that you have good female friends. Second, you actively concealed it for a decade.

It's also very suspicious, especially as you posted in the thread that you purge your inbox all the time.

I think there's only one way forward: Offer to introduce her to all of your friends. Tell her you understand that hiding them was inappropriate and that you want to make it right. Be serious about this offer, and talk to her about it *before* ""clearing"" it with your friends. If you want her to trust you, you have to make her emotions the priority in this case.

Further, if you're playing the ""I was depressed"", along with your trust issues with her, you should consider couple's counseling. 

Finally, don't be defensive about any of this. You're the one who hid these relationships.

As an aside, how actively were you hiding all this? It sounds like a lot more than just ""not mentioning"" it. 700 texts in October is about 23 messages a day. I can't imagine you were able to text that much unless you were deliberately concealing it from your wife.

Damn girl think.  Had you played that smooth, you would have been in for sure.

And as a guy, I don't know who these guys are who wouldn't care if a girl they were talking to dropped a dildo from here bag then walked away and would still be ok with that.  If a girl who I wasn't super interested in dropped a dildo and then left awkwardly mid chat, I would definitely be WTF'n.  If, he's super into you it won't matter, but if he was into you on a level where that wouldn't bother him, but at that level, he'd give you his number, get yours, and your email, or definitely make it clear he wanted to hang out.

But as a guy, there are those girls you really like and chase hard, and there are cute girls, who you think are cute, but feel it won't pan out because you're not sure if your gonna invest time and work into attracting her, for her not get interested back.
