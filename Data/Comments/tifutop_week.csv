I tugged quite hard and felt something pop. I took the ball part off and it was in my mouth. She screamed (almost typed creamed by mistake and laughed) and I didn't get laid.  ,null,0,cdme7y1,1r9726,tifu,top_week,4

Dav_C,"So you leave the bathroom door open while you shit?

 Your family only has one shared laptop and when you take it they immediately search for it? So taking a laptop to the bathroom directly means that you will be watching porn? (What about a smartphone or tablet?) 

Does your mother seriously believe that somebody would fap WHILE taking a shit? (I imagine you could smell it if she came in) 

Even if you were beating it, your mother decides to call you out for it and make you feel bad for it? (great parenting, really) 

Also, because you MIGHT have fapped you'll get consequences for it, why?

zalloy,"Wow, that was kind of hard to read. 

Anyhoo, it sounds like you were trying to give the guy a bit of friendly advice, and it got blown out of proportion. Letting him know to have a backup plan in case he was fired isn't the same as telling him he's about to be fired. 

And where, out of that conversation, did he get the idea that you were gunning to take over everything? He must like to jump to conclusions. If you've only been there a week, why would you make a claim like that? That was a rhetorical question, as I don't see where you mentioned anything like that. 

Did you explain to your boss how the conversation *actually* went? This kind of thing is very common in the workplace. You're in a position where you are the new guy, and kind of low on the totem pole. This co-worker of yours used your conversation as a means to make you look bad to your boss, since one doesn't usually have a lot of credibility when first starting at a new job. This co-worker feels threatened by your presence, and so they're doing whatever they can to damage your credibility with the boss. 

It's generally a bad idea to talk to co-workers about anything beyond ""Hi, how are you today?"" or ""How about that weather we're having?"" Anything else you say, someone will find a way to use it against you. I've lost a bunch of jobs over stuff like this. 

Your co-workers are just co-workers. They are *not* your friends. The same guy who sits in the next cube over, that you talk with every Monday about football will happily go tell your boss you have nothing better to do than talk sports, even when he initiated the conversation.

I get off at the nearest Safeway and just my luck, they've locked up the restroom for the night.  So I waddle up to the a nearby gas station and a block before shit hits the pants...

I get off at the nearest Safeway and just my luck, they've locked up the restroom for the night.  So I waddle up to the a nearby gas station and a block before shit hits the pants...

Now I couldn't use the gas station restroom.  Instead I have to take the walk of shame.  A mile long walk in my own feces back to my house.  I took back roads to avoid human contact and thankfully no one was home when I arrived.

GottaGetToIt,"So here's the what you should have done comment... Look at the back of the toilet. Most toilets have a faucet looking thing back there. Turn it righty tighty and the flow to the toilet will stop. 

Have you fixed the bathroom yet? If not:

1. Clear area around toilet of baskets and such

2. Find plunger and plunge toilet. You tube it if you don't know how

3. Flush excess water and toilet paper once the clog is gone (you'll hear it go down). ( If you turned the water off, here's where you turn it back on. Be ready to turn back off in case it didn't work. ) 

4. Dry everything up with paper towels. If you must use regular towels, try to find dark/old ones

5. Wipe everything down with a disinfectant which you can probably find under bathroom or kitchen sink

My experience is that you can try and talk to people like this and they will draw you into their world.  I like empathising, understanding and talking with folk but the time spent doing this with some people can be a fruitless exercise where they suck your energy from you to no end.  They need to talk to a professional trained in the field.

mcj2,"10 months ago I was in the opposite position (almost exactly; I have been friends with this girl for more than 10 years, I started dating someone, she confessed her love... except we were never physical).  

I can't speak for your girl obviously, but from my perspective this is what I thought about the situation:

I appreciated how difficult it was for her to admit that to me, knowing that it likely wouldn't change anything (at the time, I had been dating the ""new"" girl for about a month).  I understood the desire to put it all out there, and if I were in her position I likely would have done something similar.

However, in my case this girl had about a year that she could have come to me with her feelings (while I was single).  It wouldn't have changed my feelings since to me our relationship is strictly platonic, but it would have been a little more respectful of MY feelings.

She said she needed space when I let her down as gently but clearly as possible, and I obliged.  For awhile, we didn't speak.  A few months later she reached out and we began texting/g-chatting (small talk, mostly) infrequently.  Now our relationship is as close as it likely ever will be to ""how it used to be"".  In fact, I hung out with her and another friend last night (without my gf present) and it felt very comfortable for us both.

Ultimately, I am glad she told me her feelings since I know how much strong (quiet) feelings can eat away at a person.  I do wish she had come to me before I was in another relationship, but I have no ill feelings towards her for it. 

TL:DR, friend confessed love to me, it was awkward for awhile, but comfortable friendship was not ruined.  IMO, you didn't fuck up but you should have said something before you found out she was seeing someone else.

Your instincts are bad and you should feel bad.

&gt; Now, I'm an experienced hunter, and I know how to handle a firearm. I grew up taking the rules of gun safety very seriously when out in the field or with guns I never personally handled. 

Clearly you're not.  

&gt; Rule one of firearm safety is ALWAYS ASSUME THE GUN IS LOADED. 
&gt; However, this situation had caused me to lax the rules just slightly because a.) I wasn't planning on loading or messing with these weapons beyond a few seconds out of the cabinet each and b.) my father is one of those guys who made sure I never forgot the rules of gun safety. He always warned me about being stupid with firearms and to never forget to unload a weapon when it was not being used, so I didn't assume the shotgun would have anything in the chamber.

Chuckgofer,"&gt; When I was shouldering the gun, my finger must have moved out of instinct and squeezed the trigger

Your instincts are bad and you should feel bad.

&gt; Now, I'm an experienced hunter, and I know how to handle a firearm. I grew up taking the rules of gun safety very seriously when out in the field or with guns I never personally handled. 

Clearly you're not.  

&gt; Rule one of firearm safety is ALWAYS ASSUME THE GUN IS LOADED. 
&gt; However, this situation had caused me to lax the rules just slightly because a.) I wasn't planning on loading or messing with these weapons beyond a few seconds out of the cabinet each and b.) my father is one of those guys who made sure I never forgot the rules of gun safety. He always warned me about being stupid with firearms and to never forget to unload a weapon when it was not being used, so I didn't assume the shotgun would have anything in the chamber.

boil ramen till done throw in a colander

cut up half of each bell pepper, half the onion, and couple handfulls of mushrooms

cook veggies until theyre the way you want them (sorry idk)

CapgrasX13,"This moment happens to everyone, it's a totally normal part of the grieving process.  The shock of a loss is always so emotional that it almost seems like a spectacle, but at some point the true implication of the loss really hits you on a spiritual level.  It usually take a year or more for this to happen.  I've even seen it after people lose their dog.

That being said, my biggest bit of advice whenever people are dealing with a death is to try to turn it into a positive somehow.  Meditate on it and try to use it to better yourself.  Maybe there was something your dad was passionate about that he didn't get to do or finish; you could do that in his honor.  Think about the frailty of life and how lucky we all are to have the one we do, and how it's almost foolish to waste a single precious second of it.  There are a plethora of ways to better yourself through tragedy - the best swords are forged in the hottest flames.

Talk to your family about this if you need to.  Or a friend, or complete stranger in a bar, whichever scenario you may be more comfortable with.  (I'm compelled to take an aside to say I'm appalled that the previous two sentences both ended in prepositions...oh well)  Sometimes getting another person's perspective can help you understand moments like this better.

That being said, my biggest bit of advice whenever people are dealing with a death is to try to turn it into a positive somehow.  Meditate on it and try to use it to better yourself.  Maybe there was something your dad was passionate about that he didn't get to do or finish; you could do that in his honor.  Think about the frailty of life and how lucky we all are to have the one we do, and how it's almost foolish to waste a single precious second of it.  There are a plethora of ways to better yourself through tragedy - the best swords are forged in the hottest flames.

Talk to your family about this if you need to.  Or a friend, or complete stranger in a bar, whichever scenario you may be more comfortable with.  (I'm compelled to take an aside to say I'm appalled that the previous two sentences both ended in prepositions...oh well)  Sometimes getting another person's perspective can help you understand moments like this better.

For what it's worth, I'll send some positive vibes your way.  I don't know if that works, but just on the chance it does.",null,0,cdotzh4,1rmwbe,tifu,top_week,10

Ouch.  I've had that happen before as well.  My first (and only) car accident, I rear-ended someone at a busy 4-way intersection.  The damage was minimal and neither of us was hurt, but we backed traffic up for half a mile or so because there was nowhere for us to pull off to.  The cops showed up, and the other driver began chatting them up and giving them shit - turns out she was an off-duty cop.

It could've cause a power surge and broke your motherboard or the power supply. This happened to me with RAM but luckily it didn't surge my motherboard. Switch the power on the power supply to off and unplug it then power it on. It should light up for .5 of a second then shut off. Solution is to replace the motherboard or power supply or GPU.

Back in the day, a company I worked for used these custom computers with a proprietary video capture card and high resolution camera, to decode 2D barcodes.

My co-worker had unplugged the computer from the wall, and was trying to swap out a capture card. As soon as he touched it, there was a spark, and a small puff of smoke. 

POOF! Goodbye $20,000 video capture card. Apparently, he'd forgotten about the charge that the capacitors hold, even when the device is unplugged.

On the plus side, you will eventually get over it.  You'll learn to live with the pain you feel and it will subside.  Day by day you will feel a little better until one day you will wake up and be over her.

I'm not going to say something cliché like ""there's plenty more fish in the sea"". You will find someone else though. Someone better who will cherish your heart and it will be (for lack of a better word) awesome.

When you're young you think losing your virginity to someone means you're supposed to be with them forever, but trust me, you need to experience some things. It probably hurts now because you feel like the other guy was better than you and that's why she wants to blow him- he isn't. He'ss just different. We're wired to seek variety in our genes so it's natural to want to test the waters when you're young. 

So enjoy being single homie! And as someone who's been on both sides of this (I was her twice and you once), just chalk it up to her being a fucking kid. You're both just dumb kids that don't know what you want yet, no offense. You'll move on and look back and realize you needed this to happen, but realistically probably not until you've met someone else and inevitably compare the two. You might even overcompensate by going for someone who's the complete opposite of her and tricking yourself into believing she's the one. Then you start having your doubts a couple months down the road but it's already too late; you told her you loved her and you can't go back or you'll look like an idiot so fuck that you need to prove to Amanda you found someone better and Amanda's a bitch! But I digress, and that's a story for another day. You need to make a few mistakes along the way to fine tune what you're really looking for.

So, grieve about it if you need to, but for god's sake don't be the faggot that uses grief to try to get attention from another girl. That shit will only attract the equally emotionally damaged, which you definitely don't want. Unless you want some depraved, crazy, amazing sex. In that case, stick your dick in crazy. You need to have your life threatened a few times (or maybe just your status quo) to realize how much you value it. Anyway, I've been all over the place with this because I think I'm drunker than I think I am. Feel free to ask for clarification because I'm sure I fucked up someone in here.

Once again, enjoy the single life. I'm sure you have the biggest, swinginest dick in all the land OP. The other fish in the sea gon' learn today. Deuces

EDIT: I'd like to add for future reference that ""breaks"" are for pussies. If you can feel the disconnect already, a break isn't going to fix it. Break up like a man and don't become that annoying couple that's always on again off again because your boys will stop giving a shit and won't bother to keep up whether you're with her or not at any given time. Or go on the break. FUck it. I said make mistakes right? Your call. I'll be right behind you ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg all homo",null,3,cdq2wep,1rq3aa,tifu,top_week,14
smileandmeanit,"I'm not trying to defend her, but sometimes people need to experience other things and other people and a bit of freedom before they can really settle down. 
Given that you both lost your virginity to each other, you've obviously never explored those different possibilities. 
It doesn't feel like it now, when it's raw and fresh, but this is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to you. You get a somewhat clean break, instead of having it drag on and on until you're both bitter and depressed, and thus the opportunity to go out and really find yourself and find who you are and who you make yourself, without having a right hand lady. 

I'm a huge believer in ""when one door closes, it gives opportunity for another potentially even better door to open"", and I can confidently say that this mantra has proven itself over and over again to me, from both my first relationship to second, and second to current (*and having felt like I could have found ""that guy I wanted to be with forever"" in each of them). All have improved, I've managed to learn things from each and implement to my next.

It hurts now, but you'll be okay. Have faith

tnv91,"This might be a bit late for you to notice, OP, but just a little advice from someone who has felt a fraction of that pain in case you do see it:

1. Get rid. There's no reason for you to stay with her; if you do you'll only be bitter and resent her.

2. More importantly, take some time being single. After a fairly long relationship you really need time to be by yourself again. Sure, it's lonely at first but you will start seeing the benefit soon. When you're in a LTR you don't realise yourself changing as a result of your SO's influence. This isn't to say she's manipulating you but instead you change simply by being around her. And it's so gradual you don't even notice (like your hair growing or another, better example). You become suppressed because you tend to show your SO the side of you that you want them to see. You need time to be yourself again. You became a 'stale' boyfriend for a reason, my man.

3. Like someone else said, cut all ties. I can't stress this enough. The less you see her pop up on your newsfeed and the like, the better. You need to be thinking about you.

4. After a relationship like this you need to be selfish for a while. This doesn't mean taking pregnant ladies' seats on the bus or not feeding your pets. You need to do stuff for YOU. Focus on bettering yourself and moving towards that idealistic image you have of yourself in your head. And if you don't have said image, get one. By taking little steps towards this (be it taking a class, getting fit or eating better) you can take your mind off the pain. This doesn't mean avoiding it (it sounds like you've agonised over it enough, and fair play, she was important to you) but you'll see that improving yourself can be quite therapeutic.

Good luck, you'll be fine. You're not going to look back and laugh at this but you will see it as a turning point. Get out of that rut!

This girl, who was supposed to love you and went out and fucked a guy *to *spite* you*. That is your first signal that she is emotionally unstable. Spite is a disgusting thing, and anyone that *plans* to spite another should fuck right off.

You're shitty relationship ended. Man, that sucks! You're always going to have a deeply set fondness towards her - virginities are a big thing - and that's fine. But don't let this cloud your judgement - she wronged you in an unforgivable way.

Now, I'm not saying you should move on and experience the other fish in the sea. That's bullshit, because you're going to need time to heal. Take some ""me"" time. Go get a hobby, spank the monkey, learn a new skill, spank the monkey again. Do whatever *you* want. You now have the opportunity to do whatever the fuck you want, whenever you want. 

Hell, go skydiving. Hard to think of bitches when you're hurtling towards the earth.

Don't think ill of her. Sure, it's a shitty situation and to me she's a shitty person, but I'm not you. I didn't lose my virginity and spend a year and a half with her.

On the plus side, you will eventually get over it.  You'll learn to live with the pain you feel and it will subside.  Day by day you will feel a little better until one day you will wake up and be over her.

When you're young you think losing your virginity to someone means you're supposed to be with them forever, but trust me, you need to experience some things. It probably hurts now because you feel like the other guy was better than you and that's why she wants to blow him- he isn't. He'ss just different. We're wired to seek variety in our genes so it's natural to want to test the waters when you're young. 

So enjoy being single homie! And as someone who's been on both sides of this (I was her twice and you once), just chalk it up to her being a fucking kid. You're both just dumb kids that don't know what you want yet, no offense. You'll move on and look back and realize you needed this to happen, but realistically probably not until you've met someone else and inevitably compare the two. You might even overcompensate by going for someone who's the complete opposite of her and tricking yourself into believing she's the one. Then you start having your doubts a couple months down the road but it's already too late; you told her you loved her and you can't go back or you'll look like an idiot so fuck that you need to prove to Amanda you found someone better and Amanda's a bitch! But I digress, and that's a story for another day. You need to make a few mistakes along the way to fine tune what you're really looking for.

So, grieve about it if you need to, but for god's sake don't be the faggot that uses grief to try to get attention from another girl. That shit will only attract the equally emotionally damaged, which you definitely don't want. Unless you want some depraved, crazy, amazing sex. In that case, stick your dick in crazy. You need to have your life threatened a few times (or maybe just your status quo) to realize how much you value it. Anyway, I've been all over the place with this because I think I'm drunker than I think I am. Feel free to ask for clarification because I'm sure I fucked up someone in here.

smileandmeanit,"I'm not trying to defend her, but sometimes people need to experience other things and other people and a bit of freedom before they can really settle down. 
Given that you both lost your virginity to each other, you've obviously never explored those different possibilities. 
It doesn't feel like it now, when it's raw and fresh, but this is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to you. You get a somewhat clean break, instead of having it drag on and on until you're both bitter and depressed, and thus the opportunity to go out and really find yourself and find who you are and who you make yourself, without having a right hand lady. 

I'm a huge believer in ""when one door closes, it gives opportunity for another potentially even better door to open"", and I can confidently say that this mantra has proven itself over and over again to me, from both my first relationship to second, and second to current (*and having felt like I could have found ""that guy I wanted to be with forever"" in each of them). All have improved, I've managed to learn things from each and implement to my next.

RustyWaffle,"My girlfriend said she wanted to take a break when she went away to college. With her reputation of being a nympho skank, I said to just forget it and do what she wants because I don't want to worry about someone cheating on me all the time (I didn't tell her that but I hinted at the fact that separation would just be stressful.) I had friends going to the same school that later told me I was right.

Fast forward to the summer break, we get together again without really saying anything about what went on over the past year, and she does the same thing before going back to college. I told her whatever again, and I don't wanna deal with her shit anymore. Just a few weeks ago she contacts me again asking if I wanted to start over, so I'm assuming she got led on by some frat douchebag and finally realized she was kind of a slut. At that point I decided to be blunt and flat out tell her that I didn't want anything to do with her anymore (involving a little more expletives). I didn't want to sound mean, but I know if I was too nice about it then she would keep trying.",null,3,cdpxpk7,1rq3aa,tifu,top_week,5

I convinced myself that we could get back together for almost a year before realizing that it would never be the same. Getting over it was the hardest, but best, thing I've ever done. Not having her to make me feel comfortable forced me to start going out and becoming a better version of myself. I learned to dance and drink and have fun and be fun to be around, and how to talk to women. You're only going to be young once, don't lock yourself down too early. Learn other people and you'll learn yourself too. I've just started balding and I'm the most confident in myself I've ever been because of the things I've learned since that breakup.

tnv91,"This might be a bit late for you to notice, OP, but just a little advice from someone who has felt a fraction of that pain in case you do see it:

1. Get rid. There's no reason for you to stay with her; if you do you'll only be bitter and resent her.

2. More importantly, take some time being single. After a fairly long relationship you really need time to be by yourself again. Sure, it's lonely at first but you will start seeing the benefit soon. When you're in a LTR you don't realise yourself changing as a result of your SO's influence. This isn't to say she's manipulating you but instead you change simply by being around her. And it's so gradual you don't even notice (like your hair growing or another, better example). You become suppressed because you tend to show your SO the side of you that you want them to see. You need time to be yourself again. You became a 'stale' boyfriend for a reason, my man.

3. Like someone else said, cut all ties. I can't stress this enough. The less you see her pop up on your newsfeed and the like, the better. You need to be thinking about you.

4. After a relationship like this you need to be selfish for a while. This doesn't mean taking pregnant ladies' seats on the bus or not feeding your pets. You need to do stuff for YOU. Focus on bettering yourself and moving towards that idealistic image you have of yourself in your head. And if you don't have said image, get one. By taking little steps towards this (be it taking a class, getting fit or eating better) you can take your mind off the pain. This doesn't mean avoiding it (it sounds like you've agonised over it enough, and fair play, she was important to you) but you'll see that improving yourself can be quite therapeutic.

Good luck, you'll be fine. You're not going to look back and laugh at this but you will see it as a turning point. Get out of that rut!

SquishMitt3n,"This is literally the best thing to happen to you. You may not feel it now, hell I'm probably pissing you off right now, but it's true and will become evident over time.

This girl, who was supposed to love you and went out and fucked a guy *to *spite* you*. That is your first signal that she is emotionally unstable. Spite is a disgusting thing, and anyone that *plans* to spite another should fuck right off.

You're shitty relationship ended. Man, that sucks! You're always going to have a deeply set fondness towards her - virginities are a big thing - and that's fine. But don't let this cloud your judgement - she wronged you in an unforgivable way.

Now, I'm not saying you should move on and experience the other fish in the sea. That's bullshit, because you're going to need time to heal. Take some ""me"" time. Go get a hobby, spank the monkey, learn a new skill, spank the monkey again. Do whatever *you* want. You now have the opportunity to do whatever the fuck you want, whenever you want.
