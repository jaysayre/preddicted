Series_of_Accidents,"Reminds me of this one:

Once in a land far, far away there lived a group of people called Trids. The Trids were happy except for the huge ogre that lived on the mountain. The ogre would periodically terrorize the Trids.

The Trids tired of the ogre and sought to reason with him. They thought one of their religious leaders would be a good intermediary. So a group of Trids and their minister went up the mountain and before they could even say one word the ogre kicked them down the mountain. Not being dismayed the Trids thought that maybe the ogre was Catholic, so they sent another delegation, this time led by the local priest. But alas, as they approached the ogre he once again kicked them all down the mountain.

The Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the ogre was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they wrote to the people of another land and asked them to send a Rabbi to help them with the ogre. The Rabbi arrived and led a delegation of Trids up the mountain. The ogre saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain. The Rabbi, having been told of the previous expeditions, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the ogre. The ogre laughed and replied:

""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""

One day, coming back from a hunt and carrying a lot of Mynas, he saw a lion in his path.  There was no way to go around, and luckily the lion was asleep, so the scientist quietly, gingerly stepped over the lion...when suddenly a big group of African soldiers popped out of the jungle and arrested him.

So a news reporter was doing a story on homeless people and wanted to find out what type of interesting things they found on railroad tracks, So he visited the local soup kitchen and found a table of three homeless men sitting down, 

He asked to sit down and said he was doing a story on cool things found on railroad tracks, He asked the first man what the coolest thing he has ever found. 

""Once while wondering the track I found a twenty dollar bill and came back here with cheap wine and drank with my pals""

The next man said 
""Last week when I was crossing the tracks I found a hundred dollar bill and came back here a with lots of liquor and got drunk with my friends"" 

The news reporter was shocked at how much money he found and asked the last guy what the best thing he has found, the man replied 

""Last weekend I found a beautiful women tied to the tracks so I untied her and had the best sex ever all day and night, we did all kinds of things""

The news reporter was astounded that a women would have sex with this homeless man.

&gt;A doctor walks into a bar. He appears to be exhausted; his hair is disheveled, his face is drawn. Bartender asks “rough day?” The doctor sits at the bar and says “its flu season, give me a shot.”

/r/dadjokes


&gt;An elderly man walks into a bar holding hands with a beautiful young woman. He is obviously a man of great wealth, as his watch is decked in diamonds and his suit is of Italian make. As the pair sits down, the bartender says “I’m sorry sir, but we don’t serve minors here,” nodding towards the woman. The man retorts “Now hold on just a minute. How would you know if she’s a minor? You haven’t even asked for her ID!” The bartender shrugs and says “she’s clearly a gold digger.”

Groan. 

&gt;A large block of ice walks into a bar and places his order. “I’ll take a whisky on the rocks, but don’t serve my kids.”

Meh

&gt;The bartender walks into a doctor’s office and says “same punch line, different context.” …

This would work better if it came immediately after the first one. 

&gt;Two nuns walk into a bar. The first is elderly, and seems to be fully devout. The other is young, blonde, and appears to be new to the convent. “Bartender,” says the elderly nun, “I was wondering if you could settle a little dispute for us. You see, my trainee believes that true holiness can be achieved in a matter of days, rather than with the years on end that I’ve been practicing. One year out of catholic school, and she thinks that she is as holy as me!” “I’ll tell you what,” replies the bartender, “both of your write down your arguments, and I’ll decide who among you is most holy.” The sisters begin to write their cases. The elder nun finishes first, and slides her paper toward the bartender. At this point, the blonde sister has pulled out a calculator, and starts to plug away at the buttons. The bartender reads the first paper aloud. “‘Everyday, for the last 40 years, I’ve woken at dawn for morning prayer. I prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire convent, while using any spare hours for reading the texts and scripture. In case that isn’t holy enough, I volunteer on the weekends.’ Good gracious, sister!” Says the bartender, “this is quite exemplary.” By now, the young nun has finished and has passed her paper to the bartender. “All this says is πr2, r=2… Hold on, is this an equation for the area of a circle?!” exclaims the bartender. “Oh, sorry,” says the blonde, blushing. “It was supposed to be circumference.”

So, the it's supposed to be a ""hole?""

&gt;A bartender has been going through a financial rough patch, and hoped that his wife would accommodate for the tough times by letting him try anal. Now, the wife resents her husband, and was appalled by his audacity to ask for such a thing with their marriage on the fritz. She denies his request. Later in the week, a man walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a prostitute. The bartender is about to send the man on his way, when he gets an idea that would make him some money while simultaneously punishing his wife. “You see that woman in the corner?” He asks, “Well, she’s one of the best girls we got. You go over to her and take her into the private room. You can do whatever you want with her, no matter how much she resists. It’s all part of the act. After you’re through, come back here and pay full price, $2000.” The man nods his head excitedly in agreement and walks toward the wife. The bartender watches from afar as the two exchange a few quick words. All of a sudden, he sees the man grab his wife by the arm and pull her into the private room. The bartender smiles inwardly to himself and thinks “Ha! That’ll teach the bitch to appreciate me. Plus, I’m making a small fortune!” After about twenty minutes, the wife comes out, alone. She heads over to the bartender with a slight limp. “Where’s your new friend?” asks the bartender, smiling. “He owes me a little money.” The wife snickers, pulls her husband in close and whispers in his ear “I let him use the back door,” and walks away. 

Yup, the only thing funnier than a rape joke is an anal rape joke, especially when there's prostituion involved.

rishtastic,"&gt;A farmer ordered a high-tech milking machine.

&gt;It happened that the equipment arrived when his wife was away, so he decided to test it on himself first. He inserted his penis into the equipment, turned the switch on and voila, everything else was automatic ! !

&gt;He really had a good time because the equipment provided him with as much pleasure as his wife did. When the fun was over, he found that he could not take the instrument off.

&gt;He read the manual but did not find any useful information. He tried every button on the instrument. Some made the equipment squeeze, shake, or suck harder or softer, but still without success.

&gt;Panicking, he called the supplier ' s Customer Service Hot Line.

&gt;""Hello, I just bought a milking machine from your company. It's fantastic. But how can I take it off the cow's udder?""

&gt;Customer Service replied, ""Don't worry. The machine was programmed to release automatically after collecting about two gallons of milk. ""

rishtastic,"&gt;It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have had a really bad day the day you died.

&gt;So the next day the first person came to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate promptly asked the man to tell him about the day he died.

&gt;""Well, for some time now, I thought my wife was having an affair and that each day on her lunch hour she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex with him. So today I was going to come home too, and catch them. Well, I got there and busted in, and immediately began searching for this guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just when I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips ! The nerve of that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But, wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die. This got me even more enraged so I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him, which turned out to be the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him !

&gt;The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.""

&gt;The angel sat back and thought for a moment.

&gt;Technically, the guy DID have a bad day. So he announced, ""OK, sir, welcome to the kingdom of heaven,"" and let him in. A few seconds later the next guy came up. ""OK, here's the rule. Before I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died.""

&gt;""Sure thing,"" the next man replied. ""But you're not going to believe this. I was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily I was able to catch myself by my fingertips on the balcony directly beneath mine, when, all of a sudden, this crazy man came running out of his apartment and started cussing and stomping on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I lay there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating pain, I saw the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the ledge and it fell directly on top of me and killed me ! ""

&gt;The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ""Very well, "" he announces. ""Welcome to the kingdom of heaven, "" and lets the man enter.

&gt;A few seconds later a third man comes up to the gate. ""Tell me about the day you died,"" says the angel.
""OK, picture this,"" says the man. ""I'm naked inside a refrigerator. . . """,null,8,cdh9yoh,1qwp4n,jokes,new,3

Someone should make a collection of the songs at the end. The guy's donk being out is common, as are his balls. I've often heard something about him defecating on the stage as well. My favorite was one I heard in Philadelphia, ""Do you know your monkey keeps dipping his balls in my whiskey?""

I went to college at a smallish Indian city. You probably have heard about Indian police being corrupt and bribery being rampant in India. Well this place was no different. If you get caught riding a motorcycle without licence, or helmet etc, you'd be fined 300 bucks which probably went to cop's pocket. So, a guy from my college gets caught, and when asked for 300 bucks he instead asked to taken to the police-station. Now since the cop didn't want the hassle of taking him down to the station and doing the necessary paperworks they started bargaining. That's when a police van arrived with some senior officers. They asked  what was happening, and this guy told them, the rate is 300 but this cop asked 600 from me. The cops started arguing among themselves and let him go.",null,8,cdg6equ,1qspiw,jokes,new,33

He has no money for a ticket, so he finds a gap in the fence, and climbs up a little bit, so he can just barely see the game.

""Even when I couldn't afford a ticket for the baseball game, they welcomed me with open arms!"" he tells his wife.

A regular sees him and says ""Hey guy, you doing alright?""

""I'm doing terrible"" the guys says ""I'm having money troubles and the only option I got left is to sell my beloved dog. So, I'm just traveling around town asking if anyone wants to buy him off me. He's in the car now.""

""I'm sorry to hear that"" says the regular, ""what are you asking for him?""

""500 dollars"" the man says.

""Whoa that's a lot of money for a dog"" the regular says

""Well, it's like that dog is a part of my family. He's the gentlest, sweetest dog you've ever seen. He never barks, unless there is an intruder, in which case he turns into the meanest SOB that ever lived. When he needs to go, he'll just nudge your leg once or twice and then sit by the door and wait till you're ready to let him out. My kids and wife love him, and are going to hate me for selling him, but I don't have any other options.""

The regular says ""well jeez, guy. If the dog is that good, I'll take him. I'd be happy to help you out""

A year later the man walks into the bar again.

This time the regular is there again, but he screams ""YOU! YOU SOLD ME THAT GOOD FOR NOTHIN' SON OF A BITCHIN' DOG. That dog does nothing but shit all over the house. He barks constantly, and tries to bite my wife and kids every chance he gets. I swear to god the day I bought that dog was the last good day I've had""

A man walks into a bar with a small dog under his arm and sits down at the counter, placing the dog on the stool next to him. 

The bartender says, ""Sorry, pal. No dogs allowed.""


The man says, ""But this is a special dog -- he talks!""


""Yeah, right,"" says the bartender. ""Now get out of here before I throw you out.""


""No, wait,"" says the man. ""I'll prove it."" He turns to the dog and asks, ""What do you normally find on top of a house?""


""Roof!"" says the dog, wagging his tail.


""Listen, pal..."" says the bartender.
""Wait,"" says the man, ""I'll ask another question."" He turns to the dog again and asks, ""What's the opposite of soft?""


""Ruff!"" exclaims the dog.


""Quit wasting my time and get out of here,"" says the bartender.


""One more chance,"" pleads the man. Turning to the dog again, he asks, ""Who was the greatest baseball player that ever lived?""


""Ruth!"" barked the dog.


""Okay, that's it!"" says the bartender, and physically throws both man and dog out the door and onto the street.


Turning to the man, the dogs shrugs and says, ""Maybe I should have said Joe Dimaggio?""

So this zebra walks into an icecream bar, upset that his zebra girlfriend just broke up with him. He ask the bartender for an extra large sundae and then eats all of it in 5 minutes. Then the zebra demands another extra large sundae and does the same thing. When he goes to ask for another one the bartender tells him,  
""You'd better slow down or you're going to get a tummy ache!""
The zebra responds, ""Don't you tell me what to do. I just lost the love of my life. Bring me another sundae!"" 

And so the bartender goes and gets him a third sundae. After the zebra finishes his third sundae he starts to feel really sick. So he goes and lies down in the corner of the bar.

So, the nuns line up before the Gates of Heaven, awaiting their turn to get in. Each must speak with St Peter before they are admitted.

The first nun approaches St Peter and he asks if she has anything to confess. The nun says, sheepishly, ""when I was a young girl, I accidentally brushed my finger up against a man's crotch.""

St Peter replies, ""You are forgiven, dip the finger into this holy water and proceed into Heaven.""

The next nun approaches, and after she is asked the same question, she replies, ""St Peter, I am ashamed, but one time I did give a man a handjob."" After dipping her hand in the holy water, St Peter ushers her through the gates.

All of the sudden, there is a commotion in the line as a nun is pushing through to the front.

St Peter inquires, ""Sister, please calm down, what is so urgent?""

And the nun blurts out, ""I've got to gargle some of this holy water before Sister Mary comes and sticks her ass in it!""",null,4,cddiq01,1qjhcg,jokes,new,15

Sigismund__Freud,"In this joke, the horse or stallion straying from its owner represents an unbridled male sexual energy.  Repeated references to bars and the horses long ""face"", or head -- its identifying feature -- reinforce the phallic nature of the initial sequence.  The ""handler"" is eventually able to subdue the ""horse"" in the way a hand might subdue the male organ, but not before it spills its fluid and those of several other men.  The outwardly homoerotic nature of this public display is shamed by society, causing the horse to be cast out while the ""bar-tender"" (which we understand to be a closeted homosexual himself) attempts to sanitize his establishment and therefor his public image.

Forgiveness and understanding arrives in the form of jesus christ but, as the bar-tender has closed his door for the time being, he strays from his intended visit, encountering the receptionist.  This, as we know, is a traditionally female role.  Christ, being the illusory father figure and as such needing to retire, offers his metaphorical son the instrument of his destruction in exchange for a modicum of hospitality.  The receptionist, not recognizing the words of the lord but seeing the nails as miniature phallic symbols (given their shape and their ability to be used for both creative and destructive purposes), is further emasculated.  He expresses his desires meekly and without a voice of his own.  Christ, unable to make his message known, departs.

A duck, which is understood in many cultures to be a symbol of fidelity and sexual intimacy, has been questioning for some time whether the receptionist has any grapes -- an obvious reference to that part of the male anatomy in which seed is stored.  Today however, perhaps after witnessing the horse's literal outburst, he inquires after the size of the man's organ.  Ashamed and infuriated, he leaves for the place where he knows another man with similar self-doubts to be.  Unable to enter through the front,  he discovers and forces his way (albeit with some difficulty) into an ""alternative entrance.""  

Two other father figures, this time considerably less illusory and who presumably speak the language of these other gentlemen witness this impromptu sodomy and attempt to correct the situation, but in their eagerness follow the receptionist into the same shame.  The bartender who, in his attempt to remain clean in the eyes of society has found himself involuntarily penetrated by not one but three figures puts aside his chore so that he may wonder aloud at the supreme absurdity of the human condition.",null,3,cdde7ei,1qhuze,jokes,new,5

Oh_Skeet," A man boarded an airplane and took his seat. As he settled in, he glanced 
up and saw the most beautiful woman boarding the plane. He soon realized 
she was heading straight towards his seat. As fate would have it, she took 
the seat right beside his. 
 Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, ""Business trip or pleasure?"" 

She turned, smiled, and said, ""Business. I'm going to the Annual 
Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston."" 

 He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs. 

 Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your 
business role at this convention?"" 
 
""Lecturer,"" she responded. ""I use information that I have learned from my 
personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality."" 

 ""Really?"" he said. ""And what kind of myths are there?"" 

 ""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that African-American men are 
the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American 
Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is 
that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish descent 
who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the 
best stamina is the Southern Redneck.""
Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. ""I'm sorry,"" 
she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don't 
even know your name.""

He remembers the looks on the boy's faces when they walked into that village and... oh Jesus. He shouldn't think about that now. Sometimes he still hears Tex's slow southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes. He always had a pack of Luckys. But the boys are gone now... he knows that. It's--it's just that he forgets sometimes. And sometimes the way that seven looks at him... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. And he feels like he's back there... In the jungle... In the darkness.

MagicPaul,"Why do they have to jump? What does their death contribute to the joke? Are you not getting this joke confused with: 

&gt; An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman were sitting on top of a roof at a construction site. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is lunch time and the Englishman opens his lunch and sees that his wife has packed him a roast beef sandwich for lunch. He says ""I bloody well hate roast beef. Every day it's bloody roast beef. If I get this tomorrow for lunch I will jump off this bloody roof and kill myself"".
&gt; 
&gt; The Scotsman opens his lunch and sees that his wife had packed him some haggis.
&gt; He says ""I hate haggis. A dinnae ken what tae dae. If I get this for lunch the 'morra I'll jump off this roof and kill myself"".
&gt; 
&gt; The Irishman opens his lunch and sees that inside are some potatoes. He says ""Feck me, more feckin' potatoes. If I get one more feckin' potato I will jump off this feckin' roof and kill meself""
&gt; 
&gt; The next day they are at lunch on top of the roof again. The Englishman opens his lunch and sees that his wife had packed him the roast beef again. He gets mad and jumps off the roof and kills himself.
&gt; 
&gt; The Scotsman opens his lunch and sees that his wife had packed him haggis again. He gets upset and jumps off the roof and kills himself.
&gt; 
&gt; The Irishman opens his lunch and sees that he has potatoes again. He too gets mad and jumps off the roof and kills himself.
&gt; 
&gt; After a while the press, police and their wives arrive.
&gt; 
&gt; The Englishman's wife says ""If he only would have bloody well told me, I would have changed his lunch for him.""
&gt; 
&gt; The Scotsman's wife says ""Auch aye, if he would have only told me, I would have changed his lunch for him.""
&gt; 
&gt; The Irishman's wife then says ""I don't know why he killed himself, he makes his own feckin' lunch.""",null,1,cd8se20,1q3e4y,jokes,new,17
