She's made it pretty clear that she doesn't have romantic feelings for me. And I've made it clear that either way, I still consider her a friend. She feels really bad and says she's sorry for leading me on and wasting my time.

I told her that's just silly and that I've never considered even a second of the time we've spent together a 'waste'. Of course I'm sad that my feelings aren't reciprocated, but that's life and I'll move on with it. And at least I'll have one good friend along the way :)

mcj2,"10 months ago I was in the opposite position (almost exactly; I have been friends with this girl for more than 10 years, I started dating someone, she confessed her love... except we were never physical).  

I can't speak for your girl obviously, but from my perspective this is what I thought about the situation:

I appreciated how difficult it was for her to admit that to me, knowing that it likely wouldn't change anything (at the time, I had been dating the ""new"" girl for about a month).  I understood the desire to put it all out there, and if I were in her position I likely would have done something similar.

However, in my case this girl had about a year that she could have come to me with her feelings (while I was single).  It wouldn't have changed my feelings since to me our relationship is strictly platonic, but it would have been a little more respectful of MY feelings.

She said she needed space when I let her down as gently but clearly as possible, and I obliged.  For awhile, we didn't speak.  A few months later she reached out and we began texting/g-chatting (small talk, mostly) infrequently.  Now our relationship is as close as it likely ever will be to ""how it used to be"".  In fact, I hung out with her and another friend last night (without my gf present) and it felt very comfortable for us both.

Ultimately, I am glad she told me her feelings since I know how much strong (quiet) feelings can eat away at a person.  I do wish she had come to me before I was in another relationship, but I have no ill feelings towards her for it. 

TL:DR, friend confessed love to me, it was awkward for awhile, but comfortable friendship was not ruined.  IMO, you didn't fuck up but you should have said something before you found out she was seeing someone else.

Not only does she deserve space after this bombshell, so do you. The more you hang around her the more difficult it will be to get over those feelings. The sooner you can move on romantically in your life, the sooner your relationship with her will return to normal.",null,1,cdnjgmg,1rhz0q,tifu,top_day,5
Iron__mind,"The way I see it is you've got the awkward part out of the way, now you've got to try and relax a bit (I am fully aware that will be virtually impossible) and concentrate on not making things more awkward.

Give her a bit of space to get her head round it, keep yourself busy (you can be pretty productive when you're trying to avoid something) and when she's ready to talk try to act like you didn't say it. Don't deny it but just try to be friends like you were before, show her that this is not the end of you being friends and hopefully she will feel at ease.

When it does come up (pretty sure she'll want to talk about it eventually), apologise for blurting it out like that and for putting her under pressure especially as she'd just told you about some other guy. Tell her how hard it was to tell her because you don't want to ruin your friendship, explain how you've recently realised your feelings for her are not purely platonic anymore and ask her how she feels about it.

When you've heard her thoughts, ask her what you can do to not lose her, ask yourself this while you're at it. Try your hardest not to be selfish here, you're gonna get emotional and want to know how you can be more than friends but you need to do everything in your power to ensure you're not going to be less than friends.

sellyberry,"I live almost right next to a grocery store. The way home for me involves one big intersection, with three lanes, a right turn only, a going straight, and the left lane can also go straight. I use the left lane to go straight because that's the lane I need to be in in less than a block, but sometimes people in the middle lane drive into the left lane before they get to the other side of the intersection, with no regards for me (in my shitty minivan, it's not like I'm hard to see) and my right of way.

So I was driving home and some jack off pulls that shit with me and now I'm following him home... Because he lives in the same condos as me. He noticed and started to go slower and when he stopped he almost jumped out of his car, ready to fight his stalker...

GottaGetToIt,"So here's the what you should have done comment... Look at the back of the toilet. Most toilets have a faucet looking thing back there. Turn it righty tighty and the flow to the toilet will stop. 

Have you fixed the bathroom yet? If not:

1. Clear area around toilet of baskets and such

2. Find plunger and plunge toilet. You tube it if you don't know how

3. Flush excess water and toilet paper once the clog is gone (you'll hear it go down). ( If you turned the water off, here's where you turn it back on. Be ready to turn back off in case it didn't work. ) 

4. Dry everything up with paper towels. If you must use regular towels, try to find dark/old ones

5. Wipe everything down with a disinfectant which you can probably find under bathroom or kitchen sink

(note : you can actually plunge a sink with a sink plunger if they have one of those.) ",null,0,cdn36ip,1rgp34,tifu,top_day,6
