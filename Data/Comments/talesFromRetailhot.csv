null,"I fucking hate ICEE's now. The machines break constantly, they always expand and overflow when you fill them up, kids throw fits about not having magical-mango-cherry-lime-or-whatever flavor they want, and parents throw fits about kids getting the syrup on their clothes. And every fucking kid wants the biggest one you have, so every time you get a family you have to worry about if machine is even going to work well enough to make the damn things, then you have to deal with the parents getting upset over it being too big for their kids and then bitching about the cost and then screaming when it's not filled up all the way to the top/expanding slightly. The worst were the parents who would pick the cup up and SQUEEZE it until about half the ICEE was on my counter, and then I would have to deal with the next twenty customers throwing a fit because my counter was slightly sticky.

Actual conversation I had with a bar patron that was pounding on the bar and yelling at me ""Let's GOOOOoooo!"" after he ordered a shot, accidentally dropped and broke it before drinking it, and was demanding a new one:

""Sir, you're going to have to leave.  You're an asshole.""  
""I pay my money just like everyone else.  You have to serve me.""  
""I don't have to serve the President.  I can tell him to go fuck himself just like I am telling you right now.""

""I'm going to tell everyone I know never to come in here!""  
""Good deal.  Anyone that hangs out with you probably acts like you anyway.""

After six months I became a shift manager, and made the same discovery you did: It is more work for less pay when compared to delivery driving. As an 18-year old with six months experience as a driver and no managerial experience, I was a pretty horrible manager. One time the stress of it got to me so much, I just laid down on the floor, right in the middle of the other employees.

I don't want him to see me or my family as an endless money tree.  Plus, like the parents here, he has to learn the value of a dollar.

He once was throwing his 3DS up in the air, I told him to stop, but he did it one more time, and it broke in half.  He was on punishment, and I told him he was saving up his allowance until he was able to buy another 3DS, but he wouldn't be able to buy it for himself, he is going to buy it and give it to a needy child-so he will see just how long it takes to buy an item.  He actually did it, and has just enough money to do it now.  Now I am trying to find a family that wants one (I will probably save it until around Christmas time and keep an ear out for a family that can't get a kid a gift).

It is totally legal for your boss to walk up to you right now and tell you to clock out and go home and don't come back because you are being fired. No reason has to be given. They get like a week to send you your final paycheck even. And so long as it wasn't cause you are black, female and wouldn't blow the boss or such, it's legit.

Now the reason that they generally don't just dismiss folks without some kind of cause is unemployment. If they can't prove they dismissed you for a reason like stealing or being constantly late, then they can't deny paying you. 

Often a reason why they want to get rid of someone that isn't a true issue is money. They are trying to reduce high paid folks to keep the budget in control to get their bonuses. But if any staff is getting unemployment that is a hit against that. So they look for a reason they can out to the state that they fired you with cause to try to deny.

From my own experience, I think it would be good if your crew could get together after your store closes so that everyone who wants to participate can- having anything during work hours is just asking to hurt someone's feelings. Pick a place close to the location so you know everyone can get there without any problems, and just let anyone talk about what they need to talk about. Then move on.

mbarber1,"Ya know, the last customer i just let think they were right? Was half way arguing with me about the asparagus that we had on sale for $1.99 was for each bunch, not $1.99 a pound. She was all, ""yeah you guys normally have it for $1.99 each, but since the price is close to what I'm supposed to pay I'll go ahead and get it."" I'm just thinking to myself *don't smartass don't smartass* and go ""ookay"", give a smile and let her finish paying so she could leave. I was sooo tempted to go, ""Oh really? You must've been shopping somewhere else then because we've had it by the pound for at least four years since i started working here...""",null,0,cczteq2,1p7pf7,talesFromRetail,hot,5
homsikpanda,"it might take a bit longer and waste more time, but in the long wrong it saves time, energy, and you get to see that fun little realization in their eyes when they finally realize they're an idiot if you just nod, smile and agree with the customer :)

i do this all the time in tech support.... it's 1000x easier and quicker to just let the customer go and try all the steps they think will fix the issue until they exhaust al other options but to listen to you and do the steps you're giving them. it also makes for a nice coffee break.",null,0,cd1hi8z,1p7pf7,talesFromRetail,hot,3

Surrounded_by_cats,"It's a terrible attitude that I see all too often among the chronically unemployed that I am friends with on facebook, for some reason. They don't seem to see that THEY are the reason they don't have a job. They don't feel as if they have to work hard or put any sort of effort forth towards achieving gainful employment. Whenever the slightest obstacle rears it's ugly head (and they will) they throw their hands in the air and give up, blaming everyone else.

To clarify, I'm not saying unemployed people are lazy. I'm saying that from my experience, the chronically unemployed tend to have a bad attitude and don't handle themselves ins professional manner.",null,7,cczqumi,1p81at,talesFromRetail,hot,21
BadgerSixTwo,"In my opinion, there's really no good way. You can have the best intentions but they deal with the ""free lunch"" people so often, they tune everyone out. When I worked in fast food, I would occasionally get those like you who just wanted to give constructive criticism and the best one I heard went something like, ""I enjoyed my meal but I wanted to let you know about [whatever the problem was]. I just thought I'd let you know.

I guess what I mean is, state your intention immediately that you're not asking for replacement food/refund but you wanted to bring the issue to their attention.",null,2,cczq49b,1p879v,talesFromRetail,hot,22

Techsupportvictim,"Be nice, be calm. You ordered a sandwich with no sauces, paid for your food with an understanding that was the condition you would get your food in. You are entitled to getting what you asked and paid for. Think implied contract via your receipt which likely shows the state you ordered.

Any manager will happily replace the sandwich. Even for just a swipe. And as you say it could be an allergy thing for the next person. That chicken that rubbed up on the burger could have been cooked in peanut oil. Some folks are so allergic that just the tiny bit is enough to call 911. Or what if someone was strict kosher and tossed a fit cause some bacon from one sandwich rubbed up on his pork free burger. You are nothing compared to those situations.
