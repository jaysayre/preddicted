null,"I fucking hate ICEE's now. The machines break constantly, they always expand and overflow when you fill them up, kids throw fits about not having magical-mango-cherry-lime-or-whatever flavor they want, and parents throw fits about kids getting the syrup on their clothes. And every fucking kid wants the biggest one you have, so every time you get a family you have to worry about if machine is even going to work well enough to make the damn things, then you have to deal with the parents getting upset over it being too big for their kids and then bitching about the cost and then screaming when it's not filled up all the way to the top/expanding slightly. The worst were the parents who would pick the cup up and SQUEEZE it until about half the ICEE was on my counter, and then I would have to deal with the next twenty customers throwing a fit because my counter was slightly sticky.

Actual conversation I had with a bar patron that was pounding on the bar and yelling at me ""Let's GOOOOoooo!"" after he ordered a shot, accidentally dropped and broke it before drinking it, and was demanding a new one:

""Sir, you're going to have to leave.  You're an asshole.""  
""I pay my money just like everyone else.  You have to serve me.""  
""I don't have to serve the President.  I can tell him to go fuck himself just like I am telling you right now.""

""I'm going to tell everyone I know never to come in here!""  
""Good deal.  Anyone that hangs out with you probably acts like you anyway.""

After six months I became a shift manager, and made the same discovery you did: It is more work for less pay when compared to delivery driving. As an 18-year old with six months experience as a driver and no managerial experience, I was a pretty horrible manager. One time the stress of it got to me so much, I just laid down on the floor, right in the middle of the other employees.

I don't want him to see me or my family as an endless money tree.  Plus, like the parents here, he has to learn the value of a dollar.

He once was throwing his 3DS up in the air, I told him to stop, but he did it one more time, and it broke in half.  He was on punishment, and I told him he was saving up his allowance until he was able to buy another 3DS, but he wouldn't be able to buy it for himself, he is going to buy it and give it to a needy child-so he will see just how long it takes to buy an item.  He actually did it, and has just enough money to do it now.  Now I am trying to find a family that wants one (I will probably save it until around Christmas time and keep an ear out for a family that can't get a kid a gift).

It is totally legal for your boss to walk up to you right now and tell you to clock out and go home and don't come back because you are being fired. No reason has to be given. They get like a week to send you your final paycheck even. And so long as it wasn't cause you are black, female and wouldn't blow the boss or such, it's legit.

Now the reason that they generally don't just dismiss folks without some kind of cause is unemployment. If they can't prove they dismissed you for a reason like stealing or being constantly late, then they can't deny paying you. 

Often a reason why they want to get rid of someone that isn't a true issue is money. They are trying to reduce high paid folks to keep the budget in control to get their bonuses. But if any staff is getting unemployment that is a hit against that. So they look for a reason they can out to the state that they fired you with cause to try to deny.

From my own experience, I think it would be good if your crew could get together after your store closes so that everyone who wants to participate can- having anything during work hours is just asking to hurt someone's feelings. Pick a place close to the location so you know everyone can get there without any problems, and just let anyone talk about what they need to talk about. Then move on.

I worked self checkout at a grocery store for a while.

Most of the time she came through, all of my machines were busy do I didn't have time to keep an eye on her. 

One day I was finally able to monitor her entire checkout process. I noticed she had bags of various meats and cheeses from the deli (making them around $7.99/lb). She placed an individual bag at a time on the scale, making sure to not scan the barcode, and rung these bags up as bananas ($0.49/lb). I then saw she had one actual bunch of bananas.

Once she completed her transaction I walked up to her and said, ""I'm sorry ma'am but my computer here says you bought six bunches of bananas but I only see one in your bag. May I take a closer look?"" She started getting antsy and tried to leave the store so I ended up grabbing her cart handle and saying, ""I'm sorry ma'am but I am going to need you to wait to talk to my manager.""

This whole time she is trying to leave and I have a vise grip on her cart. One of the front end managers called our security guy to the front and took over from there.

Well, my trainee was counting down her drawer so I was near the front desk and the customer service person was dealing with someone so whenever this dude came up to the desk I walked up and started a conversation with him, intending on checking him out. B was on her register when she saw me, TURNED OFF HER LIGHT at her register while they were busy (that's a no-no), walked up to me behind the desk and was like ""You can go now.""

I know how to do it! You're just wasting time! It made me kind of happy cause the customer just looked at me like WTF? and I shrugged. And she was a cunt to him while checking him out too!

NooksIBF,"There's one coworker who gets completely on my nerves, above everyone else. For the purpose of these stories, she's B. My store is a conversion from a former supermarket chain in one of the worst areas of the country, and she's been lucky enough to work there forever. This job is the pinacle of her life, and she's probably late 50s now. I joined when the store converted over to its current company, and we both work on the checkouts as keyholders. She's in first-thing most mornings, so her role includes putting out the papers and magazines that come in each day, as well as doing anything in the cash office that's required. 

When I first stepped up as a keyholder, she regularly gave me grief about putting money in the cash bags in the correct way, or just generally bitching at me for no reason, but this died down thankfully. Then we come to a few weeks back. As I work once a week on a Friday on a late shift (late for us is till 11), I have to put the papers away and into a cabinet in the back at night, usually before 8pm. When putting said papers out, I found two full boxes of magazines still to be put out that she'd left, so being the nice person, I put them out and ask her about it, and her response is ""They don't usually deliver them on a Friday - it won't happen again"". As you might have guessed, two weeks later, it happened again. I decided to leave her a note in the cash office to ask why, and her response was possibly the funniest thing I've seen in work - ""I actually met the delivery driver yesterday, so there can't have been magazines there"" - **HOW DID I FIND TWO BOXES THEN?!?!**

A few days after that, she rung me up to tell me one of my colleagues wouldn't be in that day, and they intended to change my shift - I actually wrote this down word-for-word, it was so laughable:

Voicemail - ""Hiya Nooks, it's B from work. We've had to change your 3-8 today to a 3-11 today cause M's phoned in sick. Could you ring back and tell us if that's OK?""

I actually received that voicemail with about 3 hours notice before starting my shift, so rung back to explain that actually, no, I'm doing an 11 two days later and will not be doing two in one week under any circumstances - I'd very likely be stabbed or worse. Her response? ""What are you doing that is so important that you have to go home at 8?"". Ugh. Took all my willpower not to swear at her for bothering me when I'd just woken up. What's even better is that it was the second voicemail I'd got off her that week, and the one a few days before was only slightly less irritating.

I finished counting cash and when I went to check on his cleaning, found him sitting at our boss's desk with his feet up... Hadn't even started cleaning. 

When my boss found out about the desk thing, he told the guy that he wasn't allowed in the stockroom or to sit at any desk. So for the rest of his shift (only 3 hours) he was to stand on the sales floor. Basically every 5-10 minutes I had to go find him and send him back onto the sales floor or ask him not to sit on the actual floor of the sales floor. 

Honestly one of the worst, laziest people I've ever met.  ",null,1,cd0rsht,1pabwq,talesFromRetail,hot,4

The *next day* he comes in wearing sweatpants. I wait and see if he was going to change, but nope, he just starts working. So I call him out on it, and he says ""oh, my work pants are upstairs..I'll go change.""

Like literally a week into his job he was seeing how many boundaries he could push.

mepmepmep,"Ok, here's another one about a different coworker that thankfully doesn't work with me anymore! I work as a cashier at a grocery store that also qualifies as a specialty liquor store. Because of this, every cashier has to go through a 3 hour class and take a test in order to get a bar card (allows you to sell liquor). We all get 45 days after our day of hire to accomplish this and if we don't have one at the end of that period we're supposed to get fired. My store used to be a little more lenient about this rule but have since gotten stricter because of this coworker. Ok, I had been working there about 6 months at this point and had my bar card. My younger, kind of ditzy coworker, S, had been working there almost a year and still always asked me questions about how to do things, what to do in certain situations, etc. I didn't mind, I'm always happy to help others and I had learned my shit pretty early and easily so honestly it made me feel good that someone with more tenure was asking me how to do something. Well, on this particular Sunday morning I was working with S and she called me over after a customer asked her a question, no big deal.

S: Hey mepmepmep, ummm....this lady wants to know if we're allowed to selling alcohol right now? *S looking stupid like WTF stupid customer*

Me: *eyes buldging out of skull* Um, yes ma'am our city doesn't follow the usual rule of no alcohol before 11 on Sundays. 

Customer: Ok, thank you! *walks away gleefully to get her drink on*

Me: WTF S, you didn't know that? What if she was an undercover alcohol and tobacco person?! This store could have gotten fined for their employees not knowing their shit! 
Didn't you learn that in your bar card class?!

S: Ummmm... I never took my bar card class.....

Me: ARE YOU KIDDING?! Do you know what kind of trouble you can get into for selling alcohol and tobacco without a bar card? You can get fined and go to court and get arrested and the store will have to pay fines and shit as well!

S: OMG, I didn't know blahblahblahblah...

I think I scared her cause she got her bar card like the next week but damn. She didn't realize the shit she could cause by just being lazy and not wanting to go to the boring class. 

Even better. A couple minutes later a cop came up with a thing of beer and she was like ""Hey mepmepmep I need to ask a question in your ear!"" I turned around, saw what she was gesturing to and nodded my head. THE STUPID.",null,2,cd0wd1n,1pabwq,talesFromRetail,hot,3

When i worked at EDL, we had a lazy there was this cashier/layway back up who was plain lazy and none too bright. He always had this dull look on his face as though not everything was clicking right. He did everything half-assed and didn't ask for help, if something went wrong he just sat there till someone came over. 

Then we had another guy, ""M"", he was lazy but really charismatic, a good salesmen, but, he was trouble. M was loved by all the customers, he knew about what we were selling, and he knew it well, but, he did it half-assed. M was super lazy, and habitually late. M also liked to flirt with the female employees, and by flirt I mean his flirting was kinda off-putting and very unprofessional because he wouldn't take a hint and stop.

One day on one our busiest days he calls in that he's going to be an hour or two late. We had 1 new guy who wasn't register trained and me and a super busy store. M comes in 3 hours late, 3! He gets called into HR and fired immediately..along with a whole lotta other things. 

But, M still hangs around, he frequents the store and causes trouble by flirting with the employees. One day we get a new employee, a young girl that catches his fancy. M comes in and makes his moves, he won't stop flirting with her. That flirting turns into sexual harassment, and stalking. He calls back everyday, and comes in just asking to see her.

She then tells me she's ""positive"" i never signed up for a pedicure, just a manicure, and I, of course, insisted I had ordered both. So after a great deal of huffing and puffing on her part, she finally figured out I had indeed asked for both. Then she got upset after it took me over a minute to choose my nailpolish. 

I would have chalked it up to one bad apple, had I not encountered similar attitudes in both local and farther away salons... everyone BUT the person doing the nails seems to love working with people. (it's not just me either- sometimes i go for a haircut and see these nail technicians really giving clients a hard time over nothing). ",null,0,cd7n8wv,1pb2qs,talesFromRetail,hot,1

My coworker that night was a real toughie (she was one of those old wider-than-she-is-tall New England chicks).  I was stacking boxes of ice melt when a guy comes in and buys a gallon of milk.  He leaves, proceeds to dump the milk out (I didn't know this at the time) fills it with gas at the pump and comes back in with a rag, the milk gallon now full of gas and a lighter.  He goes to my coworker and says give me all your money.  

She stares at him blankly as I hid behind the cigarettes display.  He says it again and adds he'll blow this place up.  She bursts out with one loud laugh and asks him how he is going to carry the money if his hands are full.  He looks back at her for what felt like minutes and turns around to leave.

DinosaurBrutus,"I had a similar (maybe not so similar), though not retail related experience a while back. I live in a generally very safe part of the GTA, so robberies are quite infrequent in the area.

I was walking home rather late one night (1 or 2 in the morning), and as I was passing through a relatively poorly lit part of a jogging trail, I was accosted by some random guy about my size, wearing a baggy hoodie and carrying a small pocket knife. He made a show of appearing tough and aggressive, and asked me in as gruff a voice as he could manage for all my money. I rarely carry cash on my person, and even if I had any on me, there was little chance I was going to hand any over.

For some reason, I didn't feel particularly afraid of this individual, probably because his whole tough guy facade was being poorly executed. I could probably have run away with relative ease, but no, I decided to do something decisively more idiotic. At this point in time, I still carried a knife on me most of the time and that night was no different. So I made a move as if to grab a wallet from my bag and instead pulled out my Ka-bar. Upon seeing what I at that time liked to describe as 12 inches of angry steel (make no mistake, those knives are no joke, but the corniness of that description still haunts me to this day), the prospective mugger appeared to go from aggressive to reluctant very quickly and backed off a little. I think I made some sort of dumb comment about measuring, and walked past him with a wide berth with the knife still out, and only pout it away once I left the jogging path

In retrospect, what I did there was completely moronic, because I could very well have gotten stabbed or hurt somehow if the mugger was a little more dedicated or unstable. However, I will always remember that night as the time I scared off a mugger because, well, mine was bigger than his.

TL;DR Mine's bigger than yours.",null,10,cd0tbam,1pb94v,talesFromRetail,hot,33

NoClueHere,"This just happened this past Monday. 

Background: I was hosting my friend from England for a few days so I took some time off.  I went back to work on Monday.  His flight left Monday morning after I have left for work.  So I'm talking to my friend on the phone while he is waiting on his taxi and I'm on my way to work.

Story:

So I get to work at a really early time because I'm gonna make some delicious doughnuts and I love this shift. Start all my prep work and get ready for the day. (Which usually included me using my phone for music since I was the only one there until our manager arrived). But this Monday morning I was not, I was texting my friend while he waited for their flight. 

(This part might be a little boring,  but its my routine.)

Well I finally got all my prep done. Its now about 45 mins into my shift. I start making my doughnuts and get the icings ready. Get the doughnuts all iced and trayed up and out in the case.

I now start to get the next set of doughts ready,  about an hour and a half into my shift, when I hear this thump.

I turn and look out to see what fell. Saw nothing. Heard another thump and the sound of shattering glass next. (Remember,  I'm still the only person in the store at this time).

I look out into the lobby towards the front door and see that our front door has been shattered.  I didn't think at all. I just acted and what I do next was the talk of the store for a few days.

I grabbed the cordless phone and was dialing 911 while I ran to our freezer.

I didn't care if the robber got in the store or not. I was more afraid of my life.

After the cops arrived I ventured out of the freezer and stepped outside to have a cigarette and to talk with the officer. I have called my boss by time.

once i had an old woman call the cops on me for ""stealing"" money off her credit card. i explained to this woman over and over how debit/credit gas prepays work:

* prepay pump 6 for $20

* a $20 hold is placed on your account and the pump is ""pre-authorized"" for up to $20

* you pump your gas, and any amount up or including $20.00 is charged your card once you hang up the nozzle.

apparently this woman came into the store, prepaid, and then whipped out her phone to check her banking app **before she had even walked back to her car yet**.

we went round and round and despite myself, her husband, and another customer trying to get through this lady's thin candy shell of ignorance, she just refused to listen.

her: just give me my money back!

me: ma'am, i don't *have* your money to give back to you.

her: you stupid little liar! it shows right here!

me: yes, ma'am, that's the hold that i have tried repeatedly to explain to you.

her: i'm calling the police and having you arrested!

me: go right ahead. all you're going to do is make yourself look like even more of an idiot than you already do, if that's even possible.

her: *turning purple* what did you just say to me!

me: oh, but it's ok for you to call me ""stupid"" and accuse me of lying.

this lunatic actually stood out in the parking lot for almost thirty minutes (i can only assume that the police are bound by some sort of rule that they have to respond to calls for assistance otherwise i doubt they would have come at all)

they arrive, talk to her, and then come inside to talk to me. surprising no one, i only had to explain it to the deputy once and he started chuckling to himself as he walked.back outside to give cruella destupid the bad (good?) news. the icing on the cake? faced with overwhelming evidence of just how wrong she was, she actually tried to get the cop to arrest me for ""verbally assaulting"" her (indirectly calling her an idiot). needless to say she went 0 for 2 and stomped back to her car, very nearly driving off while her husband only had one leg in the car.

Its their job to deal with a troublesome manager the same way your managers job is to deal with a troublesome employee.

They will point ""His actions were his actions and not a representation of the policy our company has in dealing with employees, we agree it was unlawful and will help to correct this problem."" If they side with him, it will be very very difficult to defend in court. HR absolutely will not lie about it either, lest they be raked over the coals. So unless your boss has friends or coworkers who are willing to go to bat for him and risk the consequences of striking out affecting them too, I'd say it doesn't look good for him.

He may have a history of problems unrelated to it and the timing of the heart attack is coincidental compared to the massive pile of reasons they've had for firing him. He had a doctors note, did he inform his boss? Did he have the note delivered to them in a timely manner? Usually you need the paperwork and such on file within a day or two of the incident, its well and good if you have a heart attack, but you should have a parent or friend come in and deliver the doctors note so the bosses can file the paperwork. He chose to stay for the graveyard shift, so they could have had reason to doubt how severe the injury was and feel he was exaggerating to get off work (Many employees do this. Drop a spatula on their foot and they will cry broken foot and sit in the back for 3 hours.) Does he have a history of crying wolf or chronic medical ailments he claims that impede his ability to work?

Firing is a possibility, demotion is a possibility, slap on the wrist is a possibility, nothing at all is a possible but unlikely possibility. It really depends on what the higher ups are like, what they are suing for exactly, and what the fallout might be. Don't really have enough info. Its possible the boss could be fired, but that's just part of a spectrum of possibilities. ",null,8,cd0z7q6,1pcccq,talesFromRetail,hot,37
Jinxy_Minx,"I almost got screwed a few times at my thrift store job over medical stuff. It's left me with the knowledge to look into every threat a manager might toss at me.

Example 1. Working a Sunday shift and woke up cramping horribly. I've always been unlucky with my period in that it causes enough pain to leave me light headed, dizzy, and overall miserable. It hadn't quite started so I tried to ignore everything. Drinking cold water helped so I admit there were a few trips to the water fountain. At one point a manager(E for anyone who might remember my complaints about her) made a joke about me being hung over.
I ended up leaving a few hours later because I nearly passed out/had spent time crying in the break room because everything hurt. I was honest saying I was leaving to go to the ER, which I did.
Came back to work on my next shift to be written up for coming to work hung over/leaving. They asked if I even went to the ER and I said yep, and had been put on meds for low iron/potassium. They then tried to use the tapes of me crying in the break room saying it looked like a hangover.


Example 2. Was in a car accident. Doctor had a note saying I could work but could only do light work because of my shoulder. My managers said policy is that I can't even come in the building until I had a note saying I was cleared completely. At first I could only get a doctors appointment for about 2/3 weeks after I was told that. My head manager said she wasn't sure if they could hold my job that long, so I scrambled/called in a favor to get an appointment sooner. Turns out what she told me was illegal for my state.",null,0,cd1bpy9,1pcccq,talesFromRetail,hot,12
themosh54,"There is NO way that HR is going to help sue the company.   Period.   I have a feeling your friend misunderstood.   I have no doubt that they will investigate the situation, but remember if they fire the manager they will likely be facing a wrongful termination suit from him.

The good news is that HR can reinstate your friend and take disciplinary action against the manager.  If I was a betting man, I would say that your friend gets his job back and the manager gets reprimanded and possibly transferred to avoid the possibility of retaliation against your friend.   If your friend is retaliated against,  the management will be in serious trouble.   My advice is to document on your own the time, date, and nature of any further instances of the management mistreating or being disrespectful to the staff.  It's a lot easier to conduct an investigation when there are details about an incident.

QWOP_Sparkle,"&gt; He was leaning against the wall with his hand over his chest, breathing hard and complaining that his heart was beating rapidly and his chest hurt. I had already clocked out and just decided to chat with him for a moment to see if maybe it would calm him down and offer him a cigarette.


Offer him a cigarette when his heart is beating rapidly? Smoking increases the blood pressure which could've given him a full on heart attack. Come on OP, that's just common sense. If someone's chest is hurting or having an asthma attack the last thing you do is smoke around them.

1.) Why didn't he call in when he knew he couldn't make it to shift? The manager presumably thought that he was NC/NS, hence why it was marked in your schedule book. A NC/NS is enough to terminate in a lot of cases. 

2.) Are you in a ""right-to-work"" state? If so, it is going to be a hard sell to a judge.

3.) When did he provide the information to management about having medical issues? 

There are a myriad of other issues I could bring up, but it seems like there is just not enough information here. Also it seems odd that your own HR department would even suggest a lawsuit. HR exists in order to minimize law suits and to perform damage control, even if it was a franchise vs. corporate call.

HR can't 'help' you sue the company they work for. Their job is the opposite- to protect the company from lawsuits.

They wouldn't tell him anything except they are following up on the situation and will notify him when the investigation is complete.

brzcory,"This will be unpopular, but here it is:

No call.

That no call part means that while he went to the doctors office, it didn't dawn on him that maybe he should call into work and let them know that he couldn't make it in. 

Knowing that someone can't make it in, versus having someone just randomly not show up, is a big difference. Hell, when I had my appendix burst, I still left a message ""Hey, yeah, I'm in the hospital, and I can't make it in today"". 

And *if* he just took 5 days off, and then afterwards brought in the note, that's not going to fly either. If he handed them the note from the get-go, that would free him of any liability. 

It also depends on your individual states laws. Some states protect workers with short-term disability and whatnot, but others are at-will states, so you can be fired at pretty much any time for pretty much anything. If you're in one of those states, they could have fired him for slacking off the previous night, and have no repercussions.

feels like someone scratched the side of my car all to hell while i wasn't looking, possibly from driving their car into the side of my vehicle while parking (but more then likely with a key, or, if available, a power sander )

&gt;...to find one good cart and throw the trash inside of it onto the floor because why wouldn't the employees clean that?!

feels like a tripping hazard that should be conviently placed in their shopping bags when they are not looking only to discovery it when they get home and unload everything.

&gt;...to ask the deli counter to make me a fresh batch of chicken tenders because I want them piping hot, not fifteen minutes old.

feels like a 30 minute wait for a 3rd degree burn on your extra crispy chicken strips

&gt;...to get to my cereal and push past the ""Do not cross"" tape while an employee is cleaning up glass.

feels like broken glass in your foot that you can't do shit about because you crossed the ""do not cross"" line  (&lt; if only it wasn't in their shoe and in their actual foot D: )

&gt;...to tell an obviously busy employee to check the back for me for the new milk, because I know they're just too lazy to put it out.

feels like you bring them the oldest milk you have and tell them this is all that was in the back... (chances are they won't realize or even check that the milk in the display is newer, and if you're lucky try having the milk go sour within a day or 2 )

&gt;...to go through the express lane with my full cart because the other lines are too Goddamn long. 

(is this the one with the cashier? if so-) feels like the cashier does the item limit and waits for payment and then does the next set of items continually until everything is paid for. i.e. 10 items or less, take first 10 items, total a transaction, take next 10 items, total next transaction- repeat till all items are proccessed with 10 items or less per receipt :)

&gt;...to talk on my cellphone as long as I want without being interrupted by some bitchy cashier telling me others are waiting. I'm a paying customer, let them wait.

feels like a voided/held transaction while you proccess next customer in lines items and let them pay, or just go to another cash if possible and take care of other customers


&gt;...to scream at the 18-year-old cashier for carding because she should know I'm 22!

feels like a refusal to offer service because you don't have an ID and/or are being beligerent to an employee (remember stores have a right to deny you service and even individual employees have a right to refuse service to a customer with a valid reason, being belligerent/abusive towards said employee is a valid reason )

&gt;...put my money on the belt and watch the peon grasp for my change and be grateful for the privilege. 

feels like your money just went down that little hole at the end of the belt and is gone forever, later to be found by the peon and considered a tip. you of course still have to payfor your groceries because the peon didn't notice the money on the belt and you can't prove it was there

&gt;...to get 20% off my order because I almost slipped in broken glass getting my cereal and the employee was rude and told me ""There's a caution sign for a reason.""

feels like paying for item that was broken, or a ""sorry, we can't give a discount for any injuries/issues a customer has when in the ""employees only"" section of the store un-escorted""

&gt;...to have the handsome boxboy take my groceries out while I hit on him and his bulky muscles.

feels like your jewelry mysteriously went missing the next time boxboy is at your house.

&gt;...to peel out of the parking lot and almost hit that family because I'm in a car, and they need to look where they're going.

feels like a lawsuit that has several eye witnesses

we occasionally get asked about it today but it's rare and most people understand that it's been more than 25+ yrs and things change.

this one family, however didn't understand. [Dad. Mom. Son]

me- sure, the playground is right over there (I point down the street)

M- no, the big giant slide!

me- sorry about that, the giant slide has been gone for years. long before I started.

D- NO!! it was here the last time we were here, I took my son on it (points to his adult son)

me- ok, how old was your son when you were here last?

D- 3!!

me- and now?

D- 21!!

me- so that's what like 18 yrs ago that you were last here?

M- NO!! we were just here, we came all the way here to ride it again

D- yeah, it was here the last time we came here. are you new here or some thing

me- no, I've been here 6yrs. I know what your talking about, I've seen the photos of it. I know exactly where it was. it was taken down over 15 yrs ago.

D- why don't you call your supervisor!

me- ok  (I call a co-worker that has been there since the late 70's)

he gets there and I explain the situation.

CW- the slide is gone it has been gone for 20 yrs. just like he said

D- well that's great, thanks for wasting our time!!

I later got called up to talk to the GM because they went to complain at the main office about the slide. pretty much everybody called them idiots and laughed the whole thing off.

According to my lawyer, what the two guys did would clearly be defined as theft under Title XLVI, Chapter 812, of the Florida statutes on theft.

Retail theft, which also encompasses shoplifting, is stealing money, merchandise or property from a merchant. The charge also entails removing a label, universal product code or price tag with the intent to deprive the merchant of property. It's a lot more detailed than this, but this basically sums it up.

It turns out that I was within my legal right to demand payment for the merchandise, even though at the time, I was trying to scare them more than anything. I could also have legally detained them at my store until the police arrived.

averagebear007,"When you mentioned the discount for bulk orders it reminded me of a story my dad told me.

The year is 1976 (the Bicentennial). My dad is just shy of 18, and one day his friend pops over in a car. Dad's friend (DF) says ""Hey get in the car, let's go somewhere."" Dad gets in, asks ""Where are we going?"" and DF says ""To Missouri to buy some fireworks."" Dad says ""A'ight, that's cool, just let me tell my mom I won't be home for dinner.""
     
As soon as they arrive, they find a phone booth with a Yellow Pages to scope out the nearest fireworks retailer. They get there, and meet with a representative who is talking to them about the retailer's catalog. She mentions that they give bulk discounts to people affiliated with certain organizations. DF coolly mentions ""Oh, we're with the Boy Scouts of America."" Rep says ""Great! Drive around to the back and the forklift will be waiting.""

They drive back home (to MN). They divide the loot into 3 large trash bags, one for Dad, one for DF, and one for some other friend (SOF) who for some reason gets some of the spoils. A few days/weeks later, it's just before July 4th. SOF decides to take his trash bag and set a bunch off in a park. The cops arrive and he is arrested because apparently setting off non-consumer grade fireworks can be kind of dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. Dad shows up to SOF's court hearing, says the judge's exact words were: ""I cannot find it in my heart to punish someone who just wanted to celebrate the bicentennial with a bang. Case dismissed.""

Or, uh, lactose intolerance - milk bad, some cheeses OK.  

THAT SAID, I think part of the reason why people go for 'allergic' rather than 'oh, I don't like Y, can you leave that off?' is because some places get almost unreasonably anal about not allowing 'substitutions' which includes subtractions without additions.  There was one place where I wanted to get a hamburger plain, just ketchup - nothing else.  The waiter said no, no substitutions. When I got the manager to the table, I told him I'm not SUBSTITUTING anything, I'm asking you to LEAVE OFF everything and I'll add the ketchup myself at the table.  He said no, that wasn't policy.

It actually  (at least in America) effects 1 in 133 people, sadly most don't know it because the symptoms are so varied and up until recently, diagnosis was difficult. 

That being said, it is difficult to go out to eat sometimes. I typically call ahead or at least look at a places online menu if they have one. If I can't do that, salad time. 

Many places offer gluten free alternatives but I still have to ask about the rest of the ingredients to see if it is truly safe. An example is Noodles and Company. They offer two different types of gluten free noodles, but only certain dishes become truly gluten free if I substitute those noodles (and pay $2 extra for it as well). 

I also have a peanut and tree nut allergy which makes things even more interesting (as in I need to know exactly what is in your pesto sauce)

Now I would like to order this cheap food with chicken (which the label states has about 4% chicken fish by-products and fish oil in it)...  the same goes for beef - my cat is allergic to beef so this can of purina with beef and chicken is not good, but chicken and duck is fantastic, no matter that 90% of food is made of meat and animal by-products which usually contain mostly beef or pork meat and only contain about 4-8% of the meat on tha label - it doesn't matter, the cat is allergic to beef and can only have poultry. I even had people tell me that their animal has to eat only special hypoallergenic food since it can't eat puoultry/ fish and any type of grains... I offered them a soya based food, but it had fish oil in it so it was a no go... the eventually bought (their own choice) a food that had chicken liver and rice in it (both deadly to their animal) but hey...

If they say ""Sure,"" then you're fine. If they say ""No,"" you then say ""I'm sorry, I have to tell my manager what the lady at the cash needs. I'll be back in just a moment."" Then you tell your manager what you need to tell them.

If at any point in that transaction the customer gets pissy, it's not because you didn't take the time to politely communicate to them what was going on. As a customer, it's really rude to have to deal with any CSR that is seemingly half-paying attention to you. Telling them WHY you are diverting your attention away from them also tells them that you are still trying to serve them. Simply turning away from them is rude.

I say this as someone with years of customer service experience, both in person and over the phone. If I was to compare this phone service, it's the distinction between ""I am going to put you on hold for a moment so I can do X,"" and doing it cold so the customer completes an exchange with you and then suddenly hears hold music. One is a smooth, polite transition. The other is just dismissive.

I think it's because you're the owner and you actually manage/work there.  Most stores now are either corporate or owned by absentee investors, so the staff on site can't do anything about anything.  Bad for the customer because there's no flexibility, and bad for the staff because their morale suffers when they take all that abuse from frustrated customers.

This is why I try to shop in mom-n-pop places whenever there's a choice.  I'm not looking for special treatment from the owner, but it's nice to know that if I do have a problem, I can speak face-to-face with the person who can fix it.

**Background:**

I work the desk at a high end hair salon and spa in the USA, I wasn't sure if I should post here or in /r/talesfromthefrontdesk, my job is pretty much half retail/cashier related, half answering phones but here goes.

Whenever the company hires a new person they put them through a 9 month long internship type program to get them up to the ""standard of excellence"" expected from each technician. During this time they are referred to as a ""junior stylist/colorist/etc."" The juniors are able to take appointments during the internship but the prices are about half of what the least expensive haircut/color would cost with a full priced technician. (The salon also uses a level system for pricing, meaning the longer a technician has worked there generally the more expensive their prices to reflect their skill level, we are also departmentalized so stylist only cut hair and colorist only color)

So seeing a junior technician is a great deal, you get a great cut or color for half the price (most juniors have worked in other salons before, just not as high end, and they also have a mentor who checks their work before the guest leaves.) Also anytime a new guest comes into the salon before they leave we give them a thank you packet of coupons to use on future services that *DO NOT* apply to junior services as they are already heavily discounted. Unfortunately the fine print on the coupons only says they can't be combined with other discounts and does not specifically list the junior program, people give us a hard time about that frequently.

**Story:**

So when I had just finished training and was working my first closing shift alone I get a phone call literally 3 mins before we close and I no longer have to answer the phone anymore. I pick up with my normal pleasant greeting, get no greeting in return, just a ""I wanna see the junior colorist."" I asked her what kind of color she wants to get done on her hair and told her the days the girl is available. That was the first problem. The junior colorist was only at our location Thu/Fri/Sat because those are the days her mentor works. Those hours apparently weren't good for this woman.

I'm doing everything I can to make it work around her schedule but there are either appointments already scheduled or the junior isn't working at that time. Then the woman tells me she wants to schedule a color for 30mins before we close. I calmly explain that we do not book color appointments that close to closing time as it will take that 30 mins to put the color on her hair and another 45mins for it to process. By the time she would be shampooed and blow dried it would be about an hour and a half past close and we simply do not book appointments that way.

This is when she lost her damn mind. She starts yelling at me, saying ""So you just kick people out the door as soon as you close? This is ridiculous! I'm trying to come there and give you my money and you can't seem to work the computer!"" I once again calmly try to explain that we do not kick people out as soon as we close but we do book color appointments to end generally by the time we close. She goes off on this huge rant about how she'll have to miss her grandsons baseball game and he'll be so upset and blah blah blah. All I'm thinking is I don't care please just give me your name so I can book this appointment and go home!

She finally gives me her name, I put her down for the appointment and before getting off the phone she says ""oh, wait, I have a coupon!"" My heart sinks as I start to explain that she cannot use a $20 off coupon with a junior colorist (for a service that only cost $31 mind you! So she wants to get color done for $11 that at the cheapest full price runs for $60!) as the junior prices are already heavily discounted. She starts reading me the small print on the card in a snarky voice saying it doesn't say anything about junior prices. Once again I try to stay calm although my voice is shaking now, saying that I am pretty sure the junior price would be included in the ""can't be combined with other offers/discounts"" part. She loses it again, this time attacking me, telling me I am the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with, she can't afford it if she can't use the coupon, she is gonna have to miss her grandsons baseball blah blah blah. When she finally stops I tell her I will have my manager contact her in the morning and repeat the appointment time we scheduled. She tells me again my incompetence is unparalleled and hangs up.

I call my manager immediately on the verge of tears, she calms me down, tells me I didn't do anything wrong, and that I was absolutely right, this crazy woman cannot use the coupon for a junior service.

I will never understand why people think its ok to be so rude to customer service people.

I was desperate to go get my feet taken care of and while my boyfriend put up with going the first time around, he didn't want to go so he suggested I go with his mom for bonding time. First, she's legit schizo. Second, she's very narcissistic so she talks loudly so everyone can hear and 'admire' her even if whatever she says is incredibly stupid, which is always. Also, I've never had to put up with a crazy person so I usually just end up angry with her because she's annoying and she always has to get her way. Anyway, I decide to take her to get our feet done and she of course gets the one technician in the whole place who can speak fluent English so she spends the entire time bragging about her hair and whatever else pops into her puny brain. Luckily none of her delusions kick in so I figure we 're in the clear.  And then we go to pay. She had spent some time with a guy who had dated her and a friend of hers so as I was busy taking care of the bill, she proceeds to exclaim really loudly about how the guy is now fucking her friend.

Countries have laws for one reason, people do things regardless of the effects they have on others.  A law that has no punishment, or lack of enforcement means nothing to certain members of society.  Not all punishments are seen as punishment depending on the person.

If your daemonspawn understands why something is wrong, good for them, but why do they still do it?  If they cant understand that they're causing someone else to do more work, make them clean it up until they learn that every mess needs to be cleaned.  

Sometimes all the child can understand, is pain.  Its hardwired into our brains to avoid pain.  Sure, all the child learns is to not do something because it will bring them pain, but that system works well enough for our government.  Its a nice stop-gap measure until the child comes to a full understanding of morality, charity, and being an awesome person to other people.

I actually found one of my favorite christmas songs through store holiday muzak; *Marshmallow World.*  

I'd never heard it on the radio--and my mom always had the radio blasting holday tunes from Thanksgiving to when they stopped playing them--and we did a lot of Decembertime Shopping. Never saw it in a movie, though that may have changed (wasn't in any of the classics, that I can remember at least).  

It's not really religious, it's not really cheesy, and *Marshmallow World* is only loosely holiday themed, as far as I can tell.  It's ""Yay snow is awesome"" more than ""Religion/Santa/Presents!"" Also, the version I'm familiar is in big band style, and I love that stuff.

A tip is for *service*, which, to me, means personal attention above and beyond the bare minimum requirements of the position.  At a restaurant, the bare minimum job of a waiter/waitress is to take my order and fetch me my food, but they have the opportunity to do more than that: they can recommend menu items for me, refill my drink, and check back on me during the meal to make sure my experience is going well.  So, when a server at a restaurant takes the time to do those things, I am delighted to tip them generously, because their actions have made my meal significantly more enjoyable.

A carhop, though... what service can they provide?  I place my order at a speaker, and they bring me my food.  That's it.  They don't come by to check on me, they don't offer me refills, they literally just hand me a bag of whatever I ordered.

One of the worst days I had working at the library was when one of the librarians pulled me aside with the book in hand and complained that it was sticky and that I needed to clean it (wipe it down with wet towels), and separate some of the pages that were stuck together.

I tell her this, ('Eighty-Six Hundred') it doesn't click. I repeated myself a bunch of times, and followed up with 'You know, like 86 lots of 100'. No dice.

3 big things. The corner should be color changing ink, it goes from gold to green. Second and third, hold it up to the light. You should see a super imposed version of the presidents head to the side of the middle portrait, if the presidents don't match it means someone washed the ink off the bill and put it through a printer with a new denomination. Its called washing the bill. Since its a real bill, it will always pass the pen test, but you can make a trillion dollar bill that way and the pen test will still call it real.

The same goes for the vertical stripe. Same as the president head, when you hold it up to the light, there should be a vertical line of words saying the bills denomination. A 50 will say ""USA 50 USA 50 USA 50"" going up the width of the bill. If those don't match the denomination, or aren't there, then the bill is fake. The vertical stripe I believe is only higher denominations though, not sure you would find it on ones or fives, never bothered to look.

But yeah, check those things instead. Takes 3 seconds. Does the corner change color as you hold it to the light? When you hold it to the light, do the presidents match and the vertical strip say the denomination? Then 99.9% chance you are good.

My fiance's mother's ex-husband told me this story happened to a friend of his.  He got an unexpected package one day from an unfamiliar address.  Opened it up and it was full of hundreds: all strapped, brand new.  Literally millions of dollars worth.  I think he said the friend thought it was 5 million or so (500 straps would be 15m.. it was a big box).  He called the police, not wanting to get mixed up in a drug/counterfeiting operation.  The secret service showed up shortly after.  They said the address was fake.  After running a few bills through a machine they told the friend it was from North Korea, and would be completely undetectable to most people.

I'm a little skeptical they would give him any info about it.  Just show up, take the money, thank him and leave.  but who knows.

sig863,"I've posted this before, but it's worth saying again:

""Counterfeit pens"" are actually just an iodine tinture that reacts to the starch in everyday, wood-based papers.

Because US bills are made from cotton and linen, they contain no starch and therefore don't react. Any high-quality counterfeits would not be printing on standard paper, therefore rendering the pen ineffective at detecting a counterfeit.

The pens are considered ""most effective"" detecting cheap counterfiets made on a standard copier. Chances are, it would be pretty obvious that something was wrong with the bill before the pen had a chance to detect that it was fake.

Fun fact: You can create a false-positive on real bills by rubbing cooked rice on them, cutting a potato in half and rubbing that on a bill, or spraying them with [laundry starch](http://www.brandlandusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pb130022.JPG).

You can also create a false-negative on newsprint, toilet-paper and the thin paper used in large dictionaries and religious texts.

Most people appreciated this; they had a limited amount of time on their breaks from their own jobs and this way they didn't have to stand around waiting/wasting their break time. Most people. This one guy, came in at 2pm EVERY DAY and ordered the same non-fat, vanilla latte, EVERY DAY. I see  him coming down the block, there are no customers, I have been cleaning up after the lunch rush, I stop what I am doing and start making his drink, so that just as my co-worker handed him his change, I came over and set the drink down on the counter in front of him, saying ""here's your non-fat, vanilla latte, sir."" He looked at it like I had just scooted a turd across the counter at him, gave me a death look and said, ""what is this?"" I repeated what I said, maintaining eye contact. ""When did you make this?"" he asked, incredulously. ""Just now,"" I stated, ""I saw you coming down the block and started on it for you."" I smiled, he was still giving me the death look. He picks up the cup, sniffs it, glares at me and walks out. Later on that day, my manager comes downstairs and tells me that Mr. non-fat, vanilla latte had complained that I had his drink ready for him as soon as he finished paying, he also contacted our corporate office to complain about my efficiency as well. Nothing ever came of it.

killerrapist,"I've developed a personal policy to not go above and beyond in a manner that isn't required of me, unless it's for customers who've engaged me on a deeper level so I have a better understanding of them. I've said this before - people find creative ways to make us pay for being nice. That's not to say I'll stop being as nice as I can. I won't allow any amount of dick customers dictate how I interact with people, especially those who deserve more. But what I am saying is, if it's regarding some random guy, I'm not going to help them out in a way my job doesn't require me to. 

Here's an example. Recently I had a customer who bought an expensive item. Some of them were eligible for a 35 dollar discount. I let him know about it, just in case he could save money. I did it entirely to help him out. Big mistake. Since he'd have to walk over to the customer service desk to get a coupon, he was getting angry about it. ""Come on, make it happen. Make it happen."" etc, he'd say. Not being hostile, but a bit standoffish. He wanted me to just give him the discount and didn't think he should have to get a coupon. He ultimately did go for it, but his item wasn't eligible anyway. 

The point of my story is, although I've had this awareness of people dicking you over when you try to help them, I had this realization that, if somebody can find a way to cause you shit for trying to save them 30 dollars, they can find a way to give you shit for anything.

There is one type of patient that always, just ALWAYS makes me want to get up and walk out - the patient that just can't understand why the clinic can't be moved to suit their needs.

They'll call up and want to book an appointment with Dr X. I tell them; Dr X has two clinics: one on tuesday evening and one on thursday 9-2pm.
""Oh, that doesn't suit me.""
""Would you like to see a different doctor then? What time does suit you and I'll let you know who has a clinic on then.""

""Those aren't good for me. Wednesday is good for me.""
""Dr X doesn't have a clinic that day. But Dr Y has a clinic on Wednesday during the day, and Dr Z has a clinic on Wednesday evening.""

I love my job: it is quiet, the work is fairly minimal and easy, my bosses and co-workers are great, and I get to smoke hookah and basically do as I please when I'm not helping customers or doing my daily tasks. Overall, not much to complain about, but on occasion I do experience the various customers no one likes.

The rude customers who can't even utter a simple hello? Shrug, get them what they need, and move on. Aggressive jerks? Call Bossman to handle it. (Large, short-tempered arabic man yelling at a skinny douche... Hell, it's almost entertaining.) Most of them are easy enough to handle.

Dr_Acula_PhD,"Some people are literally just in their own world. I used to be a customer at a local gaming/card store. Place was decently stocked, walls of comics, tables filled with boxes of old comics, handful of cases with other random nerd gear. Rented out a couple cases to a sword/knife guy. Hired a couple counter girls that were fairly attractive. All in all, a nice place to hang out, play some Magic, browse the latest comics.

The problem was that the owner, while buying the place as-is and knowing it was a popular Magic FNM(Friday Night Magic, local 32-person or less tournaments) spot, really only wanted a Comic shop. If anyone asked him about his Magic product, he'd get surly and demand they see his counter girls for that, which is honestly what they were there for anyways. But it was just his demeanor. He'd do the same thing as Tony, ""mumbling"" about people that slighted him in the least while they were standing a couple feet away. He eventually sold his stock and closed shop, not because he was so mean, but because he didn't know how to run a business, let his help take advantage of him(For those that know Magic, he'd buy cases of product, and then have an Opening Night. At the end of which he'd let one girl have her pick of the foils, because she loved them. She'd always walk out with the 3-5 most expensive ones, costing him hundreds of dollars. Foil Jace TMS? Yeah, go ahead and have that.), and last straw, supported his pill/meth/heroin-addicted ""GF"" for over half a year.

I am not sure if this applies, but what they are doing is essentially getting rid of your position and offering you a new one, which should entail you agreeing to it or they're officially laying you off. Call your local unemployment office and ask to speak to a legal representative- in some states for certain retail fields, it is illegal for them to terminate your position in this manner without notice and without compensation. Call your manager back and ask for a written copy of what your old position title was, pay, and responsibility level, and a copy of the new one, so you have proof of the higher level of responsibility for the same rate of pay. Again, depending upon regulations in your state, this could be illegal. 

In any case, even if what they are offering you is legit, you don't have to take it and you could still collect unemployment while you look for another job.

TiredRightNowALot,"Hi there,

-- The formatting is making my numbers weird, I'm a better counter than this shows :)

I'm not sure that what I write is going to be of help, but I'll throw some suggestions...

1.  Find the positive message (I know that sounds lame).  My organization has restructured many times.  Most recently to where I had another manager come work for me.  Although that sounds great, he hated the idea.  He didn't want to be in my location because it was further than he wanted to be from home and it just wasn't what he saw as an ideal place to be.  I'm not saying it's a bad place, or I'm a bad person to work for (although I may be biased!), but he was just unhappy.  We developed a good relationship over a few months together and he finally told me how he felt.  The restructuring seriously screwed him and his family, it should never have happened.

Here's where the positive comes from.  I knew of this person, I did not actually know him personally however.  I knew he had a family, I knew that he had some good tenure with the company.  The restructuring originally had him losing his job.  He makes around $60K a year and right now, those jobs are tough to come by.  So, in light of this I reached out before the decision was final that he was to part ways with the company and brought him to my workplace.  The positive?  It was better to have a job.  Unfortunately we don't know all the factors some times.  So, perhaps it was a case of this:  either the overtime disappears, or a handful of managers disappear.  If it's tough living with no overtime, it's really tough living with no income at all.

2.  Spend this time while you have a reduced income figuring out what you want to do to bridge the gap for your finances.  Do you retrain for something else?  Do you add a second source of income that does work with your schedule?  I know it might be VERY difficult, but there are options.  Offer your services on an entrepreneurial level...  start a business and manage that business, with the assistance of your wife.  Look at business opportunities with low start up, but be careful.

3.  Speak with your manager or Human Resources Department.  Make it very clear that you are committed to working with the business you are at, but with the reduced income, you need to get ahead.  Make it crystal clear that you want advancement.  Get a clear plan for what it takes to go from Assistant Manager, to Store Manager or whatever the next step is.  You may think that you already know this, and people already know you want to get promoted... that's fine.  Do it again, and do it with some real passion around the topic.  Be political; tell them how much you love the company, the values, the mission, anything you can.  

It's a rough place to be; I accepted a position a few times in my career where the money I was making dropped 10-20% versus the previous position (making a great bonus at one position, not making it at the next due to going to tougher assignments that had been underperforming), but in the end I'm up quite significantly from where I started.  Took a ton of work and put myself in to some troubles along the way... but it paid off.

I'm sorry for your position, and I hope that you can get out from the troubles that you are in.  If there are more questions that I can answer, send me a message with whatever info you want and I will do my best.  I've been in management in various positions and organizations for around 15 years.  I've made tough decisions that people didn't like, and I've been at the end of those tough decisions too.  I think that I might have some insight :)

Good luck. ",null,6,cd3p1zp,1plb4a,talesFromRetail,hot,3

So, because of the managers behaviour things were often done improperly, including propping open the back door, or not closing it at all. This piece of information is probably the most important bit, and also why it is my most memorable story of me quitting.

Anyway, so fast forward to a while later and I get tired of the hell that place had become and I quit.

Metalhead2881,"My husband and I both got jobs at a thrift store when we were in our late teens. He was a ""hanger"" (put clothes on the hangers and acted as a second eye to catch anything that shouldn't be out on the floor) and I was in charge of the shoe dept. I cleaned up, priced, and displayed all the shoes and then pulled and processed the old pairs to make room for new ones. (I was the only shoe person-it's relevant)

So at first it seemed awesome, we got to work together, had set hours with ok pay, and I was excited to have my own desk! But things started getting bad. There were way too many managers, so you constantly had conflicting instructions, especially my husband. One manager would pull something he hung up off the hanger and throw it in the bin, yelling at him that it shouldn't have been hung. The next manager would walk by, pull it out of the bin, and yell at him for not hanging it. No one listened to him trying to explain this, and just yelled at him to get back to work.

My issues came from the unreal amount of shoes I was suppose to price and put out, while also pulling the old ones. I could get enough priced, but then didn't have time to display and pull. If I displayed and pulled, I wouldn't hit my pricing quota, etc. I explained to managers, and they just yelled at me to work harder and faster. They also got mad if I tried to put out the nice skate shoes and expensive brands (my husband had worked at a shoe store) and instead wanted a bunch of worn out grandma shoes, priced way too high, which would result in me getting yelled at that not enough shoes were selling.

So, after a month we were both fed up. We were both your typical hard working wage slaves, did our best, gave it our all, etc. (I actually got made a manager at every job I worked but that one because of my work ethic and good attitude). We had had enough! So we walk in, throw down our nametags, and say ""we quit!"" And walk out. We hear the store tattletale/suck up yelling for the evil manager in a panicked voice, and we just keep on walking. Felt like one of those explosion scenes in an action flick, where the hero isn't phased by the explosions behind him. It felt badass, and we both got better jobs shortly after.

Wow, that got longer than I expected.

I had a bit of an altercation with one of our managers (basically she personally insulted me very publicly on the gaming floor with all of the players and my co-workers) so I quit. Her manager then called me requesting me to return promising it would be looked at. With me being 19 and very stupid I believed him. 

Things did go well for a while as the investigation was carried out as to why she was such a bitch but little did i know she was hatching her plan. 

She was very friendly with the other managers especially the ones who decided what hours we worked. That manager decided I had to start to work doubles (1pm until 4 am) every other day. After about 2 weeks of this I decided I had finally had enough.

I walked in without my uniform on with a hand written note saying basically I quit. As I walked in the manager who decided the hours was sitting at reception and his first words were ""ByakuyaBankai I have had to schedule you in for 3 doubles again next week"" I politely declined and said ""Sorry I will be unable to do this because I no longer work here, I quit"" 

I put my shades on (like a boss) and walked out the door to my car hearing the boss shout ""you mother F**ker"" as I walked out was music to my ears.

unmined,"I worked at a grocery store in San Diego for a few years. The company used to double manufacturer coupons, in addition to sale prices and specials. About the worst thing that can happen to a cashier is a customer walking up to a checkstand with a bulging cart and a heap of coupons.

This didn't happen frequently because the store I worked for was in a pretty wealthy neighborhood (but no, I certainly was NOT wealthy myself). But the people who did horde coupons invariably tried to purchase items ""similar"" to what was on the coupon. After all, they don't want to use some other brand, right?

So ... since I was a bag boy (""Courtesy Clerk!""), I would have to sprint all over the store to either fetch the correct item, or to ""verify"" the shelf price. I usually took about 15min/per customer.

Any coupon that wound up being non-applicable touched off a reaction like we were accusing the customer of grand larceny.

But my favorite, by far, was this ...

A customer we named ""Pita"" (pain in the ass) purchased a Massengil Feminine Douche with a double coupon. It was real, and she got the discount.

The next day - and I assure you I am NOT making this up - she came in and approached the customer service counter. She wants a refund for a defective product.

That's right ... she brought in her used douche for a refund.

Of course, she did not have a receipt, so we put on our game faces and looked up the purchase using her Club Card. It was there, and we began to process the refund. When she saw the it was going to be something like $0.30, she protested that it cost more than that.

Yep, we are now arguing over the value of a used douche.

So we showed her the transaction, the retail price, and the price she paid after applying the double coupon. She was pissed, but finally stopping arguing. She collected her $0.30 and left the store.

We had a massive sale on mangoes. 39¢ a piece. Of course, our area being extremely ethnic, or customers went nuts. We were selling them by 6 or more cases an order. After running through one pallet (120 cases) by noon my Manager in Training decides to put a 5 mango limit for each transaction. Enter angry black lady. She and her husband had picked up 10 of the suckers and brought them up. I tell her there's a five mango limit. She, of course, goes nuts. Says we have to honor the ad (ha!) And that if we don't she will sue. I then proceed to point out the whole we reserve the right to limit quantities and terminate sales at any time. I just smile like the smug asshole I am as she sheepishly pays and gets the hell out of my line.

The thing that probably amazes me more than anything else is how much of the business you seem to give away through promotions, unsolicited discounts, etc. It's like the term ""opportunity cost"" was just ripped out of your brain and you refuse to let it back in. 

As someone who has always worked for large retail companies, and never had the opportunity to be an entrepreneur, it's really interesting to see the opposite side of the spectrum. I've often thought that the corporations pinch pennies to the point that they lose valuable business. You seem to get the business and give away a lot of the value (to you as the owner).

I said no, no one had said anything. He told me it was too short. I said ""Oh, I'm sorry. It's past my fingertips, so I thought it was ok."" I showed him that it did indeed go about a quarter inch past my fingertips. His response? 

""It's too short.""

I give her the two cups and she says she wanted 3. She yells ""This happened to me last week too! Is everyone here new?"" Of course I wish to state the obvious, that she said the order was correct when it wasn't, or bring in mind reading to it (it WAS at the top of my mind) but I simply say I only had her down for two. She said she thought she heard a third one, so I repeat back the order again, slowly and ask her what part of it sounded like a third drink. She didn't know and just ordered another drink.

While it was incredibly difficult for you to forsee this incident, calling 911 should have been done anyway by the monitoring service instead of transferring the call to you. A technician could have been organised once the police had determined there was no threat. Would it have saved her?

fifthwheel87,"I had a scene very similar to this happen in a major drugstore chain in Long Island, NY. 

I had dropped off my prescriptions the day before and was told that they were swamped then, so they would be ready the next day. That was fine with me, I still had some drugs to see me through the day. I went back the next day a full 1 hour before the pharmacy closed. 

There was only one technician/pharmacist working that whole area, and I could tell by the 10 customers hanging around the pick up area that she was swamped. That's fine, I needed to pick up some other stuff as well, so I went to take care of all the other stuff I needed. 

Once that was done, I went and sat down on the waiting area of the pharmacy and waited for the line to dissipate. Sadly, because there was only one person there, it took forever for the people to get their shit and get out. Again, it's fine. I'm a patient person, and understand things like this happen.

Finally it's just down to 3 people, but was just passing the pharmacy's closing time. The pharmacist announced that she would help us 3 and that was it. No one else would be helped that night. Good, I think, 'cause I had just run out of one of my meds the night before. 

Over the course of the next 20-30 minutes, about 5 other people came up to the pharmacy counter and asked about their prescriptions. One by one, the pharmacist turned them away, explaining that she had been swamped all day and that she was only going to help us who had been waiting obscene amounts of time. 

Or, rather, she tried to. This one lady came in and demanded that she be serviced. The pharmacist tried to explain her story to the indignant customer, but she wasn't having it. Rather than fight longer, the pharmacist reluctantly helped the woman before the rest of us who had been waiting. 

At this point, I just felt sorry for the pharmacist. She was just trying to do her job while doing right by the people who had been waiting patiently. While she was helping the aforementioned bitch customer, she (customer) was on her phone complaining and bitching about how the pharmacist tried to refuse her service. She ""how dare they""d and ""I can't believe this shit""d to whoever was on the other line. Keep in mind the lady came to the pharmacy a full 15 minutes after they should have ""closed."" Seriously, Tough Shit - you were late to begin with, come back tomorrow and shut the f*ck up - you're annoying everyone. 

Finally once the bitch was gone, the poor pharmacist called me up. I thanked her profusely and told her I understand sometimes shit happens. She was a great pharmacist and very kind. I gave her tremendous credit for dealing with that entitled brat in the manner she did. I haven't seen her since, so for all I know that was her breaking point and she quit. Biggest thing that irked me was the brat came late - well past closing time, and all while she bitched, the pharmacist still helped her, and her transaction only took about 5 minutes.

Parents meet up at a parking lot, back into the space, and distribute candy from the back hatch of their minivan, just car-to-car-to-car, allowing the entire process to be finished in in minutes, where normally visiting all of those houses could take hours.  

So we did that, and then we went inside their community hall and played games and won stickers, then we went back to trawling the neighborhood.  

The church was not our family's church--a different flavor of Christian--but it was packed, it was free, and it was a nice break from scampering around the streets.  ",null,3,cd4hgir,1po3w4,talesFromRetail,hot,5

Where I live it's actually illegal for stores to mandate this. They must give you a cash refund if you ask. I know most of the workers know this, and I know the store certainly knows that their policy is illegal, but they make the workers at the counter lie to customers and say they're only allowed refunds as gift cards.

So we were all enjoying a meal when they pipe up and start talking about the person who was leaving and i was replacing. Then they went on to say how when she applied for x's position she got shot down and was told it was already dealt with. So for the next 45 minutes myself and my co-workers listened to her rant on about how management doesn't appreciate her hard work and so on to give her the promotion she thought she deserved. I kind of sat back and smiled at the whole thing and so did my other co-worker who was the only one who knew about my promotion coming the following day at the staff meeting. 

The following day at work all of us showed up and my boss comes out and starts the thing and then says she is pleased that i would be taking x places... well the look on the girls face whose home we were at the night before went white, then green, then red... she started screaming at our boss and everything, at this point my boss looks at me and says if there was anything i wanted to say to these accusations to my character. I turned and looked at my co-worker and asked how many times shes been written up in the past 6 months. She replied twice, and said wrong this is your third time, I believe this terminates your contract with the company. She didn't even say a word about that she just turned around and left and we never heard from her again.

My dad was a local news journalist for 40 years. And you are absolutely correct about the reporter getting wood.

He knows these spots so well the he could park the live van and point the microwave transmitter to its distant relay without the use of a compass or map.

He could tell you the best parking lot of conservatives, or liberals, or dead heads. If he needed opinion contrary (or for) the story, he could get you a crazy within 20 minutes of leaving the station.

And when folks like TC show up, it's gold. It gets put on their log tapes and turned in during evaluations.

1 - Intro

2 - SDPD basically saying you will die a horrible death if you even light one sparkler or snake

3 - SDPD firing range, with a child-sized dummy, literally covered form head-to-toe with fireworks that have been seized at the US/Mexico border (ie. the most poorly constructed fireworks available anywhere).

godless117,"As a former call center worker, I feel, and understand your pain. My best way to get rid of these people is as follows.

1. Put customer on a 1-2 minute hold and break down into the smallest words what the situation is and why you can't do what they want.

2. Go back to customer and relay this information: ""I'm sorry about ____, unfortunately we (or I if you want them to escalate the call faster) can not do ____"" follow this immediately with the phrase ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" 

3. Repeat, unrelentingly until customer gets frustrated and either hangs up or asks for a ""superior"".

If done properly you'll be off the phone in under 2 minutes.

Hope this helps.

But it's getting to the point where people are literally Facebook messaging me fifteen minutes before the shift, asking me to work for them so they can go out drinking with their friends.

I've had a coworker text me less than an hour before her shift asking me to take her four-hour shift, when I had a four-hour shift right after hers.

They were about to leave and I just couldnt take it, I ran up to them and told them I want to give them my employee discount. It's the least I could do for someone about to go out and put their life on the line for me, and the least I could do for a pair if parents struggling to meet their son's basic needs. 

Their sense of grattitude was so immense. I was humbled by how much this seemed to help them. The mom started tearing up, and the dad's face was so appreciative.

mal_adroit,"Everyone needs to vent, even managers. That being said, good for you for confronting them. If your managers were bitching about legit complaints, then they really should discuss with you in private: figure out solutions. 

Because they chose the cowardly route and it seems that you have a legitimate complaint that you weren't trained properly, maybe you should go above their heads to HR or the store or district manager. You don't even have to complain. On a visit from the higher-ups, you can mention (hopefully in front of boss) that you're really looking forward to train on gift-wrapping and ""Oh, hey DR, when did you say you were going to train me again? I've been here X months now, and we should do that soon."" You know, if you want to get petty. 

I have to say, if you have asked to be trained for things that you haven't been, then you are not at fault and they're just jerks. If you have repeatedly asked for help over the SAME things, yeah, I'd bitch about you too. 

I used to work at a Bed Bath and Beyond type place that did free gift wrapping and I'm probaby worse than you. I would always warn the person who wanted it that I'm not trained, I'm not good, and if they'd prefer, I will just give them the wrapping paper and bow and they can do it themselves. I loved the people who still wanted me to do it though. It, no joke, would take me over half an hour to even get the paper to cover the entire gift. I was the worst. I had people bitch, moan, take it off right in front of me. I just smiled and reminded them, ""I did warn you I'm no good. If you would like to speak with my manager to have him train me for it, I would love to call him for you."" Most of the time, I got these people on my side by bashing management for not training ""we nincompoops"" properly. 

All in all, it sounds like you have a rather run-of-the-mill retail job. We are never fully trained. Our managers are usually assholes and assclowns because honestly, who the fuck actually wants to manage retail?

This is just one of those odd human nature things.  If the person is not self-aware (or unwilling to be aware) it’s one of those thought traps.

As soon as you help someone, they think it’s your responsibility to help them on this problem.  When I was younger I did this-tried to help someone when it wasn’t in my area of responsibility or sometimes even my area of influence. When my efforts or suggestions didn’t solve it to their satisfaction, they were back, and angrier and rude, demanding more help.

Now days, I always preface any attempts at help with"" I'll do what I can, but beyond that, I can't guarantee anything""

When my suggestions don't pan out, I shrug my shoulders and said- ""sorry- no other ideas.""  Letting them know I take no responsibility for them.



In China, there are very few good Samaritans.  The way the law is set up, if you help someone, you stand the chance of being sued.  The theory is, if you helped them, you were feeling guilty, and therefore must be responsible in some matter.
There can be zero connection between the Good Samaritan, and the person they helped, but they will still be sued because it’s assumed there must be SOME connection or they wouldn’t have.

I had a guy come in saying he didn't do it because we turn over all the info to the NSA and it's pointless because there's a law that every cell phone has to have gps etc. Which is true. But that's via the carriers who only do it for the police on warrant. So I tell him this and he says going to the police is too much work and he knows we can do it. To wit I reply even if we could we would only do it from our corporate office after receipt of a valid police report that it was stolen. 

He yelled about suing and calling his lawyer so I informed him that we could not prove him any further service until we received the orders issued by the court from his lawsuit. 

Walked in the back and wrote a note on the record that he came in claiming it was his phone and it was stolen and he was told to contact police and carrier etc. Not that it will do any good if someone else brings the phone in cause it takes corporate getting that police report to flag and ban a phone from service.

I had no clue what she was doing so I turned to my left a little and then pulled into the pump spot, got out of my car and started to pump my gas.

The woman finally pulls back enough to straighten her car out so that her drivers side window is facing where I'm pumping my gas, rolls down her window, and then proceeds to yell at me that I 'almost hit her car' blah blah blah.

It's always a competition between pedestrians, cars and cyclists where everyone hates everyone else. Pedestrians hate car drivers because many people won't stop at stop signs to let pedestrians cross and will drive on paths that aren't roads so you're always at risk of getting hit. 

However, in reverse, some pedestrians cross the road without looking, instead focusing on their phone, which is bad enough. However, every now and then you get the fucker who not only decides to cross without looking, but takes the time of their lives crossing and will many times cross at an angle or in the middle of the road not at a crossing

This was a huge grocery store and the parking lot was gigantic. I drive a small hatch back and as I was getting ready to reverse I noticed an elderly couple unloading their shopping. They were parked across the lane behind me but in a diagonal parking spot. They were unloading their groceries at a snail's pace so there was no way I was going to wait for them. Plus I had tons of room and my car was tiny. I began to slowly reverse making sure I was far away from them.

All of a sudden they start spazzing out. The man darts forward and begins hitting and kicking my car. I was going to roll down my window but he was attacking with as much force as an elderly person could muster so I just drove away.

This Halloween, people were doing a trunk or treat near the (small) college that I attend. They were doing it in our public loibrary parking lot, AS WELL AS the one the college uses. That's not the problem though. Everyone seemed to be in the middle of the road, the one you drive on to turn into the parking lot. No! Not near the cars giving out candy, near the cars that are... moving.

Besides trying to avoid the cars parked very close on the side of the road, and the people standing in it. there was no way to move. Finally a group of about 20 people standing in the road went down to about 25, allowing just enough for one lane to get through. the person in front of me let the first person through (as it was their lane) and they were followed by about 20 other cars after wards (all moving at a snails pace for obvious reasons). Finally, the person in front of me goes, and I go shortly after. The person inf ront got away, but I got behind two people walking on the side of the road. A mother and daughter holding hands standing far enough apart to fit another two children. It's like they were purposefully getting in the way as much as possible. Of course, not using the empty sidewalk to the right. I couldn't past them here because the road curves, if I go into the other lane, I wouldn't see an oncoming vehicle until they were within about five feet of me (I'm careful to cross before this spot whenever I'm walking because there's no visability of the road. It's fine because you shouldn't be crossing here.) So I had to wait until the walked far enough so I could see the other side of the road, and had to drive through there and proceeded to find a parking spot about a 5 minute walk away from the campus, which i really wish I had done before that.

Instead of making an ecstatic customer, you made someone not want to shop there again. Just how difficult would it gave been to let her in, let her get her stuff and ring her up?
edit: the level of downvotes is ridiculous. reread OP's post. where is the entitlement? the woman called 15 minutes before close. they told her they were closing soon. she asked if they could stay open. they said no, so she tried to make it in time, but didn't succeed. she tugged on the door, twice, but didn't say anything or act angry and then left. it sounds like she ran late, and missed the closing but was completely civil about the whole thing. what did this customer do that was so out of line to deserve scorn? 
the reason i say that it's spiteful and bad service is that the associate ignored her. at the very least, they could've gone over and apologized and told her that the register was closed so they couldn't service her. instead she was ignored and treated like she was invisible, which i consider disrespectful. 
maybe i've been doing this too long, and maybe the core reading this is too young, but the retail game was never like this before. i see so many posts about people doing nice thing for customer ""because they have to,"" or because they're afraid to lose their job, but from the retail that i know, people went above and beyond for people because they were good at their job.
someone made a comment about being paid overtime for staying late, which makes me think you guys don't know how overtime works. if someone is scheduled for a 5 hour shift that they stay 15 minutes longer for...that's no overtime. 
for the record, i run a very high volume retail store. we close most nights at 9pm. the team is scheduled to be there until 9:30 for store recovery and closing detail. if a customer shows up right at close or a few minutes after, we let them in. one person can take care of them while the rest of the crew continues with closing process. it's really not that difficult. everyone gets out on time, the customers are ecstatic. 
judging from this post, if this woman fits the description of entitlement, then you might be in the wrong industry. you guys can downvote all you want, but the fact of the matter is that i have a successful store with a great customer reputation, and a very happy sales crew, and our top priority is service.

(1) In the US there are extremes of poverty that you just don't see in Oz.  I mean, we have battlers here, but our employment rate is really low and most people can get a job if they try.  If not, Centrelink covers them.  You'll never get rich on Centrelink, but you won't starve either.  In the US, the pay is so low (minimum wage = $7.25) that even some soldiers returning from Afghanistan have to go on Food Stamps (coupons entitling them to free food at a supermarket) just to feed their kids.  It's awful.  So regular people are always looking for bargains, and they can get quite rude if they feel frustrated in the shops.

(2) Another thing you see in the US is the sheer number of competitors who are all striving for your business.  Whereas a large country town in Oz might have two of each type of shop and check out each other's prices to keep them similar, in an American town of equivalent size, you might have four or six.  Thus, every shop works harder to keep prices down and uses gimmicks such as coupons and attitudes like 'The Customer Is Always Right' to keep customers coming back to them.

I manage the front desk at a hotel, and the GM is a fantastic lady, very easy to get along with but firm if you screw up (basically, awesome manager material and what I try to emulate!).

This woman spent her entire shift on personal calls, every shift... changed the schedule around solely so she could arrive at 8 rather than 7 (but insisted days she didn't work the desk were normal, so we couldn't ALL just swap the shifts around... Oh no... Twice a week someone got a long shift and someone got a short one)... and of course, pushed ALL of her work off on me. After about three months of steadily deteriorating mood I was about ready to quit, had my resignation written and planned to go to her boss to do it, because fuck her. 

The day before I went up there, I woke up to a text from the Bitch, informing me that she had been let go, the previous manager was coming back, and that it had been a pleasure to work with me.

So I have to say that I consider myself a person with a high amount of patience and tolerance for other people. 

I find that working in food service you have to have both of these things but today I was almost pushed past my limit.Where I work is a pretty up-and-coming little restaurant chain and we're always super busy, but it's Sunday night and we're winding down. 

Today has been pretty hectic considering we are located near a very large university and today is normally our busiest day of the week. I was wiping down the drink station when a lady come up came up to me and said that we didn't have any more Diet Coke. I told her in a very polite manner that I would go to the back and check the syrup to see what was going on. As it would turn out, we didn't have any more syrup left in the bag and there was none left replace it with. 

So I went to tell her that we didn't have anymore left and this is how that exchange went(the lady will be know as EB): 

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but it seems like we don't have any more syrup left for the Diet Coke. 

EB: I only drink Diet Coke. (And here I would like to point out that we have an abundant arrangement of Coke and Pepsi products, unsweet tea, sweet tea, Splenda sweetened tea, lemonade and coffee. ) 

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but once the syrup is gone there's nothing else I can do. 

EB: Well there's a convenience store two minutes away and you can go get me a Diet Coke. (Insert shocked shitless face here.) 

Me: i'm sorry ma'am but I'm not allowed to leave the premises while I'm on the clock. 

EB: BUT I ONLY DRINK DIET COKE! Me: Let me go get my manager. 

EB: I want a refund for this whole meal. I just can't eat my salad without something to drink. 

As far as I know my manager ended up giving her an entire refund for the meal. And afterwords she demanded that we make her a new salad to go so that she could eat her salad at home with a Diet Coke.

one time i thought i was about to see a dog get shot right inside my store. i am and have always been a cat person, but that doesn't mean i want to see a dog get it's head blown off because of their owner's terrible manners.

a couple came in with a dog and i tried (politely, at first) to explain to them that they could not bring their dog in and why. after reacting much like op's customer (""i can do whatever i want, i'm the customer, blah blah blah). 

a sherrif's deputy came into the store. i asked him to intervene and he told the couple the same thing, adding that if i told them to leave for that or pretty much any other reason they had to go. the wife/girlfriend tried to drag  the guy outside but he actually said the same thing to the cop that he had said to me about how he could do whatever he wanted (this guy was either incredibly stupid or had a deathwish, maybe both. we've all sung a few lines from ""fuck the police"" under our breath as the cop pulls away after giving us a ticket, but to tell one right to his face to basically fuck off?).

In all seriousness, just try to be cheerful with customers. Yes, they may be the 856th customer you've dealt with today, but YOU are their first person they've met in the store. 

Try adn learn any sales promotions and such your store is doing. If your store gives out flyers, take one home and skim through it. Make note of any good deals you can talk to customers about, depending on the size of your store. Its not as applicable to say, grocery stores. But stores that require a lot of interactions with customers and answering questions its good to know a few of these things off the top of your head.

ESPECIALLY peruse any deals they are making for black friday as soon as your store makes them known. You don't want to be taken off guard by customers constantly asking questions about ""Is this on sale? How much off"" for big ticket items.

If your dealing with money, remember how to spot fake currency, visit the secret service website if you need a refresher. Holidays are when counter fitters love to do cash purchases because cashiers are horribly swamped. Count your cash carefully, and if you get flustered, pause and ask a keyholder to double check. They would much rather waste 5 seconds than have someone manage to quick change you or scam you. 

And as painful as it can be, good customer service really does make a difference. In America in particular, there is a LOT of competition in a confined space. In your general vicinity, no matter what form of retail, there are probably at least 5-6 competitors the customer can buy the same or similar products from. And if your a large chain, plenty of other branches if they don't like your store in particular because its got 'that asshole manager who was rude to me.' 

My manager for instance stresses a story about a store in our chain down the road from us, maybe 5 miles. They gave him such a hard time about buying a warranty for his fairly cheap item, he didn't go back to that store again for 3 years. And even then he only went because he knew it was under new management. We've got 3 other stores within 10 miles of here, plus all our competitors. If you don't like store A, its a skip and a hop to store B,C,D and E. Try not to give them a reason to go to one of the other places, you want them throwing their money at YOUR store. 

Some managers take this a whole lot father then others, but that's a manager by manager basis. 

And if your uncertain of something, ask your boss or a experienced employee. Its infinitely better to be the guy who asks a lot of questions than the guy who fucks up frequently. 

Oh. And get plenty of rest before black Friday, and do not drink or get shitfaced on Thanksgiving. Trust me. You can wait till after black Friday to party, because that 24 hours will be 3x harder than any other day in the two weeks leading up to or following.

morgueanna,"Leave early every day. If you've never had to be at a retail establishment at a certain time during the holidays, you have no idea how busy it is. You will need to fight traffic, find parking, and maneuver your way through lines of waiting shoppers.

So in regards to this (if this happens at your store): Stick with that person. The manager assigned you to them for a reason. Sure, you might wanna ghost the young hot blonde instead, but they likely won't teach you as much as the person your manager intended for you to follow. And if you do have issues with whoever you're supposed to be learning from, speak to management. 

As an example, last christmas, a young girl we'll call Giggles was told to follow me around. Giggles preferred to follow my large, tattooed male coworker around. He didn't know a huge amount about half the store, has been known to be rude sometimes, etc etc. Needless to say she didn't learn enough by the time Christmas hit.

And just on one last note (mostly because it's a pet peeve): if you ask a more experienced coworker a question, DO NOT just dump the customer on them and leave. Stick around and listen to the answer.

But also, don't let customers get to you.

make friends with your co-workers, especially the ones who have been there for a while. they're the ones who the managers will talk to when it comes to determining who stays and who goes because they are the ones who actually interact with you. a smile will go a long way, inviting them over for beer after work will go even longer. 

relax! you're learning and doing the best you can. if someone gives you a correction don't get upset or argue. listen and do it, or if you KNOW it's wrong, ignore them. have confidence in your work, most likely they don't have you doing anything you can mess up /that/ badly, and even if they do, it's only a seasonal retail job. you will go on to bigger and better things.

also, as someone who started off as a seasonal hire in a department store, most customers are not as crazy as they sound here. of course you will get one or two, sometimes even several in one day, but most of the time you'll have perfectly bland, boring customers that make zero impression because your interaction will go so smoothly.

NO FISHING IN THE COMPANY POND. DON'T DIP YOUR PEN IN THE INKWELL AT WORK. 

It's always a spectacularly bad idea. Ninety percent of the time it causes flaming explosions of problems. Retail and Restaurants always get incestuous because of the odd hours and close contact. You seem to mesh with someone so well and then the Stockholm syndrome wears off and you realize you may not be as compatible as you thought. You wind up spending your time outside of work **talking about work.** Christ. 

If you're into casual hookups, you should be intelligent enough to do it with people you're not likely to see **all week long** because otherwise you're gonna have to bag groceries or some shit next to someone you've boned, and it's mostly gonna be awkward. Plus if you do this more than once you get to experience the pleasure of being dubbed the town bicycle. Watch respect plummet and creepy comments from unattractive coworkers commence! Woohoo! 

That being said, it's the ten percent of the time that it does work that makes you soppy and stops you from thinking clearly. Your lives get sympatico and you fall into a comfortable groove.

Well after a while we notice that dude is gone and our boss was calling us out back. Apparently dude called corporate and claimed we refused his return.

Me: They are by the front door when you walk in. (Now gtfo!)

I hate that loom with all of my being. Overpriced plastic crap. It's a fad that will be gone after New Years. I can't even get work done without someone yelling and asking where it is every 15 minutes. 

I will be giving them my two weeks here soon. I have tons of stories after two years of being there. I will be out before this Thanksgiving come hell or high water.

Thing is, when we scanned the membership card, we could see literally EVERY purchase you've made, and how much you spend per month.

We recently had a change in policy to where we were required to charge for ice. (some customers would grab a cup from the back and fill it with ice, we charged 54 cents for that for a while. If they brought in their own cup the ice was free so some people took advantage of that and would fill up their coolers).

We had this old lady who has no car and always walks to our store. The first day we started charging for the ice she came in with a 1 gallon picture and filled it to the top. When told it would cost her 0.54 she instantly stood up straight and puffed up then yelled at my coworker, ""i buy $45 a month here in gas and I will never come back!""

How is no one keying on the last line of dialogue.

Seriously this is the most ridiculous response I have ever seen by a manager in this sub.  And that is a massive accomplishment.

Let me spell it out for people who may have missed this part of the story.

She got a refund WITHOUT ANY PROOF OF PURCHASE WHATSOEVER.  And I don't mean just a reciept.  **As it is written** she came in without the box, the used product, or a reciept and walked out with a refund for apparently nothing.... did her receipt read as a petty cash withdrawl or something?

Forget the fact that she bought fireworks and didn't realize that they made noise.  Forget the fact that they were launched illegally. Forget everything else.  The manager handed her money for no reason at all other than to get her out of his face.  How in hell do you explain that to the owner.  ""Yea  boss I flipped her a 20 because she was yelling real loud... no she didn't actually have a reciept or any proof whatsoever that we had ever sold her anything, but it totally got her out of my face""

I would have laughed her out of the store.",null,3,cd8ehbb,1pzo42,talesFromRetail,hot,1

SonGoku9000,"&gt; I know this isn't explicitly retail but I would love to share this good ol' story of mine as I procrastinate writing a really boring paper.

&gt; I worked a couple years ago as a lifeguard at an indoor pool facility. The facility consists of a ""leisure"" pool  that never gets deeper than 4'6"", has a waterslide, etc., a lap pool for exercise, a sauna and a hot tub. IIRC it was a Sunday which means there was no executive staff (""Aquatics Director"") and the Head Guard on shift was on break, he was pretty handsome and off flirting with one of the cute girls working at the front desk. 

&gt; Anyways there were two guards on duty, I was assigned to watch the lap pool, sauna, and hot tub while the other guard watched the leisure pool. While walking around scanning the area I came across a man in the hot tub who had his face submerged in the water for an extended period of time. THIS IS A HUGE RED FLAG, for obvious and not so obvious reasons. So when I get around to the hot tub I tap him with my rescue tube and explain to him the several rules he's violating and he seems cool with it and I return to pacing around the pool rethinking my decisions in life. 

&gt; When I get back around to where he is, he stops me. ""I don't understand why I can't just put my face in the water."" 

&gt; I explain to him, ""well sir, when I see someone laying face first in the water I assume that something is wrong, regardless of how deep the water is. A lot of people like to come in here after they work out and they are prone to losing consciousness, especially in hot water, with steamy, humid air."" ""Yea but I pay a lot of money to use this place, I should be able to do what I want."" ""I understand sir, but these rules are here for your safety and the safety of others,"" that's when I uttered every underlings favorite words, ""would you like to discuss this with my supervisor"" of course he agreed. 

&gt; Now I think it's important at this point to explain that this fucker was MASSIVE like, probably ex marine huge and I am the typical gawky awkward swimmer with a tiny ass waist, no fat and lean muscle. I can barely do a pull up but I have a breast stroke that would knock your socks off, but I digress. So I wait until I am relieved then I go and try and find the Head Guard, let's call him Roman. 

&gt; So Roman is a huge ass motherfucker that left about a month after this incident to become a cop. I explain to him this asshat's inability to comprehend something that most 12 year olds don't have to be told twice to not do. So I'm relieved of any responsibility to enjoy my break by eating Ritz and peanut butter (fuck yea). After a minute or so I hear elevated voices. 

&gt; So I step outside and the asshat is beet red and Roman is chill as cucumber (fuck yea veggie analogies). ""I pay 100 fucking dollars a month, I should be able to do whatever the fuck I want."" Roman keeps his cool and explains what I already told him. ""I won't listen to some little shit telling me what to do"" as he says this he jabs his finger towards me and in his eyes I saw the pure fury and rage that is steroid abuse. 

&gt; Eventually he calms down and the rest of the story was retold to me as I wasn't involved in the rest of the deliberations. Long story short, this guy gets taken off the premises, handcuffed and in the back of a squad car. He is banned from all locations of this HUGE INTERNATIONAL non-profit fitness centers, and if he ever trespasses he will promptly be arrested.

They would turn it into a competition between the restaurants, to see which restaurant could get the most donations, and the winning restaurant was supposed to get a $150 Visa gift card to be used toward a party for the employees of the winning franchise, as a way of saying thanks for the hard work.

Well, when I worked there, that store won the competition, and got the most donations in the state. Cool for the kids the charity helps. However, when the franchise owner received the gift card prize, we peons saw nothing. No party, no appreciation, not even a ""Thanks everybody, great job."" 

So, the next year, they started up the fundraiser again. I refused to sell their thingamies. The manager came to me, and told me I **had** to sell them. I told them I would do no such thing, because the last time they screwed us over. Even though we had won the competition, we never got to enjoy the prize because the owner stuck it in his own pocket. The owner was, and still is, a greedy prick.

I don't have an issue with making a donation to help the kids. I even took $20 from my own pocket, and gave it as a donation to their charity, not through that franchise, but directly. I didn't want the aforementioned greedy asshat getting credit for the donation. I was simply refusing to help the management pocket another prize that us minimum wage slaves busted our tails to earn.

NDWolfwood5268,"Your story reminds me of this from when I was in high school. Not retail at all, but more of a rant about my teacher. 

----------------

I had a bitch of a teacher in high school. I had gym right before her class so I would arrive smelling of a mix of sweat and whatever deodorant I attempted to conceal the smell with. I know, not perfect, but what can you do?

Apparently someone complained as she pulled me aside one day and brought it up directly. I'm not a dirty guy, I just sweat a LOT when I work out. Well, she said I should do something about it. Maybe shower before heading to class.

My HS was huge. If I recall, it's the biggest in my state and one of the biggest (top 10 maybe, definitely top 20) in the nation. We had like 5 minutes before class and, depending on where you were, you may have had to assume a light jog to make it there on time. And this teacher was a Nazi when it came to being on time. 10 seconds was too late for her. 

So I asked ""So, will you let me be late to class every day this semester so I can have time to shower before arriving?"" Of course not. So there was nothing I could do. She had to put up with it, and I just tried to cover myself in that shitty axe spray even though I hated it. I figured maybe it would get her or whatever classmate I had off my back about it.

Almost like a fairy tale about the ugly duckling, except this one stunk."")In the first office where I worked with this company, we had an employee who was not always that concerned with personal hygiene. Usually he was bearable, but he had a hobby farm, and some days he would come straight in without bothering to hit the shower or change his clothes. Really nice and bright fellow, but he acted like soap was kryptonite.   

He showed up for work one afternoon smelling particularly ripe, and people were giving his desk a wide berth until the Chief Clerk finally decided that he'd had enough. He marched over to the desk of the malodorous one and said, ""Jesus Christ you stink! Go home and take a shower you fucking pig.""  

The guy thought he was joking, and stated to laugh but the CC cut him off.  

""I'm serious; you smell like shit. What the hell is wrong with you coming in to work like that?""  

While I would *like* to say that for the rest of his days he came in smelling of lavender and roses, he still had his rancid days, but never as gag-worthy as that afternoon. Sometimes a direct approach is the way to go.",null,1,cd8aphd,1q1lk4,talesFromRetail,hot,12

Bad odors permeated the work area. On days when I knew I'd be alone in the office I'd smuggle a bottle of febreeze in and hit the chairs and carpets.

But then we got new office chairs. And I pretended the one that she loved hurt my back, so we got two office chairs. Now she has hers, I have mine, and we swap the chairs out when we need to swap work stations. Things have improved a lot. 

She seems to be taking a slight interest in her appearance more now, too. The hair looks washed a little more frequently, some of the clothes are new. The body odor hasn't been so bad lately.

So for hygiene you document. Sounds creepy but record what she's wearing and it's condition. Comes back from lunch with a stain on her shirt and you see the same stain two days later when she wears it again, almost certainly hasn't been washed. Hair greasy, probably not been washed.

Health is harder and easier to talk to them about. It's possible she has a condition that causes an odor. This kind of thing happens with some diabetics. So you say that there have been some complaints about her body odor and you are concerned there might be a medical reason behind it as you are sure she's bathing, washing clothes etc because she's same grown woman (reverse psychology) and you would hate for her to lose her job over it. Strongly suggest she go see a doctor because her health is very important. Document all of it. If the odor continues have another talk and ask if she went to the doctor, be more insistent she go. Document, run it up to HR. Point out to them that if it's not medical it's a possible health hazard and certainly hostile to the other staff.

AwkwardBurritoChick,"In having to deal with elders that are apt to take out their fury on you, when you are trying to help them, and resort to being threatened, insulted, and being told you're ""inferior"" the method I use, is to simply hear them out, keep calm, realize they are pissed at life and the world, and not you.. keep your demeanor and let them state their grievances.  Once they state what they are upset about simply repeat their complaint and then state you appreciate their feedback, will pass the information on to upper management and then shut it down by asking if there was anything else you can help them with.  They usually don't, and if they do, repeat process and inform appropriate parties...  Many people when you reiterate, even verbatim their complaint they are mortified when they hear their own words.

In my experience this will diffuse about 85% of the situation as some people, especially elders, just want to be heard and acknowledged and know their bitch rants are usually about minimal things.  To thank them for the feedback and to state to them that they were heard and you'll bring up for consideration usually is enough.  

There is the other 15% that will push a stupid bitch rant to upper, and you then let your supervisor or manager about it after you tell the client/customer/person know you are doing as such. It's also okay to politely say, when you are sure of policy to inform them ""if you don't mind, this is out of my authority and you may contact soandso, however, they like me, are upheld to the same policies I've described.  Yet if there is anything that can be done, they'll be better able to inform you of alternatives that I may not be aware or authorized to grant towards a remedy that you are seeking.""

The biggest key to dealing with customers, especially elders is that they are usually so cranky that they have chased off family and friends, and so they victimize anyone and everyone they can to assert their dominance. 

Never......ever....argue....back with these people. Ever.  Again, just take the information in, pass and defer it upwards, and again, keep professional no matter what....and if your organization does allow customers to be abusive, threaten you, then there is a huge issue with management. You don't need to seek a new job to avoid such customers, you need to work for an organization and company that knows how to deal with these abusive people. Being old or elderly is not a pass to being abusive and if you have a meeting, state that if these type of customers are put in touch with upper management that you can no longer work in a hostile work environment.  

Yeah, I went there.... because if your clients or customers are that belligerent towards you, that is a hostile work environment and most illegal, and  your company/organization should address.   No one... and legally upheld, should not work in an environment with hostility and harassment. Internally and externally.  If your company allows this person to ever return to your company again, I'd seek a lawyer.   The customer isn't always right, and there are many laws as to working in a harassment free environment.   Your uppers and managers should ensure these aspects for many legal reasons.

harpyranchers,"There are customer service jobs that can be wonderful, or at least tolerable.  I work in phone based IT support and believe me we get customers who get out of line.  The key difference is we have great management and supervisors who will go to bat for us.  If customer interaction rises to the level of abuse we are allowed to refuse service.  If this becomes a regular occurrence, customers are returned their service contract fee and invited to never bother us again.

I've worked other places where things are very different, the customer is king and given a depute you will get thrown under the bus first.  This is intolerable, soul crushing and I am sorry you have to put up with it.  In my opinion this is a huge problem in the service industry where policy allows lower level employees to be punching bags, who are in turn then punished because they had the misfortune of dealing with an uncivilized human being.

I worked there for like 5 years, and ended up as the store managers #2, right hand lady, so it's not like I was just some part time dummy. Our return policy on CDs was if it's open, then you're SOL. So this older lady comes in with this open cd, ranting and raving that it has inappropriate lyrics, because it said something about Jesus rock star or something, I dunno, it was some Japanese band I had never heard of, but the lady was pissed that it was sacrilegious or something, and wanted to return. I kindly explain the return policy, and she goes off again about how she didn't know it was inappropriate. I pointed out the parental advisory sticker, and explained that CDs once opened can't be returned, not only because they can't be resold, but also because they could be copied and then returned. (I was careful with the wording not to imply her precious little snowflake would do that).

So it goes back and forth a couple more times, my manager comes over, and says he'll take over. This lady looks down on me, and says ""finally, someone who understands"" (should note, I was a teenager while my manager was in his 20s, not exactly a huge age advantage over me but whatever). So he listens to her, and says hell do the return. She gives me the smuggest look ever and I just want to punch her in the face.

So after she leaves I actually confronted my manager and was like wtf? So he says he knows it's against policy, but sometimes it's worth it to keep a customer coming back.

Then he called me up and I pulled out my computer, explained the problem I was having, and explained the few things I'd done to troubleshoot it. I'm not good with computers but I know enough about them that I can usually discern where in the computer the problem might be located given the issues I'm having with it.

walloftext-no,"&gt; Sorry for the wall of text!

THIS is a wall of text. Make a note.

&gt;Little bit of background: I work at a campus IT place, where we're registered with Apple to repair their systems. We do out of warranty repair, too, but that tends to cost money...since the system is out of warranty, after all. This is good, because a lot of kids on campus use Apple computers - and very few of them know how to fix anything. In particular, given our location, this means a lot of older folks from departments and a lot of greek life. This story is about a very loud member of the latter. Cast: Twoface, the girl who came in - TF for short. M, the coworker with me at the time. B, my supervisor. And lastly, me. WARNING: This story contains harsh language, given the language this customer used. (Also I curse like a sailor) My apologies.   Me: Hi, how can I help you today?    TF: OH MY GOD. I'm freaking out right now. I promise you I'm just going to like freak out [I swear I'm actually making this less stereotypical]. My computer is, like, fucked.    Me: Well, if you have it with you, we can take a look at it. What kind of computer is it?(At this point, I look her up and down. Workout clothes, bright neon shoes, tight yoga pants, North face jacket, school-branded and sorority-branded JanSport backpack. I know it's a mac.)   TF: [as she takes out her macbook from her backpack] It's a mac. Do you guys fix macs??? Please help me!    Me: [staying calm, since that usually helps stressed out customers. Ignoring the multiple plaques and displays showing that we are Apple affiliated, and the two giant pillars behind her with Apple logos] Yes, we do actually. Let me take a look - what seems to be the problem? TF now goes on a good five minute long rant about how her computer just crashed on her and it totally wasn't her fault. At this point, she hasn't let me ask a single question.    TF: So then the computer restarted and it was just a flashing question mark! [at this point, she's noticeably calmed down - I'm thinking I'm in the clear!]
   Me: (this only occurs if 1. the HDD experienced a complete mechanical failure, or 2. the flex cable's bad. It's almost always 2, especially without any loud clicking occuring) Well, luckily it's probably a pretty simple fix - this issue is normally the flex cable going bad. This fix is pretty cheap if that is the case, but there's the chance it's the hard drive that's bad. We'd need to check it in for testing, if that's okay. We'll contact you as soon as we know what the repair options are.
    TF: YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT? I NEED IT BACK TODAY [we close in an hour and a half]. UGH. Okay. When can I find out what's wrong with it?
    Me: I'll start testing on it immediately. We should be able to contact you in two days by the latest, but could have an answer by tomorrow late afternoon. If you want to and you haven't been called, come in tomorrow at around 4:00 PM or call, and we can give you an update.
Paperwork gets signed, she leaves. She was actually not awful by the end of it, having calmed down a bit. M is confused as to why she seemed so agitated, but was helping his own people and we kind of just laughed it off.
NEXT DAY: TF suddenly barges in at 1:30 PM demanding for her computer back. This part is hearsay, but three sources gave me really similar information - I had left just a half hour earlier:    TF: IS MY COMPUTER DONE YET???
    M: Sorry, but what is your name?
    TF: TWOFACE McCUNTOCTOPUS YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS.
    M: I'm sorry, Ms. McCuntoctopus, let me check the paperwork right now...well it looks like your system finished testing for tier one (I finished it that morning), and it's currently finishing testing in the back. [Begins to radio the back for information on the testing - we don't always have life updates on the system until testing is finished]
    TF: WHY DON'T YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS IS YOUR JOB
    M: [after getting a response from the back] Well, it looks like your flex cable is in need of replacement - your hard drive came up fine and testing with other hard drives showed the cable was faulty. We'll need to order one. That'll be here tomorrow if we get your okay, and it's $35 for the part and $20 for installa-
    TF: YOU MEAN I HAVE TO PAY?
    M: Well, yes ma'am, given that you're out of warranty.
    TF: WHAT THE FUCK, THE ASSHOLE YESTERDAY DIDN'T SAY I HAD TO PAY.
    M: Actually, right here on the paperwork you signed off on it being an out of warranty repair and agreeing to it being a charge. It also says so in our Work Agreement, which is right above your signature in bold.
    TF: WHAT THE HELL, THIS IS BULLSHIT. THAT GUY YESTERDAY WAS LITERALLY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD. HE NEVER EVEN TOLD ME I GET CHARGED FOR THIS, I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IF HE TOLD ME I GOT CHARGED FOR THIS [well, actually, it's on the paperwork TWICE that she was going to be charged for this repair a minimum of $20 for the diagnostic, which is waved if we do any repairs. I read it out to her out loud before having her sign]. I WANT HIM FIRED. HE WAS LITERALLY THE WORST HELPER I'VE EVER MET.
    M: Are we...are we talking about the same person? I was here when you were checked in, and he went through all of the procedure with you. He even pushed you up the queue given you had stated it was an emergency and seemed distressed.
    TF: THAT'S IT, I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR.
At this point, my super comes out - a bigger guy who hasn't really worked a supervisor's position before this and is EXTREMELY new. Also kind of a huge accidental/sarcastically accidental dick a lot of the time. Poor guy wasn't ready.
    TF: YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIBLE, THEY'RE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR A REPAIR THAT SHOULD BE FREE.
    B: Ma'am, they're just doing your job. And I have it right here on my paperwork that you agreed to paying for the system repairs or diagnostic.
    TF: WELL FUCK YOU FAGGOT [this didn't blow over well, given my supervisor is actually gay] I DIDN'T AGREE TO SHIT. I WANT MY COMPUTER BACK.
Sadly, having missed this, this apparently became a giant screaming match - one sided, really. B kept trying to explain to her that literally no one would do this cheaper, and taking it to the Apple store will net the same result and require driving. He gave up after a few minutes, though.
    B: Well, if you want your system back right now I can pack it up immediately, but it'll still be the $20 for diagnostics before we can release to you. [This caused more of the exact same argument, and then she began yelling about me needing to be fired again, and that he should be fired as well, and that M should be fired. Basically, this girl wanted our whole department gone.]
    TF: [finally giving up] FINE. I'll just take it to Apple then! They'll do a better job.
After a bit more cussing at us, she finally pays the $20 and goes to Apple. B, having worked at the Apple store, notes that the girl just wasted well over $100 extra - the fix from us would have taken just one day longer (would have been done day after all this) and she would have only needed to pay $35 more for all her issues to be solved.
People are so...odd sometimes.
Sorry for the wall of text!
TL;DR: Some girl doesn't listen to what she's signing to, requests for a whole department to be fired, and then goes on to end up spending hundreds more than needed.

SanityInAnarchy,"&gt; Basically, you tell the operator whatever you’d like to say, making sure to speak slowly. The operator types your end of the conversation on a keyboard, and then sends it to the hearing impaired user. The user then reads the message, types in their reply, and sends it back to the operator. The operator then reads the reply back to you.

This is not the only way this can work. In at least one state, the operator is using speech-recognition software. Since that's most effective when it's trained to a specific person's voice, it still makes sense for there to be a human operator there.

Also, hearing-impaired doesn't necessarily mean they can't talk. My grandmother has been slowly going deaf, so she uses this, lip-reading, and she can probably hear some bits of conversation as well.

The net result is that *sometimes,* systems like this can be so close to a normal conversation that you forget there's an operator involved.",null,0,cd9bxde,1q3l7r,talesFromRetail,hot,4

When I worked at the game store we got a lot of TDD calls because of a nearby school. 

I'm kind of a communication junkie and have found I have an ability to represent concepts to people when we only share a common pidgin and actual language is limited.

She gets her receipt and reads it and notices that she has been charged and extra dollar and something.

So she asks, politely, why the extra charge. The cashier explains it is because of the meat on her sandwich. My friend points out that on the large menu it is such and such a price and the cashier responds with something along the lines of ""Yes, but there is meat on it, so it is extra.""

My friend is, understandably, a bit peeved about this. She and the cashier go around and around for a couple minutes before she finally gets aggravated enough to exclaim loudly for all to hear ""I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I AM PAYING EXTRA FOR THE MEAT ON A MEAT SANDWICH!!!""

When I started googling stuff about the pet I'd bought, I was shocked at everything I'd need. I needed an MVB bulb ($50) instead of a $7 heating lamp. He'd need a temperature gradient, at least 3 times the space of the tank, and a spot to hide. He'd need enough substrate to burrow himself completely. I couldn't use sand because he could get impacted. And I most certainly could NOT feed him pellets.

&gt;So I've been a little down lately and works been a little stressful I just thought I would share a bit of a feel good story from last week.  So usually I'm the opening manager at the coffee establishment I work at but lately I've been scheduled to be the closing manager.   I'm not that keen on closing but I look at it as a way to better my managing skills.  So usually I'm known as the manager that you can tell anything and I'll help you in any way I can.  I like for everyone to be happy and smile when they're at work but for some reason this story made me happy when I think about it.

&gt;So one of the girls who works for us has some medical problems and some times she gets sick for no reason and has to go to the hospital and last Thursday that happened.  She had to call out bc she was in the hospital and for some reason that makes other shift managers and the store manager a little annoyed. I don't bc I feel bad for her about it.  So when I walk in last Friday before my shift starts I see her working the espresso bar and she's got a mad look and I ask her how she's feeling she says in a grumpy mean way, ""I'm fine I just...ugh fine what do you want"" I go oh ok well just let me know if you need anything and I walk away.

&gt;So I clock in talk to the mid day manager and see what he missed or forgot to do so I know where to start and help take over and another one of my closer clocked on to so my first action was to take off the girl who was sick( well call her feel better FB) and so when she heard me say that she looked at me and I pull her to the side and go, ""I know you don't feel good right now I'm sorry so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let you float around, stock us up with milk and I know how you like to clean so don't worry about a single customer just clean, stock, and do your thing and if you need to sit down do it I won't ask where you are or anything and if ican get my major closing duties done I will send you home early.  But first go take your ten minute break.""

&gt;You could see the stress and pressure go off her face she didn't stop thanking me.  She came back from her break and I asked how she felt and FB says, ""thank you for actually caring about how I feel bc no one did today and the smell of the gingerbread made me feel worse and it's so busy and I'm just...""  She started to cry a bit so I gave her a hug and said hey it's ok were gonna have a good night.  After that she had a smile and was laughing and joking and was working hard.

&gt;It just made me feel good that someone went from being in a bad bad mood to happy and with all that's happening in my personal life it just makes me happy to be able to put that smile on peoples faces.  I hope y'all enjoyed my feel good story for the day :-P

Years ago, when I was pregnant with my son and for about the first 2 years of his life until I decided to become a SAHM, I worked for a mall food court fast food joint.

Now the general mgr there (also part owner, FTR) was the biggest jerk I'd ever encountered. It was rare (even when I had a dr's note while I was pregnant) to get breaks, even for 5 min to run down the hall to use the bathroom. It wasn't uncommon to work an 8-10 hr shift without so much as a drink of fucking water. 

The ONE time I decided to report him to corporate, I was told ""Oh he's a franchisee. We can't do anything!"" and after I called, we had a store meeting where he told us that SOMEBODY (and he looked right at me, so I'm assuming corp told him who it was even though I requested to make an anonymouse complaint) had ratted him out to corp. and he was NOT very happy about it.

Turns out super hadn't even known they got back in line, and went to talk to them. He didn't kick them out but made it clear that they had to follow the rules.

So passive aggressive wife stomps past our till holding up cash, asking 'cash is okay, right?' in *that* voice. I looked her in the eye and said 'yes, that's what we told you to pay with.'

Later she stormed up to me and shoved a cheque in my face, screaming 'hey lady, see, my husband's name in on the account, blah blah blah. I saw you go tell your supervisor we got back in line you little tattle-tale blah blah blah.' I gave her a huge smile and shouted 'have a nice day, ma'am!' she snarled 'yeah, you too!' then went off to scream at another supervisor.

A coworker told me later that she saw the bitch shove the cheque in my face and told our manager; the second my manager heard that someone had been getting up in my face, she rocketed over to where the bitch was screaming at my super, and essentially told her to shut the hell up, in a very diplomatic way.",null,10,cd9e8v6,1q54dq,talesFromRetail,hot,36

For your particular department, that list could include how much shipment was received and at what time, how many boxes were emptied, basically how much work was received versus *finished*. Then before the back room person leaves, the MOD has to walk it, *look at that fucking mess*, and accept responsibility for it by signing that duty sheet with their own initials saying they saw it that way and it's fine.

Fine. We suspended the transaction, which means we did not charge her (No pin number. No signature. No receipt. Nothing.) 

She goes to pay. Declined. Three times. She is pissed,calling me a thief. A liar. Calls her bank complaining about me. Demands I speak to him. He goes to explain that with her card it's pre-authorized for $x, which they release to us,if we accept it we get the money.

 If in 3-5 days we dont accept it, it is accessible by her once more. Sucks, but thats the CC company, not our store. She keeps yelling ""Refund me my money"" I keep repeating ""See this 'suspended transaction' receipt!? Where it says ""not a proof of sale""!? We didn't get this money. I can't refund money we did not receive!"" 

She did everything from claim I don't know the difference between debit/credit/cash, to insist I was pocketing the money (Is that possible? Like in an ""Office Space"" way?), to telling the other people in line we steal money. 

This goes back and forth for twenty. Damn. Minutes. Demands I get the manager. I love this part. ""I am the manager."" Finally the guy from the bank breaks it down, insists it wasn't me..but them... she slinked off with a mumbled ""I'll come back in 3-5 days then.."" Sweet as pie. As if nothing happened. 

Happy Holidays!

AAAAARGH! I've encountered that one as well! 

What are you, Elvis? Unless I see a gaggle of teeny boppers screaming your name in the parking lot, you don't get to set the store hours to suit your whims.

I had a video store custy that thought he was clever coming in right before close to try and snag new releases as they were returned just before the deadline.

Had he just grabbed a copy of **Turner and Hooch II: Still Hoochin'** and been on his way, I would have been fine with it. But he would grab a copy of everything new off the sorting table, bring them to the register, and proceed to play twenty questions.

**Jerkface:** What about this one? What are people saying?

**Me:** Well, the reviews have been positive, but it's a loud dumb action movie, and I know the last film like that you rented made you unhappy. (I know this because he told me, in great detail, eating up another ten minutes of close)

**Jerkface:** Yeah, but it's supposed to be good. It's got that guy from that thing. Should I get it?

**Me:** I really don't think you'll enjoy it.

**Jerkface:** Yeah, okay. What about this one? What are people saying about *it*?

And so on, and so on. For a dozen titles. Then it gets ridiculous.

After he got his new releases, he would ***browse the shelves.***

All the track lighting would be off, neon extinguished, doors locked, and all we could do was run a vacuum or get trash because we couldn't close out the system until Jerkface got his tapes.

He finally pushed me too far with that happy crappy when after three warnings that we *had* to get out, as we were no longer being paid, he was still browsing twenty five minutes after close.

I opened the breaker box and flipped off every Goddamn light in the joint. The CRT at the register was like a lighthouse beacon trying to draw the SS Jerkface off the ragged rocks of the rugged island of My Last Nerve. 

He went ape poopy. Subtlety is not my forte and plunging him into darkness was a pretty obvious slight. 

I eventually heard flack about it from higher up, but I diagrammed out the cost of keeping the store open for one renter, pointed out the policy disconnect going on, and reminded them that I wasn't receiving due compensation when I had to stay past my scheduled hours.

Moolooman,"Graphic Novel!!

TLDR for below: love your work, the characters great, it would be awesome to have a graphic novel of these stories. 

I know I'm late to the party on this story and my comment will probably get lost in the morass of comments you receive, but I thought I should say, just in case you happen to look over here, that I love reading your stories and I really enjoy imagining the characters you talk about.

Every time I read one of your vignettes I'm struck by how great the characters are and how easy it is to picture a caricature of the particular customer you are describing. 

If you found some clever illustrator who specialises in gnarly people (I keep imagining your customers looking like the puppets out of an old British show called Spitting Image, but that's just me) you could have a fantastic collection for a graphic novel. Release them for the iPad and I'd subscribe (so you'd have one customer...). 

Weird thing for me is that I'm not even slightly artistic and am only mildly enthusiastic about graphic novels, it's just that there's something very unique and visually interpretable about the stories you tell.

When I worked at the pretentious place (I keep coming back to it, so I'm gonna call it [Les Pantalons Fancie](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100126003945/americandad/images/1/12/Fancy_pants.jpg) from now on) the restaurant was located in the ground floor of a very spendy condo block. Many of the residents were regular diners. Old Rich Lady problems abounded. 

There was one old bat named Mrs Schitt who seemed particularly fond of disemboweling the help. She was often critical of changes she requested be made.

*""Well why on Earth would you do THAT?*

..umm, you just asked me to?

Her frequent dining companions were her husband and daughter. Her husband had a near crippling stroke and had only partial control of one arm. The daughter had severe MS and aside from poor motor control was like a twisted Shrinky Dink copy of her mother. Every visit was a nightmare. So many servers had been reduced to tears. The first time I got stuck with them I was shitting myself. Schitt gave me the ~~stink~~ stench eye and belittled me. I found out later she gave my boss hell about my haircut, but didn't have anything bad to say about the service.

I was now assigned to them. Oh God.

They would nickle and dime everything on every visit but as long as they coughed up full fare, the boss didn't give a shit about how nasty they were. They could have two free half ounce sides of every sauce on the menu for free, but any more and he demanded a few quarters. So you would have to bring them a whole tray of assorted ramekins.

The husband and daughter required food cut into bite sizes. Special drinking ware was used. The daughter was dismissive and hateful and liked to fling things onto the carpet.

I once brought out a salad with a slice of cucumber on it to the husband. He began to quiver. His mouth seized and drool leapt out. His one good hand was fluttering wildly at the wrist. He hated cucumber like people hate Hitler and his broken body was the only thing stopping him from going apeshit. Mrs Schitt put it together and began screeching as I darted across the restaurant with the offensive vegetable.

That night I was confabing with the bartender when I imagined the life that this woman had. Her needs were met, she was being kept well, but those closest to her were severely disabled. Her husband, her partner, this captain of industry, reduced to this quivering mass that shits itself. Her daughter, twisted physically and emotionally with a bent soul that bears it's mothers fingerprints. 

I would be desperately controlling as well. I would be relentlessly angry because I would see the pity in other's eyes and I would rage at the indignity. I could empathize.


Then the barman dropped the science on me.

He had been there for ages. They were always shitty people. The husband had been the shittiest, throwing food that displeased him and once pouring coffee on a server. He did so much shouting that when a gasket blew and he stroked out everyone kind of saw it coming. The women were always needlessly cruel and demanding.

They were just shitty people being shitty.

Then the started with the wordless screaming. Just shrieking at the top of her lungs. I hung up on her, because fuck that.

When I answered the call today, I reminded her of that fact and her exact response was ""You should just fucking hire me and change someone else's hours"". Right..... So, drop the f-bomb to your potential boss (for a customer service position no less) and demand that an employee that has been with the store since it has been opened to change her hours.

Stacking hay/lumber/firewood/fake Christmas trees.

You've been doing home renovations.

You work for an exterminator and you've been under a house.

LadyGrizabella,"There's been a rumor the last week or so that my hubby's store is going to be open all day Thanksgiving Day this year. 

Grr.
I *told* him last year when they opened at midnight on Thanksgiving Night/Black Friday morning that it wouldn't be long until they opened on Thanksgiving Day. I didn't expect it to be THIS year though. &gt;_&lt; 

And people wonder why I'd LOVE to see every holiday abolished. Holidays mean exactly zip anymore..you put a holiday on the calendar and it's just an excuse to go crazy spending money because everybody and their dog is having a sale.

I already had an intense dislike for the ""holiday season"" because of my years both working retail and dating/being married to a man who has been a retail manager for the last 17 years. This rumor (which is probably going to turn out to be true, we won't know for another couple of weeks) doesn't help things any.

In addition to having to deal with a pissed off husband, I'm going to have to deal with pissed off parents--both sets. My mom is STILL mad at us from last year when I told her I just was NOT going to let Hubby wear himself out doing TWO Thanksgivings (lunch at my mom's at 12:30 or so, then dinner with his parents at around 6) when he had to go into work at 10 pm that night. My MIL will probably be a bit more understanding, but I doubt it. After all it isn't just Thanksgiving, but Hubby's birthday falls on the Weds before this year. So she won't get to see him and lavish him with turkey and pie and presents like she usually gets to do on Thanksgiving.

I just keep telling myself to hang in there a LITTLE bit longer. He's very nearly through with his 2 yr degree and going on to a 4 yr place as a Jr. hopefully within a year. So at minimum, assuming he gets a job straight off of finishing his 4 yr degree, I've only got to put up with this for 3 more years. I've put up with it this long, every year getting worse and worse.

Miaoudeminou,"Yeah I had issues with the break room at the same big retailer.   

Mine had to do with the break room being two rooms. One was the main break room that most people sat in. Then there was the smaller one which had a door because it used to be the smoking room (with ventilation) before laws were passed stating you couldn't smoke inside a building. I too liked to read while on break but sitting in the larger of the two break rooms lead to people coming to talk to me or ask me questions about my book while I was reading. So I removed myself and ended up sitting in the smaller break room. Which at first was fine and everyone left me alone. Then we had an associate switch locations to the one I was working at. She decided she was queen bee and everything was hers. She would purposely be in the small break room during my breaks and talk as loudly as she could on her phone. Which would force me into the large break room where everyone was shouting from one end to the other to talk to each other (seriously these people lacked inside voices). One day I didn't see this queen bee in the break room and took it upon myself to go sit in the small room. And not even five minutes later queen bee comes in chattering as loudly as she can on her phone. I ask her politely to leave because she was disturbing my quiet reading time. She wouldn't and proceeded to talk even louder. So I started loudly mocking her. Then we had a yelling contest. I finally got fed up with dealing with her dumba$$ and left the room. She made the whole ""HAHA I WIN!!!"" face at me so I flipped her off. We got called into HR to get along and she didn't bother me much after that. 

I was in my early 20's and not quite mature so I handled the whole situation the wrong way. Looking back at it many years later I realize I should have ended up eating at the fast food place I bought my food or in my car. My co-workers were jerks and lacked respect for me. Yet I was supposed to treat them with the utmost respect.   

Working that retail place was a complete joke. I wish I had never done it. It's been two years since I left but I still have a lot of social anxiety from dealing with customers, co-workers, CSM/CSSs, and management constantly berating me.",null,10,cdaf7hf,1q8pnz,talesFromRetail,hot,30

Your complaint to HR should have been that you were concerned about negative repercussions from her due to your lack of interest in Amway.  ""Can she reprimand someone if they don't purchase Amway""?  ""Can she fire someone if they don't sign up enough Amway people?""  ""Can she use Amway as a hiring tool?""  

Your bosses probably care most about sales and store work.  HR probably cares most about unjustifiable terminations (IE., being forced to pay unemployment) and problematic hiring practices.

Don't be surprised if she's still working or she's still a manager after this all settles down.  Unless it's a clear and documented violation of company policy, and that she has a poor work history already, it's unlikely HR will push for her firing.  They're much more likely to suggest that it be documented and have her reprimanded first.  I suspect it'll only be after multiple documented violations that they push for her demotion or firing.

Answer:  Smart people.    
  
Cards may end up not being accepted for all sorts of reasons, often due to nothing that the person has done at all.  It is always best to be prepared, always have an alternate form of payment available just in case.  
  
(For example, I have some cash hidden away in my car in the event of an emergency -- such as a enough for a tank of gas in case my wallet is lost/stolen.  It has also come in handy when the merchant's credit card service is not working for some reason, and I still have to pay the bill.)  ",null,6,cdaqb93,1q9n0b,talesFromRetail,hot,17
SpiderVeloce,"I am lucky I guess, in that I am able to have two separate cards on separate accounts, so if one crashes for whatever reason I can just give the other card and deal with the problem with the bank later.

That 80 dollar difference is refunded to my account 24-48 hours later, but still, its a major hassle.  There have been several times when I put gas in my car, and I KNEW I had about 90 dollars in my account.

We're also required to ask for identification if credit cards aren't signed. Most people seem really appreciative that we check such things, and we've even alerted one or two people of their accounts being used fraudulently because the voice authorizations brought up a denial code. Sure, we've had a fair share of people seem confused because they've been shopping all day and the card's worked fine until getting to our store.

What ended up working for me was diatomaceous earth (food grade NOT the kind used in pools), I put it all along the baseboards of my whole house. During the night, I put a bowl of water with a drop of dish soap and put a light over it and the fleas gladly committed suicide into the soapy water.

toomuchpapertowel,"Where I work (liquor/convenience store) we're also only supposed to keep a small amount of change in our drawer but corporate wants us to accept large bills no matter what.  Now I have no problem accepting a $100 bill for a reasonably large order but the people that come in at 7:30 am and try to buy a $.99 item with a hundred can go fuck themselves.  

Like I said, however, the higher ups want us to take it anyway.  Our store manager, on the other hand, is very much of the ""screw you we're not a bank"" mindset so as long as we handle it in a way that won't get reported to headquarters it's all good.  

The best way I've found to handle this is if your drawer isn't in a position to accommodate a large bill let the person know, ""I'm sorry I don't think I have enough to break that right now"" or ""well I can probably break that but you're going to get mostly fives and ones.""  How they respond determines how this transaction progresses.  

Many times the person will use a card or find some smaller bills.  If this is all they have and they are polite about it I can buy change from the safe with their hundred or ask another cashier if they've got some twenties, if they immediately shift into screaming dick mode then I'm sorry there is physically nothing I can do, my drawer does not have that much in it (even if it does) and you can go to any of the 3-4 banks within a five minute walk.


Edit for another frustrating story I just remembered:  Had a guy pay for two bottles of vodka, $25 purchase, with a fifty, no problem, that's reasonable.  As soon as it was complete, however, he just ""remembered"" that he needed a third.  So I ring him up for another 12 bucks and he hands me another fifty.  Nope, not happening, stare at him in exasperation for a moment then tell him that he had just cleaned me out of smaller bills with his fifty and that he was free to pay with any of the change that I knew he now had.

Pros:  

* If you can count, it's not difficult.

Cons:  

* The work locations were scattered all over the place. I didn't like driving to a different place for work every day.  

* Hours and schedules were very erratic and unpredictable.  

* A lot of the stores wanted inventory done when the store was closed, which meant you might be working 4 am to 7 am, and then somewhere else later that same day from 10 pm to midnight.  

* Grocery stores often had us do inventory during regular open hours. Having to work around shoppers while on a tight time schedule could be frustrating.  

* It's all numbers-based: how many things can you count in an hour.  Some things you can fly through, but some things (say, clothes with tags buried inside rather than hanging on the outside, so you have to fish each one out) take longer, and you end up with lower speed-ratings if you are counting that type of product.  

* Like many jobs, the written rules are directly contradicted by the verbal instructions. For instances, you are officially told to never ever estimate the number of anything, always count exactly. And yet when I was counting the candy racks at a grocery store checkout, I was scolded for actually counting each bag of M&amp;M's in the box; I was apparently supposed to pick up the box, estimate how full it was, and base the count on that (e.g., if the box felt about three-quarters full and originally had 48 packs, I should record ""36"" and move on.

The daughter was fine, had no issue with sizing (was probably a 4/6 I don't really remember), she always pulled items in the correct size, maybe occasionally needing a small instead of a medium, what have you. The mom however constantly pulled sizes much too large for her. I'm not talking one or two more, but size 10s when she was easily a 0. She would pull medium tops and they would hang on her like elephant skin and she would complain ""Oh it's much too tight."" One time we had her in the fitting room and she was acting this way, and my manager and I had discussed the possibility that she may have an eating disorder, and definitely some perception issues. We would tell her she was pulling sizes much too large, and bring her the correct sizes, and she would insist that there would be no way that they would fit her. Luckily the daughter was on our side, and would convince her to at least try. Reluctantly she would try on the clothes and would admit they fit better, but usually didn't purchase anything for herself (she bought a lot for her daughter, with or without her). Just remembering this makes me sad; she was such a nice lady but so insecure with her body. :( ",null,8,cdbk6i6,1qchcl,talesFromRetail,hot,21

This time, I couldn't take it. I walked straight up to her and said ""I know people that are actually overweight and obese. I swear, I am so sick of you skinny f*ers talking about how fat you are. You are skinny, and gorgeous and every time you say that you're fat you make everyone larger than you feel bad about themselves. Could you please shut the f* up.""

Aruu,"Ugh, I hear you on the condescending tone. I had a customer come in earlier, to complain about me apparently being rude to her. She had come in, asked for her paper (we keep some newspapers behind the counter for customers, so they can pick them up any time during the day) and I had handed it to her. End of, right? Nope, she came back in, and cornered me while I was stacking shelves. 


**Customer**: I think you were very rude to me earlier.

**Me**: .. excuse me? I'm so sorry if I came across that way.

**Customer**: Oh I know how it is, sometimes it's oh so *hard* being cheerful this time of morning. I *do* get how it must be. (note it was around 11am at this point)

**Me**: (utterly confused) Again, I am really sorry if I came across as being rude, it absolutely wasn't my intention. 

**Customer**: You *shoved* the paper at me (she mimics the action).

**Me**: (If I remember correctly, I just passed it over to her like I do with everyone else) Oh.. I'm very sorry if it came across like that, I was only handing it to you.

**Customer**: Well make sure that you *don't* do it again!

I went back and talked to my co-worker, who had also been serving at the time, and she couldn't recall me being rude either. I smiled and nodded at her request for her paper, went and got it for her, and passed it over with a 'Here you go! Can I help with anything else?' and that was *it*. My co-worker confirmed it. I guess the customer was just having a bad day and obviously saw some small slight in how I served her that she took a bit too personally. 

It's customers like that who make me want to do the 'robotic false smile' routine, because when you try and be friendly and it just gets thrown back at you, it's like.. why even try?

I can see why five star places would have extras (but you'd think they'd just bill it to your room, not give them out for free?

Okay, if I'm reading this correctly, you were never actually hired, just added to the schedule.

Working with your friend is great and all, but you need to be strident here. If the manager claims to be too busy to get your paperwork together, suggest that getting your stuff in order will actually lessen their duties because of the division of labor. Adding you is adding a body to complete tasks.

If you're responsible/dependable, you'll likely rise to the top of a disorganized/scatterbrained manager's good graces.

If she's reasonable, and you like the environment, this can lead to a relationship with the manager where, because you're such a rock on her staff, you can dictate a bit more of your own terms as far as your scheduling needs, days off, etc.

Of course, if she's not so reasonable, you can also use that to your advantage too. She just assumes you'll cover a shift you weren't scheduled for, and never informs you? Don't show up. When she confronts you about it, regional/corporate supports your side of it because your ducks are in a row.

I would stay and give it a shot, but start looking for something else ASAP. Ask to meet with the manager and discuss how your scheduling will go, what happens if it changes, how far in advance you're scheduled and if there's anywhere else you can check it (like online).

You'll still need both UV and heat lamps, replacement bulbs, varied food types because most brands are not sufficient on their own, calcium supplements, a basking area, proper substrate, etc.

jonpants,"Props to the Mom, but it is kind of sad to see this kind of good (in my opinion) parenting referred to as 'old school' because it should be the norm. I hear kids my daughter's age (7) talk back and act out towards their parents in ways that would have gotten me grounded or (god forbid!) smacked on the ass. 

It makes me feel old to say this, but the majority of young kids I see in my store have no respect or fear of their parents. Sadly, the parents don't command it either. They just give them the electronic gadget and hope they shut up. 

On the other hand, today I saw a parent *scream* at their three month old child for crying. I almost walked over and smacked the woman. I don't understand that logic - ""My infant is crying, so this loud, angry noise from me should make it stop!"" 

If I see a well behaved kid in my store, I make it a point to compliment the child and hook them up with some stickers or the like. It's awesome to see the kid get all excited because someone said they were well behaved and rewarded them for it.

I was at my dad's workplace, playing with his paperclips (ironic, right? :D) and swinging around on his chair. The window is right outside pointing to the carpark so I could get a clear view outside.

My dad yells at me telling me to go, but I don't budge. So then *his* epic parenting skills kick in, and runs to the car, and starts slowly driving off... taunting me.

Kids need to trust you. Kids also need to respect you and be certain of your consistency. Any punishment I give to my kids must have those to things as a backbone. 

Threatening to leave a child behind is never an option in my book, because either you follow through and a child will feel it can't depend on you, or you don't follow through and you're inconsistent and set an unfortunate precedent of not backing up your claims. 

Were this my kid, I'd probably have picked it up and disciplined in some other way, but never leaving behind.

I had 2 shady women come in to my pharmacy one Saturday afternoon with a prescription written for a huge quantity of oxycodone. I asked for her address to register her in the computer system. 



(A little background:

Our town has a unique name that when the automated phones say the ""thanks for calling your YOURTOWN PHARMACY"" it is pronounced wrong). 



When she gave me her address not only did she give me a PO box only zip code, but she also pronounced the CITY name wrong. Who the hell lives in our small town and doesn't pronounce it correctly?



Turns out she was part of a scam and when I called the police they investigated to find out several pharmacies in the area filled prescription narcotics for them. I'm glad I caught them. Stupid jerks.

thegleaker,"Not really retail, but...

I worked phone support at a road side assistance company. I live in the land of snow and ice (Canadia) and winters are busy times for road side assistance. We doubled the number of staff in the winter with seasonal employees. Some were good, some were bad, some didn't make it through the season, but they were all warm bodies taking phone calls, and that's what matters.

One year we hired L. She was a tall, thickly built woman in her late 30's. She was a bit slow on the uptake, but seemed capable enough. The job was just simply not that hard.

She was also a flirt. She hit on all the men on staff that were younger than her (which were numerous, many kids were students working through school). I had the misfortune of training her, and trying to deal with her lewd comments for the 4 days I was paired up with her was a challenge.

As time went on, it became apparent that she held grudges and was slightly... crazy. If you did not reciprocate her affections she got angry. Nothing outright noticeable, just the sorts of passive aggressive behaviours you might expect of someone both immature and obviously feeling rejected.

I never reciprocated. She did not like me. She hated that throughout training her advances were ignored or rejected. Things went downhill from there. She'd forget (or be indifferent to) the basic requirements of her job. People called in without being sure of where they were a lot, and she'd avoid the basic job of figuring it out. Instead of using a map, ""Where is blahlbah?"" to the call centre. ""Check the map,"" I'd say. She'd scowl, get up, find it on the map, sit back down, and go on with her job. Several times a shift she'd ask from others what she could easily find for herself.

Then came New Years Day. I was a student, working as many hours as I could to pay for school and rent. I was covering a normal full-timer shift, a 12 hour run from 6:30 am to 6:30 pm. I didn't go out the night before because I needed to work, and the sweet sweet time and a half meant a lot to me. She came in at 7:00. I ran into her before her shift started, looking bleary eyed, wrung out, hung over, and miserable, making a coffee in the kitchen. So wasn't wearing shoes.

""Socks?""

""I'm not in the mood.""

""I was just wondering what was up with you being in socks. Good night?""

""Shut up.""

Alright. I go back to my station, sit on the phones. It's New Years Day, and it's slow. No one cares about their car at 7:00 am on New Years Day. I'm getting paid to read and study. Sweet.

L comes into the call centre and sits down beside N. They start a chat. Somehow it devolves into sex and religion. They ask me my opinions. I demure. I'd rather not get into that in the office. They are free to engage in whatever conversation, I say, but I'll pass. She scowls.

A call comes in. It goes to L. She isn't sure where this person is. She asks, ""Where is blahblah?""

""Check the map.""

""You know, just tell me.""

""If you check the map, you'll learn. If I tell you, you won't. It's not hard, and it's a basic part of your job. Check the map.""

She loses it. A 6 foot tall, thickly built, hungover, raging woman in her late 30's begins to stomp around the office, swearing and screaming at me. I'm an asshole, I'm a little shit, I'm a fucking faggot, and I need to suck her dick. ""Fuck you, you little shit! Suck my dick!"" Then she storms off to the kitchen.

Silence. Her client is on hold. Every other employee sits in the office, jaws hanging open. The supervisor sees this and is stunned. I break out into laughter as she huffs off.

A lady wanted to buy a $200 tablet and inquired about the refund policy. Usually, with big-ticketed items like this, we will only do returns if the item is un-opended and it is within 30 days. I mentioned this to the lady and told her that I would call my manager, just to confirm. In comes Stacy, declaring, ""Oh, I know this!"" She takes on a whole authoritative persona and tells this lady that she could return this product *opened* ""as long as there's no scratches and everything looks fine!"" W.T.F. Essentially, she took over my transaction and acted as though she was my superior or something. I knew she was dead wrong with the policy and, later on, confirmed with with a supervisor. A couple of weeks later, the lady who bought the tablet came in to return it - luckily, it was unopened.    
  
This girl was even dumb enough to put an Xbox on hold under a sign that said ""DON'T PUT ELECTRONICS ON HOLD."" Someone else called in, inquiring about Xboxes. Unable to find any others, I asked her what time the customer who she put it on hold for would come by. She told me she didn't know. I asked her what their number was (we always ask for a number), and she proceeds to tell me that she didn't take one down. *SMH.* I asked my supervisor what to do and she told me that whoever came for the system first would get it. Both customers came at the same time but, luckily, my manager was able to find another one!

**2. Working with Stacy is a pain.**  
---

Not only did she 'forget' about her shift 3 days before Christmas, leaving me as the only cashier, she still refused to come in when she was told she was scheduled for that day. I had asked that morning if it would be possible to leave early for a family thing and my manager had initially approved it, but after Stacy stiffed us, everyone ended up staying half an hour longer. This was also the day that our gift card system went down.  *MOST.STRESSFUL.DAY.EVER.*  
  

Last year, she would called me at 3 and 4:20pm, asking me to take her shift - which starts at 5, claiming that ""an exam got changed."" Now, I would believe this, if it wasn't the 10th time that she has used this excuse. She forgot to book off her exams and tried to fob them off, **the day before.** Our schedules at work are set 2-3 weeks in advance and our shifts are pretty much set (I *know* I work weekend mornings and Monday nights). It's annoying and frustrating hearing her look for sympathy when, in reality, it's her own fault for being so dumb.  

She also likes doing the work of the merchandisers when she should be working on the line up that's over 5 people long. She spends all this time chatting up customers, which is extremely frustrating, especially since that means that I have to work to churn out these customers faster. This is work time - not time time to socialize or promote her mother's hair-dressing business.    
  
She actually had the balls to do her homework on front cash a couple of months after we had a meeting **banning** this. When my manager (let's call him Dave) told her to put it away, Stacy straight-out lied and told him that the cash manager (who wasn't working that night) had given her permission. Knowing that was bs, Dave called the other manager (Rachael) and asked her about this. Apparently Rachael sent Stacy home a couple of nights prior because she wanted to go home and study for a test, but she had never allowed her to actually work at front cash.  Dave pulled Stacy into the back office and gave her shit about how this was unacceptable because they weren't paying her to do homework. There was also the matter that she was trying to turn managers against one another. Stacy ended up crying and my manager freaked out and sent her home. As far as I know, nothing else ever came out of this.  
***
 **3. Stacy is always sick.**

I'm not even exaggerating. Every time I work with her she always complains about having a sore throat or feeling under the weather. She once came into work and, when my manager and supervisor were talking near front cash, proceeded to tell them how she had an ear infection and couldn't hear out of one ear. Please note that she made no mention of this during the hour she was working prior or when she was talking to my supervisor earlier. She then asked if she could leave early to go to the doctors. She's used this shtick twice that I'm aware of. She's also bruised her ribs, pulled a muscle, and has had various other injuries that I can't even remember. Apparently it's gotten to the point where her parents ignore her when she's screaming in bed because of 'the pain', telling her to just go back to sleep.

Patient000,"I worked as an RA at a private dorm up until recently, and had to work with some very interesting people. This is one of the worst nights I had while at the property:

[Characters...

* Princess, a sophomore girl with an entitlement problem. Needed Position 1 filled by me.

* Rap Star, a sophomore boy who was ok but not a team player. Needed Position 2 filled by me, same night for both shifts.]

Princess and Rap Star both asked me to cover for them on a weekend night because of a holiday they ""couldn't miss"" for anything in the world. I agreed, thinking Rap Star--who asked second--had cleared it with our managers. Why else would he ask for the same night off, the day beforehand, and leave one person to cover 2 shifts? He said he'd talked to our property manager already, and that was why he was asking me; he also said he would be staying at home that night, so there was no way I was going to have backup from him to help me out if anything went down... Princess had asked with much more advanced warning, so that was my primary position. Rap Star was ecstatic that I was doing him a ""solid solid"" and made all kinds of promises then left ASAP.

What could happen on a friday night in a dorm full of freshman, with a cheap bar up the hill? 

1) 3:45am. A kid with a heart condition and taking 4 prescription meds passes out stone cold in my arms, in front of our building, after drinking 6 shots on a strictly no-liquor pill regimen. No ID or wallet, no memory of where he was, and he repeatedly smashed his head into the concrete before the liquor got him.

2) 3:50am. A call comes down about a kid terrorizing his roommate and Roomie's girlfriend, then puking his guts out about 4 times. I got up there and he's in dry heaves, on his back, and groaning for paramedics. Lucky for him they're there-- he does not comply with the paramedics. I wrestled this dumbass back into his puke-doused bed and then had to stay with him from 4:30a-6:15am, after we moved Roomie and RM's Girlfriend to a new room. Top Boss' orders after I had to call her down to help me out. [Morning Choking Hazard duty was where I lost it.]

***

Now... The shit-storm of worst case scenarios aside, THIS is where it gets interesting: I sent two boss-approved texts out letting Princess and Rap Star know what happened on what were supposed to be their shifts. Why? A) Boss also did not approve Rap Star's leave of absence, and had told him to get a couple hours covered but he was supposed to work with me on second shift duty. B) I had told her Princess actually came back to the building around 2am, sloppy drunk, and falling all over the lobby [so she lied to me about her plans and **knowingly** left me to handle 2 shifts because bar hopping was waaaaaay more important, but that was a minor tiff]. Both were in violation of policies, Rap Star being worse off.

The reason I did not (/don't) get along with Princess after this was because she's a two-faced, cowardly bitch in the morning. Her response to my text was a long rant trying to cover her ass and blame me for doing her job and not accepting that shit happens. What does Bitchface do next? Knocks on my door 2 fucking hours after I finally got to sleep--in order to tell me the *same things* she sent to my phone. Her final whine:

&gt;""You could have asked me to come help you if it was *really that bad.*""

Mhmm yeah, I'll ask the wasted chick--who screens her work calls and never answers at night--to come help me. That sounds safe with 2 fucked up residents needing sober assistance.

Top Boss sided with me later, on both counts. Rap Star learned his lesson in working as a team and I ended up only working a total of one shift with Princess (Bitchface), after telling our direct manager I refused to put up with her shit.

Sasparillafizz,"My old manager was sooooo bad at actually managing his store. He was sadly my first experience at retail, so I didn't know how bad he was until I got a taste of a good manager.

We have a midsize stand alone store, not a strip mall or gods forbid a mall store.

But our manager would take every. shortcut. imaginable.

He put sku stickers on blank cases to speed up inventory counts because he couldn't be bothered to get a ladder and scan the stuff that was on the high shelves. We don't know if any of it was actually up there, he never scanned them, he just assumed they were and scanned the sticker rather than verify actual product on hand. We ended up having one of the highest shrink rates in the company in weekly counts. But our actual inventories, when a 3rd party company came in to inventory, showed we were pretty on the ball. We didn't know where a fucking thing WAS at any time, but it was apparently all in the store and not stolen. Just a lot of manual shrink outs/ins because he was constantly finding or losing product.

He also never filed product, or put them away. Not Anything. Now for a large store, this isn't much of a problem if the manager isn't on the floor doing grunt work. But we aren't a huge store, there are usually maybe 2 people in the store at an avg time. What he would do is, since we deal in used product, he would take them and drop them in a drawer for 'to file.' And we would only start filing those at the end of the night. So we would end up doing what should be the entire days worth of work in the last 2 hours. It sucks for the part time employees because they would come in every day for closing shift to a literal fucking MOUNTAIN of work.

Speaking of the part timers. He sucked at scheduling. What he would do was he would make one column of time for figuring out what hours a non-keyholder was to come in for help, but then would just call random people and ask if they can come work today. It was apparently to much effort to schedule around people having second jobs/school/commitments to actually...SCHEDULE. Noone would know when they were working till the day before, sometimes hours before they are called in. Our DM was pissed when he visited one day, snatching the schedule and asking ""What is this, a pot luck?!""

Once again, since he did no actual work besides standing behind the register helping customers, our walls look like shit. We get like 90 hours of labor each week. About 44 of those are the manager's. So since he did nothing for store maintenance, we essentially had to run the largest store in our district on 50 man hours labor, including the normal day to day customer service. The store bloody well looked like it, constantly.

He took shortcuts on how stuff was put on walls to save time, he was loose about filing things away to save time, he cut every corner he could get away with and STILL fell behind on everything and pissed off our DM at every turn whenever he came in to look at our wreck of a store.

One of my favorite ones was, since we deal in used games, I was trained by him to take any games (regardless of condition) that didn't have their case as refurbished. I must have ended up costing our customers thousands of dollars for refurb fees for games that were flawless. Why? Because our manager felt it was to time consuming to make cases for them, so we would take unscratched games and send them off to a company to be buffed out at our customers expense because he was to lazy to do what our company is SUPPOSED to do. I didn't find out this was wrong till our ASM explained that this wasn't policy, since this was what I was trained to do.

He would also be rather sketchy about getting numbers. He would offer 'incentives' for customers to trade in their games, and reserve upcoming titles. ""We'll give you a free reservation of the new Halo."" But the truth is that he was just applying a promotion the customer should have gotten regardless, he'd just not tell the customers about the extra $10 bonus they give to trade ins for ALL trades this week. Instead he'd only apply it IF they got our discount card or they were reserving something; to fabricate extremely high numbers. We would end up with a extremely low pickup rate for reservations because he would get so many people to reserve and then they wouldn't actually buy.

When our new manager took over, we found he had not filed or organized ANY of the paperwork in the last year.

I'm so glad he's gone. Our new manager for about 2 years now is immensely on the ball, not afraid to say no to customers, treats us well and puts in tons of time to the store himself. Very hands on when running his store.",null,2,cdd7cju,1qh4fr,talesFromRetail,hot,7

One of the men I mentioned was pretty well off (something my family has never been). FTFG, I gather, has not always had good experiences with men. Also, I have a history with sexual abuse, which FTFG is aware of.

&gt;FTFG: You gotta watch your mom with that guy though. You know that's who she'll pick. Somebody like your mom will always go with the money.

I'm a bit taken aback because I didn't exactly disagree with what she said, but I really didn't expect her to say it.

&gt;Me: Yeah, who knows honestly. It's her choice I guess-

&gt;FTFG: -Interrupting- Well yeah but a guy like that will make her follow his rules. They're used to being in charge. A guy like that will rape your sister!

My sister is 12, and honestly it doesn't matter. This is where the line was crossed.

&gt;Me:...Well I'd really hope something like that wouldn't happen. I guess I hope I never have to deal with that.

Then I walked away. Normally when FTFG says something it's just a bit shocking, or even funny, but not that time. I think she knew she went too far, and my mom ended up ditching the guy anyway so it never came up again.

I'd be looking for another job, at that rate. If they're paying people who rip them off, it's only a matter of time before they go out of business. Not to mention, the frustration of trying to do your job properly, only to be undermined by corporate. When I worked retail and fast food, it would take me 2 to 3 weeks to make $300, depending on how many hours I got. Then some asshole comes in, and steals that much in one night.

morgueanna,"**If you're in management:**

* Make sure everyone knows what they're doing by giving them specific, short information. Don't hit them with a wall of text in the form of memos and sales goal sheets and all that. If you can't fit the info on a 3 x 5 card, it's too much. 

* Speaking of those cards, if you have the time, create cheat sheets of responsibility for each position/department on a card that size. They fit in pockets and are good reminders if new employees get frazzled from being left alone in a department. Put whatever their basic duties are, the items they should be offering, what the sales are in their zone, etc. This is also something that can be used to hold people accountable- how can you say you didn't know the sales when I handed them to you on your own personal card?

* See if you can get your district manager to do a payout to buy some donuts, coffee, and candy for the back room. Treat your employees and keep them sugared up for the day.

* See if your boss is also cool with people dressing up for the event. My stores have done pajama parties, elves and reindeer, little kids' outfits, etc. No one can feel bad dressed in a ridiculous costume and it really diffuses some of the stress customers feel waiting in line for hours- when the door is opened by a 6' tall dude wearing footie pj's, you know your day is gonna be great!



**If you're just a grunt:**

* Leave one hour before you usually leave. If it usually takes you 20 minutes to get to work, leave one hour and 20 minutes early. Seriously. Not only is traffic going to be a grind, but finding parking will take you all day. Even if you get there super early, you can take some time to relax in the back, get some status updates from others on break back there, or just chill in your car listening to music to pump yourself up for your day.

* Pack a lunch and bring pocket size snacks. You won't have time to stand in line at a food court so bring food. Bring mints and an energy bar to sneak a snack on the sales floor when management isn't looking. Honestly, even if they catch you, almost all sins are forgiven on Black Friday and they will understand/envy you.

* Make yourself a cheat sheet of sales in your department and in the entire store. Ask your management team for backup items - will anything be used to replace item X when it is sold out? What do they want you to push in its place? 

* Find out before Black Friday what your department's plan of attack will be. Even though this *should* be a manager's responsibility, we've seen plenty of stories on TFR of poor communication. Find out where your extra register tape will be, where overflow hangers will go, who will be running supplies out of the back, etc. Don't expect or rely on your managers to have your back- find out for yourself.

* Have your manager's name and contact info ready on small sheets of paper. Guess what, it's Black Friday, someone will want to complain about something. They will ask for your corporate office number or a complaint hotline. Give them the store manager's name and number and send them on their way to yell at someone else. This serves two purposes: 1) since you have it ready it will cut down on writing time/finding a pen, and 2) when they see you are ready to hand them out like candy it makes them less inclined to actually complain because they think it happens all the time and won't do any good.

-Odds are you have unused tensa-barriers in storage, use them to organize your queue. Balloons tied to them make good universal signs for start of the line. 

-Prepackage your bundles if you can. Most offers on big ticket items are conditional (buy this console and this game, get a gift card for $X, etc)

-Communicate! Stay on top of register supplies (receipt tape, bags, etc)

-Stage your hourly door busters on U-boats/pallets in the back of house if possible. 

-Dump bins and bulk stacks are great for category sales. They can also be used to block aisles if you are trying to have the guests serpentine through the department.

Assign someone to the task of making sure everyone takes their breaks and as close to on time as possible.

Have someone on phones so the cash wrap isn't trying to do it. 

Be nice to your staff.

So a return doesn't just cancel out the original sale, it acts against your total stats. So say the employee had sold 30 items that week in 15 transactions, for a 2.0 UPT. When you return one item, it brings him down to 29 items, but up to 16 transactions, so his UPT drops to 1.81. (Most stores have a standard of 2.0 or higher). 

So, what you did is basically add 2 transactions, and 0 items (-1 from the return, and 1 from the sale). Using the same example, you brought the UPT down from 2.0 to 1.76 (30 units/17 trans).

TL;DR you messed up his stats.

The following month the store was on HIGH alert for the next shopper. I still remember my store manager pulling me aside one day and letting me know there was a customer who had hit all the departments thus far - only the copy center and registers were left. This was probably our mystery shopper. I should call him for back up the moment I had more than one customer at the counter - and please try to remember everything! 

As luck would have it, he encountered the mystery shopper first. Having listened to her spiel, he rather smoothly apologized, saying I was better suited to give her suggestions and he would ask my customer if he could finish up their order.

This mystery shopper had come with a plan - which gave me something to work with! She wanted a set of double sided color copy brochures to promote a new business. Thank you for giving me a story to go with! I spent, I think, 20-30 minutes walking her through every service I could conceivably offer. Did she know we did folding? We do! It's a new business, huh? We can make business cards either in the store or out. Did you know about our wide format printing? Great advertising. Or a banner? Just as nice! Oh, your business doesn't have a logo yet?

itsme0,"Fast food for me. We have food safety inspections, which is where someone comes in to make sure our safety things are done correctly. As well as a core visit (corporate, I'd guess) which makes sure we're doing everything correctly.

Core visits start out the same, they order something and make sure everything was done right. To make a long story a little shorter, while the lady from core was still there I heard that I didn't ""triple check"" the customers order. (Triple check includes repeating their order before pulling them forward to the window and each item as your giving them out, but the third varies. Old way-repeating the items as they ordered it. New way- repeating entire order again at the window before taking money (yes, when we just repeated the entire order 20 seconds before)).

I have said that I'm no longer to work the cashier position well for reasons that I'll shorten to being burned out on it, but I was doing good that day, so I asked my manager (the one who told me) what part I didn't do. She said the lady said that i didn't check the bag before haning it out to her. I mentioned that for many of the orders I was able to see the chefs putting the food in the bags. I was making sure, it's just out of sight from someone trying to peer in through the window. Se could check the security video if she didn't believe me.

I continue my shift and am almost off the clock, the core lady already left and I'm told that before I clock out the manager wanted to talk to me. I was getting a write up for not triple checking. When I repeat the thing about triple checking that I mentioned earlier, I was told the lady had actually said that I didn't repeat the items as I handed them out. I said I think I did. (note: we have video, but not audio) The manager said that core said I didn't. I know that she has to take Cores word over mine, and this manager has been better to me than most others here, so I didn't want to give her more trouble and signed the thing. At the time I didn't know that I could have refused and signed it ""under duress"" if forced. Also, I figured that if I had two write ups (yeah, had a previous one already) that they'd stop putting me as a cashier, to avoid getting a third which would get me fired, since they've done that with multiple other people and that was becoming my only hope to get out of being cashier.

This is one of my first awkward moments in retail. I saw a couple of teenage girls at my counter facing away from me looking at my makeup. They were all over each other, holding hands, holding each other, etc. Whatever, the teen girls that come in here pretty much always are and nobody here cares anyway. What I do care about is my counter being made messy by kids who won't buy anything, so I let them look for a couple minutes to gauge their behavior. They seem to be calmly checking stuff out so I go to greet them. ""Hi ladies,can I help you try anything today?"" The taller blonde with the prettier curls turns around with a shocked look on his face. Yep, his. 

He smiles and says ""What?"" then his girlfriend turns around chuckling ""Did you say ladies?"" she asks me.

Ordering a meal at a fast food place was at the tail end of lunch time so I was one of the last to order, no other customers behind me. All other lanes (around 3) were almost empty.

Cashier looks tired since her computer is down but she still takes my order and promptly gets everything fixed up. When it comes for me to pay, her computer is still down. I don't mind.

She looks at her manager who gives her a thumbs up and she then moves to the next lane, also asks me to go to that lane. The computer is down also. The cashier has a ""wtf"" look on her face. I don't say a word, still don't mind since I don't.

She moves on to the next lane and asks me to go there too. Computer is not working also. The cashier's face now has a ""OMG WTF This is not happening"" look on her face. We've spent maybe a total of 2 minutes by then. I raise an eyebrow but don't say a word. I know its not her fault and I'm not the type to become unreasonable because of this.

The Cashier moves to the third and last lane. It is also down. She has that look on her face that she wants to murder the damn machine. I give exactly how much I need to pay and tell her that its fine, she can just bring me the receipt at my table since it looks like there's something wrong. I also didn't want to make a scene.

A few minutes after I got to my seat, the she brings me my receipt and also leaves down a sundae I didn't pay for.

As I leaned forward to grab an ashtray a fully loaded with stinky butts ashtray slipped off my tray and down the back of a low cut dress.

SpyPies,"Reminds me of an encounter I had ages ago. Totally not retail though.

Once ages ago, I was walking through the subway to get to school. I was super sleepy and basically zombie walking after having pulled a close to all-nighter. As I descended a packed staircase, getting jostled around by the surging crowd, I unwittingly put my hand on the railing between a woman and her brood. She immediately began screaming at me about ""comin' between her and her chilldrin."" I mumbled an apology, back then I was extremely shy of strangers and I experienced a lot of social anxiety, it took a lot of courage for me to talk to anyone I didn't already know, had trouble looking people in the eye and whatnot, and would actually start to shake sometimes if I were speaking in front of a group. A few steps down I was pushed a bit (not on purpose, the mass of humanity that inhabits the NYC subways cares for no man) and felt I like I was in danger of falling so I shot out my hand without thinking to grab the railing. I look up to see I had done so right between Crazy Lady and the chilldrin. She really lets me have it that time, yelling and cursing. She actually follows me over to my platform despite my feeble ""sorry""s and ""it was an accident, please leave me alone."" I could feel everyone on the platform staring at me.

Eventually something snaps, normally I would just hunch my shoulders and hope she would go away. I don't know if it was my half-delirious sleep deprived state or what that gave me the balls, but I turned to her and growled ""Listen lady, I don't give a damn what you have to say about me, but your kids are *right there*"" (the little guy and gal couldn't have been older than 5 or 6 and their eyes were wide and staring) ""You shouldn't be cursing in front of them like this. Is this the example you set for them? If that's the case I feel sorry for them. Really, I do."" 

Crazy Lady roughly grabs her kids by the arms and yanks them down the platform after firing a few parting shots, notably devoid of curse words. I flip her the finger after her and her kids backs were turned (Yeah I know), board the train, and take a nap. ",null,1,cde6e1l,1qlrym,talesFromRetail,hot,20

techiebabe,"I've been a secret shopper for pubs, shops, underground stations, train journeys and stations... What would you like to know? 

Personally I wouldnt shoplift... Im more worried about remembering the name of the assistant, trying to subtly time how long it takes for them to greet me, and trying to get the task done, get out so I can braindump into a notebook, then get home and write the report. I dont want to waste any time as it doesnt pay that well and I cant afford to fanny about.

You can recognise me by needing a receipt in situations where people dont usually bother - eg a drinks order at a pub, or asking staff to let me retain a ticket at a station barrier. 

Or if youve got a product on promotion and I ask about that even when it should be obvious, to see if you know which products to push or how to present a gin and tonic perfectly, or whatever. 

Or if I pop into the loo when you dont think Id normally need to, such as a really quick visit when Im visiting alone and clearly feel awkward leaving my drink or bag unattended, or I dont spend very long there (eg checking if it is clean and stocked but without using it).

Or if Im spending ages browsing, and seem genuinely interested / ask questions, but then only buy one cheap item - for example I was told to buy something at x store, they would refund up to £4. I didnt know the store, so I had to look at pretty much everything before working out that all I could buy at that price was a small candle. 

I never want to mark people down, as I know your bonus may depend on it. On the other hand, I have to be honest so if you dont have a namebadge or I spent ten minutes queuing I do have to record that. I once - ONCE - scored a pub 100% and I got crossexamined, I made sure I was CERTAIN that everyone greeted me in time, was helpful, glasses were sparkling clean, tables were spotless, empties were removed within a minute, etc. Remember that the mystery shopper will get questionned if they just say everything was fine... and it is very very unlikely that everything will be perfect, just because life happens! I dont want to risk my job by being anything other than honest, but if you are helpful / friendly / go the extra mile, I WILL commend you. I want people to do well! 

I am disabled, and if you offer to bring my drinks to my table / ask if I need help taking my goods to my car, I WILL commend you... it's always worth doing! ",null,4,cded15q,1qmr4d,talesFromRetail,hot,11
lepetitmarshmallow,"My mom used to be a secret shopper, but wouldn't be a butt about it. If she could tell the cashier was new, young, nervous, having a bad day, whatever, she would go super easy on them (if they forgot to say some BS corporate line that was stupid and sounded unnatural in actual conversation, she would gently remind them just so she could say that they did in the report. If they weren't wearing a nametag, she would ask them for their name so she could put that they were on her form. This was partly because I worked retail at the time, and would constantly get harassed with it, i.e., old ladies who I've never met before snapping their fingers and calling me by my first name to go over and help them when I was busy, men telling me how ""sexy"" my name is, or weird stalkers using it to find me on facebook. I even had a guy post on craigslist missed connections with my full name looking for me).

But if the person who worked there was some rude middle-aged harpy who thought they were above store policies because they had worked there forever, all bets were off. They got scathing reports.

rugbygirl24,"I did mystery shopping in college a couple times. I had to drive to gas stations and a few restaurants to make sure they were carding for cigarettes and alcohol. I felt like a scum bag the whole time. I studied psychology in school so it got me thinking about situational factors that lead people to not card me. For example, days that I would do my hair and makeup and wear something cute I wouldn't get carded as much, especially from guys around my age. Days that I wore a sweatshirt and my hair thrown up in a bun I almost always got carded.


Nothing will make me feel worse than one of the last gas stations I shopped. My form told me that this store was a cigarette check and that the employees are required to check your ID and also scan the barcode on the back. Well I go in, the woman is very pleasant, asks for my ID but does not scan it. My heart sank because not scanning counts as a fail. I tell the woman I have to fail her for not using the scanner and I see her face go from pleasant to terrified in 2 seconds. She proceeds to beg me not to fail her because the scanner is broken. I tried to explain that the store is registered as having a scanner and there is nothing I can do about that. She started sobbing, telling me that if I failed her she would lose her job. It didn't matter what the circumstance was, even though she did ask for my ID and did confirm that I was at least 18. She had 4 kids at home and was a single parent. I couldn't bring myself to fail her because she did in fact check my ID, I was not going to be responsible for this poor woman losing her job. I told her to make sure her boss got the scanner fixed and marked it as a pass.  


At a different gas station I had the clerk actually chuckle a little bit when he asked for my ID saying something along the lines of ""you look like your 15"" I was 21 at the time.

Count it in your head and don't adjust your hand in the meantime - you're making a seal over the broken blood vessel in your nose. After 30 seconds, take your hand away.  If there's still bleeding, pinch your nose a little higher or lower and go another 30 seconds. After the bleeding is stopped, don't breathe out of your nose for a minute or two to make sure the blood has congealed enough to not restart the bleeding.  

Glad it worked out ok for you, OP, but just know that next time you could be vomiting blood, and I'm sure you have better things to do, like getting yelled at by entitled douchebags at work. ",null,20,cdepxh0,1qnzkj,talesFromRetail,hot,108

etterboce,"I generally hate dealing with teachers at work. My store is a big-box office supply retailer, and we have teachers come in all the time. As a group, they are generally incredibly cheap and entitled. They also commonly make it clear that they feel they should get everything for free or nearly free because of the public service they provide and their terrible pay.

I am married to a teacher who works in a middle school autistic classroom in the poorest area of my city. We spend a fair amount of money on supplies every week for her classroom, so I certainly know what it's like. However, even though it totally sucks that we have to purchase certain classroom supplies on a regular basis, she definitely makes enough money that we can afford to do so (she is given an allowance at the beginning of the year -- if she taught regular ed, it would be plenty). She works at her job because she likes to and because she finds it rewarding.  She doesn't want others to feel sympathetic towards her for doing so.

With that being said, she has to do several community-based field trips with her students per year. Every so often, they will visit a store (it makes sense, because most of what she works on with her students is behavior). She would never even think of going anywhere without first contacting the store manager by telephone and in writing. She also contacts them well in advance of when they wish to come, and also holds the visit during an off-time.

I could completely see a group of teachers walking into my store and doing the same thing. I'm not sure what kind of benefit them going to an electronics store had, because they certainly could have held technology training without actually going to a store. But if they wanted to, they sure as hell should have called your store manager and asked permission.

Luckily, our policy states that anybody who wishes to meet or assemble at our store needs to have a letter from corporate before they can do so (this obviously doesn't happen overnight or in the less than 30 seconds most customers desire).

We have had groups (including teachers) try to set up tables at the front of our store on multiple occasions. We have told them no and they eventually leave without setting up. Some have contacted corporate and have been given permission, but we would have had an email from them well before they group was scheduled to arrive.

At this location we provided archery services which included basic things such as fletching/cutting/installing inserts into arrows. One particular man refused to believe that we properly heated his inserts for the aluminum arrows he was buying. He wanted them as hot as possible, so the glue would stick better. 

A new associate decided to take this literally and heated the insert with a torch (which is usual). The man kept interrupting him and telling him to hold it under longer, and even after it was clearly too hot demanded that he heat the glue too (while on the insert). Needless to say the glue caught on fire as did the hot melt stick it was being applied from.

The associate was surprised and dropped the flaming glue/melt stick into the trash can. At the time this can was filled with solvent residue, paper towels, bits of carbon arrows, newspaper etc. and went up like a dried x-mas tree.

I am called over by the employee for ""help"", without any mention of fire or distress in his voice. Needless to say I see the flames, run for the fire extinguisher and put out a fire that could have easily spread to the nearby counter top (that had many flammable substances on it).

Customer did not believe that the hot melt could catch on fire, and was surprised to here that excessive heat diminishes the adhesive properties of the melt stick. He was sure that the employee was using the wrong type of adhesive. Face palm.

I frequent this sub because I have worked in retail, and my husband still does, and it horrifies me how rude people can be to people doing their best to serve them.

I was assuming that OP is a real human being, who might, possibly have been exaggerating her injury.  That isn't necessary.  You don't need to burst into floods of tears, you simply need to say, ""Ouch!"" and ""I'm sorry, but my nail has been ripped off, give me a sec... here's your bag, but I need to stop this bleeding, can you just hang on a tic, while I get my co-worker to take over from me?""  and ""Thank you for your patience, I'm a nut-nut for not keeping my nails short.""

I had a similar thing happen to me at my previous job and I ended up having to get a restraining order on the guy because my boss wouldn't ban him from coming there just to see me/stare at me. 

Consider talking to a victim's advocate (a service provides for free through the court system) about your options. Do NOT let yourself be bullied into allowing this to continue. Although it was difficult and stressful, seeking and successfully getting a restraining order gave me such a sense of security and relief
 My only regret was that I waited and suffered through a year of harassment to do it. Oh, and I did not have to pay any legal fees to do this. 

Please take care of yourself. You deserve a safe work environment.  Contact your company to ensure this gets done. Do NOT let your boss convince you that this is OK or that you are just overreacting.  Stand up for your right to work in a place free from hostility and harassment. Be safe. Be assertive.

2. I always put my card/money on the counter because you touch money all day, wipe your face, touch other customers hands. They will be dirtier than mine, and it's also less awkward when handing over notes and coins (they won't spill and disappear into the abyss under the counter).

3. Now days a lot of stores aren't offering bags or clerks forget to give the transaction receipts and/or stamp my reward card. I just ask out of habit, not because I think you're an idiot.

4. I'm trying to save my time and yours, and I'm only being polite when I ask. It's like when your boss asks you to do something, they're not really asking.

Abracadanielle,"I've told this story on Reddit before, but I enjoy telling it so here we go:

I worked at a corporate restaurant a few years ago, around 2008 when the economy started to officially tank. So business was awful and corporate heavily coupon'd the surrounding area to try and bring people in. It was a ridiculously good deal of a coupon. Buy one/get one free on damn near most of the entrees, including steaks and ribs and stuff. And it brought people out alright. It brought out the cheapest motherfuckers imaginable. The coupon would appear in the paper once a week, every week, for almost an entire year. We got all these new regulars, and they would only come in to use their coupon, tipping on the discounted price. All the good servers started to quit because of what bullshit it was.

So there was this one couple in particular that I will never forget. They were awful. They were rude and their order was ridiculously complicated and trivial. They wanted all their sides plated separately because, as they told me, they felt the kitchen would give them more food that way. When it actually it's just that a scoop of mashed potatoes will spread out on a plate by itself. They like, bragged about this to me. I would just bite my tongue. They would talk down to you in the way that shitty older customers do, like you're ""the help"" in an antiquated sense. They would flag me down when I was talking to other tables. Like, I was *talking to someone* and the woman would yell for me and wave her arm. And it would always be for something incredibly trivial. Like ""I'm going to need a refill in about five minutes"" was probably my favorite. Really. You felt the need to interrupt me when I was taking another table's order to tell me that. So when all was said and done, they'd pull out their BoGo coupon, turning their $38ish ticket into a $18ish one. Then they'd slap a $20 down and tell you to keep the change with a shitty smile. So after dealing with them through all their horseshit, you'd have a dollar and some coins to show for it.

The story does have a happy ending. One night when we were busy, they came in and pulled their usual routine. They each wanted two sodas each, one with extra ice, the other with none. They asked the same questions about the menu. Thirty questions about the bbq sauce and then asking for it on the side after all that. Food all on separate plates thinking the kitchen is stupid enough to give them bigger portions. Asking for new mashed potatoes because they ""accidentally put too much pepper on them and need new ones"". I wasn't waiting on them that night, but I could still see everything. The check got dropped and they out-of-the-blue demand to talk to a manager. Guy starts to chew my manager out because, that past week, there had been *no BoGo coupon in the paper*. They were livid and demanded to have their ""usual discount"". My manager, bless her, gave them the most amazing shit-eating grin and told them that our individual store had no control over when corporate chose to put out coupons. They then said ""Well if you don't give us a coupon for tonight, we're never coming back!"" My manager actually replied with something to the tune of ""That's fine."" They were livid. ""How is that fine?"" She said ""Neither the restaurant nor the serving staff has been making any money off of your business. I think we'll be fine."" They paid full price for the order, left in defeat and sure enough never returned.

After arguing for a whole ten minutes, I hear her say, "" You guys act like that coupon show is going to ruin it for everybody! I am never shopping here again."" And proceeds to stand with her arms crossed, giving the stare down to the bagger who now has to unbag all her groceries so she can stomp home with her bags empty.

Warning: Wall of text inbound.

We gave her a $25 dollar gift card to a certain bath product chain store marketed heavily towards women for her birthday.

Later that day, the family went to the mall, and she insisted we go to the store so she could use the gift card.

We spent at least an hour and a half in there while she smelled almost everything in the store, and proceeded to walk up to the cash register with a basket full of stuff.

I was young and naive to her shopping habits, so I thought she was just going to use the gift card to pay for part of the purchase, and pay for the rest with a credit card. Boy was I wrong.

She then proceeded to pull out a massive stack of coupons, and instructed the cashier which order to apply the coupons and on what products in order to get the best possible discount. This took another half hour.

After that ordeal, the (at least) 10 coupons were applied and the metric shit ton of soap and scented hand gel paid for, the cashier had a smile that said ""I'm going to kill you if you have another damn coupon,"" and we finally made it out of that chemical-and-flowery-scented hell.

In the end, I think she got $75 worth of stuff for around $25.

Needless to say, the four guys in the house (my dad, my two younger brothers, and me) all agreed to never get her another gift card anywhere ever again. We have also never let my mom live that down, and repeat it to her whenever she even thinks about doing something similar, to save both us and the cashiers the frustration and agony of having to deal with her shopping habits.",null,2,cdhbugk,1qvk5o,talesFromRetail,hot,8

Once upon a time, my wife was a couponer. She had the big binder full of coupons that she categorized and dated, and her shopping trips were *organized*. I remember her getting out of stores with a cart full of shit for like 12 bucks. Once, she got 3 back on a cart full of shampoo. 

A couple times, I was dragged along. On a 6-hour shopping trip. The last time was just a fucking nightmare. If it were just us, it would be no problem. No, we had to bring her mother. My wife was organized, had all the things in her cart separated and coupons ready and counted when the cashier needed them. She rang up, paid for her shit, and moved along. Behind her, was her mother. She didn't have her transactions separated, so as the cashier got to things, she would make them void it and move it to the back so it could be put on the next one. And her coupons were not sorted. The icing on the fucking cake was when she paid. She brought out a bridge card, 2 debit cards, and some cash. She paid for 2 or 3 separate transactions with *four* different methods. Each fucking time.

Today it's a couple years after that incident, and the cashiers are still rude to my wife and her mother at that store.",null,0,cdhfjln,1qvk5o,talesFromRetail,hot,3

When a customer is says they're just looking let them look.  But as soon as they pick up something comment that it'll look good or is a very versatile item. When we get new product in the store I'll start planning out outfits for certain popular pieces/closet mainstays so if a customer likes one thing you can show them coordinating pieces. 

Always be honest - if something looks horrible tell them in a tactful way and have another suggestion for them to try. Like the above commenters - over time you will recognize customers and they will start to know you and in time trust your judgement/recommendations. Also jewelry and scarves can make a complete look and are easy add ons to suggest.

I think the main thing is that you don't need to worry about pushing products on the customer. Just show them the products and accessories that are applicable to what they are looking for and explain any possible benefits. 

I work in a different type of store. We sell office supplies and electronics, but it's really the same general idea. We have a lot of expensive and overpriced items, and the company wants us to upsell as much as possible.

The biggest thing that I have found turns off customers is when they feel like they are in the middle of a sales pitch. Make them feel like you are just trying to help them get everything they will need.

Sometimes companies do things that are stupid that try to force employees to upsell. For instance, our company forces employees to offer a ream of paper with every transaction. It's not a terrible idea in theory, but when I've worked with a customer for an hour or more and then randomly offer them paper when I know it's something they do not want or need, it screws up the whole flow of the sale.

She yells at the man who comes in with her (might be her carer, her son, her husband - who knows), yells at us, is extremely anxious about everything.

I was bagging her stuff once. I scan a bottle of fly spray and am going to bag it. She says, panicked, ""Put that seperately won't you?! It's poison, you know!"" Yes, I know..

Everyone was on alert mode when she came in one day extremely irritated. More than usual.

After she has paid for her stuff, a coworker is asked to take her bags out to her car for her.

My coworker comes back in looking quite upset. I ask what happened, and she tells me that this customer apologised to her, saying she had a stroke or something a year ago and has 'episodes' where she becomes angry seemingly out of nowhere and cannot control her emotions very well. She mentioned she was on medication for it, but that she was having a bad day.

She told my coworker that she has a jewelry store and makes her own jewelry, then gives her a little bracelet because she felt bad for how she was acting. 

Now, I was still pissed after she told me this story, but it was also like a lightbulb moment as well. ""Oh, so that's why you're acting like that. It's not because you're angry at us, it's because you have a medical condition. Okay, I can deal with that"", I thought.

I still don't think it's an excuse for acting badly, and treating people badly, but it does explain some things.

The reason I'm saying this is because perhaps this customer had a similar story. I mean, she is incredibly hunched over, and I think that anyone stuck in that hunched back position would get cranky from time to time! In no way does it excuse her actions, but there is probably a reasonable explanation behind it.

Or she might just be a cranky person for no reason! There are many other disabled people I see fairly regularly as well. They are all perfectly nice, and I have had no dramas with them at all.

A woman bought a large gas grill and was pissed the employee would not tie it down for her and refused to tie it down herself.

Next day he comes into work and sees a destroyed grill...well bits and pieces of a destroyed grill.  Turns out the woman had lost the grill to wind shear on the highway and had come back demanding that she be given a refund, a new grill and that the store pay for some minor damage to her pick-up truck.

We were open late, til 11, to process returns, and also an after xmas sale. So we see these two, who are obviously too damn young to be alone, by themselves, just piling up merchandise. They ended up going into the fitting room and filling up some bags. We stopped them at the mall entrance.

They were so quiet, and had this look of shame. Heads hung. And their clothes were just dirty. Jackets were soiled. Going through the merchandise, none of the stuff was anything flashy. Just socks, underwear, generic t-shirts, some jeans, some cheap jackets, etc. Was about $800 worth. They weren't talking much at all except to give us personal information.

Couldn't get a hold of a parent. The whole situation was depressing, but it got worse. Cop showed up, me and him are just trying to get something out of them. Need a parent or relative's info. Finally I'm just like ""WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?!""

The little one looks up at me and eeks out ""At home..."" To which I replied ""DOING WHAT?!"" Again a quiet response. ""Smoking crack...""

I got the older girl to talk more. She added that they hadn't gotten anything for xmas- they was nary a mention of it in the household- and the rest of their clothes were in a similar condition. Felt awful to hear to say the least.

Cop asked me what I wanted to do, as in prosecute, etc. I said absolutely not. It was policy to do so, but at that point I'm in this fucked up mix of rage and depression over their situation and I can't say I gave a fuck. That and they were already fucked in life and didn't need a record to go along with their predicamint (no sealed juvenile records in my state). Besides, I got a police report, so anyone reviewing the case would assume I prosecuted.

Cop said he was going to take them to the troop and call family services. The fact that it was then past midnight and no parent had called- not to mention the drug allegations- was enough for an emergency order, or whatever. Not sure how that works.

Sometimes I wonder what happened to those two, and I try to be optimistic, but the area of the city they're from made it likely that they fell right back into the same cycle as their parents. Some kids have no chance...

| Can I make a WorkCover claim for stress?

You can make a WorkCover claim for stress or a mental health issue that requires you to obtain medical treatment or take time off work, if your condition is established to be related to your work.

An exception to this is that you cannot make a claim if your work-related psychiatric injury is predominantly caused by a reasonable ‘management action’ taken in a reasonable manner. It is important that if your condition is caused by factors at work other than management actions, that you state this clearly on your WorkCover claim form. Contact Adviceline Injury Lawyers for free legal advice and any help you may need in filling out your claim form on 9321 9988.

As far as your job goes...it just sounds like a typical day at your average retailer. It's obviously not a great work environment, but honestly, most retail isn't. I'm not saying this to justify it or condone it. It's shitty, but that's how most of them are. Managers that are barely adequate that fuck things up, get frazzled, have you do ten things at once, and yell at you when they're not done. That's typical.

Everyone here is telling you to talk to a supervisor or someone higher up. I'm telling you this because I don't think that's going to help. Your complaints, while perfectly valid to you, are going to sound petty and vengeful to a higher manager, because this is the way retail normally operates. They will smile, pat your hand, tell you that they'll look into it, and then tell your boss to find a way to cut your hours or get rid of you altogether.

If you absolutely, 100% need this job- like you will lose your home if you don't have it- suck it up and keep looking for another job every free moment. If you don't need this, if you're living at home still or have some money set aside (which it sounds like you do if you have the money to fly out of the country), then look into quitting and taking a few weeks away from work altogether. It sounds like you need it anyway for your personal issues and the stress is not helping.

If every disgruntled customer rants to their friends &amp; family about how poorly they were treated then it makes those friends &amp; family less inclined to go to that store lest they receive the same treatment if they have a problem. Knock that out over a few years with every case of the customer being wrong and it can cause a substantial loss to the business.

The same is true in reverse. If the disgruntled customer is placated then they will go on to tell friends and family about how well they were treated, which in turn makes them more inclined to shop there themselves in the future. Thus increasing profit.

Think about it for a moment. If there are two grocery stores within a short distance of each other that sell approximately the same quality/value items as the other, but one has stellar customer services and the other is abysmal, which are you more inclined to shop in?

I know it as Dirty Old Woman Syndrome. Old women in nursing homes should not be allowed to have dildos. When it's time for anything that requires them to be naked, if they own one, without fail, they'll have it inserted when you need to bathe them. You have to pull it out because it's a yeast infection risk. Often times, they'll ask if you, as a male, would mind just taking it out and putting it back in a few times, or sometimes, they will grab you by the shirt, pull against you, and ask what you plan to replace it with.

Four women in that nursing home owned dildos. All four of them would harass the male staff endlessly. I took to wearing a cup because one of them no longer had fine motor control, so when she grabbed my package, she'd squeeze way too hard. I'm glad they weren't bad enough that they'd threaten us with sexual harassment charges if we refused their advances. I cannot, however, forgive them for their habit of smearing their dildos on my bare skin, or touching my face with them, leaving... stuff... on my face, even my lips.

Now I know theses aren't exact, and there are exceptions to every rule, but I would tell parents that generally game ratings break down like so: 

* E rated game = G rated movie 

* T rated game = usually closer to PG-13 movie 

* M rated game = R rated movie

* AO rated game = probably NC-17 or higher.

BloodBride,"Y'know, there's been something bothering me about video game age ratings and movie age ratings for a while, and this topic is what made me realise exactly what that is. 

The ""with parental consent"" part. 

If a parent wandered into a liquor store, or came to a tobacconist and asked their kid what they wanted, or there was any suggestion that the age restricted product was for the under-age person, even if by a mere day, we would have to legally restrict that sale because it's for a minor, and we could still be in trouble should someone report that case. 

The parent's consent doesn't factor in. There is no degree of being almost the right side of proper. Not old enough, no knowledgeable sale. 

However, with movies, video games and other items of media, the parent can tell you to shut the fuck up and sell their darling little turd a copy of whatever violent entertainment they want. 

That's what's odd to me. The video game doesn't suddenly become less violent or have less graphic content because the parent says it's okay. It's the same media as it always was, the same as alcohol and other age restricted products - they don't change in property because the parent says it's okay.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of all sorts, was shown age restricted media as a kid, and I'm aware that kids can handle it, that isn't my issue here.

My issue is that age restrictions are handled that differently. 

That it's okay for media that can effect psychological development to be just okayed in by a parent even if you know it's for an under-age person and you cannot be caught out by the law for selling it that way, but if you accidentally let slip a pack of cigs to a minor via a parent, you can lose your job and earn a fine.",null,1,cdiqj84,1r14xk,talesFromRetail,hot,3

Finders Keepers is a childrens rhyme, not a law. And its not even a good one, you buy a expensive toy for you kid, he puts it on the park bench and runs to to ice cream truck, that doesn't mean another kid is now legally entitled to take it claiming 'finders keepers.' Just try that when the parent is around and see what happens.

Unless there is clear intent that of abandonment, (I.e. put in the trash can on the curb.) you can absolutely prosecute for someone taking something they picked up off the street. There was in fact a news article recently about the new york police doing this as stings. They would leave a wallet in a crowded conspicuous place, and if someone took it and didn't immediately take it to the police officer (which is what you are supposed to do for lost property) standing in plain view nearby, it was considered theft of property and they were arrested. Got a lot of hubub in the news since this was considered provocation and turning people who would probably not under normal circumstances perform criminal behavior into criminals.

For future reference, if you find lost property, the law says either leave it alone, or if you pick it up you must take it to the police so whoever dropped it can come claim it. If they do not claim within a certain time (usually like 90 days) THEN you can claim the property yourself, legally. ",null,13,cdj6igq,1r3cg6,talesFromRetail,hot,103

You were hired to cover 6 shifts, and then suddenly decided to reduce to three shifts. That means they now need two employees to cover what they had one person covering. It doesn't work out for them.

While I understand that you've opened up your schedule, it doesn't really matter, OP. You only want three shifts a week, and now want to screw up other's schedules so you can get it. (And yes, full timers tend to get priority, so it's not fair for management to take away their set schedule so you can have what you want.)

I agree that the manager isn't going about it in a professional way (and that overall, the business seems to have some issues), but calling her out in a phone conversation isn't the way to handle this.

The universal acceptance agreement that your employer agreed to as a stipulation of being able to accept credit cards says they cannot require ID to complete a credit card transaction.  If the card is not signed, the procedure is to ask them to sign it or use a card that is signed.

Visa and Mastercard each have their own.  If you are making up your own regulations, you are creating a customer service problem for your company.  Huge companies don't like that.

Instead of downvoting, you can read the agreement...

Or the wikipedia page, which states:
""Unlike MasterCard, Visa does permit merchants to ask for photo ID, although the merchant rule book states that this practice is ""discouraged"". As long as the Visa card is signed, a merchant may not deny a transaction because a cardholder refuses to show a photo ID.[63]""

I came across a lady and her son (~12 years old) trying to push a land-yacht (ancient Buick or something) off the road in the rain. It had broken down at a fairly large intersection on the north side. If it was the south side it wouldn't have been a huge deal, but the north side was backing up and people were beeping/yelling. It was, of course, rush hour.

I pulled my truck in front of her car and jumped out with my emergency tow strap. I told her to take it out of gear and try not to rear end me. I hooked it to and looped it around the hitch on my truck and found a nice sturdy piece of frame to hook it to on her car.

Popped the truck into 4WD high and waited for the light to turn green. Pulled her across the street and got her into a parking lot with a grocery store. 

It turned out that she'd left her lights on the night before and ran a fairly new (well under a year old) battery down to nothing. She'd gotten a jump and accidentally stalled at the light. She hadn't, however, let the car run long enough for the alternator to charge the battery back up.

My V8 truck struggled to get that battery a charge, so I can only imagine what they jumped it with in the first place, but after about 15 minutes we had the car running again. I sat with her and her son and talked for a little just to make sure it had the charge then I followed them to their destination to make sure everything was OK.

She tried to give me a $20 bill, and I told her ""Ma'am, I got to use my tow strap **AND** 4WD in the same day for the same thing (we live in Florida so this is rare), so believe it or not that's the most fun my truck's had in a while.""

Blerg_ShutItDown,"&gt;Asked a buddy for ride to the bank, came back to the car crazy asking him to drive. Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops came.

I used to work for the admissions department for a college, and if you had an arrest record you had to submit a statement about what happened, basically what you learned from it blah blah blah and a committee decided based upon this (and your actual record) whether you were admitted into the school.

I was the lucky one who read these initially, and then either approved minor offenses (DUIs, etc), denied super recent offenses (out of jail less than a year, sorry try again later) or sent the major ones on to the committee of important people above me. 

I could not BELIEVE how many I read that were along the lines of ""My buddy asked me to drive him to the convenience store, he came out running and told me to drive fast, I had no idea he was going to rob it and I got scared and took off.""

*Maybe* some were true, but every time I read one I thought ""What the hell, if my friend did that to me I'd sit there and wait for the cops and tell them I had no idea this crazy person was planning on robbing the store.""

At the register, I handle them in a few different ways. Some people I just don't speak to until they put the phone down. I'll scan their stuff, but just won't talk. This means the transaction will take a lot longer because most of them can't figure out that they have to scan their own credit cards or have to confirm the total.

For others, I just offer them everything possible (which is what corporate wants anyway). I ensure I get an response to every question.

""How are you doing today, ma'am?""

""Did you find everything ok?""

""We have paper on sale, 2 for $10. Would you like me to add that to your purchase?""

""It's flu season. Do you need any hand sanitizer?""

""Do you need any batteries?""

""Would you like to apply for our store credit card? We'll give you 10% off your purchase if you are approved.""

""It's pretty warm outside today. We have ice-cold drinks in the cooler.""

""Do you have your rewards card?""

""Would you like to sign up for our rewards program? Let me tell you all about it.""

""We offer an extended warranty on this product. It covers accidental damage and breakdowns for up to two years past the manufacturers warranty.""

""We now offer computer repair. Would you like to set up an appointment for a Free PC Check-Up?""

If they don't respond, I just repeat myself until they do. Once they put the phone down and treat me like a human being, I stop with the questions.

perfectdrug659,"My first job ever was in a small Italian pizzeria. I worked there for 8 months, and they shut down for some unfortunate reasons. After that, I got a job at another locally-owned pizza/sub place. 

When I handed in my resume, I was 18 with multiple facial piercings, blue and pink hair, and my clothing consisted highly of fishnet things. I was hired on the spot, yay! I've been with them for over 5 years, on and off since it does get stressful, and I'm not currently there, but my boyfriend is.

PROS

-Customer rude to me? I can tell them to fuck right off. No questions asked.

-I actually know the owner, he's a friend, I can talk to HIM about things, not have to jump through ropes to fix things.

-I can wear what I want, no real dresscode. Much more relaxed.

-I can get things ""on credit"" and take advances on my paycheck as I please.

-Everyone gets along great, and we've all known each other for years. For a while, there were 4 couples working, many family members, close friends, ect. I've been to every single one of my coworkers houses, and they've been to mine.

-Job security. Over 5 years, I've walked out, pissed off mid-shift at least 4 times now. I'm always welcome back, they love me and know that I'm human and can only handle so much stress.

-Awesome regulars. My store has been open almost 30 years, and there's many customers who have been regulars over a decade, which is cool. There's people who order every single day, which is crazy, but they love us.

-No one will ever rob us. We don't have corporate rules, we have a steal baseball bat. One guy found out the hard way, work got out I guess.

CONS

-Customers think that because we're a ""small business"" they are regulars if they order once or twice a month, and can get pissy when we don't remember things like their entire address or phone number

-Again, with the customers, they think we're dead with few customers. They give me their address which is a large apartment building, and when I ask for the unit number, they say ""the guys been here before"" Well, we have 8 different drivers, and at least 10 different apartments in your building order regularly! 

-People try to scam us like you wouldn't believe! They never get away with it though, but they do keep trying. And then we ban them!

-Owners/mangers family that SUCK and should be fired. I've had to deal with the previous owners daughter, and then the managers daughter. They were terrible workers, but they kept their jobs for as long as they wanted.

All in all, I'd much rather work for a small business! I've been with a big franchised company the past 3 months, and I'm going crazy being nice to people because I have to be. And uniforms...uggghhhh. I want to go back sometimes, but that place gets super crazy and stressful.

morgueanna,"I worked for a company that is now a large national chain but when I started it was pretty small. The pros were all the things you mentioned- very laid back atmosphere, regular customers, etc.

But I started to realize those were also cons as well. The laid back atmosphere lead to employees who were lazy and never got fired, so I had a lot more work on my hands because no one would make them do anything. Most of the regular customers were great, but then there were the ones you literally wanted to run and hide from but couldn't. 

When the chain got larger and more rules were implemented, it honestly improved the work environment. Sure, there was more paperwork and supervisor visits, but being able to hold people accountable for their actions took a lot of stress off me. And the regulars I didn't like so much came around less and less as the store became more 'corporate.'

Everyone's experience is different, but that was mine.

For the most part, I agree with a lot of your pros.

SamNextDoor,"I've worked in a small, family owned grocery store for my first job for two years and currently work for a large corporate retailer that is easily identifiable in red. 

Small grocery store PROS:
- I knew everyone who came in and what their usual order was (bakery/barista). I would do my usual ""Hi, LadyWhoGetsRedVelvetCupcakes!"" Or ""Hi, ManWhoGetsBlackCoffee!"" They usually got the same thing every time. 
- I learned how to write on cakes and how to make latte art. Art is a hobby of mine and was excited to learn a new edible form. 
- I got in through a friend and was able to work with her and make all new friends. They only hired people close to my personality which can best be described as happy-go-lucky and friendly. 
- I was trusted with new tasks every week and became a jack of all trades in a matter of months from cashing to latte making to cake baking and sometimes other departments. 

Small grocery store CONS:
- was usually left alone on super busy nights where I had a line of 10+ people deep to work my department built for 3 people minimum. 
- the owner was a tyrant that was known to fire people without warning for a minor mistake. Once fired a close coworker that was there 7 years out of the blue because he was on break too long by 10 minutes, on the phone with his wife. 
- I was well under appreciated, I learned new tasks myself to help out the store and met with a measly ""they'll do for now"" when I made well over 200 cupcakes by myself, no instruction. Just seen it done across the way (5 meters) only a handful of times. 
- I was stuck with tasks I was not equipped to do nor thought was sanitary (ie. forced to change the women's bathroom toilet paper when I informed the manager it was out) he literally just have me the rolls of toilet paper and told me to ""take care of it"". 
- the customers in this particular area were absolutely horrid. They were as entitled as the stereotypical Beverly Hills trophy wives. They looks down at you as if you were gum on their brand new coach shoes or what ever expensive shit they had. It wasn't uncommon to see a Mercedes or a jaguar pull up and spray tanned stay at home mom stroll in with a little girl in ballet outfit (ballet studio next door) and she's holding a brand new iphone when she can barely spell phone. Not only that, they were idiots and very hostile. One seriously asked me what kind of cake was the ""death by chocolate"" cake, and there was a piece missing so you can see inside! Then he got mad when I flatly said chocolate and turned away. 
- and finally the one thing that made me turn in my two weeks notice: the entire two years I was there, I can count on one hand how many lunch breaks I received.

They ignore them.

Send in your resume, and you will NOT get a response unless they like you.  None.  Nada.

Low level HR drone, looking at the resume in question, with ""PERMANENTLY REJECTED"" across the top.  ""Uhm.  I have no idea if we received it or not.  You could send it in again if you wish, just to be sure.""

All future resumes are carefully checked against the reject list, then routed to the circular file.

We won't tell you that we don't like you, we won't tell you why you are not a good fit, we do this because we have learned from experience that ANY negative feedback from us, even a simple, ""sorry, we're not interested"" will often result in you suing us for some imagined ""discrimination"".

ZennerThanYou,"The key with these kinds of promotions (the kind that commonly elicit a negative or frustrated response from customers) is in the explanation. I'm definitely not saying you're not delivering a perfectly logical and appropriate response... Just saying maybe a different approach might make your days a little less awful. 

Of course, I don't work there &amp; don't know all the details, but at another holiday-driven retail store I worked at, I often took an approach something like, ""I understand that you shop here often, and we truly appreciate your loyalty. The purpose of the $25 minimum purchase condition is to incentivise purchasing ALL of your thanksgiving items earlier, to avoid the list minute holiday rush. It's generally a win-win for our customers and for us."" 

The main point I'm making is that (in my experience), customers appreciate being educated, as opposed to, ""that's what the coupon says, so do it, or you don't get the discount."" 

The other way to handle it is, when they say they're buying a turkey &amp; want to use the coupon, say, ""Ok, great! I'll be right over here if you have any questions!"" and let the cashiers deal with it. I know... It's a shitty solution if you give two craps about the cashiers.

The barista and her go back and forth a bit, him insisting that he cannot let the dog stay as it is a food service establishment and it's clearly not a service dog, and her insisting that it's not fair because there's no sign on the door.

The resolution? The barista said ""Fine, why don't you tell me what you want and then you can take the dog outside and I'll bring it to you."" To which she happily responded ""Ok!"" and got to skip to the front of the line. What. The. Fuck.

anonydeadmau6,"Wait. Do you need your current glasses to see things close up, ie reading, or far away ie car plates and people across the street? 

If you need your glasses to see things up close, then they are reading glasses, in which case your prescription may be wrong, and you're entitled to get them checked.

If you need your glasses to see things far away you are short sighted. This means your glasses correct your vision for far away things, but not close up, because you don't need your close up vision corrected. If you're now squinting to read things that means you now need reading glasses (so if you need glasses to see things far away and now you need reading glasses as well, then that means you'll need to get bifocals, or you can keep your current pair and get another pair of glasses especially for reading).

This is just a simplified explanation, I'm in no way clinically trained, but I do work for an opticians so this is the sort of troubleshooting I do on a daily basis. 

Hope this helps, and helps you understand a bit more about glasses. Now you've got that knowledge you can go back and explain a bit better to your opticians so that they can help you or explain why they did what they did :) ",null,0,cdkoto1,1r8bvl,talesFromRetail,hot,2

Mine's a pretty long story (aka there's more than what I've typed out). Basically I'm 100% sure I have the wrong prescription. I was convinced by an associate to not return my glasses until long after their return policy (30 days). Which isn't written/typed..etc anywhere on any receipts (only on their website- sounds similar to Erika's Test). So I am stuck with two pairs of reading glasses that just give me headaches (total of $250).  

I've been told I could take the frames and get the correct prescription. Mostly I'm angry about having to shell out more money for something that should have been correct in the first place. The other part is taking the time out of my schedule to fix this too.

superspeck,"Heh. Actually, that reminds me of a time when I *did* school a cashier. I wasn't trying to get a discount or anything, he was just having a problem with a POS system at a place that I'd worked at while in high school. It was a regional camera store and is now national. This is about ten years ago, several years after I'd stopped working for them. 

I was buying up their stock of a slide film that had been discontinued. He was having a problem getting the machine to ring it up, because when looking up by the UPC barcode, the POS insisted that the product had been discontinued... yet it was obviously sitting right there on the counter, which meant it was probably in inventory, but under the retailer part number and not the UPC. I told him to hit the key that escaped to the manager menu, and walked him through looking it up by name. When it worked, he said that he had to go get his manager to make sure he'd done it correctly. Fine, I'll wait. 

Fatty McManager came stomping out of the back room with each step shaking the carefully plan-o-grammed displays and a cloud of steam coming from each ear. He asked me who the heck I was to tell his employee how to access HIS manager menu, and what was I trying to pull with having his employee ring up stuff that wasn't in inventory, and how the heck did I know anything about their system. I just said ""Yeah, I used to work at (low numbered store) back when the POS system was released, and y'all probably do it differently these days, but we had to use those menus because things were pretty broken when they were first installed."" That didn't appease Fatty McManager, though -- he said it was VERY irregular, and pompously declared that I should give him my associate number if I was indeed an employee. 

This company's POS system assigned a number to each associate for life. They were sequential, so you could tell when someone had been hired by how low their associate number was. 

I gave it to him, told him ""You can look me up in the computer (F8, menu 41), here's my driver's license. Address is obviously different but the name's the same, and so's the cell phone number. Oh, and what's your associate number?"" His was well up past a quarter million. I asked him if a particular district manager still worked for the company, and confided that his associate number was in the double digits. 

I got my film, and after Mr. McManager deflated, he actually gave me the employee discount, even though I didn't ask for it. 

tl;dr: There are cases where a customer might school a blowhard manager. Not that I think you, OP, are a blowhard. However, you might find out someday that you were just a number to the corporation. ",null,16,cdlcw22,1ragwd,talesFromRetail,hot,45

On occasion, I do the open-and-close method of turning the ringer off (it's quicker, don't have to find the button in the dark), and am surprised when the ringer goes off five minutes later because that actually puts the alarm on ""snooze"" instead of turning it off.

And let's not even start on what the mentally handicapped guy would do. He had a preference for finger painting with brown substances. Not always his own, either. Then of course he would sneak into the kitchen, make huge messes, and cost the home a fortune. He would steal things from people and hide them. He would even steal vital paperwork right out of the offices and flood the bathrooms by flushing it. He was such an ass. He knew he could get away with anything he wanted, and we couldn't touch him, because he'd cry to his social worker and get us in trouble if we tried to punish him.

devoidz,"In my store the managers have said that corporate wants us to use only self check outs at night. Funny that it happened the day after a customer service supervisor mentioned that is what they did in her store she transferred from. 

We used to keep one register open all night, and would open more when it got busy. We get weird rushes at 3am. 

So now, usually a few times a night I get an asshole customer that absolutely refuses to use them. At first managers still wanted us to push them to use them, and try not to use the other registers. When I say assholes, usually old white customers, for some reason they feel entitiled, and will not use them.  Not, I really don't want to do this, can you help me ? But the YOU ARE GOING TO RING THIS UP FOR ME !!! RIGHT ?!!! 

The other day I had a woman go to the register we used to keep open and start piling her shit on it. I was straightening up stuff near the registers, and mentioned that it was closed. Her head started spinning, telling me she has been through this with management before, and they told her it was OPEN. No matter what, no matter what time, it was open. I started explaining the new thing, we started a month or so out, and No it is open. I don't know what I am talking about it is open. I can either sell her stuff or not. Well not seemed to be an option, so I was like, um ok. And went back to what I was doing. a few minutes later she tracked me down, and asked if I was going to find someone to ring her up. Well no, that register is closed. I want to see a supervisor, I want a manager, this is ridiculous, omg, the is fucking crazy. Rant rant rant. I said ok, fine, I will ring you up. But for future reference, the managers have made us shut down that register at 1:30 and after that, only self check out is open. As I was ringer her up one of the managers decided to show up, and talk to the supervisor, that had also just showed up. She wanted to speak to them. After I finished her order, I went back to what I was doing. She apparently complained to them, then called to complain to my store manager, then came in the next night to bitch at my other supervisor. I had the next two days off, so I mentioned it to my other super. She told me about her coming in and calling the other manager. After she complained to the first manager, he walked by me without saying anything. I never got in any trouble. If I see that woman in my store again, fuck her, I am not doing anything for her. If she asks me to, sorry I refuse to help you. You went way beyond trying to get me in trouble, talk to someone else.

MagpieChristine,"The grocery self-checkouts here seem really poorly designed. When they first came in, you needed to get the attendant to override for you when you started, because putting your bags in the bagging error would trigger the scale. (It's not bad that the scale is that sensitive, but the ""add bags"" button is an entirely necessary feature.) 

I think they might even let you take bags off and add new ones these days (I never buy that much at the self checkout, because every time it burps I have to wait for the overworked attendant). 

My biggest beef with them is that the grocery store in the mall has ONLY self-checkouts at the mall entrance. Sure, I get that it's not really feasible to have two sets of conventional checkouts, but I hate having to carry my bags of groceries back through the store, past the self-checkout, to be able to leave.

Patient000,"I've had similar experiences. I started my second job/first long-term position in May; I quit a little while ago. Summer went like this: I turned into the general back-up, asked to cover most people's shifts and often saving my shift switches for the coming school year. Worked for everyone, and I still got to have a life. Ran into a few problems and all the crazy shit seemed to happen when there were barely more than 3 of us in the building at any time, but it was ok.

September went like this: ramped up my studying for an entrance exam in October, trying to keep up with 2 very high-level classes and a senior course load, and dealing with long work hours. LONG work hours--hours I should never have been pulling every day, but everybody else would be hard to reach between 12-8 am. Our night shift lady would be left without backup unless she called me, so she called me and we formed an alliance; she was the only person who had/has my back from that place, which was a godsend in that environment. I was sleeping &lt;4 hours ~5 nights every week, eating irregularly, barely scraping by in my classes and ended up having 3 nervous breakdowns from the stress.     

Did that stop anyone from asking me to cover for them or trying to guilt-trip and lie to me about their reasons? No. They all knew I was stressed and depressed; the staff ""joke"" was that I never slept. My boss said she was praying for me, which was probably the only thing she ever really did on my behalf. She did decide to schedule me to work a shift that started 8pm 11/28--8am 11/30, because ""nobody else can do it, and you get paid for day duty [8a-4p] friday!"" Yeah... real helpful. She loved playing therapist with me as practice for her future career; you could see her calculating her textbook ""active listening"" responses and seeing how much experience we could give her, instead of acting like a team leader and taking initiative.

My favorite was one of the girls who asked me to cover 6 shifts for her in a row. I declined when she asked me 4 hours before her first shift: ""I would, but I have something going on right now [i.e. a life]."" Her: ""Well do you know when your ""something"" is going to end?"" Turns out I was busy until she stopped asking...which was the day I quit, a week later.

I doubt my GPA will remain untouched from what that job did to me.

I noticed a woman looking at SD cards so I decided to help her out (gotta use that CS degree!).  I sat there for about 10 minutes answering her questions and being quite pleasant.  Without realizing it, I was subconsciously flipping a quarter in my right hand. Towards the end of the conversation she goes ""you know, that is INCREDIBLY RUDE"" of you to be flipping that quarter while you help me!"" in one of the meanest voices I had heard while at the job.  Taken aback, I repeated which was best for her then walked back to the office to continue my slacking.  I repeated to my coworker in there what had happened, and since I no longer cared about the job, capped off the story with a yell of ""AND I HOPE SHE CHOKES ON A DICK AND DIES"".  She was still in the camera area and had the most sour look on her face.

There was a bakery in the store, which was one of the first departments to totally shut down, so we were nice enough to transfer all the cake orders to one of our competitors down the street. Most of the cakes were simple for birthdays and what not, but one happened to be for a wedding. I can't remember exactly what the problem was with the other store's bakery, but for whatever reason they weren't going to be able to get the wedding cake done on time or exactly how she wanted it. I do know that wedding cakes are usually scheduled far in advance, and if the bakery already has multiple wedding orders, they may not be to get it done on short notice. They are super labor intensive and usually require a delivery and set-up as well. Yeah it's a bummer, but we didn't have any choice as corporate was shutting us down.

Cue very angry and screaming bride-to-be...

(paraphrasing what I can remember)

BTB: ""The other store just called me and said they couldn't get my wedding cake done, so I'll need you guys to make it still.""

Store Manager: ""Our bakery is shut down. We don't have any bakers or decorators working here anymore. I'm sorry, but there's really nothing we can do about it.""

BTB: ""I'm getting married in 3 weeks and I can't even get a cake!!! This is fucking bullshit!!!"" (and a lot more yelling and screaming)

 - I work in a jewelry store and we are coming to one of the biggest times of the year (christmas), we have our Nov/Dec catalogue out with amazing deals so people have been shopping like mad.

To start off, the day had been going pretty **badly** from the start, people bitching 'cause they can't get a better deal, bargains not being big enough, seeing our brand merchandise in a competitive store for a cheaper price, etc. However, the day really started doing horribly when I got a sale stolen from me. 

Two guys walked in to buy a heap of christmas present, the two of them together (brothers) dropped nearly 13 grand on various things (mostly 3-5 grand chains, rings etc.), I was serving them for about an hour, biggest single sale of the day but still about 10 grand behind the months best. These two gentleman were about too pay, we were at the register and one of the other sales assistants came over and said that Our manager wanted her to ***take*** ***over***. 

I reluctantly said ok, I asked if I could go talk  to said manager after sale but she said no, so I told the customers I would be back in a jiffy (minute or so I was back) and serve them. The other sales assistant stated she would stay by the merchandise and the customers while I was with the manager, I come back and the two guys are all bagged up, there merchandise boxed and a near 14 grand sale gone through this other girls ID giving her the sale and a hefty commission (just over $2500) which should have been mine. 

The thing was, the manager was just asking if I could give her, her keys back as she gave them to me to look after as she needed to use the toilet. I had a bit of a rant at the other sales assistant, the manager asked what was going on, I explained the situation, the other sales assistant said ""she could make the sale as I said to do so, and that even if I didn't she has been there longer than me so she had the right, she also stated they needed to leave but even so she can still allocate the sale to me on the sales program we use. 

The two customers heard what happened, made a formal complaint, asked to see the manager, thanked me for my happiness and service and left.

Battery Store:  Go deal with the car battery that exploded in back, again.  don't mind the bags of loose lithium either.

Furniture store:  Operating the phones on a major shopping holiday.  every other call needs a sales person and there are zero available salesmen/women.

Big box store warehouse:  Retrieve the washing machine off the top shelf (about 20 feet high at least) by having someone else raise you up on the forklift.  also, our safety harness broke last week, so good luck.  (i quit right after that one)

renting out strollers at the zoo:  Battle the wasp infestation in the candy bins.  (this one wasn't assigned to be management, I took it upon myself.  almost got fired for it too)

amusement park/college/convention center/buffet/pet hospital (long story):  Emptying the garbage bins out front that haven't been emptied all summer.  smelled like rotting ketchup.

At my favorite store, I did ask the produce guy if they had any ""in the back"" and to his credit, he told me they had them first thing in the morning, but they were long gone.

Last night I stopped at a small local grocer, and they not only had a giant bin of loose ones, they had the stalks. There were stalks piled up with the rest of the vegetables, there were stalks on a special 6' shelving unit by the front door, and there were stalks on another unit at the end of the aisle. 

When I was checking out, I thanked the cashier for thinking ahead and stocking so much. She looked at me like I was crazy.  From now on, I'm just paying for my sprouts and leaving.

iasked1iam1,"The moment she brought up the business, she actually became guilty of two other things (potentially, laws may vary). For one, she is now slandering, as the business owes no money and she is potentially staining the reputation of the business by saying such a thing. For another, if it could be construed that she was coming between the business and their customers, and causing the business material harm, she could be in violation of another law designed to protect the right of a business to conduct their transactions.

You need to have a conversation with your boss when this lady is not present. She is potentially causing you harm, also, if the business were to be damaged through her actions or, possibly, if your boss were to use company assets to pay her off despite this being about his brother. Tell him that you understand his personal situation, but when it bleeds into the business it needs to be handled and not ignored, or else his problems could compound, and you and your coworkers will get dragged into the mess. 

Tell him you are quite capable of handling the intrusion yourself, so he doesn't need to be involved in a conflict that he wants no part of. Assure him that you are looking out for both him and the store. He wouldn't want his business to suffer because of an employee's private affairs, and he shouldn't let his own get in the way, either. He has the biggest stake in the company, but everyone he is paying for their work also does, and they shouldn't be subject to this lady's unnecessary, stress inducing presence while they are there.

Let him know that the next time she shows up, you will give her the option of making a purchase and leaving, or skipping right to the leaving part. If she refuses, you will tell her that the police will be summoned, and she will be charged with trespassing. Let her know that if she attacks the business verbally like she did on this occasion, further charges will be pressed if applicable.  

In short, make sure your boss knows that if the lady continues her antics, you'll do everything you were going to do after he left last time while he is still there, acting on behalf of the business and your co-workers. My guess is that the boss will initially balk at the idea, but with a little push on your part he'll actually be glad to know that there's a plan if she returns, and that someone else can take charge of the situation.",null,5,cdnn2ex,1rhnqp,talesFromRetail,hot,17

I don't have a problem with church, I go with my devote Christian mother whenever I visit, but I have no interest in religion. I go because it makes her happy and I love spending time with my family. 

So they invite me to church and I'll try and brush it off with ""Maybe, yeah. I might make it out there."" Some people drop it there, but about half keep pushing. They then ask me where I go to church and then keep pressuring me to come to church with them. They'll offer to pick me up from my house and I can come over and they make me lunch and all sorts of things. It usually devolves into a really awkward conversation at this point so I usually just tell them I have to work every Sunday and most of them understand and leave it alone.

b0rk1983,"Im curious on how the manager cant understand questions from employees or do more than one thing at once without brain exploding.

I work at a fast food restraunt known the world over.
Our breaks are 30 minutes put on a schedule days in advance and we are required to take the breaks when they are put down on schedule. This never happens, some days I never get a break at all.

If a manager/supervisor tells you to take a break, you take that break. If they complain, refer them to said manager. IF said manager said they ""didnt understand your question"" but said yes anyways to a question they didnt understand/hear I would make note of this complaint and bring it up to someone higher than your supervisor/manager such as an Assistant Store Manager or Store Manager (even as high as a district manager)

I cannot understand how someone can be a keyholder or in a position of power if they cannot handle employee questions and say ""yes"" to something they didnt understand. Would they do the same to customers too? Your DM will not like that. Nor would corporate.

If you leave your job, leave the DM a note explaining your reasons why with documentation, it sounds bad but in my mind you would be doing the DM a favor by letting him know exactly why you left.",null,0,cdnu9eb,1rj9d7,talesFromRetail,hot,5

They'd tell you to go do carts. You go outside to do carts and you see an elderly woman struggling to put her bags away. So you stop pushing the carts, making sure not to block anyone trying to back out, and you help her - and continue with the carts. THEN, you go back in - and they yell at you for *helping a customer*, because you took an extra 2 minutes to do carts.

So the next time I do carts, same situation. Old guy who has like 8 big bags of charcoal under his carriage - who clearly could use help - is in my sights. But, because I don't want to get yelled at, I pass right by him (and feel like absolute *shit*). And guess what? I go inside, same manager yells at me for *not* helping a customer.

cak3isyummy,"Let's pretend my name is Amy.

I worked at the deli in a pretty well known super market. This guy came up one day and asked what my name is, weird since I'm wearing a name tag but whatever. 
Me: My name is Amy. 
Him: What a nice name *Amy*. Are you new? 
Me: Yes I just started working here last month. Can I help you with something?  
Him: In a bit thanks. I'm from New York. That's why I have this accent. 

While not an all out creepy first meeting, it just got weird every time I saw him for the next few days and weeks. He'd come in, ""Hello *Amy*"" ""How are you doing *Amy*""

Every single time I saw him he'd emphasize my name in a way that made me feel dirty. While I don't remember any exact conversations, he'd start asking to see me outside of work, or if I rode the bus so he could walk me to my stop. Eventually I noticed that he was never ready to order until I was available to help him. One day I went home really upset about something he said and my mom told me to let my manager know. (First job ever, I was scared of getting fired for every little thing and didn't know my rights.)

So I told my manager and she said the next time it happens to let her or the second in command know. The next day he shows up and I let the assistant manager know. While he was taking care of it, one of my coworkers told me that that guy has been kicked out multiple times for stealing.

Techsupportvictim,"We have mall alarms that go off all the time. And internal ones for our store, if both go off we clear the store right away.

The other fun though is that we deal with soft cell batteries. Easy to puncture if you aren't trained to deal with them. You literally have to take a week long course in how to handle them, safety rules etc. Anyone comes back to so a battery replacement they are right next to a fire extinguisher and open fire safe. These are lithium based batteries and yes if they are torn they can explode. 

Guy comes in griping about how his phone gets really hot, smells funny. Slams it down on the counter in front of me. I pull up the serial since it was turning on, preparing to start trouble shooting etc. I notice it's rather warm and that the display seems off, lifted up even. His comment about the smell makes me nervous so I say I'm going to go to the back and have a look at it.

Now I'm happen to be the only tech on duty trained to handle batteries (the other two were on lunch). Once I'm out of the customers sight I radio the mangers to stand by as we have a potential battery fire risk. Yep, we are code orange boys and girls. 

I clear the room as my manager comes in and grabs the fire extinguisher. Warehouse has been alerted and all runs to the floor are paused and they are standing by to clear out. Floor managers are standing by clear the sales floor without alerting the customers just yet. 

Fire safe is open. Tongs at the ready. Neutralizer is in tray. Safety goggles, face mask and apron on (yeah seriously). Manager also has safety gear on

Deep breath, unscrew the bottom. Generally attach suction and lift up the tray. 

Two things catch my eye, one the battery casing is white (ours are black. Two, there is a freaking screw embedded in the middle of the battery.

Split second later the smell is worse. The mask is basically one if those dust things so I can still smell some of it. 

It's like a scene out of a movie. I hear Sam Jackson ""oh hell no"" in my head as a grab the tongs, phone into the tray, tray into the safe and slam the door and lock it. My manager is on the radio at the same time basically screaming ""thermal event this is NOT a drill"". Warehouse manager hits the fire alarm for our store which also alerts the mall. 

End of the story, mall is cleared out, fire department called, took two hours to clear the store for anyone to go back in and we couldn't go into repair room for like 12 hours until the neutralizer absorbed the fumes and the safe could be opened. I was sent home with pay and I got to have to go to doctor and cleared to come to work because I might have been exposed. phone actually caught fire in the safe and was a charred mess. Company was nice enough to let the guy pay for a service swap with the understanding that the third party battery actually voided the warranty etc

I was shopping in a store in a plaza one day when the fire alarms started going off.  No one seemed concerned about this.  The two employees were at the counter looking totally lost and confused and the customers were shopping like nothing was happening (typical customers).  

I asked one employee if that was the fire alarm.  She said she wasn't sure but that it sounded like one.  I told her to get the customers out just in case something was wrong.  She told me that the fire alarm was connected to all the stores in the plaza and the fire mightn't be in this store.  I told her it didn't matter, to get everyone out and to ask her boss about the procedure for a fire alarm so she would know in  the future.

As everyone left the store, people were coming out of the other stores in the plaza and I could hear fire trucks in the distance.  I had other shopping to do so I left.

Only one per account.

When we ran out of pumpkins we had one guy flip his shit at us for not saving any for people who were coming later. First some first serve asshole.

When it got too busy make balloons another man flipped out because his kid really wanted one.

No jokes about it being free if it doesn't scan

Don't shop. Buy, sure, but don't shop. Especially this weekend. Do your homework online etc and keep the questions to a minimum. We have a shirt ton of folks to help and being caught up for half an hour by someone with a million questions and no real intention to buy is not cool

You will have to wait. Get over it or buy online. 

Don't get mad if we don't know the answer to your random and obscure question. It doesn't make us morons, we just have to remember a ton of things about a ton of stuff. If you ask nicely we will try to find the answer and then we will both know

Know the rules about when you need your id for what things and don't give us crap about it. Yes you need it to buy liquor, yes you need it to pick up your prepaid order, yes you need it to pay by check. 

If you are going to a shop that price matches have the damn flyer with you and don't give us crap when we say we have to verify the online sale or sorry but that was a door buster and since you can't get it now at 2pm because it was only good until 10am. Same with items we had as door busters. See that big sign that says no rain checks. That means no. 

Leave the purse pup and kids at home. If you must bring the kids make sure they are military grade behaved. Nothing is worse this time of year than a dog in a store or kids running around like maniacs and the parents think it's cute. It's not.

Don't give us shit if the corporate office decided to send Christmas decorations or that Santa is satan and we should have baby jesus on things. Or that we say happy holidays to be 'inclusive'

Don't demand special treatment because of who you are,how much you are spending etc. If the rule is one per customer don't ask us to ring up ten separate transactions. If you want things bagged a certain way,do it yourself. And tell us before we start that you need a gift receipt. If you forget don't get pissy with us that it takes time to reprint or we ask you to go to the service desk 

Pay attention to closed signs or if I am ringing someone and I have turned out my light and tell you I am closed then I am closed. Don't give me crap. I told you before you started piling your stuff up. I likely legally have to take my meal break or it's the end of my shift and my rat bastard boss allows zero overtime. I will walk away and leave you standing there.

Stay off they damn phone. Seriously if someone is trying to help you don't be yacking in your phone. Don't hold up my line while I'm waiting for you to swipe your card so you can take about little foofoo's poop issue or whatever. If we are on the sales floor and you just need to call your husband because you can't decide, fine.but don't expect me to stand there for 20 minutes with you for moral support. I have folks waiting. My boss demands that I walk away. And yes that means you might have to wait a moment once you are off the call. But I promise I'll get back to you ask quickly as I can. 

Don't give us shit about our warranties etc. We have to pitch it or we aren't doing our jobs. Just zone out for ten seconds if you like. But don't tell us to shut up, yell at us for scamming folks etc. If you really think that then find a lawyer and deal with corporate.

Tell them a story about the same situation. It doesn't even have to be true.

Try this out.

""I'm sorry madam, but our manager accidentally sold to someone underage last week and got a $10,000 fine! We have to ID everyone. Rules is rules.""

It takes the focus off their transaction and big pictures it for them. Suddenly they don't think they have to convince you to drop your silly little rule... they realise they are actually trying to convince you to risk a $10k fine; and who is going to risk that just for someone else's smokes? Friggin' NO-ONE that's who.

I used to use this on people who wanted to pay by cheque.

""Sorry, we can't accept cheques as cash. You can let it clear and then come pick your stuff up. I'll call you when it clears.""

""BUT MY CHEQUES NEVER BOUNCE! Are you accusing me of writing dodgy cheques?!!!""

""No, sorry. The manager gave in and took a cheque last week and we got screwed for $1800. No more risks.""

""Oh, OK. I guess I'll just go to the bank and come back with cash.""

It's a clever, polite way of saying ""Nice try. But we JUUUST got fucked over by this exact thing and there's no way in hell I'm bending the rules for you.""",null,4,cdojpe5,1rla4l,talesFromRetail,hot,41

I told her that if something like that happens again and the customer DOES touch her, to scream. Scream loud, scream with all the panic in her shy, anxious soul. No words, just noise. They did not have a right to touch her and this is nature's signal that the other person is out of line and send help quickly.

Cousin did as advised. According to her sister (who also worked there as an asst. manager) it was the howl of a thousand banshees. EVERYONE came running to see this large woman gripping my tiny cousin's wrist in an apparent death vice. Later, cousin said she wasn't actually hurt, just scared. 

Customer was ejected immediately and is banned from the store. Cousin said that she actually felt better from the scream and the aftermath was not as bad as other occasions.

First off, those coupons are the worst things ever. I one time had a woman who didn't understand why her coupon for $15 off a purchase $45-$74.99 didn't automatically bring her purchase down to $30, when she had spent $65. Holy shit. She literally did not understand how subtraction and addition worked, and there was no way for me to explain it to her without being condescending, which only pissed her off more.

Second off, the fact that we could not delete coupons after scanning them nearly made me cry on several occasions, i.e., psycho coupon lady hands me a 50% off coupon after I've scanned a stack of 40% off coupon and it screws up the entire order. I would usually just smile and enter it as a special discount it by hand so that they didn't try to murder me.

Third off, if a customer came behind my register, I would have called the manager up immediately and told the customer to get out from behind the register, even if they hadn't touched me. My store was not in the safest area, and there had been several stores that were robbed at gunpoint within a couple blocks.

etterboce,"To everyone who keeps saying she should file criminal charges against the customer, I agree in theory. However, even if OP knows who the customer is, simply calling the police could result in her termination depending on the company. 

It's a really terrible thing, but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization. And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hired.

I don't know how I would have reacted. I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place, but I'm not sure. In times like that, it's hard to say how any of us would really have reacted. I've had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years, and I've never reacted completely how I would have expected.

Either way, I'm sorry you had this happen to you, OP. Nobody has a right to put their hands on you. Next time, the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation, call a manager, and fill out an incident report. Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary. And do not ever serve that customer again. Even if management will not ban her, let them know that you will not wait on her.

I thanked him and asked him to pull around for a wait on his food. Before he goes he hands me a couple bucks, saying that I had amazing customer service. Tried to refuse, oh no take it!

I was pretty embarrassed at this point, for working in customer service I'm pretty freaked out by strangers. His kindness was appreciated, but gave me a bit of a panic attack. Asked my manager to take out the food, and he agrees. He returns with more money from this guy, saying he had nothing but nice words to say about me. We then hear a beep in the drive-thru, go to the window to say we're closed and guess who it is? It's him again! With a tip from his girlfriend this time.

Please don't make rash opinions and labels on both the game and the communities over this. Our communities are actually very strong and very tight knit.

johnnydakota,"I work in a bar where one manager thinks we're all replaceable and I have literally only heard him say one positive comment to staff in the year that he's been in the position and that was to one specific person who cleaned the bathroom well. I've been at the place just about as long as he has and because of this many people come to me before him when they have issues.

I make sure to tell people when they're doing well, I thank people for their effort, even if they're just doing their basic tasks. I will go over to the next station and ask ""You doing okay? You need help? Okay, come to me for anything"". I'm not a manager. I'll never be a manager at the place and I know this.

I've had people come to me and tell me I'm too good for the place and I have a lot more potential than I give myself credit for. Because the other manager is such a dick to everyone, morale is way down, people have up and quit because they don't want to deal with him, and inventory has been fucked because people just don't care anymore. I love my job but I'm not happy where I work anymore because of these issues.

I don't really have a point to all that but I just want to agree. Yes, management, please tell your employees ""thank you"", ""good job"", and make sure they're happy. I promise you, your employees will enjoy work more and it will show in the business. You can have a line to draw when it comes to getting personal but take an interest in your staff. Even if it's something small, like, if you know someone is interested in sports and you saw the same game or something, talk to them about it. It's not showing weakness, it's making a connection. In turn, I believe employees will be more honest with you and try harder.",null,2,cdps306,1rpynq,talesFromRetail,hot,13
