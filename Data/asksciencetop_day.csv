Tetanus obviously has an influence in the muscle fiber relaxation period, but is this due to Ca2+ molecules or ACh being stuck in the synaptic cleft?

Being that they both occupy chemically regulated channels and so influence the depolarization of the membrane thus causing a larger peak tension.

However, this seems to be treating areas of gas molecules as though they are a coherent aggregation, like a solid.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Is there something wrong with my sources, does the world's 4th largest tidal power plant only supply power for a measly 350,000 people or am I just totally not understanding how to calculate poer generation vs consumption?

fencepost13302,7,,1,1rgu88,,3,"I just started reading The Dragons of Eden and I found this paragraph very strange:
Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.
