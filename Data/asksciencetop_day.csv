Hyperchema,321,496,1rhu7r,1009,Sorry if my terminology is rough but I have always thought of space as infinite yet I only really see flat diagrams representing the solar system and in some cases the galaxy But with the infinite nature of space if there is so much stretched out before us would there also be as much above and below us,I always see representations of the solar system with the planets existing on the same plane If that is the case what is above and below our solar system,1505,askscience

LetThemEatWar,5,2,1rgf8v,11,I know that they say an area of hot air becomes less dense and so it rises above colder areas of air However this seems to be treating areas of gas molecules as though they are a coherent aggregation like a solidTo explain my question let me refer to an example a plank of wood floats because the molecules constituting it are less densely packed and so water is held down more strongly pushing up the wood relative to the water at least thats my understanding But what if there was a single constituent molecule from that wood existing in the water Would it float It is neither densely nor sparsely aggregated existing all by itself So back to my original question arent the individual molecules that make up a heated area of air independent like a single molecule from that wooden plank And if so why do they act like an aggregated body with those molecules around them just because they are at the same temperature Thanks Hope this made sense to someone,Why does a single gas molecule which is hot rise above another one which is cool,13,askscience

fencepost,7,1,1rgu88,3,I just started reading The Dragons of Eden and I found this paragraph very strangeQuoteThe information content of any message is usually described in units called bits which is short for binary digits The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not  digits as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers but only two  and  Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit or  yes or no If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs Thus if a single chromosome has five billion  x   nucleotides it contains twenty billion  x   bits of informationEnd QuoteIt seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs would be n not n Each letter would provide a single bit of information Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however each letter represents two bits of information and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be n Thus if a single chromosome has  billion nucleotides Im assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse the chromosome contains  billion bits of information not Am I just misreading this or do you guys agree that there is an error here I would hate to think that such a well known book by such a famous author had such an obvious mistake in it but thats what it looks like to me Any commentary,Has Carl Sagan made an information theory mistake here or am I just misunderstanding something,4,askscience

alternativemax,27,21,1rhwdb,34,Torque is a vector the crossproduct of the force vector and r the vector representing the distance of the applied force from the center of rotation Since the torque vector is the crossproduct of two vectors it is also by definition orthogonal perpendicular to both force and r vectors In many cases this results in a torque vector that is in or out of the page I understand the significance and applications of the magnitude of the torque vector but what significance does its direction haveRelated question it is known that tangential acceleration  angular acceleration  r In this situation the units of r must be in metersradian How is this possibleThanksEDIT I understand the righthand rule and how to find the direction of the torque vector however it is the significance of this direction that I do not understand,Why is the direction of the torque vector significant,55,askscience
SovV,2,14,1rgx9w,23,Hi Im not sure if this is the right place for me to post or not but Ive got nowhere else to goHere it goes Im a first year chiropractic student and I have to write an essay about the properties of nerve conductionsIve been writing about this for a long time and in the end found myself being confused wether summation occurs due to excessive Ca or acetylcholine ACh in the synaptic leftOr is Ca a part of ACh and does it just split offAnyway Im trapped at the subject of tetanusTetanus obviously has an influence in the muscle fiber relaxation period but is this due to Ca molecules or ACh being stuck in the synaptic cleft And do they both have same effect on the postsynaptic membrane Being that they both occupy chemically regulated channels and so influence the depolarization of the membrane thus causing a larger peak tensionThanks in advanceNote I am talking about a series of stimuli that take place on intervals of HzHzHzHz,Influence of Ca or ACh on muscle relaxation and tetanus,37,askscience
OneLegAtATime,6,3,1rg990,21,I understand that geostationary orbit is achieved with an equatorial orbit with a period of one sidereal day What I dont understand is why there would be a hour launch window for the Falcon  currently on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral if both the intended geostationary location and the launch pad are relatively stationary on a rotating reference frame theyre orbiting the earth at the same angular velocity I always assumed that launch windows became a problem when other celestial bodies are concerned but why cant they launch this rocket at any time,Why does the Falcon  have a hour launch window to go into geostationary orbit,24,askscience
Posty,12,18,1rgzjd,20,So my roommates and I are having a drunken conversation and were wondering if its possible for a women getting dpd to have two ovaries impregnated by two different men during the same sexual encounter  Obviously after a sperm impregnates an ovum the Ca shield prevents a second sperm from entering  But is there some extraova protection that would prevent a third party sperm from impregnating another ovum,Dual pregnancy by two different men,38,askscience

mrhelton,6,4,1ri6wl,8,A guy I work with keeps telling me that putting a fan behind a space heater will make the room heat up slower I argued that the same amount of heat is being produced by the heater and in addition the fans motor would produce even more heat and possibly even friction from the blades I said it would just disperse the heat in the room rather than letting it pool up in one areaCan anyone here settle this,Please help settle a workplace feud regarding space heaters and fans,12,askscience
