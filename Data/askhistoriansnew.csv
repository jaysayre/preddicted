conpassionate,0,0,1rio7f,6,The replacement of legionnaires with allied foederati armies is often suggested as one of the major reasons for the collapse of the empire  This seems reasonable enough as relying on unruly vassals with huge armies for defense seems like a pretty bad idea in retrospectBut what led to this shift in the first place  Why not break up Frankish and Gothic armies and incorporate them into the legions which seems like the safer option  Was it a matter of funding or manpower  Or were the Romans never in a position to make such demands,How and why did the Romans become so reliant on the foederati,6,askhistorians
jamiebyrondean,2,0,1rindw,11,I am interested specifically in the personal daytoday life of the individual Southern civilianThere is a great mythology in the south about the unbelievable evil and brutality that the Yankees  Lucifers legions  brought in their victory campaigns towards the end of the war  the obvious examples being of course Shermans March to the SeaAs I understand it Shermans March was composed of several similar acts the Battle of Meridian in which he practiced the sort of total war he would later commit to entirely the march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah and the march across the Carolinas which was both the worst South Carolina and the most lenient North CarolinaI am trying to figure out how bad really these campaigns were for the south Does it live up to the mythology  raping pillaging plundering roving bands of criminals mass starvation  of horror and unthinkable tragedyThe fact that the south rebuilt so quickly makes me think it wasnt really that bad and that the mythology was deliberately and easily built up out of a fairly civil  if not terribly wasteful and destructive  campaign Can anyone weigh in on this topic How bad were Shermans marches How bad did the worst of life get during the war and where did that happen What was the most horrifying part of the war  both in terms of military like Picketts charge and civilian life life in the aftermath of Shermans march Thanks I hope this question is focused and answerable enough for you guys,How bad did life get for the South in the final year of the American Civil War,11,askhistorians

EbenSquid,1,0,1r14h8,1,Reading most works from the ancient world there is a distinct lack of narrative detail and Im wondering why this was and when the modern narrative detail began to emerge For example in the Odyssey it takes Odysseus perhaps twelve pages to defeat his wifes suitors what should be the climax of the work The author the semimythical bard Homer does not witness this from the perspective of any particular character There are no thoughts of the characters on what is occurring while detailed when it comes to the actual bloodletting the Suitors are no little more than names and genealogies  For example Odysseus sends his son to retrieve more weapons and armor gt Telemakhos did as his father said and went off to the store room where the armor was kept He chose four shields eight spears and four brass helmets with horsehair plumes He brought them with all speed to his father and armed himself first while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor and took their places near Odysseus A modern narrative this single paragraph would likely have been twelve pages on its own as Telemakhos rushed from the scene of battle to the hidden storeroom with a side discussion of its being hidden to prevent theft by the suitors his hasty fumble for the equipment his rejection of breastplates for the lack of time to put them on his recruitment of the heretofore unmentioned stockman and previously mentioned swineherd or was it the other way around and finally his return to his father just as Odysseus fires his final arrow  The narratives from antiquity that are not plays appear to be the worst offenders of what any creative writing professor would call telling not showing Why are these works so short on narrative detail  The expense of paper Or lack of previous examples to build on Culture Artistic choiceBonus Are there any prerenaissance works that do read like a modern novel Especially interested in ancient works but I know most of our surviving ancient writings are treatise like Platos  letters like Ciceros  and Plays Uggg Cant stand reading a play Watch it sureDouble Bonus What do you suppose an ancients reaction would be to a modern narrative Say If Doctor Who accidentally dropped his Latin copy of The Game of Thrones Would the be more likely to appreciate our descriptionheavy style where the narrator lives in the head of his characters or would he likely find it too much Edit Spelling,Narrative Detail in the Ancient world,1,askhistorians

SnakeGD,4,0,1qxbtm,2,Im interested in the religious climate during the First Crusade This is a long one and the question is a bit wide but I thought Id pose it in case anyone else was particularly interested at the momentThe last text Ive read has been Thomas Asbridges The First Crusade and in it he suggests more pragmatic compulsions for the European leadership than what might be described as religious zealFrom Asbridges depiction of Bohemond I for instance I have the impression that the crusade was seen as military expedition for this warlike and predatory individual I have a difficult time seeing figures such as Bohemond believing that they were doing the work of God But Im concerned Im oversimplifying or missing the sort of Christianity that existed in his timeIn the same book Asbridge asserts that Saladin had rather cynical or pragmatic reasons for his association with the Caliph rather than genuine religious ones I believe it was Nur alDin who was described in a similar fashion using the guise of religious unity to give credibility to conquest and to secure cooperation and subordination to his own interests while being cheered on as a championThe reason for this question is that Ive seen it claimed offhand that the crusaders were compelled  by a more ingrained religiosity than moderns would be familiar withI know that the ancient Greeks had a relationship with their gods that is alien to me being a modern raised Catholic and an atheist With skeptics like Xenophanes writing freely however I get the impression that there was no dogma and of course there was no church and no pope to create the atmosphere I associate with modern religious belief However while other intellectuals such as Herodotus took a scientific approach to the gods they still seem to have actually believed in them literallySo Im curious as to what the most prominent theories are  whether addressing the common people or the nobles of this time  as to the nature of belief during this period Was it similar to postHomeric Greece in that while deeply ingrained within society the nobility were not exactly motivated or controlled by religious conviction Surely it would be absurd to imagine a Hellenic crusade driven by the command of the gods  they did not seem to command that sort of primacy The question then Did the Catholic Church combine pragmatic goals conveniently but genuinely with their religious convictions Or can it be said that Urban II used the Church and religious belief as a vehicle for his own advancement A complex mix of these things that can be described as the religious climate Did anyone who wasnt a clear fanatic or member of the clergy actually believe they were fighting for penance or for the good of the Abrahamic God as far as we can tell Or were they really interested in the classic promise of plunder or a new start in a new land free of debt or what have you and for the nobility a fresh kingdomOf course I realize that any evidence for I guess you would call this the historiography of the First Crusade is sort of conjectureIm talking about generalizing a feeling of belief and I know thats a bit crazy but Id like to hear opinions on this ,Do we know how genuineearnest religious feelings were for the first crusaders,2,askhistorians

thecaramel,0,0,1qwlcr,17,I imagine for the large history of firearm technology it might have been easier to subdue civilians with a good old fashioned club rather than a firearm I also imagine that some time in history a firearm quickly became of apparent use to law enforcement typesI do realize that not all law enforcement agencies presently issue firearms to all of their field personnel but I imagine that the issuance of firearms for a law enforcement capacity must have been introduced at some point to meet a change in law enforcement targets Do we know when this happened and where What were the doctrines of the day in terms of acceptable level of force Were they considered more or less brutal than other physical uses of force,When and where were firearms first adopted in professional permanent law enforcement agencies How widespread were they,17,askhistorians
