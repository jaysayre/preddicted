People would get up to the window after standing in line probably 10 minutes and then ask me what was good, and hem and haw over what they wanted to see, sometimes bickering amongst themselves, meanwhile I'm just standing there watching the line grow and wondering why the hell they hadn't figured out what they wanted to see either before they even got to the theater or while they were waiting in line with a clear view of the board of movies playing.

I was just recently hired and didn't know a lot about the area. Especially the wrapped cucumbers which we rarely had.

I told him that I would go check the back because I wasn't sure if we had any in stock. He said audibly but quietly, ""Incompetent shit..."" and told me to go look.

I went to the back to look for the wrapped cucumbers and it turned out that we did have them.

I hate it when people treat me rudely when I can't retaliate so I retaliated the only way I could.

Gone2far,"At least you knocked up a successful woman and not a scum bag like I did. I was the sole provider for myself and my ex partner when we were together even before she fell pregnant. I was the one who worked 45-60 hour weeks on apprentice wages to support the house hold while she 'looked for work that suited her'.

When she fell pregnant I told her she didn't need to look for work and that I would provide for us and quit my cooking apprenticeship to be a kitchen hand at the same place for better pay but worse conditions and no chance of a certificate.  When my son was born I was working 55-65 hours a week and doing all the cooking/cleaning at home as well as looking after my son through the night so she could rest.

When he was 6 months old she threatened to leave me because I was too sick to work for a week and too sick to look after our son or do the housework. We had a massive fight and as soon as I was well enough to get out of bed (it was pretty bad and I was bed ridden with swollen glands in my chest, pneumonia and bronchitis at once, I probably should have been hospitalised) I moved back into my mothers and broke up with her.

We did 50/50 shared care for 6 months and she got the single parent pension and I helped her with bills. A little after he turned one her house was in a putrid state and full of cockroaches and other nasty vermin so she gave me full care of our son and continued to collect the single parent pension while I worked and my family babysat my son for me. 

Just before he turned three she was still collecting the single parent pension, I had had enough of her shit and decided to do something about her abusing me financially. I contacted centrelink (Australia's form of welfare) and let them know what had been going on for the past two years, I was extremely bitter at her because in that entire time she had never once helped me with any of the financial burdens or even bought a single bottle of milk or pack of baby wipes let alone any child support and it put me in debt.

They backdated my claim for the single parent pension and gave me a lump sum payment which pretty much cleared the debt I had gotten myself into. She copped a massive bill and was risking jail time for fraud as a result but they let her off with a $35,000 debt with the government to be paid back slowly. 

Now I still have full custody and it's my sons fourth birthday soon. In the past three years she has had very little to do with him and has only recently started having him one or two nights a month and I have documented every interaction that we have with her including all text messages and phone calls. 

I still receive nothing from her financially at all and I like it that way, it means I have even less to do with her and my son and I are better off that way. Look on the bright side, your situation could be a lot worse, I manage to look on the bright side of mine so you can too.

I'm not in Australia ('murica) but this isn't entirely an outrageous claim. Albeit she went into her $130k salary knowing full well she had a daughter (I would hope, lol), so the point I am making isn't necessarily in defense of her but for others who go into happy marriages, have kids, but for one reason or another things fall apart.

When most couples start a life together they tend to accumulate debt together. When child support is calculated it doesn't take into account any of the debt, especially any debt accumulated prior to the divorce. It's almost as if the state thinks you said ""Oh, I'm single now, I can spend thousands of dollars a month and go into a ridiculous amount of debt without having to worry about caring for my child!""

It's absurd. My wife has worked for two different states' child services departments and she has calculated what I would owe if I had to pay child support for our son if we ever divorced. It's ridiculous. I make a little more than double what she does and we have a pretty decent lifestyle but if I ever had to pay what the state mandates for my salary, I would be screwed.

They negotiated a price that ended up being a significant chunk of his salary but he didn't try to argue. At least until shortly afterward when she started trying to renegotiate for more. He was already barely able to support himself and make the payments as it was but she refused to back off and took him to court. The part that makes me smile is that the court determined that he was already paying above the amount required by the state based on his income and she actually started getting less than she had been originally.

M4n,"I am at a loss why *any* parent feels they deserve a pay check from the other parent. Child support is created for one thing. The transfer of a portion of the wealth to the state, and redistribution of a portion to a person more likely to spend it. People with money have it because they are frugal. Poorer people are likely to spend more frivolously, especially when they did not have to work for it, so they do not value it because they're was no personal or sweat equity invested to create the wealth. There is no investment. The state loves it because they can skim off every payment plus all the lawyers and court costs and fees. 

But its 'law' so its perfectly fine... right?

200 years ago I could beat my slaves and my wife with the same tree branch... and it was law.

Ever seen people on welfare with new cars, nice apartments/houses, new clothing and shoes, internet, computers, cell phones, and mp3 players , video game consoles, custom nails/beauty treatments/hair, etc... 

Or ex wives with all that stuff, while Dad eats canned beans and balogna sammiches, driving a 25 year old clunker (or walking, biking or taking the bus), while sleeping on mom and Dad's, a friends couch or rathole fleabag apartment, busting his ass working 2 jobs just to maintain a 3rd parties legislated and ordered quality of life standard ""for the children"". 

Do different human offspring children require a different quality and/or quantity of food, water, and shelter to survive? 

If not, then why does one dad pay $25 a month, another $250, another $2500, and that rich bastard $25000?

What was her old car like- was it a beater she'd had since undergrad that finally gave out? Is she in a group practice where she covers clinics in different locations such that her employer leases the car for her?

Any chance that the trip to Europe was a medical conference?

Docs, especially younger ones , don't make big bucks ...yet. If she is in a fellowship or residency  she is probably not making $100,000 a year.

If she is making 6 X the amount you make, you are earning roughly $17.000 per year.Even with a kid 50% of the time, that's low pay.

In Illinois, the judge orders the amount of child support.This is true in every US state. The child support agency only gets involved if the  custodial parent is getting welfare and the state want to be reimbursed or if  the judge orders the non custodial spouse to pay through the CSA. One parent can't just call them up to enforce a private agreement.

So, no doubt she is being an ass, but your original story doesn't hold water and calling CSA is not likley to result  in much,... unless you are not in the US in which case things might be different. Maybe.

Pitmattman,"Her perspective:

So I started my new job at unnamed taco joint the other day and already I want to quit.  I was on the till and the guy training me had left for his 15 min break.  Sure thing the second he leaves I get some asshat (AH for short) up to my till.  This is how the conversation (abbreviated) went:

Me:  Hi what can I get for you today.

AH:  I'd like 3 jumbo tacos and a Burrito.

Me:  Sure thing that will be $3.02

AH:  *Shuffles around and grumbles a bit*  Shit I only have 3 even can I just have it for that?

Me:  I'm sorry sir but I can't let you do that.  I can't have my till off at the end of the night.  (No way was this happening on my first shift at work)

AH:  Cmon please it's just 2c

Me:  I'm sorry sir but I can't.  If you want we can take the burrito off and it will come to less than 3 dollars.

AH: Are you serious??  It's 2 cents.  Who cares?

Me:  Well if everyone I served today did that and I didn't care then I would end up several dollars off and I don't want to treat you differently than everyone else.

AH:  Fine whatever just take the burrito off and get my food.

Me:  Ok sir.  Sorry about that.

So the guy gets his food and I thought all was well.  My coworker comes back and says that it wouldn't have been that big of a deal and show's me the dish under the counter where the cashiers put pennies that customers didn't want as change so that the till doesn't end up off at the end of the night.

Sure enough it can't just end at that.  The next freakin day this jerkoff came back (and I know it was intentional based on the following).  Orders the exact same thing and then pulls out 6 effing rolls of pennies and unwraps them right in front of me so he can dump them on the counter for me to count.

Obviously I count them and it doesn't even come to 3.02.  It's 2.99 ffs.  At this point I don't care and just get him his food to get him out of my face.  He probably felt so smug because he thought of this super clever ploy to annoy a minimum wage worker.


FYI you're an asshole and you're lucky she wasn't more informed.  If you had done that to me I would have told you that I'm not legally required to accept unrolled coinage (for that matter I don't think rolled coinage has to be accepted either) as payment and to get the fuck out of my store (It's been upheld in court and people have been cited with disorderly conduct for trying to pay in coins as a way to annoy or piss off clerks/cashiers)",null,9,ccjnsud,1nl4c9,pettyrevenge,new,25

SelkieMaid,"To everyone who doesn't seem to be aware, cashiers let pennies slide all the freaking time. At my store its common to let people slide on amounts up to and including 0.10cents. In our area, a lot of stores don't accept pennies because they don't want to deal with such small change. Hence letting the small stuff slide. 
On top of that, even when you do everything in your power to make every interaction right 'on the money', your till might still be off at the end of the night. Probably not much, but most employers aren't going to roast your ass for being over or short by less than a dollar...let alone by two ever-loving pennies. People make mistakes, and more often than not they're for more than 2cents. 

My manager would be seriously pissed off at me if I refused a sale based on the customer being short two pennies...but our store is concerned about repeat business, and we have a great relationship with most of our customers. 

He wasn't asking for free food, he wasn't looking for a massive discount, he even offered to bring the PENNIES in the next day. People probably threw at least that much on the ground on their way out of the store over the course of her shift. She wouldn't have gotten in trouble (All my friends work in fast food and do WAY worse than just letting someone slide on two pennies)...she just was having a bad day and decided she was going to power trip. 

To the people saying ""pay for your order, op, and don't be so cheap"" I say have a little common sense...he wasn't robbing a bank or stealing. Two pennies are not worth bunching up anyone's panties. I bet if she'd ASKED her manager, the transaction would have gone through without having to remove anything. But no. She'd rather piss off a customer. 

I'm sure she got the message. Counting pennies is a bitch. 

Edit to say, I don't support the use of unrolled coin as a weapon, mainly because as mentioned earlier cashiers don't have to accept it. I refuse to deal with it, and so will a lot of people. Really, this would have been just as good to me if you'd left the pennies rolled, and then added two extras to make it EXACTLY 3.02, in pennies. Even though they would be rolled, they'd still swamp her till and she'd probably still get the msg. It would have still been a pain in the ass, and she'd have no grounds to think you're a jerk.

The staff signed to us, ""on the count of three all turn around and stare/glare at the chav by the bins""... she counted to three and bam, all 25 of us turned around and the she shouted ""We can hear you!""

Me: ""But the coupon says any sub of equal or lesser value.  a 6"" BMT costs the same as a 6"" BMT""

Him: ""But it has to be a different sub.""

Me: 'It doesn't say that on the coupon.  If I had just ordered two 6"" BMTs and used the coupon on one, it would be the exact same thing.'

Him (*to manager*): ""I don't think he can use this coupon this way.""

He was a nice kid too. She was screaming about the product we had and cost and his service. Just on and on and on. I gave it a moment and when I felt she went overboard I stepped out of my office (hopped off the counter where I like to hide when sleeping) and pointed across the street. 

""Ma'am, there's a perfectly good 7-11 across the street. I suggest you go there from now on because we won't be serving you here anymore.""

She flashes me a evil smile and screamed, ""Do you know who I am? See that car out there? The BMW? I have nicer cars than that at home!! I'm married to a Colonel. I'm rich! Do you have any idea what I'm worth?""

I calmly replied, ""No ma'am I don't, but what I think you're trying to explain is that you think your better than my colleague and I, because you have nicer cars and more money than us. Is that about right?""

Her jaw worked itself up and down a couple times and finally just shut. She grabbed her shit, then quickly and angrily stomped out without saying a word.

Shaggyninja,"At the markets I went to a few years ago a guy was selling hot sauces. Every sauce except one was available for testing by yourself (ie. you decide how much you put on these little rice crackers)

The last sauce was a special sauce, it was a hot sauce, it was a sauce so hot that the hot sauce man kept it behind the counter and wouldn't give it to anyone who couldn't stomach the hottest sauce that he had available.

The sauces in front of him ranged in number from 1 to 10. Number 1 was a sauce made from your garden variety capsicum, number 10 was made from the Caribbean Red Habanero. A pepper that rates around 400,000+ on the Scoville Scale. 

I had the ten, it was hot, but hey, my parents like spicy chillies, I could handle this. And I did handle it, and so did my other 2 friends.

And then we went for the sauce behind the counter. This is an evil sauce, it is a hot sauce, this sauce changed me. It changed me badly.

This sauce was made from the Naga Viper, a pepper that registers over a million on the Scoville Scale. A pepper so hot even Satan himself wouldn't eat it A pepper that was recently beaten by my fellow country men with the Trinidad Scorpion but fuck that I'm not having a sauce made from that thing.

The man behind the counter got 3 rice crackers, 1 for me and my 2 friends, and poured this sauce on them. He then gave them to us and we placed them in our mouth and we ate them. Then it began. 

It came slowly, but it never once wavered in its increasing intensity, It got hot, then it got fiery, then it became lava, and it didn't stop. This was destroying my mouth, it was destroying my throat, it eventually destroyed my stomach and upset my eating abilities for months after (seriously, I couldn't consume food without feeling sick for a long time)

And then that night, I pooped. Oh boy, I pooped. I pooped long, I pooped painful, my ass was read and raw. When I looked down after, my poop had small specks of red chilli still in it. It was a bad time for all, don't do it.

For the past 3 years I have looked for this sauce at the markets, I didn't buy it that day, I wish I had for the hot sauce man has never been there again :'(

TL:DR I should be doing an assignment but the worlds hottest chilli gave birth to a BBQ sauce that caused my stomach to commit suicide.

gunkystuff,"Easier to read version: 


There's this guy from last year, let's call him Jason. He was really annoying and is an asshole. He bangs on the table during class, fistfights with HIMSELF, shoves people to the ground to get out of the door, etc etc etc. So one day, I'm on my way out. Right in the middle of the door, he pushes me and slams me to the side of the door frame, making me drop my school laptop. It's slightly cracked, and he says like he didn't know anything about it, ""oooh, you're going to get in trouble for that."" By this point, I'm pretty steamed. 

 Fast foward to 5th period, i realized he forgot his school laptop case with his laptop. He was still logged in. He turned off the option to need the password logging back in. That night after school, I went to starbucks for their wifi so the school couldn't trace it back to mine, and downloaded the worst bloody porn videos you could imagine. It was nasty. I hid them in some folders so he wouldn't notice them, but to make it even worse, I opened porn tabs as well as putting the volume back up. They ordered me out of starbucks but it was worth it for the ensuing chaos. 

 I had placed the laptop in the corner of the room for language arts. My teacher at that period found it, as I hoped, and I had logged out. So Jason comes in, sees it on her table, and grabs it so she doesn't notice he lost it, as there's a punishment about it. After asking the class who it was, she told us to open our chromebooks and go onto her course website. After logging in and the tabs still open, one of the advertisements play. You could hear the moaning from outside the room. Before he could close even a third of the tabs, the teacher picked up his chromebook. She paled, and told him to stay after school so they could talk.

When they called back the number that showed up on their caller ID they were getting an entirely different department, me and the other receptionists who just routed the calls. At least 10 times a day I'd answer the phone ""Thanks for calling &lt;company name&gt; how can I direct your call?""

I'd explain it wasn't me personally, sometimes they'd insist ""Well I just called the number right back and I got you, so you called me"" etc. etc. People don't understand the concept of extensions, I guess.

null,"As a point of reference, if your kid does this, even if you ignore him (and attempt to get the behavior to go extinct) the people around you might not, which will only reinforce their behavior. 

So if your kid does this to try and get you embarrassed or annoyed enough to buy them something, just remove the kid from that environment as fast as humanly possible. Take them outside, wait until they calm down (you don't have to do anything, just wait), and then let them know what they did was inappropriate and what their appropriate response should have been. It might take some time but if you're calm, patient, and clear they will get the idea eventually (the time it takes depends on the kid, really).

Kids do have a tendency to throw tantrums, but that doesn't mean they can't learn from them. You just have to really follow through with your response. And even though extinction *will* work in most cases, being in public means not just you, but everyone has to ignore your kid for it to *really* be effective.

And if you think ""I don't have 20 minutes I could be grocery shopping to explain to my kid such and such"", it'll save you a hell of a lot of stress and time down the road when they learn that you won't tolerate tantrums of that sort.

Last note I swear, but it may take a couple of tries to get the behavior to decrease altogether. In fact, there may be an increase in the behavior just before it goes away completely. Just think about the end result and how much better behaved your kid will be in the long run. 

TL;DR Behavioral Psychology! There are other approaches but I like this one best.

10thplanetwestLA,"When I was much younger (I think around 4-5 years old), my took me to the supermarket.  It was around Easter time and I saw a Cadbury Chocolate Egg.  I asked my mom if I could have one and she said no.  For some reason, I thought she was too poor to afford it, so I decided to steal it.  Just put the egg in my pocket and walked around like normal until my mom checked out and we got to the car.

As soon as I got in the passenger seat, I smiled at my mom and took the egg out of my pocket to show her.  My feeling at that moment was similar to a hunter who proudly came back to his village with a kill to feed the villagers.  That feeling lasted about 2 seconds.

My mom snatched me up, took me right back in the store and demanded to see the store manager.  The manager came and she told him that I was a thief and to call the police to take to me to jail.  4-5 year old me was thinking...WTF MOM!??!?!  The manager just laughed and said it was OK as long as I learned my lesson.  I said I did and my mom kept saying I needed to go to jail.  WTF MOM?!?!!

I am his sister and I love him more than anything, but it is not fair to make me responsible for his quality of life.

Blaaamo,"I have formatted this for easier reading.

Some crappy lady let her dog out to play with us when we were in college. Instead of taking some time from our busy frisbee game and play with this poor animal for a few minutes, an animal who was undoubtedly kooped up all day with the old lady, and whose only respite and physical activity was running around with us, we decided to douse the innocent animal with tabasco. So much hot sauce that eventually the dog had intestinal problems.

Aren't we fucking funny?",null,21,ccp4j5x,1o5zvw,pettyrevenge,new,30
Raveynfyre,"I have formatted this for easier reading.

&gt;So as you may be able to guess, this is a story my dad told me years ago that always made me laugh. Back when my dad was in college he was living in an apartment building. The building had four levels of apartments with three stories above ground and then a basement level of apartments. 

&gt;My dad and his roommates would sometimes go the the field outside of the gated area around the apartment to play Frisbee. The apartment allowed pets and the woman who lived by the stairs in the basement level of the apartment had a dog. Somehow this dog always knew when my dad and his friends were outside playing Frisbee and it had no problem getting out of the apartment through the doggy door and squeezing through the bars of the fence going around the building to play with them. Unfortunately the dog's favorite game was to steel my dads Frisbee and play keep away until it could chew it up. I don't know if they ever went to confront the woman about her dog before they came up with the plan but it kept happening and they were getting pissed about this dog. 

&gt;Finally they decide to teach the dog a lesson. They all knew that the dog loved tennis balls just as much as Frisbees so the next time they went out they took a tennis ball with them... plus a large new bottle of Tabasco sauce. They threw the ball a few times and sure enough the dog comes running. They then completely doused the ball in Tabasco until it was completely red and threw it for the dog. The dog snatches the ball and starts to play it's game of keep away when suddenly it drops the ball and stands there barking at it. They walk over and pick the ball back up and douse it again before throwing it for the dog. Again the dog takes off after the ball, picks it up, drops it and starts barking at it unable to figure it out. My dad and his friends, being college guys, are laughing hysterically by now and keep repeating the cycle. By the time they call it a day they have literally used about half of the large bottle of Tabasco. 

&gt;Everyone goes to bed that night thinking that they have had their fun and that it is all over, but of course it wasn't. Sometime that night the Tabasco finished running it's course through the dog's digestive track and it really had to go. Something interesting about dogs that you may or may not know is that they will do anything in their power to not poop where they sleep. The dog left the basement apartment and made it's way up the stairs. One feature of the building that is important to this story is that the stairs connecting each level of the building went up along the outside of the building but there was in fact about an inch wide gap between the staircase and the wall they ran parallel to. 

&gt;The dog made it all the way up the the third floor of the building before it decided that it had gone far enough an turned it's back end to the wall of the building. If you have guessed watery diarrhea at this point then you are correct and because of the gap between the stairs and the outside wall of the building it ran all the way down the side of the building and puddled outside of the woman's apartment. The next day my dad woke up to the sound of the woman shouting at the poor dog and felt really guilty about everything. Not enough to confess about it though so the woman had to clean it off the side of every floor of the building. I guess she should have trained the dog to be better behaved.

&gt;TLDR: Three floors of dog diarrhea for owner to clean up.

After the first one goes off, everyone will laugh, and you can tell him that it was just the single loaded one in the pack.  If you've placed them well enough then he will go through another couple with no explosions and get into a false sense of security.  Then when another one goes off he'll crap himself just as much as with the first one because he'll not be expecting it.

There are lots of ways to make it convincing (marking the ones you've loaded so you can both take from the same pack without you getting a loaded one etc).

Childish, but immensely satisfying.

So, I get in line and their is this girl and her dad I guess (the girl is 26+ possibly married) and they're taking an age. He keeps putting the card in and withdrawing more cash. The guy before me is super pissed and I can see the line growing outside.

It's holiday soon and everyone wants to get some money before the ATM goes down (it happens alot). So, I am just keeping my cool while the guy before me is just cursing him and I talk to him and according to him, those pricks broke the line.

Now, I was bad because that asshole used his daughter as a shield and got in. Now there is a huge line outside by now and I am getting pissed as well.

As soon as they leave another girl just pops up and before she can cross the line and use the gender card, I politely call her out. I tell her this guy and everyone else has been standing her for 10-15 mins. If you can just wait for 10 mins and let some of them finish it would be nice.

And she retorts back with OH I AM A FUCKING GIRL. And I had to control myself, I had to really control every inch of being from really bitch slapping her verbally but it's Pakistan and plenty of white knights around, plus it's not her fault.

So, after I tell her to take a chill pill, she politely stands (I know she felt humiliated) and the guy before me finishes up. And I know that dude is happy because someone stood up for him for once. 

He leaves and without a delay I motion her to go ahead and she is like, wtf wow. I knew she was surprised because in her mind I was the asshole.

She thanked me and I got my cash and everyone was happy.

TL;DR: Resolved the situation and created equality once again thanks to the knowledge gleamed from Petty Revenge!

I turned around and pointed out that the movie would suck less if there were fewer annoying assholes in the theater. He apologized (which I wasn't expecting) and a few minutes later they left the theater.

We were pretty sure they'd snuck in anyways by comments they'd made earlier (sounded like they'd went to an earlier movie down the hall and snuck into this one since the ticket collectors were in the lobby not the halls).

Just-call-me-colonel,"I too gave a bully what he had coming to him.

Let me give you a bit of background before I get into this...
So this kid at my high school was the bane of my existence. For sake of ease I'll call him Jack. No matter the situation he would find a way to pick on me, torment me or try to hurt me. He was a good half a foot taller than me (I was a pretty small kid) and he was the guy who picks on 'easy targets.' Needless to say I wasn't the biggest fan of this guy.

So anyways, I was in ICT, doing my work quietly (and a damn large quantity of work if I do say so!) and one of my classmates asked me to come over and show them what to do because I was one out of the 3 or 4 in the class who listened to instructions. 

So I was helping this kid for a good 5 minutes and I came back to my computer to find all the work I'd done closed and my memory stick missing. First thought crossing my mind was 'dear God did I save any of it?' But of course I didn't, I'm the kind of guy who saves everything right at the end of the lesson. So I turn around and look across the classroom to see Jack sitting there with his menacing little smirk staring directly at me twirling my memory stick between his fingers like a tiny, fluorescent green baton. So yeah, wasn't too pleased about that. I went over to him and said 'why have you got my memory stick? I never said you could take it and I need that.' He shrugged. He didn't even respond. I asked him if he saved any of my work. He chuckled maniacally and said something on the lines of 'wasn't my work, why should I have saved it?' I responded calmly saying 'I damn well hope you're joking with me' to which he responded 'and what you gonna do if I'm not?'

It was about then I lost my shit.

I decided enough was enough, I was having a pretty bad day anyways so this was just the icing on the cake. So I decided it'd be a really good idea to boot him in the chest. 

I took a step back to give my self a little bit more force behind it, I brought my knee up high and thrust the sole of my shoe right slap bang in the centre of his chest. It was the best connection I could've hoped for. And to make things even better, because he was sitting side-on at his computer, he rocked back in his chair and the look of terror and desperation on his face as he grasped for something to steady his fall was simply priceless. Also, because the teacher basically adored me, even though she saw what happened, she said 'you really shouldn't rock back on your chair jack.' That was when everyone began laughing at him and his humiliation.

Tanok89,"Happy that she finally got the recipe, she had convinced herself that it would be a great time to ask John from across the street over for coffee and cake. And boy, was he in for a treat. That carrot cake had almost turned her lesbian towards her employee. That's how good it was.

John had even accepted her invitation, so she was really excited! She didn't want to mess this up. She had known John for a long time and always had a good eye towards him. She felt John had the same, but no one ever acted on it. Untill now. Now was the best time ever. But she had to practice to make the perfect cake. Otherwise she might ruin it.

Her first batch came out dry and boring. 'I expected that,' she told herself, 'it's my first attempt at this cake'. When she took out the second batch, it looked terrifyingly similar to the first one. A small drop of sweat fell across her forehead. John was coming over in a couple of hours, so time was running short. 'Once more', she convinced herself. 

When the third cake came out of the oven as dry and bland as the first ones, she was on the verge of crying. 'This can't be happening! I'm following the recipe exactly as it is!'. Her throat felt tight and her heart beat an irregular beat. In despair, she considered calling her employee to ask for help, but that would be very unprofessional. But did she have a choice, she pondered. Will she ever get a chance with John again?

storyofmycrazylife,"Happened to me when I was away at school. The girl left an evidence behind. It was a shirt I've seen her wear a few times. She lives in another area of the same housing unit as I was. I took her shirt, soaked it in the toilet water, used the tongs to get it out, and air dry for a day outside of my window. I left my basket of clean laundry by the foot of my bed so anyone can see that I haven't had time to fold my clothes. 

The next day, I casually asked around if anyone knew who this shirt was because it was found when I was doing laundry downstairs. A another girl in my unit volunteered to pass it on to her friend (the owner of that shirt) and thanked me. No thanks necessary. :) 

It brings a smile to my face knowing where that shirt has been. 

Edit: I meant to say the girl took my wet clothes from the dryer and dumped them on the floor, and she used the already paid dryer to dry her clothes. It happened a few times before she left the evidence behind. She must have left in a hurry knowing that I was coming down to pick up my clothes.

I worked in a retail store for a few years. Being in electronics LP would give us stacks of these things to stick to video games and other easy to steal shit we sold. We had thousands of them at any given time. They were the primary prank tool in the department.

It was a fairly regular occurrence to place one sticky-side-up behind the register before leaving a shift so the next person to come in would step on it and it would stick to their shoe, setting off the alarm when they got off work.

Some of us would get crafty and stick them on coats in the break room. One epic level sneakness was reached when one guy managed to stick one under a shirt collar of someone *while they were wearing the shirt*.

I kept a folding clipboard with manufacturer's spec sheets of all the major computers and TVs we sold every day. My co-workers loved to try to stick security tags in it when I wasn't looking so I'd be searched when I left at the end of the day.

The best ones though were when for whatever reason the alarms would miss a tag that was stuck to you on the way out the door. Then on your next shift if you still had whatever was tagged on you the alarm would sound going *into* the store, making for much confusion.

Or worse, if you went to another store after work with alarms you'd set them off and have to explain to their employees what was going on.

As a comment to everyone reading this, or everyone out there in general: if you have a chronic condition which is bothering you, GO TO YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN.

If you go to the ED, all you're going to get is an 8 hour wait and maybe one day worth of pain medication with instructions to see your PCP.

If you're seriously sick or injured and it can't wait till you see your normal doc, that's when you come see us.

I have a similar story. 

At a place I used to work, we had a pizza party every month we didnt have an incident.   One guy liked hot sauce on his pizza, and brought in a bunch of different types to try.  There was one particular sauce that was *hot*.  Everyone was respecting the sauce, trying it in small amounts and remarking about how obscenely hot it was.  

In comes our napoleon complex guy.  ""I eat hot stuff all the time.""   He goes and grabs the hot hot sauce bottle.  I tell him ""careful, its hot.""   And he smirks at me and liberally puts about a tablespoon onto a slice.  

The next few minutes were pure joy. After his first bite, he went bright red.  Didn't say a word.  Shakingly took a second bite, looking a bit watery.  People were making conversation with him like ""hot huh?""  ""Wow, that stuff was too hot for me.""   After his second bite he retreats with his plate into the office.  Unfortunately his job required him to see us all face to face for the remainder of the day, about every 15 minutes.  He cried, he was red for the next 45 minutes, he drank 3 sodas, and he tried to pull it off without revealing his pain which was the best part.  

I lied.  The best part was finding the uneaten slice in the trash can under his desk when he left for the day.  ",null,1,ccy112h,1p0nfj,pettyrevenge,new,12

I previously worked at a small franchise coffee shop and the owner was nuttier than a fruitcake. The owner was the kind of woman who was miserable in her home life, so she put in 80+ hours a week to ""help"" run a store that was open MAYBE 80 hours a week.

I first came in and offered managerial help complimentary (I had experience and wanted to make myself useful). She told me that SHE did all of the scheduling, ordering, inventory cataloging, hiring and interviewing, and that she was a bit crazy from doing all of this. Mind you, she told me this while she was interviewing me for an entry-level position.

The highlights of her management include;

-Banning ALL employees from buying pastries... No, you can't purchase it at store price, you simply can't buy it.

-Kicking out the local sheriff and officers (they were visiting, not investigating) because I offered them a discount, she shot the idea down and they supported me.

-Hired a 15 year old boy over a college graduate.

-Attempted to ""tax"" our tips because, according to her ""tips are a privilege, not a right"". I shot that shit down and put myself right on her shit list, which made for the coup de grace;

-Firing me because I was at the doctor. I had a note, I had actually gone to see the doctor, I had given notice over 8 hours before my shift had even began. No, I'm not broken up- I worked about 17-18 hours a week for barely above minimum wage with no chance of a promotion EVER, and I had a second job that paid more than twice what I'd make at the coffee shop.

HPLoveshack,"Similar story, except I was doing close to 80 in the middle-lane of a 3-lane highway.  There was some truck with a trailer a few dozen cars ahead that was cruising in the left hand lane at 65mph so everyone in my lane (the middle lane) was passing people on both the left and the right at a steady interval.

Then some douche weaves through traffic in the back and jets up behind me in a truck with a lift kit and flashes his brights directly into my rearview mirror several times.  

Got a bit angry but ignored it, then 10 seconds later he flashes them three more times, fucking blinding me because his lights were 15 feet from my rear window and at the exact level of my rearview mirror due to the lift kit.  

So I reached out and gave him the finger as I slowed down to match the exact speed of the two, much slower, cars on either side of me that were doing roughly 65, forming an impassable wall.  

After about 10 minutes of that we came to a part of the highway with a generous shoulder and he decided to jet up that before forcing his way into traffic ahead.

The only time I've ever genuinely felt road rage, for a few minutes there I was 100% down to throw everything away to stomp that guy unconscious on the side of the road.  Wish I could say I saw him wrecked up or pulled over by a cop on the side of the road later, but unfortunately there's no justice in the world.",null,12,cd0c2ke,1pa2v0,pettyrevenge,new,58

3) A Lt. Col in command wouldn't take getting hung up on kindly. ANYONE in the military wouldn't tell their commanding officer ""Sorry we're swamped."" And hang up on them. That's a great way to severe paperwork for military members and to be out of a job for civilians.

MurrueLaFlaga,"In college, I lived in the engineering dorm. I'm female, and most of the dorms on the female floor were filled up by non-engineering majors with whom I had very little in common, so I used to hang out with the guys on the floor above me. We'd host huge Halo LAN parties and the like, and everything was generally pretty fun up there. Well, there was one guy who sounds *exactly* like your William who lived at the very end of the hall opposite the main entrance. We'll call him Unhygienic Asshole, or UA. One of my good friends, Dave, was unfortunately roomed with UA. Dave tried to be a good roommate to UA, but UA wasn't having any of that. Honestly, we all tried to include UA in our group activities at first, as good freshmen do for their fellow underclassmen, but UA proved time and time again how little he cared for our friendship. UA was a douchebag at heart, pretty large (at least 300 lbs), ate horribly, never exercised, and if it was possible to shower less than never, well, that's what he did. We'd monitor his shower gel usage when he wasn't around...he started with a full bottle at the beginning of the year, and nearing the end of the first semester, the bottle was still about 80% full. UA's side of the room was consistently messy, and Dave was finding it increasingly difficult to find space for his things/sleep in his own bed as entropy took over. The smell quickly got to the point that Dave took to sleeping on the floor in his friend's dorm rooms. In addition, UA would almost never leave his room as he believed he knew better than his professors what he was supposed to be learning, so he would skip class often, only leaving the room for important pre-exam study sessions, exams, or holidays.

One day, UA was absent from his room, and a bunch of us armed ourselves with t-shirts over our faces and as many air freshener cans as we could, went into his room (he liked to leave the door propped open so we could smell his ambrosia, I guess), closed the door and bombed it. We opened the window, left, and closed the door behind us, hoping that would help. The RA noticed the now mixed smell emanating from the room and asked around as to what it was...we confessed what we did, but the RA gave us the impression that he was glad we had at least tried something. I guess whenever someone would complain about the smell during the semester, the RA would try to give UA hygiene tips, hoping gentle prodding would work. After our air freshener incident, he finally went to whoever he needed to in order to get Dave an official room transfer and report UA for endangering the health of everyone in the building. UA ended up being required to move out of the dorms after the first semester, so we could all breathe easier then. I really hope this William of yours wasn't as bad as this guy was, but if he was, damn. I am so sorry.

That forest was my friend. And when I see someone littering anywhere I go livid. My buddy and me were once walking behind an old lady in heart of Zagreb and saw some old lady just finish a bagel and hold the paper in her hand. And she waited for a few minutes until she was sure no one can see her and then just casually dropped the little behind her on the floor. We didn't attack her or anything but just followed her for 5 minutes talking loud about littering and dirtying my city AND how people have no shame while directly referencing the lady in front. The worst part is that in the center of Zagreb there are trash cans literally every 20 meters. It was like she was a shamed to put the paper in the trash.

Once I left a buddy in Maximir Forrest because he tried to deceive me by saying he threw the plastic bottle in the trash but he didn't, he just dropped it somewhere in the forest on our way to the lake and hoped I didn't see it.

Good. I like this. 

I got this same phone call on October 30. After listening politely I asked the man for a cal back number. He gave me 209 779 5088. which reverse look up tells me is a land line in Hughson CA, not Micrsoft. I keep him on the line for about 5 minutes and then nicely tell him that the call has been traced and that I am hanging up to report him to the State of Illinois Attorney General's Consumer Fraud  unit and that  he too will be reported for fraudulent activity. I could hear the spluttering as I hung up the phone.

If they call again, I will use your tactic.

Just how stupid are these people?

I am not a tech person- what is the point of this? are they going to try to sell me antivirus protection to get my credit card number or something?",null,87,cd49yff,1pnwh6,pettyrevenge,new,535
Lirathal,"I'm a Network Engineer and my brother works at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. I was at my parents house and the same phone call was received by my parents. Now because I have excessive computer knowledge and knowledge of the Microsoft campus I also decided to eff with this guy. 

The conversation went along the lines of this. ""Hi I'm calling from Microsoft we have recently found that your computer is infected with viruses and malware."" 

Now of course I know this scam and my parents computer is maintained by myself so I know there is nothing wrong with it. 

""Well thank you for the information and I really appreciate your help. What exactly are we looking for?"" 

He takes me though steps and I waste about 30 minutes screwing with him. I then change gears. ""So where are you calling from?"" He replies, ""Microsoft in Redmond"". I said, ""Oh really? That's funny I work there as well, what building are you in?"" He replies, ""in building 5"" so I decided to turn up the heat. ""Oh awesome I work in building 11 right across the street! What's your badge number?""

""My badge number is 856308"" and then I ask him to please hold while something was ""running on the computer.""

""Hi there thanks for waiting. Something really is off here. I'm walking over to building 5 and have contacted campus security, as well as the police and FBI. There is no point in hanging up, They have already traced your call while you were on hold. So now your real problem is that if you aren't truthful with me you are looking at felony offences as well as jail time. So let's talk.""

At this point his voice croaks and he said, ""..... What?""

I repeated myself and expressed that if he hang up the phone the FBI have notified me they would add felony evading to any charges that were brought. So I started to ask his real name and current location. 

He starts to warble as he responds, his voice croaking more and more... And I start asking more and more personal questions, children's names, wife's name, and home address. Suddenly there is another voice and they speak in Arabic. They start to argue and suddenly the line cuts out.... I wonder what happened after that.... :P

ryloshawk,"My dad got a call like this last weekend. Fun fact he's been working with computers for 25+ years and specializes in network security. So when an Indian lady tells him his computer is pinging the government of canada servers in mexico while it wasn't even turned on he tore her apart.  She was crying when he finished yelling at her..

Edit: Full story

So she asked him to turn his computer on, so he proceeded to. Then she wanted him to go into the windows options and turn his firewall off, for security reasons so she could see what might be causing the problem. Next he was to go into his antivirus program and allow access to some ip address she gave my dad. So my dad asked her why the government would be doing network security over the phone which is highly unsecure. She said she sent many letters and no one replied so she had to call. My dad asked her to send him another letter and he would verify it with the police as he has done work with the government before so he could find out of it was legit. She proceeded to te him it wasn't necessary and if he followed her steps they could fix the problem now. So he ripped her a new one. Asked her to define secure, and questioned why the government would do anything over the phone and why the caller I'd didn't show up as Government of Canada.  She tried to explain it was for security reasons and he asked for her ip address so he could ping her server and see if he could see her. She gave it to him. So he yelled at her and told her he reverse engineered her scam and was reporting her to the police. She started begging him not too and hung up crying. I sat there dying of laughter the entire time.

EmperorOfCanada,"I have long used a horrible technique that I heard once. Basically you just ask them to keep repeating the ""Last bit"", ""No before that"" ""No the other thing you mentioned"" ""Yes I got that but I missed the other thing you said"" ""That's cool but I don't think that I understood the bit before that."" and so on. You are obviously quite interested in what they have to say but they don't like to move on with their script when you are missing some. Often they get a bit frustrated so just start re-reading the whole script. 

The key is that you are not quite fitting into their script formula. You aren't saying, no, you aren't asking questions, and you aren't saying yes.

Almost any telemarketer can be spun in circles for a bizarrely long time.

I was home alone, browsing a bit behind my PC. Mind you, I was using Linux Mint and the only Windows PCs in the house weren't even connected to 230V. All was good. Reddit had some new, nice AmAs, The Who was coming through my speakers and the cat was peacefully sleeping on my lap. Suddenly, the phone rings (as far as it rings. it really just loops some sort of mp3/wav, but whatever). Annoyed because my lovely atmosphere was disturbed, I wanted to get this over with. I pick up the phone and lo and behold: AN INDIAN SCAMMER! My evening couldn't be better, because I knew I was going to have some fun :-)

Okay, said morron wanted me to to press the Start button. In my bestest Dutchlish (Dutch-English, completely ununderstandable if you're not Dutch), I tried to find the thing. Note: Still on Linux Mint. Had no Start button. I kept on frustrating the guy until I said ""Oh, do you maybe mean that round colorful flag in the bottom corner? ""YES SIR. THAT ONE."" (Nah, guy wasn't annoyed at all, we're 15 minutes on now ;-) )

Well, he tries to get me into the RUN mode, probably to scare me with something in regedit or so. He's getting more angry with me, because I can't find any button. He then asks me to do some kind of test, probably to figure out what kind of messed up kind of Windows I have. I was getting bored, so I wanted to get it over with. I ran my imaginary test. And he did not like the outcome:
- Sir, the test is done.
- Ah, what does it say?
- It's a rather weird answer.
- Well?
- It says you're a terrible person. It genuinely says that. And they weren't even testing for that. Now, I'm a Linux user and I would like to tell you to have a bad day before I hang up.

Future_Cat_Horder,"I mentioned in another thread that I drove my kids around and everyone gave me hell. I can understand why it would seem like I was a helicopter parent, but I'm not. 

My main concern was bears. We live in an area that is heavily wooded, and we see bears so much that we recognize each one. There are only two bears that I am concerned about this year. They have stuck together since they left there mother in the spring and they are rambunctious ""teenage"" trouble making bears that have absolutely no fear of humans, because some idiot fed them when they were small. Now they walk into peoples yards and up onto their porches in the middle of the day time. They seem to be more attracted to noise than afraid of it and have come to our yard during parties just to see what was going on. So it's not a good idea for anyone, including adults to wander around out in the woods at night. I do still let the kids play outside and walk to friends houses in the daytime just as long as they have the dog with them if they go into the woods.

What I do have going for me is that my kids are not overweight. They are actually very close to the low end of a healthy weight, and when they get sick we have to keep a close eye on how much they lose. We don't have very many overweight children at all in our area. Even kids that move here and are overweight at first, quickly lose at least some of it. I think it is because they spend so much time playing outside. The woods may be a bit dangerous, but to a 10 year old they are like a giant playground. Once they get older and want to walk to stores ext. They have to walk at least 5 miles to get there, and they do it because there isn't really anything else to do. When I was a teenager I walked 3 miles a day during the summer, every day to go fishing, because that's what people do around here for fun.

TL;DR If you want to solve childhood obesity live in an area where exorcise is necessary to get around. Save the car for the few times when it's dangerous to be walking, like Halloween night when rambunctious teenage bears are looking for trouble.",null,2,cd532p5,1pp55i,pettyrevenge,new,5

When we left the rain had finally stopped so we decided to hit the streets with an hour left before Trick or Treating 'ended'.

The 4 kids and 2 adults would exit the van and hit the houses while I pulled on ahead and did recon and waited close by in case it started raining again.

In the end, my daughter ended up with a great haul but since Trick or Treating was canceled due to the rain last night, she got an extra day to trick or treat.

Having been a vegetarian (for health reasons), people gave me a *ton* of shit for not eating meat while I remained respectful of others' dietary choices. People automatically take offense to it and make a big deal out of having to cater to you or thinking you're out to get them because they enjoy meat. They'll never fail to mention it and sneer at you when you settle for a veggieburger instead and they'll fucking **offer** you meat and ask if you're sure you don't want any.

The best way to annoy a veg_____ **who deserves it** is to constantly offer them meat. This forces them to respond instead of ignoring you reveling in the deliciousness of it. If she insults you, just point out that that animal wouldn't have cared if *she* died.

I've not *personally* witnessed an unruly vegetarian/vegan get into anyone else's business, but I have seen meat-eaters get into their business all the time. That's what made me bitter towards people about it. It didn't give a shit what *they* ate.

- She killed all the bushes planted on the property line. 

- Hired someone to take out a tree that was on the neighbors property.

- Screamed at the children because they cut through her open backyard on the way home from school (as every child in our neighborhood did until recently and she never asked them nicely not to). Her yard is all barkdust. All she had to do was ask nicely.

Call centre staff are lower than middlemen, try to treat them with some semblance of respect. We're not monsters, and a lot of the time we're working within rigid perimeters (we used to lose points on a ""scorecard"" for using contractions or saying ""no"" in any context). I dealt with more than 4000 people in my time there and, more often than not, the way I was spoken to during complaints was less than subhuman. I understand you may be upset, but 9 times outt've 10, you wouldn't speak to someone in person the way you speak to them over the phone and more often than not, it's not our fault. We're just the punching bags, and the turnaround rate on these jobs prove it.


One important thing I always tell people when you're dealing with customer service: ""is the way you're treating me going to make me want to help you more, or less?"". If I was speaking to some jackoff, I'd do the bare minimum to never have to deal with them again without getting fired. If I had someone on the phone who was cordial, and pleasant, I'd break my back to fix all of their problems (including adding in a few perks where I could).

When I signed up with my internet provider, they gave me the equipment for free. It said so on the contract I signed, and in an email I received. I had an order number linked to that transaction, so it was very, very easy to check that I shouldn't be charged for the equipment.

My first bill charged me $50 for the equipment, so I called the provider. I got some Indian woman who kept saying she didn't see anything on my account about it, even though I gave her the number on my form that indicated which charges I was to get. She got frustrated with me and tried to tell me I should pay it, and kept repeating that I should pay it. I asked her to transfer me to someone else in her department, and she said she couldn't do that, and that there was nothing wrong and I should pay the fee. It became a shouting match, since she got upset (read: incredibly angry) with me, to the point I was shouting ""Transfer me to someone else! Transfer me! TRANSFER ME!"" She kept refusing! This went on for close to 10 minutes - no exaggeration.

...Until I said ""Are you so incapable of doing your job that you don't know how to transfer me? Is that it? You just DON'T KNOW HOW?"" Apparently I hit a nerve. She finally got fed up and transferred me.

It took the new guy 5 minutes to fix my problem. I greeted him nicely (as I had done to the previous person), he looked at the account, pulled up the info and said ""Oh yeah, we shouldn't have done that. Let me fix your bill, you'll get a new bill in the mail soon with the correct amount.""

So on one of the nights they pulled us out of our barracks at 10PM (we used to do 6am starts and 9:30pm finishes) and put us all on parade. This was extremely strange but we had to just go with it. They march us out into this field, and get told that we have to play the game of ""Detection resistance."" Basically what that means is a big game of hide and seek. Except the big kids have trucks, torches, helicopters, quad bikes, and searchlights.

So, I end up swimming in mud to conceal myself and get about 95% of the way to the goal before I hear ""CADET (my name)"" MARCH UP HERE IMMEDIATELY. I think for about two seconds ""is this a trick..."" then decide that since they used my name it must be real.

Before turning the bag into the lost and found, I proceeded to take all of his belongings in this bag into the storage closet, and dump them in the trash can in there.

But handily Karma decided to sort things out for us.

So we're sitting by the window and we can smell that our neighbour is smoking out of his window. We then hear intercom bell ringing in his flat, and his footsteps as he goes over to answer it. Then some running footsteps, and a muffled litany of panicked swearing. Some sounds of spraying. Meanwhile we can hear the newcomer going up the stairs and then straight into the flat upstairs.

Then a pause.

Then, a torrent of increasingly voluminous shouting as our upstairs neighbour's girlfriend discovered that he hadn't given up smoking despite his promises. Attempts to claim that it was a one off quickly undermined by the pile of (&gt;100) butts on the ground. Several minutes of enraged shouting - this was clearly a big deal - followed by slamming and stamping feet back down the stairs and out the door.

I agree it's complete shit but summer camps never want to loose potential clients and their money and especially don't want anything in the way of legal attention to come their way (a lawyer will never sue a counselor when they can get real money by going after the camp). The only time I know of when my camp sent a camper home early was when he tried to run away from camp (technically he tried to swim away but same idea). On the other hand, I've seen 6 counselors be ""let go"" within 2 years. My camp took a policy of punishing not only the counselor(s) who were in the wrong but also the counselor who tried to confront them. The story is too long for here though.

Also, in my personal experience 1 week campers are the easiest to deal with. In that first week they are still not used to each other and it takes some time to put together a pecking order. Don't get me wrong, a piece of shit camper is going to be a piece of shit for however long you have them for but things tend to escalate starting half way through the second week. It seems to take about that long for the cabins alpha campers to form their groups and start going after each other. Then again I never had too much trouble from my 9 year old campers.

Me: ""Hi!""

Telemarketer: ""Mr. Sleepy? Can I speak with Mr. Sleepy please?"" 

It's worth noting at this point that my mother often gave me the phone when my grandpa was on the line.  He has always referred to me as ""Mr. Sleepy"" for whatever reason.

Me: ""Hi Grandpa! [Blah blah blah... 5 yr. old thinking he's starting a conversation with his grandpa stuff]""

Telemarketer: ""No! I need to speak with Mr. Sleepy.""

Me: (Obviously confused about why my ""grandpa"" was shouting at me) ""Grandpa... ? Grandpa?!?"" 

I'm pretty sure that he hung up at that point, so there I was... a 5 year old confused about why his grandpa had just shouted at me and hung up on him.  My mother never told me that it was a telemarketer, so until I recalled this recently, I was confused about exactly what happened.

I once had a manager tell me I couldn't show up to work unshaven as I too don't always feel like scrapping my face with a piece of steel (it can be very enjoyable on occasion though, check our /r/wicked_edge for more info), it pissed me off quite a bit as I knew there was no actual policy on the matter. I steamed for a little bit then had a flash of brilliance/ stupidity. 

The next shift I worked after that I showed up again with a few days of stubble and when the manager pulled me into his office I asked for HR to join us for the conversation. He called one of the ladies down and when he got on me about being clean shaven I handed him two notes, one from my dermatologist saying he recommends I don't shave daily due to ongoing irritation as well as one from a rabbi stating that the beard was a religious symbol. The manager was furious with me, the HR lady could barely contain her laughter. 

The dermatologist was my step dads cousin and the rabbi was the uncle of a guy I grew up with... total bull shit on both fronts but any manager dumb enough to enact a policy like that isn't smart enough to dig into either of those notes IMO. Either way, I won. I made a point of not shaving before working right up until the time the manager was fired.

He was considered the nuisance on his floor due to his surround sound.  The elderly neighbor next door pounded on his door on a couple of occasions and my brother-in-law was apologetic and told the guy he wasn't trying to be an asshole, just drown out the slap fights coming from the couple below him.  (B.I.L. would ask them to cool it but they still fought).  His neighbor immediately sympathized and politely asked my B.I.L. to keep it down.

Until he figured out his neighbor's schedule, he didn't put the surround sound on unless he was having friends over or he went out if he heard the couple screaming.

About two months went by when my brother-in-law noticed he had not been hearing any Jerry Springer auditions.  He ended up running into the lady tenant from the apartment below his and apologized if he ever came off insensitive during the fights.  She replied that her boyfriend got thrown in jail so she and her kids had the place to themselves.

FilmYak,"We have REALLY narrow streets where I live (hillside in Los Angeles). My next door neighbors built a hideous and illegal fence in front of their house, right up to the curb. Again, even more illegal. The city owns a certain setback from the curve. Then they put a door in the middle of the fence facing the street (a second door allowed access from their driveway) and put planters in front of the door so no one could park there. 
And the fence was so close to the street, if you did park there, your passenger had no way to open their door. 

So their friends would constantly take one of the two spaces in front of our house, making it hard for us to get groceries and our young kids in and out of the house. 

I went over and asked them to stop, they did nothing, so I gave them an ultimatum: move the planters from in front of your door and tell your friends to park in front of your house, and only if every single space is taken can they park in front of ours. Or.... I'll just call the city and have them remove the illegal fence and all will be well. 

They said when people parked in front of their door, their little yapping dog would go nuts, so they asked people not to park there. I explained that was their problem, and by illegally blocking the parking they were solving it by making it my problem, which was not ok. 

They caved and started parking in front of their own house. And never spoke to me again. Until one of them came home clearly on major drugs and with all her possessions on the street, mumbling incoherently, and the cops were called. (Not by us.)

Crazy neighbors didn't live there long after that. Whew!

My friend was in the beta for hearthstone.  My bf and I went to visit for a party.  When my bf saw hearthstone installed he excitedly asks to play.  My friend of course lets him but warns that he doesn't play much and has crappy cards.  

My bf reads over the cards, makes his own deck, and is in the middle of playing when he gets a message from one of my other friends, asking for a duel.  Now this guy is an elitist, strategist type, and people who don't really know him would consider him an ass.  He's already spent 300 bucks on hearthstone for a bunch of rare cards and is one of the top 100 players.  

Of course, my bf mentions he's not actually my other friend, but is using his account to play the game.  Of course, this guy wouldn't pass up the opportunity to stomp on a noob.  I just walked away because I didn't want to be present to witness the aftermath.

Some time later I come back and ask how it goes.  Apparently my bf beat him 3 times in a row with crappy cards.  He impressed the guy so much he was offered a beta key to the game.

I wonder if she's just pissed off that she's required to say something so obviously stupid and demeaning, and it came across to you as ""huffy"" and ""condescending""?

I know that in any store _any_ conversation that's not related to the task at hand pisses me off. And not just me. And cashiers aren't stupid; they know this kind of corporate bullshit pisses us off, too. But they're required to spout this corporate crap to everyone if they want to keep their jobs. And if they hate doing it, it's not likely to sound very nice, meaning that it's easy for you (as a customer) to take the wrong way.

I mention all of that in case you're a kind person who might feel reflect on those words and feel bad if you realize that my conjecture is correct (although I wasn't there and I may be wrong).

On the other hand, I am a true social and societal Darwinist and really don't care about the cashier at all as she's not part of my immediate tribe. Therefore if she doesn't like what she has to say, she could find another job, or make a better effort to not make people think she's being a bitch about it.

For instance, his boss asks for a certain piece of information. You are present when the information is needed. Your boss doesn't know how to provide it. You do because you've been doing your boss' job. Chime in and say, ""My boss has been busy with x and y, lately, so even if he could get something going, that might hurt those projects' deadlines. I can get you that information by Friday, no problem. I'll shoot you an e-mail. Sound good?""

Makes your boss look better, satisfies your boss' boss' requirements, makes you look better to the boss' boss, and you are still doing the same job.

Promotion comes up, later. Your boss recommends you because you saved his ass. Your boss' boss knows you can do the work and promotes you.

Be sure to NOT whine about this stuff to you coworkers and take it like a champ. Don't be stupid and go out with your coworkers, and in a drinking fit, whine about the boss. That shit will bite you.

* Print out a page of random characters

* Swap the left and right mouse buttons

* Make a default windows sound 

* Make all open program's taskbar icons blink

* Change the input language of the keyboard 

* Change the mouse speed to something random

* Minimize all windows

* Maximize all windows

* Open any and all optical drives.

One day the owner of the company overheard us complaining about the guy and he wanted the whole story, we told him about all the times we had troubles with the guy. He told us ""well he can't shop here anymore"". We did not expect this, customer is always right, etc. The guy came back to return something and made a big deal about it and my manager politely told him that we would return the item but he was never allowed to show there again. The guy was furious and left after a long line of expletives and yelling. The best part is that we're a big ski sales company and our prices are always the lowest. the guy's whole family skiied so he was buying gear a lot. The next season he walks in and starts asking about new skis and stuff and my manager walks right up and asks him to leave. Guy thought we would forget or something.

Larrygiggles,"It's a good story, but (Holy wall o' text, Batman!) much easier to read when it's broken up into paragraphs. Here it is for anyone else:

Years ago, working in a little burger shack on Maui (one of the best jobs I ever had!) Just about closing time, and we're a man down, so there are only two of us in the store. One of the responsibilities of closing is, of course, taking out the trash. Here we run into a problem, as its against Policy to take the trash out alone, and against Policy to leave the store unattended. We opt, seeing as how the place is empty, except for one guy who is a non paying customer, checking his email, to take the trash out as quickly as possible, and rush back in. I see this guy every day, and we all know him fairly well. I take the keys out of the register and ask him to inform anyone coming in that someone will be back in two to three minutes to help them, and he gladly agrees to do so. Trash goes out, I come back in by myself and the other guy stays outside to mop the back deck. 

As I come in I hear a bit of commotion from the front, someone yelling, ""Where the hell is everybody?"" I walk through a door to the front, and the only person there is my webmail dude. (WebTV, thats how long ago this was.) He points to the other door leading back to the kitchen, says ""dude just went in there looking for you."" I go into the kitchen through that door as the guy looking to be served goes back out the other one. We repeat. Finding each other at last, I am left to be berated by this person for not being immediately available, and told hows he's friends with the owner, and helped ""build this damn place!"" I apologize for the delay, and take his order, comes out to $16.42. I will never forget that total.

Upon being asked to pay for the food, he becomes even more of an ass. ""You're CHARGING ME! I'm friends with the owner and built this place, and you are CHARGING ME!?!?! "" ""Yes sir, I have to charge you, as it is my job, and I don't know you, nor have I been instructed to give you free food, sorry."" I replied, and turned to begin making his food, IT doesn't take long, it's burgers hot dogs and fries, FFS, but this dude is standing right behind me the whole time (open kitchen with bar for customers to sit at.) mumbling under his breath at me about how slow I am and how if the place was being run right he wouldn't be having all these problems. Cursing at me, and in general just being a complete prick. I finished up his food, and went back to the register, pulled $16.42 out, and put it on the counter while I boxed up his food, after getting it all bagged and boxed nicely, I handed him his $16.42, and threw his dinner in the trash right in front of him. 

I told him he had to leave, as we were closing, and not to come back, as I was informing the rest of the crew not to serve him, ever. He leaves threatening all kinds of dire consequences, 'cause he's ""friends with the owner"" ""Once he knows how you were running this place, you'll be fired!"" I replied ""Do you SEE the owner? No? huh. Who do you think he put in charge? I'm here, and he is not, because he trusts me with his business, you go tell him anything you want, just get out of my store, before I call the police."" He left, foodless, and angry as hell cursing me the whole way. I should mention at this point, Maui closes at 9pm, being open till 10pm, we were literally the last option for food in town besides cold egg rolls from foodland, so its a good bet he went dinnerless that night. Best part of the whole thing, the webTV guy gets up, after watching all this, and says to me, ""Hey man, I have the same name as that guy, and that whole thing makes us look bad, you want me to go kick his ass?"" ""No, i said, but I'd love your phone number, so when my boss asks me about this, I can refer him to a customer that was here at the time."" I got to work the next day, and was questioned by my boss, who did in fact know the asshole, and when he found out about the behavior of his ""friend, then verified the account through Webtv guy, he permabanned him. Me and the Web tv guy became pretty good friends, and the guy mopping, well, he went to the emergency room for swollen testicles, but thats another story.

Tl;Dr: Do not fuck with the people who serve your food.

Edit: it has nothing to do with petty revenge, but while he was mpping the back dock, and I was dealing with above prick, he tripped over the mop somehow, and racked himself. The pain was apparently bad enough that he called his girlfriend to come pick him up. He no showed for work the next morning and I got a call from his SO telling me he wouldnt be in for a few days, with no explanation. When I told her that wasnt good enough, she told me he had to go to the emergency room at 3am to have surgery on testicles the size of a grapefruit. One had apparently gotten tangled up and was ""strangling"" itself. He said they cut his sac open and rolled it out on a tray right in front of him. Yes, I eventually saw them 3 days later, and they were horrifying, yellow and purple, swollen beyond belief, and wrapped in so much gauze he couldn't zip his pants.",null,0,cdfisv3,1qpivx,pettyrevenge,new,6

gohomecatyouaredrunk,"Nice. Had had roommates like this once back in college. They were so disgusting and never paid me for any of the utilities. I ended up moving in with my girlfriend at the time because they were so disgusting and cheap. 

Yes, that means I was paying for two apts for about 3 months. Well worth it though. I ended up putting a deadbolt on the door to my room and locked the cable modem inside after I moved all my stuff out. 

I cut all utilities (except the cheapest internet) off because they weren't paying their share of the power/water/gas/internet/tv. Took them a whole week to figure out why the power to just our apt had been out and nobody else's. Being in college, internet is important. 

I kept that active and in my name but had it unplugged. Bc the apt still had an active and current account, that was in my name only, my roommates could not add service, upgrade, or call someone out to turn ""fix"" it. 

After I moved out and they got the other utilities turned back on in their names they then expected me to split the costs with them. Told those fuckers ""sure, I paid all of the utilities for 3 months, including hookup fees. with 4 people living there, I should be covered for the rest of the year so they can just subtract it from what you owe me.""

Of course, I left the door locked with the room light, 3 lamps, and the fauset open. Left the window open as well (extremely hot summers/decently cold winters in our area) so whenever they ran the ac or heat it made the units work overtime.

When I wanted to go visit friends or stay somewhere, I took MY car, so she was stuck at home until I decided I wanted to go back (rural house). I locked MY bedroom door so she couldn't use the comp. I completely separated financially so she suddenly realised how much of her income was actually mine.

Also she realised her friends were mostly MY friends. The phrase ""I'm going over to the guys place, seeya"" became so amazing when she realised they knew she was a dumb bitch and didn't want to hang with her anyway.

She eventually moved out with a Christian guy who wanted to 'Rescue' her so that was all good. They were pregnant within 2 months and married a couple months after.
He then abused the shit out of her and forbid her to leave the house without him or have friends. She fled to a womans refuge for 6 months while he tried to track her down.

When a freshman an living in the dorms I had a friend who was in a different dorm room. His roommate was mildly annoying who tried to be the stoner hippy guy and also try to project the ""I know more than you"" attitude. He never did anything too terrible to anyone, just sort of annoying.

One day I was at his dorm doing a bit of pre-drinking.  His roommate left suddenly for some dumb reason. I look and notice his computer was left unlocked. So I took it upon myself to make it that whenever he logged in it would open some gay porn site.  I thought I was uber-clever of me to not simply put it in the startup folder, but to bury it in the registry (this was likely windows 98, maybe ME, not sure). That way if he happened to have a friend who knew what to look for, they'd really have to know what they're doing and judging him, those friends didn't exist to him.

We leave before the roommate comes back. He had no idea.

I come visit the same friend a few weeks later and his roommate comes in and turns his computer on. I suddenly remember what I did to his machine and just waited for his reaction. Sure enough it starts up and boom: gay-porn.

With his stoner voice he says ""what the hell?? I think my computer thinks I'm gay!""

He never thought that somebody was playing a joke on him. I got my laugh and offered to remove it for him realizing what I did was sort of douchey. He asked if it was due to him watching porn on it. I just nodded. That's all he needed to know.",null,0,cdhph3q,1qx2lb,pettyrevenge,new,8

ivegotthegoldenticke,"I totally relate on this. I just had an AWFUL flight experience because of the person sitting next to me. To begin with the girl was overweight and on the border of needing two seats. She was in the aisle seat and I had the window seat. 

She would NOT put down the armrest between our seats, I don't even know if it would've fit because her leg was spilling into my side. This was extra annoying because it was JetBlue and the headphone plugs are in the middle armrest....and I was only flying JetBlue because they have cable! Anyway, I just awkwardly plugged in the headphones and shrugged it off.

Then came take off. She was not wearing a seat belt AND she left her phone on. I was convinced the plane was going to crash because she was just tempting fate too much, and I took solace in the fact that her death would've been extra violent in the event of a crash. But again, I just dealt with it...only a 3 hour flight.

Soon after take off I get hangover/motion sickness nausea. So I politely ask if I can get out of the seat and go to the bathroom. .....This bitch has the nerve to try and squeeze her large body into the seat so I can slide past her. Who doesn't just stand up and let the other person out?! Let alone the fact that a child couldn't even squeeze between the chair and her body!

My revenge? I hadn't showered prior to the flight and made sure to rub my stench on her as I squeezed past. Hope she enjoys the smell of sweaty ass. Bitch. ",null,2,cdimlnk,1qzcxw,pettyrevenge,new,5

BurgerThyme,"Ugh. I once had some silly-looking bitch ask me if I would mind swapping seats so she and her bimbo friends could sit together. Of course I didn't mind at all because she was switching out of an emergency row seat and I am a tall girl who appreciates her extra leg room but before I could even open my mouth to respond, bitch just says ""she doesn't mind"" to the flight attendant. I was debating for a microsecond about concocting a ridiculous excuse and denying them but ohhhhh that sweet leg room.
&gt;A friend and I were traveling together, but had been assigned an aisle and window seat. We were hoping no one would be seated between us, but some guy hopped on the flight just before we left. My friend asked him if he wanted an aisle seat—he said, ""sure!"" and started to get up, but when she pointed out that in the row next to ours  and the one behind us there were empty aisle and middle seats, he refused politely and sat back down. Weird, but no big deal. We expected someone to be in the middle seat when we got the seating assignments, so this guy's own stupidity confused us more than it annoyed us.

&gt;Generally, I tend to give the person in the middle seat a lot of leeway: full reign of the armrest, keeping any of my movements into their space to a minimum (air, lights, etc). He began our relationship by splaying his elbows into my seating area, and listening to shitty live music on his phone without headphones, but electronic devices would be turned off soon enough, and I figured I'd only need to say something if he did it again after takeoff. I used a magazine as a force field to get his elbow out of my seat, turned the channel to something boring enough to sleep to, and settled in. Thankfully the music stopped once he turned off his phone for takeoff, and I thought it would be the end of that.

&gt;Once we were in the air, though, he threw his jacket over himself, spilling sleeves and coattails into my seat and my friend's seat, and both of us kept handing back his sleeves, asking him to be more careful. He'd make a show of tucking in loose ends and being in his own space, but every time he shifted it would happen again. I later found out he had also used my friend's armrest controls and gotten wildly confused when his channels weren't changing, but when he was asked to stop did he apologize? Of course not. He was just generally a clueless idiot.

&gt;Here's the thing: clueless idiot thing aside, he *really wasn't that bad.* Until...

&gt;My personal last straw was when I fell asleep comfortably, and woke up in a deep sweat because he had taken it upon himself to turn off my air. He kept craning his neck into my seating area to look out the window, so once I caught on to that, I shut it for the rest of the flight ""so I could sleep."" Thing is, I like to see the lights in the city when we land, so I had to weigh my options when we began to descend: I knew he would enjoy the show, but I, too, wanted to see the lights, and I felt an opportunity for petty revenge.

&gt;So I opened the window, and he jumped into action, craning his neck, moving his elbows into my space, trying to see better. So I made sure my whole face was taking up that window and I turned around to make my best ""Wow, this is AMAZING"" face at my friend. Eventually he reached behind me to open the window between us and the row behind us, but by then he was clearly agitated and the plane had reached the landing strip—too late. I leaned back in my seat, affecting his view of the other window, and shut my own window pointedly.

&gt;When we got off the plane, we were behind him talking about how pretty the city looks from up in the sky, and he shot me a nasty look before we parted ways. I could only grin.

We were at a Chinese buffet.  Boy was probably 7 or 8 and was being a hyper little mess.  He was climbing under tables and not just ours but other families.  He was running in the restaurant and any time I told him to stop, his mom would step in and make sure that I was silenced.

Maybe he had to work late and was rushing to get to a parent-teacher conference. Maybe he forgot he was supposed to pick his kid up after soccer practice. 

You were in no rush to get anywhere, and wasted 25 minutes playing games with three other motorists, two of whom had done nothing wrong. 

In doing so, you created an unsafe situation for yourself, the two vehicles behind you, and the unwitting truck driver, who likely had multiple vehicles pass him on the right as you clogged the passing lane. 

And why, really? Because a fellow motorist followed too closely behind you momentarily? 

Listen, I've gotten upset and spiteful on the highway before. I've hit the windshield washers to mist a car riding my ass, for sure. But I try to be more zen these days. The road belongs to all of us, it's incredibly important in our day-to-day lives, and it should be treated as something to share.

BTW, in most states, it's against the law to not yield the passing lane for faster vehicles. Seen those ""slower traffic keep right"" signs? It doesn't matter if he was speeding. The rule was written to prevent unsafe situations like the one you caused. So you're not exactly in the moral right in this situation.

Just to clear up, and I think in the context, ""got"" is accurate, but I might say ""received"" - since you received it at your ceremony, where you hammered the asshat ASM with his just desserts. 

But in the future, make sure that you refer to your ""earning"" the award. Because you earned it. Using the word ""earned"" is better to all scouts, past, present and future. You're part of the club, welcome to it, happy to have you - now - make sure you give back. ;) You'll have gotten something from the earning of the award, there will be a time to give back. 

(And maybe, since you've a personal stake in it, that might include your own lobbying for opening up the adult leadership to inclusivity... )

Pause

""Radio to all units, 78s reference signal 72: 78s on a blue van, Florida tag XYY 555, last scene northbound on main street from 2nd ave. Single call complaint no further information, 2124 hours.""

If a unit on the road happens to be in the area and sees the van, they can't just stop the vehicle because someone called in to complain, they have to observe a violation themselves. 

If someone is following you like this, put your flashers on and call 911. Advise them you are being followed. Give them a description of the vehicle and driver and do what the dispatcher advises you to do.

While I am simpathetic and aware of the plight of the trucker, I will not tolerate a bully. I am driving on the highway while this truck comes up behind another driver and tailgates the shit out of him. I mean there is literally two or three inches between his truck and the other car. The guy swerves over, naturally, because there is nothing in his rear view but the grill of a huge Kenworth truck bearing down on him. I was driving a '68 Chevelle at the time, and it had a great and powerful V8 engine. Passing the truck was no problem. Then I'd slow down to about 40 and wait for him to honk and get pissed tailgating me. No shits given. Then he finally has a chance to change lanes and pass me. Not for long. With a light push of my foot the car growls and pushes me back as I easily overtake him again. Wash, rinse, repeat until I reach my exit.

I'm not saying I did not deserve some of these, but the overall effect is simply the message that whatever I, my siblings, or my parents do, I will get hit.  So do whatever I want, it's going to suck for a bit, and then it will be over (plus some issues later in life).

I have 3 routers for different purposes, 2 D-Link and one Cisco.  One of my laptops supports 802.11a/b/g/n.  Both the Cisco and one D-Link support a/b/g/n, while the second D-Link only support b/g.

Every other machine can connect to the a/b/g/n router, and the same machine can connect to every other router, but they refuse to connect with each other.

She ended up having me call my manager over.  He handled the transaction, but could tell she wasn't being helpful.  So, he intentionally took as long as possible to process her exchange (returning two items and buying two others) and kept stopping to call back to the department the items were in and verify prices.

This is not my revenge but Zelda's, my 9 year old daughter. To give a bit of a back story, she's been classmates with a girl, Dana, since kindergarten. They have become the best of friends. Dana has Down Syndrome and doesn't have many other friends at school. Zelda always tries to include her in the fun.

Yesterday at first recess this 13 year old boy, John, thought it would be hilarious to make fun of Dana. He called her ""retarded"" and ""ugly""; he also called her ""baby"" for eating baby food at lunch (she does eat baby food but she has to). This made Dana so upset that her mom had to come get her from school.

After recess my daughter was asked to go out to the portable classroom to grab some papers from the other 4th grade class. When she was changing out of her indoor shoes, instead of putting her boots on, she put on the boots that belonged to John. She then got the papers from the portable classroom like her teacher had asked. Then she walked over to a big pile of dog shit; a pile of dog shit that she had noticed earlier. She stepped in it, repeatedly, until crap was all over John's boots. She went back to class, changed back into her shoes, put John's boots back, and did her schoolwork.

Lunchtime came around and all the kids were getting ready to go outside. John sees and smells what's on his boots and promptly starts to bawl. My daughter said, ""stop being such a baby,"" and went to outside on lunch recess to build snowmen.

She came home and told me this story but she thought she would be in trouble. Instead I made her a cup of hot cocoa and let her watch SpongeBob.",null,2,cdpe9dl,1rnco5,pettyrevenge,new,6

The clerk could tell it this way: ""A mean man came into the store being extremely demanding and short with me; we make headstones. I was the only one working that day and I got another call. The caller is grumpy and demanding as well. The first grumpy guy then threatens to leave if I don't give him attention, now, or he'll take his business elsewhere. He doesn't know that the owner of the store next to us also owns this store and is my father. So I said, 'Yeah, good luck with taking your business elsewhere.' So he left and went next door and bought a $4000 headstone.""

Your story could be helped if you included what the clerk was talking about on the phone. Was it personal or business?

What if the call was about a bus - load of people that just died and he was negotiating a deal with an organization that was going to pay for ask their headstones? 

The clerk could have handled the situation better, obviously. I just think I am missing something important for this story to click for me. ",null,24,cdpoa48,1rpfe5,pettyrevenge,new,24

But that is my luck. 

Hopefully she gets an office with strict policies that will refuse to see her. 

Wait a week and call her back with some bad news. Tell her you are referring her to a specialist and ask her what time is good for her to have her appointment. Make sure to tell her you will arrange it and call her back with the details.

Relay everything back and forth between the two, except schedule their appointment an hour or two earlier than they're asking for. They'll show up late to their appointment and have to either wait or rebook, and potentially be charged for it.

Or if you want to be a little less mean, schedule it an hour later than they're asking, so they get to spend extra time waiting.

You can do this even if the doctor is the one choosing the time; just continue relaying everything he says except changing the time.

Just be careful that one caller can't hear you talking to the other. Maybe mute the phone you're not talking into.",null,4,cdpvp0q,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,new,22
