Mrknowitall666,"You're killing me, trying to put it in eli5

Ok, you got the gist that Fermat was trying to generalize Pythagoras theorem of right triangles... a2+b2=c2.

In short Fermat said that beyond squares there were no integers that worked. That is, you can't take a3+b4 to get c3.


And,in fact the proofs were finally accomplished, after over 300,where Fermat simply commented that he'd leave the proof to the reader. Which formed that math major joke. 

And, I don't recall the last theorem having to do with areas of squares. But i could be wrong. Problem am, actually. ",null,0,cdkrp35,1r8wp6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

So any motion that happens during those milliseconds is recorded onto one frame, creating motion blur. This smooths the motion between frames. Using more frames means less time per frame and less motion blur which people aren't used to in their movies.

In video games, every single frame is created on its own and only shows one instant in time. There is no blur unless you put it there on purpose.

Slightly more in depth answer - Router software is complex, and involves things like routing tables (basically a list of places that your router can connect to), as well as QoS (quality of service, which prioritizes certain types of internet traffic, so video/voice services are faster, at the expense of waiting an extra second or two for an email to come through), firewall services, filesharing services, and other features.

If the queues are completely full, you'll lose several packets and your router will be forced to request several resends making the situation even worse.

danceycat,"Psychological disorders are defined by people in the DSM.  I don't know exactly how it works or the details, but a group of people decide what changes to be added to the latest editions of the DSM every now and then.  Should X be a disorder?

Disorders are pretty much defined and diagnosed by symptoms in an effort to treat and study them.  Homosexuality could be a psychological disorder, if the people who updated the DSM chose to define it as such (though probably many people would disagree with it, but the DSM is what determines whether or not certain symptoms are a disorder).  However, things are labeled as disorders so they can be treated, not because there is something in the brain that is different than the majority of people.  If homosexuality were labeled a disorder, the implications would be that it would be treated.  Though this used to be the case (and homosexuality was indeed in the DSM), it isn't any more (at least in western society as a whole today).

In general, changes to the rules can be filibustered, and a 67-vote threshold is required to cut off debate on any such change. But a ruling from the presiding officer of the Senate on the rules can be affirmed or overturned by a majority vote.

***A likely scenario:*** Reid invokes cloture on a nomination. If Republicans object, Reid raises a point of order and asks the presiding officer for a ruling from the chair on how many votes are needed to confirm an executive branch nominee. The presiding officer turns to the parliamentarian and ask for a ruling. The parliamentarian responds that according to precedent, 60 votes are required. The presiding officer then declares filibusters on executive branch nominees invalid, followed by a vote requiring 51 votes to uphold the ruling.

....now, that's an example of a possible route, and it has its own issues like whether the presiding officer can make that decision, and what point of order needs to be raised.

Because fuel only burns well when it's mixed in a fairly narrow range of ratios with air, adding more air means you have to add more fuel. Using more fuel, and enough air to let it burn well, makes more power.

bulksalty,"I worked at a walmart, and it was basically like any other job.  There were good points and bad points, but I think we were a pretty good store.  Walmart has its silly points (like the ""cheer"" they do before shifts) but is very, very good at product distribution (they knew to the dollar how much sales had changed from the year before for every department and orders were designed to cover 1-2 days sales (and they regularly did) and this was long before the internet made that common in business.  Even at our relatively good store, employee turnover was 100% (we had 300 employees and in a year 300 employees would leave and 300 new employees would be hired)!  

During the time there, I learned something, retail employees blow off steam by complaining.  At first I thought it was Wal-mart, but having later made friends with much better paid retail employees they did the same thing on breaks.  

No one ever asked us to work off the clock (when I'd first started my only experience was farm work which doesn't take breaks, ever) and I got in trouble for not taking my 15 minute breaks as scheduled, it would have been a firing offense in our store for a manager to ask you to work off the clock.  

Even then we weren't ever scheduled to work close to 40 hours, most weeks I was scheduled for 35-38 hours, not getting done within 39 hours would have been an issue.  This was fine with me (I was a student at the time), but may not have been ideal for non-student employees.  

Costco pays far more, but they can afford to be picky (hiring only the best employees after training by other retailers) and don't have turnover.  There wouldn't be room for everyone to follow Costco's strategy.  

TL; DR: Wal-mart is like most entry level jobs, but as America's largest retailer they have more stores and more chance for a shitty manager to become a headline, they're excellent at distribution but tend to be relatively bad at high touch service (partly because they've found that their customers won't pay for it--which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy).  

Edit: Clarified employee turnover and fixed a capitalization.  Also, I'm happy to answer questions and rarely shop in the local Wal-marts near me because they're pretty terrible (I told someone about a spill knowing it was f'ing drop everything to fix this only to have the employee either not understand me or totally ignore me), stores were filthy and checkers are very slow.

* Wages: Union stores seem to have a slightly better wage structure than WalMart. We start out slightly above minimum wage, but after union dues your take home is actually less than that of a minimum wage worker. The one guy in the documentary said it took him 2 years to get a $1/hr raise, whereas in my union it only takes a year. As a side note, I have 2 friends who used to work overnights at WalMart, whose starting wages were more than I'm making now after 3 years.

* Working off the clock: There seemed to be two sides to this one. One was that managers told employees to work off the clock, the other was that employees were put under so much pressure to perform that they worked off the clock on their own volition to keep up. I have no idea how prevalent this is, but in any case it is illegal, and you can report your employer for making you work off the clock.

* Funny that /u/Ipooponpee mentioned pharmaceuticals. Today my shop steward was telling me that the union had just changed its policy, and under our prescriptions coverage you now had to buy from a pharmacy at one of our union's stores.

* Keeping employees' hours low so they wouldn't have to pay full time benefits/overtime: This is true, my friends who worked at Walmart said that anyone who worked too much got pulled aside and talked to. But, it's fairly similar at my store. I'm part time, but was regularly working 40 hours a week. According to our contract, if you average 40 hours a week for 3 or 6 months, I forget which, the store had to offer you full time benefits. But the unspoken rule is that you don't ask, because if you do you get your hours cut.",null,1,cdkxdz6,1r9fb1,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5
__Pers,"Several reasons. Though Walmart isn't unique in this regard, they are symbolic: the Walton family alone has more personal wealth than the 40 million poorest Americans, many of whom work and shop in their stores, making them a convenient symbol of out-of-control inequality. 

A few specifics: Walmart doesn't pay a living wage to its average workers. Their typical employees tend to require assistance from various public programs (food stamps, welfare, Medicaid, etc.) and the average cost of these services is of order $900k per year per superstore opened, amounting, in effect, to a taxpayer subsidy for the Walton family. In locations where the local minimum wage is higher than the national minimum, they build their stores just outside city limits, often violating building ordinances and environmental laws.

the equator is the zero line of the coordinate, that goes from **-90°** to **+90°**, the Prime Meridian is the zero line of the coordinate, that goes from **0°** to **360°**. if the prime meridian went around, and you only had coordinates going from **0°** to **180°**, one set of coordinates would give you two different positions.

redliness,"Electropop is the oldest of those. As the name implies, it's a form of pop music, with prominent singing and a verse/chorus/verse structure, that relies on synthesisers and electronic keyboards for its melody and prominent computerised drum machines for its beat. It was a huge influence on 80s pop and you've [heard electropoppy stuff a billion times](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldyx3KHOFXw). Not necessarily, but usually, it features 'rough' singing that (unlike 60s pop, or soul music, or disco) is clearly unprofessional and doesn't try to be, sort of like punk musicians that got bored of angry rock and started getting silly with computers.

House came a few years later. It was the first form of electronic dance music to become mainstream. It kind of takes up the mantle of disco music, but with more computerisation -- it's got a disco feel, and disco aesthetics/vibes a lot of the time, but has a steady drum machine where disco usually had physical drums, really heavy and prominent synthesised bass, and felt more 'robotic' and rhythmic and less 'funky'. House artists might take bits of old disco songs and reuse portions of them in more electronic ways, especially French house artists [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUC2b-OSZ00&amp;t=1m25s), which you've probably heard. 

Techno came out shortly after that. It is much more rigid, with common structures and very steady clear beats. It was intended directly for dancing, not for casual listening, and was heavily associated with molly and rave culture for a long time. [Stuff like this would be called techno](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcpxjX4koRc). 

Dubstep is the newest form, it's existed as its own genre for 10 years now, and is pretty clearly defined as the fusion of dub music (a bassy, rhythmic offshoot of reggae with more emphasis on dancing and less on vocals/singing) and 2-step, a form of English dance music with jagged offbeat shuffled rhythms. It's a form of dance music that makes heavy use of bass and sub-bass, empty space (silence or quietness between moments), and unsteady patterns, and (when vocals appear at all) minimal reggae-ish spoken vocals. Famous successful dubstep songs are things like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pTSGvp7T8&amp;t=1m26s) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaU-pnassYM&amp;t=57s).

Techno music has a BPM ( Beat per minute ) of anywhere from 130 BPM to 155 BPM. If you need a reference, the 70's disco music was usually at 120 BPM. Techno is also created in a 4/4 time measurement which is 4 quarter beats in 1 measure.  
The beat per minute for house is anywhere from 115 BPM to 135 BPM and has been created with real instruments such as a piano or a bass guitar.  
Trancemusic has a tempo of anywhere from 130 BPM to 160 BPM and is also in a 4/4 beat measure.  
Drum &amp; Bass (the pre dubstep genre) is an offshoot of many styles and genres such as reggae, electro, hip hop and funk. The BPM is pretty fast, usually at anywhere from 150 BPM to 180 BPM. It is really more for listening like the IDM ( Intelligent dance music ) genre because of the speed and chaos of the drums and beat.

Magnus77,"Its a pleasant sensation usually described as tingling brought on by certain sensations called triggers. If you've ever gotten goosebumps from listening to a song you found beautiful, this is similar.

On youtube there is a group of channels of ASMR channels that specialize in making videos with sounds that trigger that response. Some of the more common ones are simulated whispering in your ear, scratching, tapping or rubbing noises, which are heightened by the use of directional/binaural audio, which means if you wear headphones the sound will seem to be coming from a certain position, which increases the sensation.

There's also often roleplays or reaffirming dialogues which are used to relax the listener and even encourage falling asleep. 

There's a woman on youtube that does a lot of these called heather feather who I enjoy quite a bit, so maybe grab a pair of earbuds and watch a few of her videos.

mikejonas,"A lot of television entertainment as we know it today was carried over from the live theater (also by way of radio), so in a sense, they were theatrical performances that happened to be recorded and broadcast.   So in the early days of sitcoms, that's kind of how they set things up--each episode would be a little play in front of an audience, who would obviously laugh and react to the action they watched in front of them.

The TV audience got used to this format over the decades, so even shows that didn't have a live audience (animated shows like the Flintstones, single-camera sitcoms like Bewitched) included an artificial laugh track.

And yeah, there is something sort of psychologically comforting about it, our instinctive itch to belong being scratched by laughing along with others, even if the others are on the other side of the screen.

I'm not one of those narrow-minded, cynical types who think that a laugh track is an indicator that the show is somehow cheesy or unsophisticated--many of television's most important and genuinely funniest sitcoms have had laugh tracks.  Also ridiculous is the assumption that single-camera, non-laugh-track shows are automatically superior--there've been plenty of stinkers over the years since they've come into fashion.

It's interesting that someone mentioned ""How I Met Your Mother's"" laugh track, because the show is actually a sort of ""hybrid"" in this sense--a stylistic choice by its creators, who wanted the feel of the old-fashioned multi-camera sitcoms but wanted to innovate on the format.  Unlike Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and other current ""laugh track"" sitcoms, who record their shows the old fashioned way by rehearsing through the week and then performing each episode live in front of a studio audience a couple of times (with the final product being edited together from the two recordings), HIMYM actually shoots like a single-camera TV show, without a live audience, shooting the scenes piecemeal and not necessarily in chronological order, and doing as many takes as they feel comfortable with.  They do have the cameras and stage set up so that it has the ""look"" of a traditional sitcom, but it's put together differently.  That allows HIMYM to be paced faster than your average multi-camera sitcom (a HIMYM episode has about three times as many scenes as a Two and a Half Men episode), and allows for a lot of humor ""in the edit"" via quick flashbacks and cutaways.   Because of this and the fact that the laugh track is more subtle (you don't hear the audience cheer and whoop it up whenever a beloved character shows up for the first time in the episode), some people don't actually notice that there's a laugh track until they discover it much later.

This combined with parents pushing for autism diagnosis is the reason it is so overdiagnosed.

So when someone tells you that they've been diagnosed with autism, it doesn't mean much by itself.  It tells you nothing about their social or behavioral issues.  There are hundreds of signs that are used to make the diagnosis, and there's no single sign that can be attributed to every single person with the diagnosis.

But I'll give it a try.Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by a lack of empathy to some degree. The word is derived from auto, meaning self, implying the person is incapable of perceiving the world outsode of themselves to some degree. In the most mild forms of autism, including Asperger's, the person can often function normally and may even be a savant (extremely gifted in a specific area), but they have trouble reading social situations and conveying emotion. Imagine you are upset because your friend's carpet is too blue. To an average person this wouldn't even be a problem, or you might jokingly tell your friend you don't like his carpet. To someone with Asperger's, who doesn't understand sarcasm or tact, they might think its perfectly appropriate to begin screaming at the carpet for being too blue, or at their friend for having such a blue carpet, or at their parents for bringing them to a place with such a blue carpet. And they lack the skills to explain why blue carpets bother them, which makes it even more frustrating. Children with Asperger's are often easily distracted and have a hard time generalizing skills (I wrote with a pencil on a notepad and made words, so the only time I can ever write anything is with that pencil on that notepad.)More severe forms of autism essentially isolate the person from the world. They aren't aware that people around them are actual human beings that care about them. People are background objects, like trees in a park, and there is no value in paying attention to them. Children with severe autism have an extremely hard time learning, even when they aren't concurrently diagnosed with mental retardation (which they often are.) Their brains are essentially on autopilot, performing tasks without higher level comprehension as to why or how. They are alone but aren't even aware of what alone means.The good news is that the earlier a child is diagnosed, their outcome become exponentially more positive.

jixig,"A computer virus is nothing magical, it's just a series of instructions like any computer program, but with malicious intent. It takes advantage of different features of your operating system to do things that you'd probably not like it doing. Keystrokes, for example, are readily available to be logged so that different programs can react to what you're typing, but a virus can turn that intent into tracking your passwords, bank accounts, etc..

Not sure how technical you want to get here, but when a computer program runs, the operating system will find its raw data on the hard drive and place its code into virtual memory (RAM) where it's quickly accessible. Then it looks up where the starting point/instruction is and lets it take off. That computer program can see its own code body, however, and make copies of itself if it wants to.

It can also seek out other programs/executables (and other file types in general) and use the operating system functionality to load THOSE into memory. But instead of executing them, they'll modify the contents, usually by adding the body of the virus into it somewhere. A common way to do this is to find gaps in the computer program caused by file alignments. To relate this to more understandable terms, let's pretend that a physical representation of a computer program can fit into one or more fixed-size shipping boxes. But it only needs 10% of a certain box to run. The virus can fill the other 90% of the space with its own code, and then make sure it gets executed.

How do they steal your information: The aforementioned keylogger, for one, is a common way. They can also present you with fake ""security patches"" that capture your information.

These exceptions include exceptions for privacy (so they can redact the names of their employees in certain instances, or the phone numbers of private citizens if you, say, asked for a bunch of passport applications because you were doing a study on immigration patterns.) for the safety of confidential informants, and protecting trade secrets. 

Most importantly for your question, there is an [exemption](http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-exemptions.pdf) for national security information, meaning information that is properly classified.  Now, you can ask for information to be declassified, which an agency may or may not do, or your FOIA request can prompt an agency to review if something should be classified.

When you buy a property 'Freehold', you are buying the house and the land underneath it

When you buy 'Leasehold' you are buying the house but only renting the land. This means you have to either pay 'ground rent' or have a long term lease on the land

A 999year lease is as good as buying it outright but just means the developers want to keep the land in their portfolio.  Probably more useful where land values are expected to rise and they would be able to sell the land at a later date for a great profit.

OldWolf2,"There are a few different sorts of legal ownership of land: freehold, leasehold, cross-lease (amongst others).

I believe that the London 999-year lease is **leasehold**,  although in my country anyway, all of the ownership types include a lease term.

(Rest of this post applies to New Zealand only, but our system is based on the British one, so some of it may also apply there).

**Freehold** (aka. fee simple) is defined as a 99-year lease from the Crown here, but it gets renewed to 99 years on sale (and I presume the owner has the right to renew it at any time).  It's done like this so that the country the land is in still has the right to charge you property tax, and apply the laws of the country, etc.  For most intents and purposes, you own the land absolutely.

**Cross-lease** is also popular here, it's where there is a single underlying freehold title, but two members agree to both share the freehold title, and also lease half of the property from the other person for 999 years (which is the closest the law allows to saying ""in perpetuity"".

Cross-leases are typically used when the land is too small to divide into two separate freehold titles (city councils have rules about that); or occasionally when an unscrupulous developer is too lazy to subdivide properly.

**Leasehold** is where one person owns the land freehold and then they lease the buildings out.  This is the worst type of ownership if you're the one buying the lease; because the leaseholder can change the terms of usage of the land, and also put up the rent. There was a case recently where some leasehold titles included a lease of $7000/yr for the land, and then they were renewed (this happens every 21 years) for a rent of $84,000.  So most people who owned houses on this leasehold land were immediately ruined , because they couldn't afford this rent and the re-sale value of the house was destroyed.

So except for a few rare circumstances, normal peons don't really ""OWN"" land, they rent it. Long term ( 999 year + ) leases are the only way for normal peons to 'own' land. Such leases usually allow transference to the leasers heirs or other assignees. But after 999 years, the land and all fixed improvements (houses, roads, etc) would revert to the original land owner or their assignees/heirs.

Also, in the UK, if you make improvements to the land, build a house, etc, then all fixed items become property of the landowner once the lease is up. You only retain movable assets, or chattel.

This is a leftover of the medieval feudalism.

This is why the US was such a big deal for early settlers. Here, lowly peons could own land free and clear, and turn it over to their heirs, or sell/trade it, without worrying if the lease would revert to some lord or master in 50 or 999 years.

Loss of consciousness (LOC) is part of almost every algorithm we use in assessing trauma patients, particularly those involved in blunt (car, motorcycle, etc.) trauma. Its far less important in penetrating truama (guns and knives), unless that trauma is directly to the head.
There is direct correlation between LOC and type and severity of head injury. Now, a finer point here is WHEN the loss of consciousness happened (immediately after the injury vs during resuscitation). Loss of consciousness during the transport to and while in the trauma bay is a different beast than immediate LOC during the incident. But as trauma surgeons, when we make the decision on whether or not to CT scan someone's head to look for injury, LOC is often very high on our list of reasons for doing so.
That being said, the below commenters who say that a conscious patient is more easily assessed than an unconscious one, amen.

If a trauma patient has lost blood, either internally or externally, the body's mechanisms for maintaining cerebral perfusion kick in (tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, reduction in blood flow to less vital organs such as the kidneys). We see these effects as shock which get progressively worse as the patient loses more intravascular volume (ie blood). When the patient begins to become confused, or unconscious, this is a sign that the body's mechanisms for compensating for the blood loss are no longer sufficient to maintain the brain's blood supply, and we need to do something about it!

So, keeping the patient talking isn't important for them as much as it's important for us to monitor: 1) their neurological status (from injury) and 2) their intravascular volume status.

 To make it as simple as possible, the human retina consists of two broad classifications of photo-receptive cell: rods and cones. The cones detect 'colour' light (or more accurately, detect three different ranges of wavelengths of light, and determine colour by comparison), whereas the rods are better at black-and white (due to not making colour comparisons).

 The rod cells are the focus here. Rod cells are wider than cones, and can capture a larger amount of information for each cell. Because of this, they are much better at motion than cone cells. In addition to this, cone cells are mostly in the centre of the retina, while rods are found towards the outside. This means that the centre of the eye is more adept at colour, while the peripheral detects more motion.

  This should give a good basis for why you can see motion better out of the peripheral, but doesn't quite explain why vision in the dark is better in the peripherals. To do this, we need to revisit the colour comparison idea I mentioned in the first paragraph.

  Since cone vision (centre of visual field) determines colour by comparison of three cone types, the peak response for each differs. Rods only have one wavelength range, which peaks right about the middle of the visual spectrum. Because of this, the visual range of three cone types is much larger than the range of one rod.

  If you've stuck with me so far, I can put it all back together now. Rods, which specialise in motion and are found in the peripheral of the visual field, detect light in 'black-and-white' (to put it crudely). Because of this (and a few interactions of photoreceptive proteins), they can adapt to the dark faster than cones. This means that while it is *mostly* in black and white, your vision in the dark is better with your rods than your cones, and being found in the peripheral of the visual field, your dark vision is hence better in your peripherals.

Points against immigration:

* Many Americans are unemployed because immigrants are willing to do their jobs for less money. In some cases, this is true. In other cases, immigrants are often willing to do jobs that are so crappy that most Americans aren't willing to do them.

* Since immigrants aren't citizens, they don't pay taxes, but are still eligible to receive some government benefits. For example, it is illegal to deny a child a public education on the basis that he/she is an illegal immigrant.

* Much of the money that an immigrant earns is sent back to his/her home country, removing money from our economy and weakening it.

* Many who oppose illegal immigration will try to link it with crime, such as by bringing up stories of individual illegal immigrants who commit crimes like rape or murder, or trying to correlate the low income of illegal immigrants to the fact that most crime is committed by low-income individuals. In my opinion, the first type are really the exception and not the rule, most illegal immigrants are good people. I do believe that deportation should be a mandatory part of the sentence for illegal immigrants who commit felonies, though. As for the second part, it has been shown that low-income illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than US citizens in the same income bracket.

Points for immigration:

* The human aspect. Illegal immigrants are basically just trying to make better lives for themselves and their families. Sometimes you have situations where an illegal couple has children in the US, making them citizens, so to deport them would be to separate children from their parents.

* In many industries, employing illegal immigrants drives prices down. For example, when farms employ illegal immigrants, their labor cost goes down, and in turn the cost of groceries goes down for the rest of the country, making it easier for Americans to feed themselves.

* Many programs meant to curb illegal immigration have some fairly racist implications. For example there was the law passed in Arizona a few years back that police could stop motorists if they had reason to believe they were illegal immigrants, which, to an extent, was translated as ""being Hispanic is probable cause.""",null,1,cdl59x5,1ra5m2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7

JohnSmith1800,"&gt;Is it just a method of searching for life based on what we already know

Pretty much. Our understanding of the development of life on Earth is that it required the presence of liquid water (and some other relatively common trace elements). Although forms of life exist which live outside of environments with liquid water, they all originated from the first cell. They are also almost exclusively small and boring (and their cell is still water filled).

Given that we don't know of any other way life could start, we discount planets which orbit either too far or too close to their host star for liquid water to exist on their surface. We also focus on rocky planets, although a gas giant in the ""habitable zone"" would almost certainly have some rocky moons which might have water. There is a growing number of candidate planets which are in, or on the edge of, the habitable zone. With a suitable greenhouse effect, there could well be liquid water on some of them (the habitable zone is therefore a somewhat fluid term).

There's no reason that life couldn't originate elsewhere as you said, but we don't know what to look for so we don't make any assumptions/statements about planets out of the hospitable zone being capable of supporting life.",null,123,cdl7e56,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,603
prjindigo,"Basically we have a VERY good understanding of what chemical processes can generate energy for life to consume.  

There first must be some way to be able to generate a differential in energy.  

Next comes the chemical complexity necessary to support the development.

After that comes the external source and the replenishment of resource.


If an environment stops every form of any of these three, it is LITERALLY unable to support life - immaterial to the form of life in question.

Planets close enough to stars to cause metals like aluminum and copper to vaporize.

Planets too far enough away from heat that their temperature oscillates above and below the superconductive point.

Planets with thick atmospheres and massive gravity which impede energy transfer.  (these also tend to have insane amounts of radiation)

----------------------------------------------------------

On the other side of the argument we have exceptionally good ideas about what planets may harbor life.
While much of this is based on our ""Goldilocks Zone"" theories, there are several things necessary for bio-diversity.

A large moon or heavy tidal force that keeps the core molten and thus through vulcanism replenishes the surface minerals.

A complex atmosphere containing a wide range of gasses in mixture.

Both a day-night cycle AND some kind of mild yearly variance in weather due to tilt.  

A star with stable output.


So these second sets of conditions, when all met, will almost certainly result in development of some level of life on their planet.  Notice I didn't mention liquid water or weather that oscillates around a freezing point of a liquid!  These are NOT necessary.     The bacteria growing in the Chernobil reactor room don't appear to need liquid water at all and they're not exposed to a large variation in temperature!    They do however have a stable energy source, a complex atmosphere, replenishment of mineral resource and a daily/yearly weather variance.

dead_middle_finger,"prjindigo gives a great response. I agree with what he wrote.

One principle I did not see is much of it is due to the the inherent qualities of chemicals, for the actual ""being."" There are only so many chemicals that can be used. We are carbon based, because carbon is extremely extremely easy to create chemical bonds with other atoms. It would be very difficult to create a being with inert noble gases, like Argon, Neon. Those atoms do not combine with anything - their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be ""full"". So really, one needs to eliminate or assign a value to each *atom* relative to carbon. That way, one can get a ""standard"" probability or likelihood of combining to get life. 

Also,  carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. So ubiquity has something to do with what life forms can be made from. It would be difficult to create life with an extremely rare atom, just because of scarcity.

Hydrogen makes up 74% of the Milky Way Disk, and helium makes up 24%. This ratio is from the Big Bang. The rest of the Milky Way - 2% - is made of heavier atoms, which are generated from stellar nucleosynthesis, ie, we are all stardust, even other ""types"" of beings.

Then, you have to look at the relative abundance of atoms, and their combinatorial likelihoods. This has to do with what atom combines easily with another, *and* the relative abundance of each. And again, we are talking about 2% of the galaxy mass (non black matter).  For example, glycolaldehyde. It is a key ingredient for life. It helps to build Ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is thought to be the central molecule involved in the origin of life on Earth. Glycolaldehyde is a monosaccharide sugar, the basic unit of carbohydrates. It can react with the chemical propenal to form ribose, the building block of RNA. It would be nice if that shit were naturally occurring, right? Well, it is. It was spotted in a large star-forming area of space around 26,000 light-years from Earth in the less-chaotic outer regions of the Milky Way.   The finding, was made with the IRAM radio telescope in France, is published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Again, I am more concerned with the atomic level of life creation. All the other parts, like a planet being in a ""life supporting band"" is interesting. But ultimately, it depends on the atomic level - wether it can even happen with relative abundances and valances of atoms.

It would be interesting to find out how the energy would be generated. Here on earth, all beings, as far as I know, use the [Citric acid (Krebs) Cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Citric_acid_cycle_with_aconitate_2.svg) It is just atoms. For example, the citrate is C6H5O3−7.  Six Carbons, five Hydrogens, and seven Oxygen atoms. I bring this up, because bringing in energy, through some kind of energy source (food) is necessary if a being works and expends energy.

So the point is that there are actual physics limitations that determine what *actually* can happen, and the probability of it happening. So rather than creating a *theoretical model* of what is *possible* (habitable zone, presence of liquid water, etc) it is much better to create a 100% known information of what can happen, based on our actual knowledge of what *is.*

We are currently looking for these kinds of planets outside our solar system which lie in Safe (Habitable) zones. There are lists of [Habitable Planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potential_habitable_exoplanets) around the internet. These lists are continually growing (as well as the list of planets outside our solar system grows, in general).

Due to complexity of other elements, and the larger amount of carbon &amp; oxygen compared to these other more complex elements, we expect that life is most probable to be carbon, oxygen, and water based -- We assume that since it is the simplest, and most abundant choice that it is most likely to occur.

That aside, we can in fact see if a planet has an atmosphere. We have seen atmospheres before. Here is a bit of an explanation on that: [Link](http://astrobites.org/2012/11/11/detecting-exoplanet-atmospheres-from-the-ground/). 

It can be tricky to see it, but the easiest way in which we can detect an atmosphere on another planet is when a planet passes in front of it's own star. We see the outline of the planet, and with that, we also see the light coming from the star that passes through the atmosphere. 

Now, every gas has it's own signature it gives off when light passes through it, and by looking at this signature we can tell what gasses are present in the atmosphere. 

Oxygen is particularly unstable and reactive by itself. Over long periods of time, it will interact with other elements, changing both itself and them (think rust on metals, but this occurs with a lot of elements and compounds). By itself, in nature, Oxygen is so unstable that pure oxygen in the atmosphere of a planet is so unlikely that on a very large time scale it becomes impossible for an exoplanet's atmosphere to contain it.

Impossible unless you have a source of Oxygen renewal. Think of Earth. Animals use oxygen and make CO2. Plants, however, use CO2 and make oxygen. Without plants, we would run out of Oxygen in Earth's atmosphere.

For this reason if there is a significant amount of oxygen in the atmosphere of a planet outside of our solar system, it is a very good indication that there may be some form of life on that planet.

EDIT: However, keep in mind that a lot of these things *are* assumptions. They may be highly informed &amp; educated assumptions, but they are still just that. It is most likely that life will occur under similar conditions with similar chemical elements and compounds. This is not, however to say, that it must.

&gt; Plato has Socrates describe a gathering of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them, and begin to ascribe names to these shadows. According to Plato's Socrates, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall do not make up reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners.

Sinstrite,"Saying it as simply as I know how, scientists base their facts and theory-craft, even state the possible and impossible based off of the current rules in the laws of physics.  If you break down life as we know it to the most simplistic form, you can see it needs certain things in order to live, such as different types of mass as an outside source of energy to break down, sunlight, water, etc.  

If you were to ask a scientist if there is life on Mars, they would most likely say that as long as certain variables were there such as the right chemicals in the atmosphere, traces of water in the ground, the things life evolved from here on Earth, then they would say it's possible.  

They only say that though based on the current science and how life is bound to exist or not based on the fundamental laws of physics.  If we found a life form on Jupiter that does not ingest any type of outside mass as a way to convert it to energy, then the question is asked ""how does the life form sustain itself?"" - Let's say that to sustain itself, it rises from increasing pockets in its body to create a gas and then when it's at the right height, it releases the gas and falls at a fast rate.  The friction of its body against the atmosphere around it may create a type of heat which the life form can convert into energy, most of which is probably used to create more rising gas, and other energy to sustain it's basic life functions.

Well, some type of life form along those lines, my science is very bad obviously.  

But to discover a life form that lives that way would introduce new possibilities, because it doesn't need water, or to ingest mass, or to take away from anything in order to live.  Instead it lives solely from heat created from friction.

TLDR;

Basically because we have our ""rules"" that allow or don't allow life to exist currently, life we can study, we have decided to explore new possibilities using those rules as a template.  Until we discover a life form that goes against those rules, we will never know what is and isn't possible outside of that realm, because we can't actually ""test"" anything and come to a conclusion without a test subject (life form).",null,0,cdld2no,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

In order for this to happen, a planet must have elemental diversity. There could be life based on silicon rather than carbon (though it is less likely, as silicon doesn't form conjugated unsaturated or aromatic systems,) but one thing that definitely cannot happen is for life to evolve on a giant hunk of iron. A planet must have a substantial amount of at least several of the following elements: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, silicon, fluorine, chlorine, germanium, arsenic, selenium.

acid2,"We're mostly looking for what we've already seen but we can also make reasonable predictions on whether there's a possibility of life naturally evolving on a planet based on the chemical properties of the elements present there and hence use that knowledge to rule out certain planets as possibly home to some form of organic life. The following's an excerpt from Stephen Hawking's book The Grand Design that explains this in a bit more detail:

""Life ... depends on more complex elements [than, say, lithium or helium,  atoms whose nuclei contain two and three protons]. Carbon is the most important of these, the basis for all organic chemistry. Though one might imagine “living” organisms such as intelligent computers produced from other elements, such as silicon, it is doubtful that life could have spontaneously evolved in the absence of carbon. The reasons for that are technical but have to do with the unique manner in which
carbon bonds with other elements. Carbon dioxide, for example, is gaseous at room temperature, and biologically very useful. Since silicon is the element directly below carbon on the periodic table, it has similar chemical properties. However, silicon dioxide, quartz, is far more useful in a rock collection than in an organism’s lungs. Still, perhaps life-forms could evolve that feast on silicon and rhythmically twirl their tails in pools of liquid ammonia. Even that type of exotic life could not evolve from just the primordial elements, for those elements can form only two stable compounds, lithium hydride, which is a colorless crystalline solid, and hydrogen gas, neither of them a compound likely to reproduce or even to fall in love.""",null,0,cdlf1g2,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
Bparrett77,"Those planets and moons don't likely support life ""as we know it"". We know that all life on Earth has a few things in common such as it's all carbon based and requires water. There are other theories about silicon based life since silicon is so similar to carbon but those haven't been proven. So when astronomers look for planets that can support life it makes sense to look for planets that have features which could theoretically support Earth-like life. It doesn't have to be just like Earth though.

For example, Europa is covered in water ice but it's all cracked and the cracks change frequently. This indicates that the ice is a shell covering an ocean of liquid water underneath and Jupiter's gravity constantly flexes the shell, cracking it while the liquid water repairs it. It's possible that hydrothermal vents are supporting microbial life at the bottom of that ocean, just like at the bottom of Earth's oceans. So even though Europa isn't even close to being like Earth, it does (theoretically) have some Earth-like conditions.

Therefore, we can look at a pretty diverse set of planets and say ""those could possibly support Earth-like life"". But then we need to ask the next question. If Earth-like life exists on a planet, what evidence will it leave that we can examine from here? Well how about a substance like methane? Much of life on Earth produces methane gas. Even you. When you fart! So let's look at Titan. Titan has methane in the atmosphere. The methane itself doesn't ensure that life exists but we can watch for changes over time in total atmospheric methane (what is producing it?) and also look for areas where the methane is inexplicably thicker than surrounding areas (could that be a large bacterial colony or a huge herd of space cows?). So far we can only make observations like that within our own solar system though. Exoplanets (around other stars) are still too far and too dim compared to their host star to observe in any detail.

Anyway, there could totally be crazy forms of life that we have no clue about. But we have literally 10 billion-trillion (aka 10 sextillion, aka 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) stars to look at. Why not start with what we already know?

Scientists know that for all life it need 3 things; water, a source of energy say from the sun and carbon which is the building block of all human life as we know it.

To work out if a planet has any of these necessities to life is if it fits some criteria meaning those 3 things, but also if the planet is in the habitable zone as astronomers call it, its basically just a point away from the planets parent star where the planet is far enough to have an atmosphere and if the planets temperature is right to host human life. 

Earth is in the habitable zone, a place just right to host life.

I suspect the same could be true of the Sri Lankan rain, but I would like to have samples to confirm this. I should also say that reports of red rain are found throughout history all the way back to biblical times.

The team's new research show that the cells reproduce at a temperature of 121 degrees C. ""Under these conditions daughter cells appear within the original mother cells and the number of cells in the samples increases with length of exposure to 121 degrees C,"" they report. By contrast, the cells are inert at room temperature. The spores of some extremophiles can survive these kinds of temperatures and then reproduce at lower temperatures but nothing discovered to date on Earth behaves like this at these temperatures -an extraordinary claim that will need to be independently verified before it will be more broadly accepted.

Wickramasinghe's team say they've examined the way these fluoresce when bombarded with light and say it is remarkably similar to various unexplained emission spectra seen in various parts of the galaxy.

sababababa,"Salt is sodium chloride. When saliva breaks down salt, it dissociates into Na+, which has a positive charge, and Cl-, which has a negative charge. The Na+ is the important one here! We'll get back to it in a minute.

Your taste buds operate using something called an action potential. These are found in neurons (brain cells) throughout your brain and spinal chord, but also in your taste receptors and other cells. I'll give you a brief rundown of how they work.

There's an electrical current running through these cells. The inside of the cells are kept at a constant -70mV. This charge can fluctuate up or down a little bit if positively or negative charged ions enter the cell. You might see where we're going with this. If the cell's polarity (another name for the charge, kinda), rises or falls a little bit, nothing really happens. But if the cell depolarizes enough (that is, if its charge is raised enough), it hits a point of no return. That point is -55mV. What happens next?

Well, once the point of no return is reached (a value also known as the threshold stimulus or simply, the threshold), we see what's called an a action potential. This is a sudden SPIKE in charge, making the cell reach upwards of +40mV! This causes a chain reaction where the charge travels to other cells close by. This electrical impulse travels through the body and eventually reaches the brain, where it gets interpreted as ""hey, I'm touching/smelling/tasting something!"" Cells return to their normal -70mV baseline after they fire an action potential, and after a brief refractory period they're ready to go again.

Food electrically stimulates taste cells, raising them to that critical level so they go nuts and blast your brain with messages. Remember how I talked about salt dissociating into Na+ and Cl-? Well, the Na+, being positively charged and all, effectively raises the baseline voltage on the receptors in your tongue! Instead of -70mV, they might be hovering closer to, say, -65 or -60mV. That means that they require less stimulation to reach that critical -55mV and fire signals to your brain!  Foods taste richer and more flavorful because your taste buds are primed and ready to fire at the drop of a hat.

Salt does indeed have it's own flavor, but to say it ""brings out the flavor of food"" is also accurate in my opinion, cause that's exactly what it's doing! As someone else mentioned, try putting a pinch of salt into sweet foods. Salted caramel ice cream? game over dawg

edit: you might be wondering why the Cl-'s negative charge doesn't just negate the Na+'s positive charge. The  answer is that the resting potential (that -70mV we were talking about) is regulated by the concentration of Na+ and K+, or potassium, inside and outside the cell. Cl- does come in to play, but a little later!

TrickyTiger,"There is a trick companies use to make their brand look exclusive and valuable. The idea is to show a product that looks really cool, and is unrealistic for your audience to own.

Television makers do this all the time, releasing screens FAR too big and expensive for most people to dream of owning. The effect is not that the consumer wants that particular television, but that the brand suddenly looks very competent and cutting edge.

A lot of concept cars are designed for the same reason. You start to think that brand really thinks outside the box, or are very elite. Suddenly their sedans seem kind of cool too.

EDIT: I just read through all the responses, and I really should have chosen my words better. 'Trick' is not really an accurate word, and I'm sure there are many other reasons for the cars than psychological.

Research and Development departments are paid to push the envelop. It is their job to come up with new technologies. They then present their concepts to management and, in some cases, the public to present the image that the company is on the cutting edge.
From there, a whole host of people get involved. Manufacturing engineers determine the cost of producing the parts and suggest more sensible solutions. Supply chain folks require changes so approved vendors can be used to make the parts. Businesses folks determine which features actually add enough value to justify their costs. Product engineers suggest practical alternatives that improve performance. Reliability engineers calculate the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of all the parts and systems. Service folks look at the training required to support repairs. And, possibly most influential, Program Managers force compromises to ensure the product is finished on time and hopefully within budget.

For much of the US population, this terminal was fed by a gasoline pipeline from greater Houston.  When the gasoline is pulled at the terminal from the pipeline, it is a commodity.  Exxon going in, Hess coming out.  The gas is put into tanks where additives are added to differentiate brands from each other.


Gasoline is delivered to the various gas stations, sometimes up to 3 times per day based on volume.   Despite getting their gasoline from the same place, different companies do NOT pay the same price.  There are spot prices for those with no contracts and contracted pricing for the more sophisticated gas retailers.


The price at the pump is determined by what the other stations are charging, NOT the cost of the gasoline.  Large gasoline retailers (typically independents) sell gas below cost for most of the year and make all their profits in 3 or 4 months.  Competitive surveys are done multiple times per day by the gas stations, usually with managers coming on or off shift driving a pre-determined route and recording all prices.  Then the pricing strategy is applied.  Some companies want to match the lowest price, some want to best the lowest by one cent, etc.  Gas price changes are not instantaneous, but can happen multiple times per day.

silk-e-smooth,"The Earth's atmosphere contains carbon, as most of us know. The thing is, not all carbon atoms are the same. Some have more mass than others (i.e. Carbon 14, or simply C-14), but the majority is C-12. Living organisms are constantly eating, breathing, and interacting with the environment. Because of this, our bodies contain a set proportion of C-12 and C-14 (and others) that varies only slightly. However, when an organism dies it no longer can get new carbon atoms; it can only lose them. C-14 has a known half-life (the time it takes for the total to reduce by half), and because of this, the older an organism is, the less C-14 it will have. By measuring how much C-14 is in a dead organism, we can estimate how long ago it was alive.

Hypothetical example with arbitrary numbers (extremely simplified):
Say all living humans of have around 1g of C-14 in them at all times. We know that the half life of C-14 is 1 year. Now, we find a dead human in Antarctica. We measure the C-14 in their body and find 0.5g of C-14. Since we know the (hypothetical) half life of C-14, we can estimate that this person has been dead for 1 year. That's how it works.

Now please note once again that the above example is extremely simplified and rather uses the proportion of C-12:C-14, as we wouldn't really be able to just add up the mass of C-14 in an organism, but I think it gives you a good idea of how it works.

null,"So, there are two versions of the carbon atom. Both versions have 6 protons and 6 electrons, but one version has 6 neutrons (Carbon-12), and one version has 8(Carbon-14). Carbon-14 is unstable, and will convert itself back into Carbon-12. Carbon-14 is created by energetic waves from the sun interacting with atoms in the atmosphere. When something is alive, it will naturally have the same ratio of Carbon-12/14 as its environment, because it's constantly recycling carbon. However, once it dies, no new carbon comes in. This means that the carbon-14 atoms won't be replaced with new atoms, and thus over time the ratio of 12/14 grows higher and higher as the carbon 14 decays. Since carbon-14 has a known half-life (the time it takes for half of a substance to decay), we can use the ratio to mathematically determine the age of an object.

EDFDarkAngel1,"I was a broadband tech support supervisor for 7 years.

First off, you have the ISP (internet service provider), and they provide the signal via the cable network (aka. plant). That signal has a series of flags on it, two of the more well-known flags are DHCP (alternates your IP address based on a random protocol, and is network-based), and lease. 

One thing to realize is that, gateways aside, the modem (cable bridge) and the router are two separate objects that do different things. The modem is what talks to the network, and receives the information. The router takes that signal, encrypts it via NAT, and evenly distributes it through your network, either wired or wirelessly depending on your router. If you have an issue with your internet, and you reset your router, chances are that you are NOT going to fix your problem. This is why:

Your modem has an IP address provided by the network, known as an external (or public) address. If you have a router, the router will request that IP like a computer would. The router than takes it, and hides it behind its own security (NAT). It will then provide all connected devices with another IP address, known as internal address. This is typically what you see when your address says 192.168.0.1, or something similar depending on where your device is in your network.

When your router turns on for the first time, it will request the IP address from the modem. Although typically automatic, you can request the router to check with the modem periodically to make sure the IP address hasn't changed, but sometimes it doesn't work.

If your modem's lease expires but isn't provided a new IP address, if there was a software update that wasn't properly applied to the modem, or if the modem is having a fault due to improper signal level/packet loss, then the router may not get the updated information. Your computer will request information from the router, who then requests it from the modem. If the router and modem have conflicting information, the request is denied and you will get errors like ""ISP unavailble"" or ""internet connection not detected"" or ""webpage unavailable"".

Now, if the problem is on the modem's end, resetting the router will not fix anything as it will still have the most updated information that the modem can provide. Resetting the modem may fix that, or you may need to call your ISP so they can adjust the information being sent. 

However, if the problem is on the router's end (ie. the router isn't requesting updated information), then resetting the router will force it to do its initial startup check, of which includes requesting new information. If the problem is not solved with that, and the modem is indeed fine, you may need to perform a factory reset on your router to clear any potentially bad firmware updates, or glitches.",null,5,cdle85o,1rad4n,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10

Also, not all of the bits are data - some of them are control information and not always in 8 bit blocks. The control information is usually something like ""here comes some data, get ready!"". There is no way to measure the bytes per second transferred. The bits per second measurement of digital bandwidth makes sense, because it allows you to compare it against other network media accurately. Throughput (or ""goodput"") is usually measured in bytes per second - that's the measurement of download and upload speed. Why isn't that measured in bits?

rickosborne,"It reflects where most of the work is done: at the bit level or at the byte level. 

Networking has several layers, the lowest of which is call the Physical Layer. It's concerned with how to get data across the cable, the air, the pigeon, whatever. Most, if not all, of the physical layer techniques to move data work on individual bits to convert them into electrical impulses of one kind or another. As you go up the network layers those bits get combined into bytes, frames, packets, etc, but at the layer that is most often measured (physical) it's all bits. 

Storage is a little different. There's no one standard that defines how to store bits on a disc, on a memory chip, on paper tape, etc. In networking terms, each storage vendor worries about their own physical layer. The standardized parts are the layers above that, where all of the data is accessed as bytes. Well, technically most/all drives return data in blocks, but block sizes aren't the same sizes across all drives, so the common measurable size is the byte. 

You could be pedantic and say that you can't ask a network interface for bits any more than you can a hard drive, and I used to be one of the tools making that point. But once you really learn about the bit-level encoding strategies that happen at the physical layer you shut up pretty quick - it's all bits, and it's all standardized at the bit level.

MrTuesdayNight,"I don't know what your masturbation habits have been.  But speaking as someone who went from masturbating about 25 times a week, down to about once a week - I think I understand now why those cultures and religions consider it a bad thing.

I grew up religious but only recently tried NoFap (/r/NoFap).  I didn't realize it, but masturbating every day was having an effect on me.  A negative one.  In particular, it had made me weak, slow, and painfully shy.  So I figure - if even a reasonable percentage of other people are wired like me - then what religion would want that for their people, particularly their youth?  

A lot of people find my kind of story here, and /r/NoFap in general, outrageous.  Like some kind of placebo cult.  So did I.  All I can say is - read /r/NoFap, or try it for a few days yourself.  Then make your own conclusions. 

For myself - now I know that abstaining from masturbation (indeed, all orgasms) for even a few days gives me a level of mental zeal at all times that I previously only knew very occasionally.  This zeal is, for lack of a better word, very compatible with religion and many aspects of what one might call an old-fashioned life.  It is incompatible with many aspects of our modern world.  I find it hard to explain.  

Of course, I can only speak for myself.  Obviously I can't speak for all the religious people throughout history.  All I'm saying is - it makes sense to me now.  Even those brutal Victorian punishments for masturbation, and the once-common belief that it can ruin a person's life - it all makes sense to me now.

No, but seriously, I grew up in a very religious family. I hated it every step of the way, it was forced on me, and when I finally told my parents how I felt about it all they damn near disowned me and still look at me as less of a person. 

My personal bias aside, maybe you shouldn't crank it all day every day. But maybe it's not bad to crank it every once in a while. Me, personally, I won't masturbate for a week, maybe two. I just don't want to. I get busy and it never crosses my mind, or I'm tired, or whatever. 

But every once in a while, maybe once or twice a month, on one of my off days I'll crank it throughout the day, maybe 10, 20 times in a day. Just to get it out of my system, ""clean out the pipes"" as it were. Sometimes I even break out the gigantic dildo and get freaky deaky in the shower for an hour or two. 

Is it bad? Well, sometimes I get chafed and I'm usually pretty exhausted afterwards. But I don't do it every day, or even most days. I just set aside a day or two out of the month to have an all-day fapathon. 

I really think the biggest reason the church isn't very fond of masturbation is because it's so much easier, and usually more gratifying, than sex. Or it becomes that way when you haven't had sex in a long time or haven't been in a relationship. Whoever circumsized me when I was a kid (Oh, hey, thanks for that one too religion - paragons of good and humanity, but only if you let us snip your dick when you're an infant) didn't do such a great job. Everything looks fine, and it's the right size and everything. But I have shit for sensitivity. Every time I have sex, even after not jackin' it for almost two weeks, it either takes me so long to get off that the girl gets exhausted, sore, or bored, or I can't get off at all. Even when I do crank it, it takes me almost 20 minutes to even get close. 

It's all just about controlling people. If you think it's bad to masturbate, then you'll seek out sex to sate that urge. Just go around knocking people up, since your sperm is so important you can't even spill it on the ground.

The following have been my observations.  Results may vary.

Check /r/nofap for evidence or better explanations, there's a reason why that group is so large.

Self control is a factor, gaining control of your wants and desires furthers the self from instinctual urges and allows the mind to impress moderation or suppress addiction.  You'll hear of people say they have ""needs"" that need to be fulfilled. No they don't, they just lost control or don't want mental control.  Again, you can check /r/nofap , people get a sense of clarity and productivity when they train themselves to control their bodies.

Second is psychological, masturbation/porn teaches the brain to associate people with sex and in a sense de-humanizes them as something to ""get-off to"" also known as objectification.  Soon it becomes easier to see beautiful people and ignore them as humans in favor of lusting after their bodies.  This is why some call it evil.

Last is that it does not satisfy which equals bad.  Sure one feels ""satisfied"" after masturbating, but will soon find themselves with urges the minute they find a stimulus again.

Matthew 5:28 but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 

This means that to even look at a woman lustfully is sin. i.e. checking her out. Because this leads to craving more and more until one is having sex outside of marriage, which is wrong. Obviously masturbation and sexual desires are linked.

Ephesians 5:3 But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people

This is also to protect us from where sexual sin leads. Just go by r/NoFap and read some of the stories of marriges destroyed by one's desire to masturbate and look at pornography. Not to mention that sexual desire leads to actually having sex with other which, needless to say, often leads to STDs. 

Plus I think the first couple times anyone has masturbated they felt a measure of guilt, this is the conscience telling you that what you have done is wrong

Romans 2:15 in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them

God's word is written on our hearts, in other words, our conscience tells us right and wrong. After a while of repeated sin however, the conscience becomes seared and is no longer sensitive to certain types of sin.

1 Thessalonians 4:3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality.

In conclusion, does masturbation feel good? Yes, but only for a moment. It does not satisfy, you will continually want more and more. To have real joy and eternal happiness is to have a good relationship with God. Masturbation is clearly defined as sin throughout the Bible and should be avoided at all costs. And as a Christian, nothing brings more joy than fulfilling God's will.

Unfortunately, the transition back to a normal society hurts people who vested and bet their lives on the distorted structure.  If you spent decades of your live improving your housing related skills, then when things go back to normal, it has the potential to totally fuck up your life.   It also has the potential to fuck up the financial institutions who bet the farm that things would go a certain way, when then didn't.   

However, once you distort things, there is not really a nice way to back out of it.  You can't print up more money and credit to solve a problem that was created by printed up money and credit to begin with.   All it will do is reward behavior that society doesn't need, and never allow the distortion to return back to normal.   

Today, the banks lent recklessly into sub prime, and recklessly over extended themselves.   Covering it up provides no social function, other than delaying the pain, and creating more distortions.   

In sum, yes, a lot of people will get hurt as unproductive credit goes into default and people without lots of backup are forced into bankruptcy.  The reset will likely hurt like hell for 18 months.  But after that, markets will find a bottom, people will have a fresh start, prudent and wise savers will have tons of opportunities, communication signals will be undistributed, and society will be able to have a prolonged boom that they simply can not have otherwise.

Zoralliah_Author,"At the very end of that gif you can see the umbilical cord still attached to the mother. Dolphins are placental mammals, meaning they develop a placenta that connects the blood supply of the mother to her developing offspring. It allows the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and wastes between the two via the umbilical cord. 

All placental mammals need to breathe air - even though dolphins look like fish, they have lungs instead of gills. Since they live underwater, dolphins and other marine mammals have the difficulty of getting their newborns to the surface of the water to breathe air as quickly as possible immediately after giving birth. The reason the calf was born ""fluke first"" is to maximize the amount of time the calf stays connected to that umbilical cord, receiving oxygen from its mother's blood. As soon as the calf is completely out, it makes the most sense to sever the umbilical cord immediately to give both the mother and calf the most freedom of movement so the mother can hold her newborn at the surface of the water. She can do this by making a tight turn in the water - the sudden change in direction provides enough force that the umbilical cord snaps.

In short, the umbilical cord *was* attached for all of the gestation and most of the delivery, but the mother snapped the cord as soon as the calf was free so that she could help her calf reach the surface.

LIPCSB,"Vibrations travel differently through different media--generally, the more dense the material, the faster vibrations travel through it.  Furthermore, some vibrations can only travel through solids.  

So, by measuring the shaking of the earth produced by an earthquake, we can tell there's a great big ball of liquid in the middle.  

Now, how do we know what it's made of?  By looking at meteorites.  The prevailing model of planet formation is that a lot of space rocks piled up into a planet, so the Earth's average composition should match the average composition of an asteroid.  We know from the study of meteorites that that's silicate, iron, nickel, and other elements.  

In this model, the Earth was at some point molten (all the heat released by those impacts melted the rocks).  The heaviest elements (iron, nickel) would sink to the bottom, so that's what the liquid is made of.  However, we can also calculate the pressure at the center of the Earth because we know how gravity works and the mass of the Earth, and we know that, at a high enough pressure, iron and nickel become solid even at very high temperatures.  This pressure exists at the center of the Earth, so we know that the center has to be solid nickel-iron.   

So, by earthquake measurement, we know that the core of the Earth is liquid, but by physics, we know that, within that liquid, there's another ball of solid iron.  By study of meteorites, we know what the average composition of the Earth is.  By study of the earth's crust, we know that the lighter elements (silicon and oxygen) are much more prevalent at Earth's surface than they are in meteorites, so the heavy parts of the meteorites must have sunken to the bottom.  ",null,1,cdl9dd4,1rajct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
Lobin,"No, we've never seen it, but there's plenty of evidence lying around for scientists to interpret.

First, the structure. We know that Earth has a solid crust, which is the part we walk around on. We know it's solid because, well, we walk around on it!

The crust is underlain by a mantle geologists describe as ""plastic,"" by which they mean that it isn't quite solid and isn't quite liquid; it's sort of squishy and deformable like Play-Doh. We know the mantle isn't quite solid for a couple of reasons: first, convection cells within it are what move tectonic plates around--imagine some stiff lasagna noodles banging around at the surface of a pot of boiling water, and you'll get the idea; and second, certain places in the mantle generate magma. When magma cools, it crystallizes into minerals, and the minerals grow together into rock. Geologists can analyze the chemical constituents of those minerals and determine that their parent magma came from the mantle, because mantle rock is chemically very different from, say, granite and limestone.

Underlying the mantle is the liquid outer core. How do we know it's liquid? Very clever geophysicists who study the behavior of seismic waves from earthquakes and atomic bomb tests noticed something. Seismic waves come in a few flavors. They call one flavor S-waves, or shear waves. If you've ever been in an earthquake and felt yourself moving from side to side, then you've felt S-waves. Geophysicists looked at the way seismic waves travel around the globe, and noticed that S-waves stop at a certain point. S-waves can't travel through liquid, so their disappearance alerted the geophysicists to the presence of a large liquid body within the Earth.

At the very center is the solid inner core. We believe that the inner core has the same chemical composition as the liquid outer core, but because it's under so much pressure from all the stuff on top of it, it remains solid.

As to how we know the chemical composition of things: we learn what the crust and mantle are made of by chemically analyzing rocks. You first have to know that rocks are made of minerals, and minerals are made of elements (chemicals). Chemicals can only combine in certain ways and under specific conditions. Minerals, therefore, can only form under specific conditions. A mineral called [olivine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine), for example, is very common in rocks which originated in the mantle, because the pressure and temperature conditions there permit the elements iron, magnesium, silicon, and oxygen to combine into olivine.

We infer a lot about the core from studying meteorites. The early solar system was a mass of small particles. Most of them banged into each other and clumped together until they coalesced into the planets, but some of those particles are still out there, and they land on Earth. Those are meteorites, and they're like snapshots of the early solar system. They can tell us lots about the chemical composition of the early Earth. At some point in Earth's development, it underwent a process called magmatic differentiation: most of the planet was molten, and the elements making up that magma began to separate, with the densest elements sinking toward the center. We believe that the inner core is an iron-nickel alloy--iron and nickel are both quite dense--with trace amounts of other heavy elements like gold and platinum.",null,0,cdl9swp,1rajct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

So as you can see to get the angle you take the inverse tangent of the imaginary part over the real part. This has many useful applications. For instance in electrical engineering they are used to keep track of phases and used in circuit analysis.

The quaternion extends this idea. It is an complex number with three parts. This allows you to keep track of three rotations. So now you can imagine how this is used in the real world. You can keep track of three rotations and we live in a 3 dimensional world.

Familiar with frames of reference? Quaternions can rotate you between these frames of reference and are not subject to [gimbal lock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock) as can happen with using Euler angles to track rotations.

If she did it in a Brothel, she would have STD testing requirements and her income would have been properly reported, which are things that are required in ""legal"" porn as well, and the income from making a porno would also be reported to the proper authorities for proper taxation.  The STD testing requirements would also include the fact that if she suddenly came back with one, the Brothel would do its best to contact all the partners that she was with between her last ""clean"" check and the one she had then to advise them to get tested.  Besides the fact the Brothel would likely require safe sex practices be used to avoid that happening in the first place.  She also wouldn't be allowed to continue having sex with clients till the STD was eradicated (if possible) and if not possible to eradicate, she wouldn't be doing that anymore.

Those things are supposed to happen with companies that produce porn as well, although not all of them obviously follow the practice, which would make them ""illegal"" also.

Enron owned pipelines throughout the country, and would take contracts for multi year delivery (from the Oil+Gas companies, selling to the end user: factories and powerplants mostly).

So after signing contracts with future revenues (no money was traded when the contracts were signed) they took thoes 'future' billings and put them on current year balance sheets.  Basically, they were capitalizing (turning into money) future pipeline streams.  They'd book the volumes that were projected years from now, and put them on their current balance sheets.

Also, they started divesting into non-core (non oil and gas industry) functions, leading to the Oil and Gas group (steady revenue) being used to 'cost' non-oil and gas projects/companies.

bananalamarama,"Basically it was an entire system created on fraud for committing illegal things and more fraud. 




In the early 90s they started something that can be called ""creative accounting"": 
(this is just a rough overview and not everything is strictly correct to someone who knows about business but its the most obvious way I can put it)


Simply put, when they sold something into the future they already put it in their balance in whole, when they bought something they didn't account for it until they really had to.  
Then they thought it would be a nice idea to make such deals with companies they founded themselves in other countries and didn't consolidate the balance sheets (when you own two companies and sell something from one to the other, you actually didn't earn something but they pretended they did).  
That really wasn't enough in their minds so they let these foreign companies take big loans from banks to finance this non existing business. Of course Enron also had a stake in these companies and when needed paid themselves large dividends out of the borrowed money.  
Because that really wasn't enough (Enron just ballooned into one of the biggest companies with the greatest revenues and was considered to be the smartest an best company in the world) they also didn't account for the things they owned properly. They valued everything at market value but a lot of things didn't have a market to sell them into so there was no observable market value. If there is no market value one has to have a system how to value those things and how to justify their valuation and as you can imagine, all the stuff they owned was like pure gold. 
But of course they also had the energy business left. That business needs big investments in risky programs and therefore they often found new companies for that special purpose (so called special purpose entities). That isn't unusual, but whats special is that they had hundreds of them and tried to put all the liabilities they had into those companies and either designed contracts beforehand or changed ownership later in a way that allowed them to take all those businesses out of their own balance sheets effectively reducing their liabilities considerably and driving revenue up.  
While doing all those things they also had some time to get creative in other fields like inventing new types of options (for example with the weather as underlying) or incentivizing their employees in a way that drove a competition to make the biggest fake deals and the smartest ways to get around laws.




Why didn't this system collapse quickly?  
At first it worked out nicely. Revenues went up massively, stock prices rose accordingly, big banks got big deals, everyone was happy. Other companies even thought they did something wrong and were told to take Enron as an example. Later people started to wonder how it all worked but by then a lot of top level Enron employees changed into politics and consulting (and politicians became consultant and/or were being supported by Enron, like George Bush sr received 2,5 million for elections, almost 200 congressmen were supported too), banks were being threatened to lose their deals with Enron if they didn't keep up the loans and other deals, ever new stock was given and large dividends payed (out of nothing) to keep people happy. The auditing companies were at the same time hired as consultants and payed lots and lots of money so they had an interest in keeping it up as well. 
But like everything, this had to end, too. People started to question the extremely high stock price in comparison to the revenues, banks started to be a bit more careful in deals with Enron and in the end they were also called out by an insider and their entire system collapsed quite quickly at that point.

For example, most B vitamins help with the metabolizing carbohydrates and alcohol.  Taking more than the daily requirements will, to a certain extent, help if you are consuming more carbohydrates and alcohol.

In other words, there could be reasons to take more than the daily recommended amount of vitamins, and most of these products are there for that.

dageekywon,"Because everyones body has different requirements.  By supplying more than the body needs, Body A which needs 110% today will get the 110% today it needs, while Body B which only needs 95% today will get it as well.

Since although we do have an idea about what vitamins the body needs on a daily basis and we can kinda guesstimate as to how much they need as well (which is where you get the ""suggested daily allowance"" figures) we can estimate that and set a rating.

But because bodies have different requirements, different needs daily, and some bodies also have difficulty in absorbing those nutrients, providing more of them hopefully assists in a few ways-it allows a greater chance of absorption as the pill or supplement travels through the body, it meets the varying needs daily also as well.

And the simple fact is although the benefits and amounts of some vitamins are known fairly well, its still honestly an ""educated guess"" and since it cannot be narrowed down, ""overdoing it"" in a lot of cases doesn't cause any harm.

If there is known harm from having too much of a nutrient, you'll see that they usually are not placed into a vitamin or supplement in those quantities.  They will be 100% or less if you can get them from normal food as well.

But unless something is known to be harmful in large quantities, its easier to provide way more for those reasons, especially if its something known that the body needs, but the quantity is unsure.  If it doesn't hurt the body to take more and the excess is simply discarded, there is no real harm in doing that.  And with your body having varying needs, providing 100% RDA daily will be fine some days, but not on others.

Having said that, unless there is some science in it, 1000% is really overkill.  200% would more than meet any variations the body may have for demand.  Especially since most people including myself may take a daily vitamin that supplies 100% of most of the ""important"" stuff, but we also eat foods and consume drinks with them in it also, so any ""excess"" we need would be easily supplied, obviously.",null,4,cdld8ej,1rapt0,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6

The bulge at the far side of the Moon is a bit further away from the common center of mass and therefore does feel a bit less attracted to it. Gravitational attraction diminishes with distance. The bulge rises because there are in fact two forces at work on the water: gravitation pulls it inward towards the center of gravity, but because the world rotates around the center of gravity things are also pushed slightly outward by the centrifugal force.

a credit card is basically a standing agreement that you can be loaned X amount at any one time, and you can use it anywhere, and if you pay it off you can use it again.  a loan is an agreement that you can borrow x amount of money once.  an APR stands for annual percentage rate and is the amount of interest you have to pay on a loan over the course of a year.

you use a credit card like you do a debit card, for any purchases you want to make.  if you pay off your purchases at the end of the month then the credit card company will waive the interest that would be due that month.  if you don't pay off your purchases, then you're responsible for paying the interest accrued over the month.

there are a couple types of loans, those would be secured and unsecured loans.  a mortgage or car note are examples of secured loans, you're using the money to purchase an item that can be repoed by the bank if you don't pay on your loan.  unsecured loans are usually called personal loans and are for smaller amounts.  lets say you need 5k for repairs on your home, you may be able to get the loan from your bank just because of your credit history.  there's no collateral, so if you default(don't pay), the bank is out that money.  both secured and unsecured loans also have an interest rate that you pay, so at the end of the loan you may have borrowed 10k, but with interest you're actually paying back 11k to the bank.

drewtam,"Democrats and Republicans agreed to try and contain communist expansion. The war was initiated and ramped up under Kennedy (D) and Johnson (D).

(some) Republicans were upset that the war was being fought in half measures rather than the total war of the previous conflicts (Korea &amp; WW2). Some thought the war had no clear objectives or purpose.
(some) Democrats didn't consider the war just. It was after all, a foreign adventure that America thrust itself into the midst.
Part of getting involved was that an America warship was attacked, this was later shown to be staged or overblown, leading some to feel betrayed by the causes for getting involved. Some felt that the burden of the fighting was too heavily laid on the middle class, poor and blacks.

This was also a time of changing party dynamics. There were many more ""liberal"" Republicans, and very ""conservative"" Democrats than the party polarization and alignment that we see today. So there was a lot of internal party disagreements and fracturing. This fed the chaos and turmoil of the politics.

Feeding this turmoil was a news media that was not nearly restrained in its war reporting as it was in WW2 or Korea, and made every effort to be as explicit as possible about what was going on.

Some Americans did not believe in confronting the Soviet and Chinese for various reasons. Not just political reasons, but religious and pragmatic as well.
Obviously the communist political fringe in America were a core group certainly against fighting the Soviet empire. Although it is downplayed today, there was a well documented communist/socialist ideology in the counter culture of the day. [History repeats itself as farce, so that now counter culture kids wear Che Guevara shirts.]

Many were afraid of the draft. But this often stated objection is only a surface argument... what I mean is that there is a deeper ""why"" men didn't want to serve in the draft. After all, there was no such draft objections in WW2 or Korean War...

Vietnam was plagued with foreign conquerors for centuries.  They were fighting for independence more so than communism.  South Vietnam was held together with a loose web of a corrupt government mostly comprised of officials endorsed by the US.  

The thinking was this would be another Korea but with modern firepower of epic proportion.  Not the case, few battles were fought with conventional armies.

This wasn't your daddy's war, we were fighting a mostly guerrilla force comprised of south Vietnamese sympathetic to the communists.  They were known as the NLF national liberation front.  Many villagers were drafted into the NLF, they were normal adolescent males.  Very difficult to distinguish from civilians which is where the controversy starts.  

Since the objective of the war was attrition and not securing ground, It was hard to tell who was winning.  Body count was the name of the game.  In a war being fought around civilians whom look no different than enemy it's hard to tell who you are killing.

News of a few village massacres became public and the whole ""baby killer"" mantra erupted. 

We started to sustain large numbers of casualties which is bad for politics.  Civilian casualties through the roof also.  News of all this eventually caused policy makers to adjust the rules of engagement.

Anyway, what you're describing is ""relativistic mass,"" which is a sort of tricky concept. Most physicists these days prefer to avoid it entirely, because it's just not a very coherent concept. If you read a modern physics textbook, they'll generally skirt away from the idea entirely.

The reason that most physicists don't like it is that it gives you somewhat nonsensical results. For example, let's imagine you have a box with perfect mirrors on all sides. If you shoot a bunch of photons (light) into the box, the mass of the box, as measured from the outside, increases.

Photons, however, don't have mass. It doesn't matter how you rig the numbers, they just don't. So, we have a bit of a conundrum, because the presence of photons increased the mass but photons do not have mass.

It's frankly a logical inconsistency that most physicists prefer to avoid. The preferred approach is to say that by adding photons to the box, we increased the ""rest energy"" of the system, which causes an increase in the mass.

LIPCSB,"The basic premise is that the Doctor is an alien (species: Time Lord) who travels around in a spaceship/time-machine called the ""TARDIS.""  The TARDIS is bigger on the inside and has a camouflage circuit that's been jammed to ""London Police Box, 1950s"" since the first episode.  He tends to be accompanied by ""companions,"" people who travel with the Doctor on his adventures.  

The show began in 1963 and, thus far, 12 men have played the Doctor.  This is explained in-universe by Time Lords growing a new body when they die.  The show went off the air in 1989.  There was an attempt to revive it in 1996 with an American-made television movie, but that didn't get the green-light for a full series.  It was successfully revived in 2005 with the Ninth Doctor, played by Christopher Eccleston.  

It was a cult show in Britain for many years, aimed mostly at younger audiences but having a strong following among science fiction fans, but the revival has brought it a more mainstream popularity.  

I'd recommend getting started with Eccleston's episodes--Series 1, which aired in 2005.  Watch the modern series, then go back to the older stuff.  There's no need to slog through every episode (which is impossible anyway, given that a good many were destroyed in the old days of non-ubiquitous recording), just pick up a story or two (stories are several episodes long, though) from each Doctor.  And give the TV movie a look--it's not perfect, but the 8th Doctor's acting is very good.  Eric Roberts as ""The Master""...your mileage may vary.

kcnovember,"The show started in 1963 and continued through to 1989 when it was canceled. This is dubbed ""Classic Who."" In 1996, there was an ill-fated TV movie that failed to revive the series. Then, it was finally remade in 2005, it proved a big hit, and that is the show we see today. The series from 2005 to present is dubbed ""New Who"" by some fans.

The synopsis: ""The Doctor"" is an alien called a ""time-lord"" who travels through space and time in a blue box that's ""bigger on the inside."" Along the way, he makes friends (usually female and human, but not always,) solves complex problems, saves planets and galaxies from destruction, but he never gets the girl in the end. This time-lord has many enemies, but he has many friends to help him. Finally, he doesn't die. As a time-lord, he regenerates into another physical form. He looks different and has a different personality, but he retains the memories of his past regenerations.

The show is about how creativity, resourcefulness, friendship, intellect, passion, and a strong belief in oneself can overcome practically any obstacle. The Doctor almost never uses a weapon against an enemy. If he does, it's usually used indirectly, such as using a gun to shoot a machine to stop a plot instead of shooting the evil mastermind behind the plot. His chief tool is a sonic screwdriver which can open locks and scan bio-organisms and computer systems.

The show is very British, and sometimes it helps to have an interest in British culture and history, but it's not crucial. 

To start watching, try ""Blink"" from Series Three (2007) of the rebooted series. It's widely considered the best episode ever made in the show's entire history. It requires no prior knowledge of the show. If you don't like that episode, chances are the show is not for you.

If you like ""Blink,"" then you can binge-watch starting with Series One, with Christopher Eccleston as The Doctor, then to Series Two thru Four with David Tennant in the role, and finally with Matt Smith in the role from Series Five to Seven. Along the way, check out episodes of the Classic show as it suits you. Many fans have different opinions about every Doctor, so look around the Internet for ""Best Of"" lists to see what would be a good episode to watch in Classic Who.

In order to watch the 50th Anniversary Special, ""Day of the Doctor,"" you'd have to watch Matt Smith's run to understand it. If you only watch Matt Smith's run, you won't understand some of the references made about David Tennant's Doctor in that episode.

Risar,"This is a very short version. 

  The Doctor (the primary character) is a timelord, an ancient species of alien which live for thousands of years through a biotech process called regeneration. This allows The Doctor to survive otherwise fatal events, but the process causes physical changes.

  The series is oriented around The Doctors adventures in time and space usually using his stolen time ship which is a TARDIS (time and relative dimension in space). You see the Doctor is a bit of a misfit. In addition to his rebel streak it's important to note that Timelords choose their title, so The Doctor views himself as a healer of sorts.

  Accordingly the show is a bit quirky / odd, and has a magic ""go anywhere, do anything"" mechanic in the TARDIS. So The Doctor may be in Ancient Rome or future London, some alien ship or planet. He often picks up interesting partners in crime to travel with him as he goes. So the entire show has a rotating cast essentially, with overarching themes and arcs spanning multiple seasons.

vadieblue,"Please don't listen to people whom are telling you to start with Blink or to skip the 9th doctor.  BLINK is the WORST episode to start with if you want to get into the entire series.  (The doctor isn't in it that much and it is nothing like a typical episode- that is one of the reasons it is so loved.) It's like skipping right to the orgasm with no foreplay.  Skipping the 9th doctor is like starting the Star Wars franchise with Empire.

laioren,"It's hard to describe the Doctor simply. The main character has committed genocide on not one but (at least) two races, including his own. His closest friends frequently die or meet even worse fates. Despite these two facts, everyday he wakes up and tries to make the universe a better place. The Doctor is a character so complex in his history, created from so many poignant but small moments buried in the genre fiction of his show, that simple descriptions of him can't help but make him sound unbelievable. But he is brilliant. That god and the devil could be the same person? Absolutely brilliant. That's why the writing of the show is fucking fantastic. That they can believably pull off that character.

I still get chills every time I see his speech when he confronted the Atraxi.

But, I'll try to do him justice here.

Basic Premise:

The Doctor is an alien that has a time-traveling phone booth. He frequently takes ""companions"" with him on his travels. Companions are just people he meets up with and travels with. They're like his friends.

He is a devout pacifist (though he has his bad days), and generally thinks of very clever ways to get out of problems. He spends his time saving the universe. Literally.

Here are the Doctor's ""powers:""

1) He has a ""sonic screwdriver."" It is the ultimate MacGuffin. It works when the story needs it to, and doesn't when the story needs it to not work.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin

2) When he speaks, others listen. He is frequently cornered by enemies with superior weapons, but then he starts talking at them. By the time he's done talking, he's outsmarted them.

3) He's wicked smart. He thinks of ""technobabble"" solutions to problems sometimes, but the best stories are when he thinks of creative solutions that you could have thought up.

4) He's a master of Venusian aikido (space martial arts). No shit. You'll probably never see this though. It was really only used by the Third Doctor.

http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor

5) He can ""regenerate."" Thought up as a way to continue the show when William Hartnell (the First Doctor) wanted to retire, it has now become a staple of the show. When Time Lords (the ""race"" of the Doctor) are killed, they can undergo a complete cellular regenerate that brings them back to life. However, they end up looking different (i.e. being played by another actor). This change is more than just skin deep though. They can change skin colors or even genders. Also, their memories become a bit muddled, and other significant changes can occur, such as no longer liking a favorite kind of food.

In the fandom, whenever the Doctor undergoes a regeneration, it's a HUGE DEAL!

Currently, the Doctor is in his 11th incarnation (sort of). That's why Matt Smith (the actor currently playing the Doctor) is generally referred to as the Eleventh Doctor.

About the Show:

The British refer to what American's call a ""season"" as a ""series,"" so that can get pretty confusing. I'll use the American version for this write up, so when I say a ""season,"" I'm taking about a single string of episodes aired typically during a single calendar year.

There are basically three different ""eras"" that make up Doctor Who. Most people in America refer to these as the different ""series"" of the show.

""Original Series"" - Aired from 1963 to 1989 and had a ""movie"" that aired in 1996. The original series was mainly characterized by by ""serials."" Two to five episodes that made up a single ""story arch.""

""2005 Series"" - Aired from 2005 to 2010. This is when the show relaunched after being canceled 15 years earlier. The budget for the show was still very small (comparatively), and is often considered cheesy or unwatchable by younger audiences.

""Steven Moffat Series"" - Started in 2010 and running up to today. Named after the current ""show runner"" or ""head writer"" for the show. Marked by a noticeable increase in budget. All episodes are now broadcast in high definition. Still using the same actor, Matt Smith, as the Doctor.

Where to Start:

You're going to get lots of different answers for this. I'm just going to give you the ""easiest"" place to start for what is probably ""the average viewer.""

Start with the episode, ""The Eleventh Hour."" It's generally considered ""Season 5"" (or ""Series 5"" if you're British) of the 2005 series (though fans often make a distinction and think of it as the first episode of the Steven Moffat Series). Calling it the 2005 series distinguishes it from the original 1963 to 1989 run (and the movie made in 1996).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_5_.282010.29

Each season of the 2005 Doctor Who is comprised of ""episodic"" episodes as well as ""serial"" episodes. Episodic episodes are stand-alone pieces. Like one-off shows that don't much connect to any of the other shows. Serial episodes are ones that have interconnected stories (though they may not have occurred ""in order""). Usually, the first and last episodes of each season are connected, and sometimes one or two other episodes in the middle of the season. These form the ""seasonal story arch.""

If you enjoy the first few episodes of Season 5 and want to watch the older stuff, jump back to ""Season 1"" with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor. Again, this is Season 1 of the 2005 Series.

If you have a hard time watching that, but just want to see ""the best episodes"" so you can keep up with Doctor Who talk, then I'd recommend these:

""The Empty Child""
""The Doctor Dances""
""Human Nature""
""The Family of Blood""
""Blink""
""Silence in the Library""
""Forest of the Dead""

Those are pretty much the best ones from 2005 to 2010.

Everything from 2010 on should be pretty ""easy to enjoy"" for modern audiences.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that love Doctor Who so much that they want everyone to love it. I certainly love it. However, it's not really ""for everyone."" Lots of people don't like the more childish or cheesy parts of the show, and that's fine. If you don't like it, don't try to force yourself to like it.

However, if you can get into it, it is certainly one of the best shows ever made.

brandoncordell,"/u/LIPCSB explained the show very well, so I will give you my opinion on where to start.

There are three episodes, one from each of the three Doctors that have appeared since the reincarnation of the show, that I use when showing someone the show for the first time.

Season 1, Episode 9 ""The Empty Child"" (This is a 2-part arch. Episode 10 is named ""The Doctor Dances"")     
Season 3, Episode 10 ""Blink""    
Season 5, Episode 10 ""Vincent and the Doctor""

They won't get you too much into the history of the show, but they'll give you a good idea of what the show is about and give you a preview of how each of the modern Doctor's acts.

hifigi,"The Fourth Doctor is really where Classic Doctor Who hit its stride, so if you want to really *understand* the culture of the show it's a great place to start. The classic format had shorter weekly episodes (about 25 minutes each) but longer story arcs (usually four episodes per arc), so each classic serial lasts roughly 100 minutes, or the length of an average movie. However, since this is a serial format, each episode has a basic three act structure and most episodes end with a cliffhanger. The action and plot are therefore more fast-paced and often a bit more goofy than modern Who. Prepare to suspend your disbelief!

I now present a breakdown of the best serials (opinion alert!) for each season of the Fourth Doctor:

S12 - ""Genesis of the Daleks"" On planet Skaro, two human-like races are caught in the middle of a planetary war. A scientist for the Kaled race has developed a terrible technology that will transform his people into mindless exterminating Daleks, and the Doctor has been ordered to eliminate them before they ever exist.

S13 - ""Pyramids of Mars"" In a Victorian Gothic mansion, strange things are afoot. The master of the house, away in Egypt, has been replaced by a sinister Egyptian. Cloth-wrapped Mummies roam the grounds, killing people. Beneath a pyramid, the last of the Osirians — Sutekh the Destroyer — waits to be freed, to at long last bring his gift of death to all who live.

S14 - ""The Face of Evil"" The Doctor arrives on a planet where two tribes, the savage Sevateem and the technically brilliant Tesh, are at war. He meets Leela, an exile from the Sevateem, and discovers that their god of evil is apparently himself.

S15 - ""The Invasion of Time"" The Doctor, showing signs of erratic behavior, travels to his home planet of Gallifrey and proclaims himself President due to a legal technicality. His strange behavior continues as he tries to access the Matrix, the heart of all Time Lord knowledge. Meanwhile Gallifrey comes under attack from not one but two enemy forces.

S16 - ""The Key to Time"" If you've made it this far, you should watch the entire 16th season. It's one massive story told through an episodic Hero's Quest structure.

S17 - ""Destiny of the Daleks"" The Doctor and a newly-regenerated Romana arrive on Skaro to find that the Daleks are using explosive charges and a group of humanoid slave workers to mine the planet in search of their creator, Davros.

S18 - ""Logopolis"" The Doctor goes to Logopolis to repair the TARDIS's chameleon circuit, not knowing that a shadowy watcher is spying on him. His old enemy the Master has plans of his own for the planet of mathematicians, Logopolis, and a plan that could spell doom for the entire universe.

Note: Episode synopses for ""Pyramids of Mars"", ""Face of Evil"", ""Destiny of the Daleks"", &amp; ""Logopolis"" are taken verbatim from tardis.wikia.com, all other descriptions are my own.",null,1,cdlmnpt,1rbmab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8

I would recommend that you watch ""blink""  it is not the first episode (maybe in the third season?) but you don't need much background before you watch it (that video before this should do) and it doesn't give much away.  If you like that I would recommend that you start with Eccleston (First season from reboot) and move on from there.  I consider myself a huge fan and I have not seen all the classic who episodes. 

*warning:*  The first season is super cheesy; especially if you don't watch any sci-fi shows.  The first couple of episodes are rough, try and solider through them.

Warskull,"The main character is ""The Doctor"" a super-genius alien who can solve pretty much any problem.

He has access to a time machine which can essentially teleport anywhere in time and space and uses this time machine to go on grand adventures.

He takes along a companion which a vast majority of the time is a young attractive female.  Most of the time the premise is him showing off cool things to the companion.

It is really more fantasy than hard science fiction.  Pretty much every rule can be broken and stuff is only loosely explained at times.  It is ultimately an excuse to go on adventures, have crazy villains, and fantastic stuff happening.

I would just start at the beginning of the 2005 series.  Quality will go up and down between episodes because they feature a variety of writers and each episode can be a one off premise.

LostNoob,"I've literally been watching doctor who all my life (well since I was like 5 or something, a good few years before the revived show at least) and I honestly can't think of a way to explain the show without it sounding dumb and goofy, well it is dumb and goofy, that's part of it's charm.

It seems I got to this thread a bit too late to bother going into too much detail as many have already described the show already.

But one thing that doesn't seem to well explained in the thread is what does he do and why?
Well, in the early series, all that was know about him was that he's on the run from his own people, and we later learn, it's because he stole a Tardis.

He stole the Tardis too see the universe, but the tardis was faulty and he would often end up somewhere he didn't intend to, the early series revolved around him getting his two companions back home (whom he practically kidnapped to stop them from talking about what they had seen)

The basic plot of the classic episodes was the tardis would land, the doctor and his companions would go looking around and get separated from the Tardis and they would have to get back to the Tardis, in fact most the time, he wouldn't even consider saving the day unless it meant them getting out of their.

By the end of the first Doctors run, he had become a bit more like what we have today, he would save the day, even if he was able to get back in the Tardis.
One thing I should note is that continuity in the early series isn't exactly solid.
For example one episode the doctor is over 700 the next he's only 500 or so, it's more down to the production team really.
(the modern series keeps up with continuity a lot better)

As for where to start, the beginning, Unearthly Child, it sets up the show quite well, though the three episodes after it are a bit dull, the story after that makes up for it (the introduction of the Daleks) the first 3 storeys are available on dvd with the beginning box set (btw in the classic series each story has around 4 episodes sometimes 6)
Keep in mind that it was made 50 years ago, and the budget was terrible, even in 1963 and enjoy
Anyway, a lot of the early episodes have gone missing (BBC wiping the tapes to save money) but from 1970 onwards, you'll be able to watch every episode, or just pick a few from each doctor that appeal to you, the continuity in the old series isn't that great anyway, so you can jump into just about any episode and understand what's happening.

(Did I say I was't going to go into too much detail? uhhh sorry, that happens)

Polaritical,"Don't let the super devoted fans fool you: Doctor Who is just a silly little show about a time traveling alien.

I think people get scared off because the super devoted fans give an impression that show is much more serious and detail oriented than it really is. This is not Lost. You don't have to go back over episodes and poor over details. In fact, you can pretty much watch any episode and catch on pretty quickly. Some of the companion related side plot plot might be lost, but the show is mainly episodic and focuses on one particular problem and plot each episode.

Doctor Who is a beloved british tv show that follows the antics of a time lord (a type of alien species that looks similar to humans) traveling through space and time with various companions.

Think of it kind of like a sci-fi version of Scooby Doo. Every week there's some new mystery or problem and it's up to the doctor and his loyal companion at the time to solve it. He sort of acts as an intergalactic police officer running around and keeping everything from hitting the fan. But instead of the mystery mobile, the Doctor has the TARDIS.

The TARDIS is basically a super high tech spaceship that also acts as a time machine. It helps with the adventures by doing nifty things like allowing the Doctor and his companion to understand whatever alien language is being spoken where they are (which addresses the issue that so bothered fans of District 9 who didn't understand how the heck people and aliens were communicating with each other in completely different languages). It also has a camouflage function which got stuck on an old phone booth. Nifty disguise back when the show first aired that was kept because it was part of tradition, but now is pretty funny when you see an old phone booth just appear in a modern London street.

The show started and did pretty well and then ran into the same problem that a lot of shows run into: an actor didn't want to do the show anymore. Think about Three's Company when Chrissy left or the Office when they had to right Michael off. Except this was THE main guy. They couldn't just write in a new character and take off with that plot line. He was the LAST timelord. There was no one they could write about without changing the entire premise of the show (look how well that turned out when Scrubs tried it)

They wanted to continue the show, so they had to think of a way to keep the character of the Doctor going but have a new actor. They could do like That 70s show did with Laurie or Bewitched did with Darren and simply get a new actor and not address it. But they had something those shows didn't: the doctor was an alien! So they just wrote into the show that sometimes a doctor regenerates. Which basically involves them taking a new human form.

And that's how the show has had a string of actors that have been able to play the same part throughout the show. 

Doctor Who can pretty much be split into two sections: the original run and the modern revival.

The original run was more of a Saturday morning type kids show that was aimed at the kind of kids who thought sci-fi was awesome. The modern series tried to expand the appeal to a wider audience (and did so quite successfully) with an expanded budget and better special effects.

If you're just getting into the show, start with the modern series. You can start with Eccleston which was the first series in the modern run. David Tennant is widely considered to be the most popular and loved Doctor, so if you start with Eccleston and aren't a huge fan I'd recommend switching to Tennant before you write off the whole show.

The show is hugely popular now and popular with a wider audience. This can be seen as both good and bad. You'll see that in the modern series, especially with Matt Smith, the show suddenly starts going to America a lot which is largely because the show now has a large American following. There's also some negative views of Doctor Who 'fan girls' who think that the doctor is 'like super dreamy and cute'. Some fans think that show show shifted somewhat to appeal to those type of fans by including a lot of opportunities to make the Doctor look like a hunk despite it not really being in vein with the original show.

If you're someone who's a bit skeptical about all this alien crap, I'd recommend watching the episode ""Blink"". It's completely different than all the other episodes and barely even features the Doctor. But it really highlights the clever writing of the show and can be a good way to ease people who aren't usually fans of science fiction into it. It's a lot less cheesy than some episodes (at first, the cheesiness seems bad. But once you've grown to love the Doctor, you eat that cheese right up).

OpportunityBox,"An alien race of beings becomes so advanced that the power of the entire universe is at their beck and call.  They can instantly travel anywhere in time and space, manipulate stars and black holes, etc.  

These aliens (called Time Lords) use time travel to change history too much to suit their own ends and screw up.  They mistakenly create super evil beings just as powerful as themselves.  They wage a war so devastating that it tears major holes in the history of the universe and are about to tear apart the entire universe and destroy everything in it just to save themselves.

One of these Time Lords, The Doctor, determines that he can save the universe but it will mean destroying his entire race.  He steals one of the most powerful ships ever created (The Tardis, a physical embodiment of the energy of the universe itself), and uses it to stop the war by imprisoning both the evil race and his entire race of Time Lords for all time.   

He then spends thousands of years trying to alleviate his guilt and boredom trying to fix the damage to the universe caused by the Time Lords by traveling through space and time. The Tardis brings him to places and times where he can do the most good and regenerates him into a new body each time he dies so he can continue his work.  

His effect is so profound that many races and planets (including Earth) call their heroes or healers ""Doctors"".

He has access to the best technology ever created in the entire history of the universe.  He travels with a human companion who helps to keep him honest and true.  Storylines frequently involve a danger where there appear to be only two choices.  For example, making one choice will destroy a planet, but making the other choice will only kill a small child.  While the choice of one small child dying seems better than an entire planet dying, his human companion attempts to force him to find a third choice where everyone lives.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

EngineeringStudent_,"The basic premise is the Doctor (a Time Lord from the planet of Gallifrey) has a machine that can travel anywhere in space and time. The machine is called the TARDIS* which looks like an old London Police Box. 

The Doctor ran away from his home planet and travels around the universe to explore. He picks up companions (the first of which he kidnapped, back in '63) and travels around with them until they decide (or are forced) to leave. In his travels, he just so happens to help out other races so he can save himself and his companions.** The show is a chronicle of his travels.

Because he is a Time Lord,*** he can regenerate. This means he gets a new body and a different personality. His memories are the same, but otherwise he's a completely different person. This is why there are multiple Doctors. The ""classic"" series contains the First through Seventh Doctors (1963 to 1989 iirc). There was an American TV movie in '96 which featured the Eighth Doctor. The 2005 reboot of the series, dubbed ""New Who"" began with the Nineth Doctor.

As for where to begin: I stared with the episode ""The Eleventh Hour"" which is the Eleventh Doctor's first episode. Another good starter, as others have mentioned is the first episode of the 2005 reboot with the Nineth Doctor. However, since every Doctor is different (different actor, different writers, etc), I would encourage giving at least two or three of them a try. The good thing about Dr. Who is that you can jump in pretty much anywhere as stories are generally stand-alone and don't rely on knowledge of stuff that happened before.

*Stands for T.ime A.nd R.elative D.imensions I.n S.pace. The TARDIS is bigger on the inside, and we generally see the console room. 

**The motivation behind helping other races depends on which Doctor you're dealing with. Their MO also changes. Some are very peaceful and avoid violence, some may have committed genocide.

CultureMan,"Well, let's see.

The Doctor is, as others have stated, an alien from a race that has learned how to manipulate time but, in the main, just watch the passing parade.  The Doctor thought they should be doing more, and stole one of the time-space ships to change things. 

When he is old or seriously injured (irradiated, shot, etc), he has ""this trick"" as he puts it, which allows his body to regenerate on a cellular level.  He retains his memories, but is in effect a completely new person, who goes swaggering off to new adventures.

His human companions often keep him grounded and are 'way in' characters for us.  In some ways they have healed him from his past actions.

Best starting points are, I actually think, 'Rose' and 'Dalek'  In  those eps, you find out why companions are important, and why Daleks are actually shit-scary and pretty iconic.

If you've watched old TV shows from the 60s on, you should at least sample some of the earlier Doctors, each have strong points.  If you haven't watched old shows, well, Who was always about the characters and the story, not the effects.

The one they are showing this weekend is pretty amazing, but you'll need some background first.  Also, webisodes.

TheTretheway,"I have been watching Doctor Who for six years and am quite a dedicated fan, thus a bit evangelical. Sorry for this being a long comment, but there's quite a bit to get across!

The Doctor is a lone alien. His culture (the Time Lords) spent their lives watching the universe from afar, and the Doctor decided to escape in a faulty time machine (a TARDIS), to see the universe. It's meant to change shape, but since 1963 has been stuck [in the shape of an old British police box] (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-38irUCKTBtg/UEp_jm46MjI/AAAAAAAAFEw/3l4YcO-0Mgk/s1600/new-tardis-look-s51.jpg) which has become synonymous with the show and an icon of British TV. He goes around, exploring different places, with his (usually female and attractive) companion. He's also (almost always) a strong pacifist (hence why he chose the name 'Doctor'), so episodes are resolved in interesting ways, as opposed to just blowing things up.

The Doctor has the ability of 'regenerating', which he has done eleven (for simplicity's sake - don't get me started on [that one](http://static.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/john-hurt-doctor-who.jpg), or [that one](http://brianofmorbius.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/doctor-who-084-4k-the-brain-of-morbius-4-of-4_0-19-03-29.jpg)) times. During this, the character dies and changes his face and a lot of his personality. Each Doctor (they generally last three-five years, the longest being seven) is a completely different era for the show.

Part of the appeal is due to this - different Doctors, and different writers completely change up the show every few years - no era is really the same. The current writer likes complicated plots, and fan-pleasing moments, whilst the previous liked bringing 'soap opera' type things into it. It's had a horror phase, and a camp phase, and an educational phase, every few years it's different.

I started watching with the start of new Series Three (2007) and to my mind that's still one of the best series. There's a new companion (who is also very good) at the beginning, so it's explained quite well. Don't worry about effects - one, it's 2007, not 1872, and two, it is and always has been about creativity, rather than showing off.

However, the series has always been written as a 'dip-in' type series, so really you can start anywhere you like (though probably not a finale, they resolve all the plots of recent and can leave you feeling a bit confused.). 

Last night's episode was a continuity-laden festival, but it was also half-written for the cinemas (it's an anniversary!) so there were quite a few crowd-pleasing moments, and a bit of explanation. You might as well dive in there, as I feel the show is less about understanding everything and more just loving it.

If you watch last night's spectacular and don't love it, IMO you have no soul.

Bearing in mind what I said about watching what you want, when you want, here's a list of some of the best IMO, in no particular order. (Most are new series, just because I'm not old enough to have seen many of the classics.)

* Dalek (2005)
* Blink (2007)
* Human Nature/The Family of Blood (2007)
* Voyage of the Damned (2007)
* Genesis of the Daleks (1975)
* Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (2008)
* The Waters of Mars (2009) -*My favourite, but probably not the best to start with*
* The Next Doctor (2009)
* The Eleventh Hour (2010)
* The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang (2010)
* The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon (2011)
* A Good Man Goes To War (2011)
* Asylum of the Daleks (2012)
* The Angels Take Manhatten (2012)
* Cold War (2013) -*I like this one, it got mixed reviews though*
* The Day of the Doctor (2013)
* The Five Doctors (1983)
* Remembrance of the Daleks (1987)
* The Time Warrior (1973)

The Doctor (whose name is never revealed) is one of these Time Lords.  He chose a life of adventure.  So he stole this ship called a TARDIS and too off to explore and participate.

Time-space has fixed points.  so he is unable to change all things.  He can only change what has happened.

Time Lords have differet anatomy.  For instance, they have two hearts and longevity.  Some Time Lords (like The Doctor) can regenerate into a new person 12 times.  It's a way to change actor and give him a new personality

The Doctor almost always has a companion.  He's partial to earth and earthlings.  The companion asks those questions the audeience would ask.  they also get captured and such.

Extrmcouchsurfer,The purpose of oil is to lubricate and aid in keeping engine parts cooler.  It forms a thin barrier around things like bearings to prevent excess friction.  Over time the viscus property starts to decay and the parts basically rub against each other and start to wear out and thus the requirement to change oil.,null,8,cdljqp2,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,27
NightMaestro,"Imagine the inside of your engines piston boar. Inside this giant cylinder the piston will go back and fourth thousands of times in a minute. On a molecular level you will see the surface of this boar have very jagged ridges because steel isnt perfectly smooth. As the piston goes up and down these pieces of metal will keep catching these ridges on a molecular level over and over and produce a lot of friction. This happens in all moving parts of the engine. To reduce this friction we use oil to fill gaps where the metal surfaces would otherwise grind up against eachother and subsequently melt all of these pieces of metal together through heat.

You cant keep other molucules out of the oil, thats just not possible, so after a while the oil will be mixed with other contaminates that dirty up the oil. After so many contaminates get into your oil, those molucular ridges wont fill with the almost friction free oil moluciles anymore, instead you will have dirt or metal shavings fill and create friction.

So check your oil. And imagine your engine melting together if you ever need a good incentive to check the milage until your next oil change. ",null,3,cdlkxap,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

CertifiedBullshit,"Oil has polymers in it that cause it to behave differently at different temperatures.  These polymers uncoil themselves as they warm up and give the oil a higher viscosity.  

An oil that is 5w-20 acts as a 5wt oil (very thin) at winter temperatures and a 20wt oil (much thicker) during warmer temperatures.  This is so the oil can easily flow through and coat the engine when cold, but will not become too thin when heated up that you lose oil pressure.

Over time these polymers begin to break down so that at higher temperatures the oil is too thin, giving less protection to the engine.

Windowsrookie,"Engines are very inefficient and produce a lot of waste.  Waste from the fuel combustion process mixes in with the oil over time.  Oil is designed to hold this waste so it doesn't build up in the engine. Eventually the oil reaches it's waste carrying capacity. When this happens the oil begins to break down and separate, leaving this waste all over inside your engine.  This is called sludge.

The additives are things to help combat oxidation of internal engine parts, viscosity of the oil, deterioration of the oil, among other things. Now, you have to understand what the oil is doing inside of the engine. It's being pumped around making sure all the bearings, rings, seals, and everything else are being properly lubricated. With the engine running, at any time, you are producing heat. The heat breaks down the additives inside of the base stock oil and can effect the performance of the oil. (And yes, the breaking down of oil can also effect the viscosity, however very slightly.) The oil can no longer properly protect your engine against sludge, oxidation, rust, and the lubrication of the oil will no longer be as effective as new oil. Also, on an added note, burned gases inside the engine also go into the oil, contaminating the oil and further lessening the effectiveness of the oil.

voucher420,"There are several reasons to change your oil. Even if you hardly drive, you should change your oil every three months. Why? The best reason is to remove the water being built up by taking short trips. Condensation will form on the cold metal parts overnight. Normally, it isn't much &amp; it evaporates &amp; gets sucked thru your engine once it's fully warmed up &amp; been driven for some time. Constant short trips never let the engine reach operating temperatures. The water builds up &amp; creates sludge. It can sometimes be mistaken for a blown head gasket. 

Oil additives break down over time &amp; wear out. If you drive a lot (long commutes, half hour or longer), you can go longer between oil changes. You don't have to worry about water contamination as much as people who take short trips &amp; can go five to ten thousand miles between oil changes (use synthetic to go up to fifteen thousand miles between oil changes). 

Most places recommend three thousand miles to help cover their asses. It's normal for engines to consume up to a quart of oil every one thousand miles. In a five quart system, that only leaves two quarts in the engine of ""key &amp; fuel"" drivers. If you check your oil frequently &amp; top it off when it gets down a quart, you can go much further between oil changes. Your engine runs cooler &amp; the oil is less likely to get burned. 

The other reason the three month/three thousand mile oil change is a good idea is for the inspection. Take your car to a real shop for oil changes. A good shop will inspect your car from top to bottom, check tire pressure, change your oil, &amp; suggest other maintenance items you may have neglected in that time. 

TL;DR: Change your oil every three months or three thousand miles unless you keep up on fluid levels &amp; tire pressure. Use the guide in your owners manual for specifications based on your driving style. ",null,1,cdlotzn,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
sophisticated_eyebro,"Your car's engine has tons of metal parts constantly rubbing against one another. To stop the metal bits from wearing out instantly and getting too hot, we use oil in it. The oil coats all the metal in a thin layer of lubricant to prevent wear and overheating.

As good as oil is, a bit of wear still occurs. Microscopic pieces of metal start to build up in the oil, making it not work so well.

Also, oil breaks down with heat. In oil, there are molecules that are bound together, but when it gets hot, those molecules break down and become a less effective lubricant.

When the oil becomes broken down and/or dirty, the metal parts in the engine scrape together a little more and wear faster. A 30$ oil change every few months is a lot better than a destroyed engine due to lack of lubrication.",null,0,cdloz90,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
mysticalone,"Many changes occur to the fresh oil you put into the car. Additives added to the oil are used up and the oil can no longer provide the same performance as fresh oil. As the additives break down, friction between metals increase and will contaminate the oil with metal particles. The tight spaces that rely on the oil and additives will now contain abrasives from the metal particles further worsening the performance and degrading the health of the engine.

If you have ever seasoned a pan, you may have noticed a stickiness from the oil when heating the pan. Similar reaction occurs over time with motor oil and with other contaminants such as moisture, dirt, coolant, motor oil becomes sludge. Oil filters can only remove so much until the filter is overcome with particles and can no longer effectively filter the oil.

With age, stress, and other factors, the engine may be leaking very small amounts of coolant that can react with the oil. Small amounts are ""ok"" however, over time the total amount in the oil increases and potentially causing harm to the motor same as motor oil.

Similar to oil in fast food restaurants. Oil will break down and become darker and thicker. Some owners will filter their used frying oil to save money, however, not everything is removed.

TimeTravellerSmith,"Basically what happens is that people can only contribute so much when they donate to political elections for obvious reasons.  It prevents single rich people from buying politicians via financing their election.

Enter the Super PAC, which is essentially an account that's run by someone and anyone can donate any amount of money *anonymously* and then the PAC can use the funds however they like towards elections.  They can buy ads supporting or against a candidate, run rallies, whatever.  So they can indirectly fund any politician they like with the caveat that ""they aren't supposed to work directly with them"".  Meaning that they can't go up to their candidate and ask ""what would you like us to do?""  Which creates obvious problems.  

Essentially, behind closed doors, a rich businessman or company can come up to a politician and his buddy who runs a PAC.  The buddy can run campaigns in different districts ""without consulting the politician"" to support them, while the businessman finances it ""anonymously.  Which means that the three can collude behind closed doors to get a politician in office and then the politician can do what they do best and give their donors perks once they're in office.

Example:

Politician is running for election, supports offshore drilling.  Buddy opens up a PAC and says it's going to support whichever politician will be best for ""local economy"", which really translates to whoever wants to do offshore drilling, which translates to ""I'm going to support my friend who happens to be a candidate"".  Rich oil company steps in and says ""well I support the guy who's going to let me drill offshore"" but can only donate a limited amount of money directly to the candidate.  So the three gather behind closed doors and the oil company says ""I'll donate millions to the PAC if you work for me in office (as in, allow drilling, lift sanctions, get tax breaks, etc)"".  To which the politician says ""no problem"" and the buddy running the PAC says ""give me your money and I'll work on some great ads"".

To make it simple, let's pretend that there is just one enzyme that helps process lactose and that enzyme's name is MILKY. Now, MILKY isn't needed if there is no lactose. And he IS needed when there IS lactose. So DNA does a clever thing.

In a normal state there is a small protein (essentially a bouncer at a club) that sticks to an area of the DNA called the [OPERATOR]. The name isn't important. What is important is that because this fat bastard is sitting in the way, the DNA can't be read (imagine the DNA is read in a linear manner). If you can't read it, you can't make it.

So what happens when lactose is present? The lactose (actually its metabolite... but just think lactose) actually sticks to the fat bastard bouncer. When lactose sticks to it, the fat bastard bouncer lets go of the DNA. Now the DNA can be read.

With that area exposed, a constantly floating protein (let's call him the AGENT) binds to the beginning part of the lac operon section of the DNA (the AGENT is chemically made to bind there - he fits like a key). With the AGENT bound to the promoting area [PROMOTER], he calls his friend the READER. The READER moves across and reads the DNA and while doing so is writing a translation of it, almost like translating it from one language to another. Except for READER he translates DNA into RNA.

Once a copy of the RNA is made this moves to another part of the cell (not body, just inside the cell) to be made into a protein. The name of the protein? Albert Einstein. Sorry couldn't resist. The resulting protein is MILKY. And with MILKY here, he can eat up all the lactose and poop out stuff that the cell can readily use.

That's pretty much how most stuff in the cell or any organism is made off of DNA. If it's something that we always need, then there is no fat bastard bouncer blocking that bit of the DNA. Or this regulation could work in reverse, where it's always made until something comes which sticks to a different fat bastard bouncer and instead of making it let go, makes it stick to the DNA.

Hope that helps.

eideid,"To understand how this works, you have to let go of the idea that anything on this level 'knows' anything. Things work because if they didn't, the organism would die and we wouldn't see any of that thing's offspring.

DNA is read by structures which copy sections and release bits of RNA which float around and then interact with structures in the cell which build new proteins which then float around and interact with other structures. In fact, most of biology is molecules floating around until they interact with something to cause something else to happen.

The really cool part is how different parts of DNA are read depending on the circumstances in the organism. There are molecules which will attach to the DNA which suppress or enhance different sections. Suppressed sections won't be copied as much, if at all, while enhanced sections will be copied much more often. In complex multicellular organisms, this results in different sorts of cells having different bits turned on and off and those differences affect which proteins get created and interact from one cell to the next. There are also feedback loops where a section of DNA gets activated, resulting in the production of something, which results in some activity which creates a new molecule which goes and turns off the section of DNA which was activated in the first place. Sections of DNA can activate and suppress entire networks of other sections of DNA. With just a few simple rules, a tremendous amount of complexity can emerge.",null,3,cdllthm,1rbs80,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9
Just-creepin,"DNA is code. Segments of it are read as mentioned through transcription and translation. This is the process of turning DNAs code into a message that is read and turned into a protein at a ribosome. The protein then encodes an enzyme or other cellular components (eg. Receptors). Now some of these enzymes go back to the DNA and are responsible for helping to express other segments of DNA along with binding partners enzymes are responsible for transcription and translation. Cells varying throughout the body express different regions of DNA, this is seem by cells in the liver having high expression of regulating enzymes for drugs or glucose, while cells in the stomach are responsible for digestion associated factors. Cells are able to know what they are supposed to do and what they are supposed to make by a series of things. This includes external hormones triggering cells for certain functions in a localized area as well as messaging between joining cells. So cells can receive messages from distant cells or other close cells which help tell them what to do. Then through intracellular signals tell the DNA what to do. Hope this helps.

OK, really, it's just a data type. It's not scary, so if your professor has been making it sound really scary it's not. It's only hard to deal with if you don't think like the computer.

Technically a pointer is just a 32 bit unsigned integer. (Or 64 bit unsigned integer if you're compiling for a 64 bit machine.) All it is is some number.

What's special about pointers is what we do with them and how the language will interpret it. A pointer is an address in memory. 

When you run a program the OS will allot it some memory in which to copy its instructions and to otherwise work with. The way the OS keeps track of memory so it only allots memory to one thing at a time - and the way low-level languages work with memory too - is by addressing it. The first byte of memory is 1, the second byte is 2, etc. until the last byte of memory is addressed. If you'r using a 32 bit OS with maxed out RAM that would make the last address 2^32

So now you know what a pointer is - an integer that's meant to correspond to a place in memory.

How we use them is a bit more complex, but it's not that hard if you just always think of it like the computer. The computer just has a huge stack of 'drawers' it can put stuff in. Each drawer is a byte. If you tell the computer 'put this in that address' it'll simply go to that address and copy the byte over. If you ask it to copy a 32 bit integer (4 bytes) to an address the first 8 bits go in the address, and the next 8 bits into the next bytes, etc. until it's copied everything. It's really simple, it's just not how humans tend to think of things. We try to bring common sense and other assumptions into how we think. Computers don't. 

In C/C++ you can get the address of things with the &amp; operator and ask the computer to read from memory with the * operator. (Often called the dereference operator because we often say a pointer references a point in memory, so dereferencing is finding what's actually there in the memory.)

    int a = 10;
    int* b = &amp;a;
    *b = 9;
    cout &lt;&lt; a;

That would print 9. The computer is told by us that b is the address of a, and to make what's at the address b points to 9. The computer isn't aware that we modified a because it doesn't think that much, it only understand that a is an integer that it put at some address it's kept a record of. When we ask it to print a it looks up where it put a in the memory, reads the memory location and finds a 9.

Here's something to be careful about:

    int a = 10;
    int* b = a;

That's bad. That doesn't mean 'b is a pointer to a', that means 'b is a pointer to the address 10'. This is bad because you have no guarantees that the OS has allotted the program the address 10 and so if you try to ask your program to modify what's at the address 10 and it has not been given access to it by the OS the OS will complain and will kill your program for attempting to violate memory. (This is usually called a segmentation fault. Segmentation fault almost always means you messed up with your pointers somewhere.)

Similarly be careful of this:

    int a = 10;
    int* b = &amp;a;
    b = 9;

Same as above, you're saying to make b point to the address 9, not to make what b points to 9. 

Also something you may not have heard but it's true - there's no real difference between an array and a pointer. When I say

    int[10] a;

a is an integer pointer. The program will give it enough room to store 10 integers rather than 1, but nonetheless a is just a pointer to the first byte of the first integer.

eideid,"At a very basic level, computer programs have to interact with memory. C++ is a rather low-level programming language by today's standards and it lets you (requires even) interact with memory in a very basic way.

When you initialize a variable you are telling the computer to set aside a specific amount of memory in a specific place for the program to store and retrieve information. This variable begins at a memory address which is represented as a number and it goes to a memory address dependent on the size of the type of data you are storing in it. When you reference this variable, you are really referencing this space in memory.

Now let's take it up a bit and talk about arrays. In C variants, arrays have to be declared with a fixed length and each element of an array must have the same kind of data. When you create an array of size N with a data type which takes up M bits, you get a chunk of memory N * M bits long. Let's say you want the third element of the array, we can calculate it by taking the address of the beginning of then skipping past the first 2 values, or 2 * M bits. This is (essentially) why arrays in this language start with index 0, since the first element is the address of the array and skip the first 0 * M bits.

Pointers are simply these memory addresses in a form which you can manipulate with your code. Instead of relying on the compiler to do it all behind the scenes, you can use pointers to play with the memory directly.

One reason you might see pointers very early is when passing arrays into functions. Most of the time we don't want variables we send to functions to get edited by the function without our knowing about it. If I were to just send the memory address of a variable to a function and that function changed the contents at that memory address, it might cause problems. C++ handles this by copying the value of the variable into a new memory space just for the function to play with, which makes programmers happy. This, however, can be a problem when dealing with large data structures. We don't necessarily want to copy a big pile of data just to do some trivial evaluation of it, so when you pass an array, instead of copying the whole thing, you just send a pointer to where the array already lives and hopefully you or whomever wrote that function is going to be nice and not mess it up for you.",null,0,cdlnkwr,1rbx7c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

OldWolf2,"A pointer is a way to refer to another variable. (There are several ways to refer to other variables, a pointer is one of them).

You point it at a variable you are interested in, and then you can access that other variable via the pointer.

One situation where this is useful is if you have some code that you want to be able to run multiple times on different variables.  Then you could make that code accept a pointer, and then you don't have to write out 10 different copies of the same code, just copy-pasting in a variable name.

IMPORTANT:  In C++ you actually don't need to use pointers at all, for 99% of applications. They're mostly there for historical reasons. C++ has other tools to do the same job which are less error-prone.  ",null,0,cdlrjkn,1rbx7c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
kouhoutek,"A pointer is a variable type that holds an address of another variable.

That is the technically correct and completely useless answer.  The real question is why the heck would you want something like that.  *That* question is more easily answered by looking at the problem that pointers solve.

Let's say you need to write a program that reads numbers from a file, sorts them, and prints them out.  The first thing you probably want to do is store them in an array, declared like this:

    int numbers[1000];

This presents a big problem, because the storage for numbers will be allocated statically.  This means your program will always reserve enough space for 1000 ints.  If your list has 20 elements, you are wasting space, and if it has 1001, your program fails.

The answer is to allocate memory *dynamically*, that is, let the program decide how much it needs while it is running, not beforehand.  For this, it is nice to have pointers:

    int *numbers;

That creates variable that can hold the address of a int.  It hasn't been initialized yet, so it is kind of useless, so let's take care of that:

    n = get_number_of_elements(""file.txt"");
    numbers = new int [n];

get_number_of_elements() is just some function you wrote to figure how how many numbers were in the file.  Once you know that, you can use new to ask your computer to set aside enough memory to hold n ints.  It returns the address of this memory in the form of a pointer, and you can use that pointer to access that memory:

    *number = 7;                  // Store 7 in the first location
    *(number + sizeof(int)) = 16; // Store 16 in the second location
    number[2] = 99;               // Cleaner notation

That is what pointers get you.  By using addresses, you can access data without having to explicitly declare it ahead of tiem.",null,1,cdlnust,1rbx7c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

It doesn't stop there either, there's the IBO, the WBF, the WBU, but people don't really pay much attention to any outside the main 4. Some guys hold ""World titles"" without ever fighting a top 10 opponent.
There's a lot of other crap but lets put a pin in that for now.
So each of the 4 organisations will have their own rankings. So you start out turning pro, and you get a promoter who will have lots of other boxers, and you start off on his cards fighting easy fights, and move up to better fights and eventually get on some rankings. After you move up to fighting capable guys (about 15-20) fights, your management (promoter mostly) will decide which of the belts to go after. The main factors in this would be which is an easier route to the title, and which organisation your promoter has the best relations with.
You will often find that big promoters will focus a lot on one boxing orgainsation. They build up a good business relationship and it gets stronger over time. The organisation will clear a path for the promoter's fighters to get the title, give him an easy fight to win it etc. In return the org will trust that the promoter can guarantee that he will put on some fairly lucrative title defenses so the org can make their money.

You're probably thinking of cancer as just ""mutations"" and if cells divide at around the same rate, why would mutations crop up in such a shorter amount of time in dogs compared to humans? While mutations are part of the development of many types of cancer, how your body handles those mutations is equally important.


Yes, older = more likely to develop cancer. But it's helpful to think of older not in terms of the number of years lived, but in what stage of the expected lifespan you're in. If you're a human, that means after 50 or so your chances of developing cancer are going to be highest. If you're a dog, that means after 10. What exactly governs the lifespan of a species? Why dog dogs enter old age at 10 and humans at 60? Lots of theories. One possibility has to do with the individual capacity of species to repair it's own DNA. If you have a stronger genetic capacity for DNA repair, you will be able to mitigate the damage that accumulates that leads to aging changes. You can think of humans as simply having a 6 or 7-fold better genetic capacity for DNA repair compared to dogs.

Cancer is something that ALL humans would get if we lived long enough.

The reason I say we would all get cancer if we lived long enough is because over time, our bodies break down and eventually our immune system just can't fight anymore.

I'm guessing dogs have a couple things going against them: 1) their immune systems work differently than ours and may not be as efficient at keeping cancer at bay... 2) as I said, they age more quickly, so a quicker ""break down"" of their defenses against cancer... 3) a lot of dogs are inbred, leading to genetic issues/mutations that make them more susceptible to cancer.

Inbreeding increases the risks of harmful genes being expressed because the offspring is more likely to receive copies of the harmful genes from both parents (because said parents share a number of the same genes with each other). Thus there's no 'healthy' dominant gene to act as a safeguard.

If you get the mutated gene from both parents, you suffer the effects of the disease.

Whilst these genes are rare in the general population, and so you'd have to be unlucky for both parents to be carriers by chance, if you interbreed within a family the chances of both parents being carriers of some defect or another is much higher.

People recognize that severe inbreeding results in people who start appearing and behaving a bit differently from society and they often end up resulting in more sickly children after several generations. The taboos and customs regarding inbreeding tend to be rather strong across cultures. The idea that this is the result of mutations is due to the public having a poor understanding of how genes and mutations work and how this relates to different mating choices.

A rough example of this is Tay Sachs in Ashkenazi Jews. Ashkenazi Jews are very genetically similar, so when two Ashkenazi born Jews get together, genetically they are about as close as 4th cousins (there was a study on this a while back).

Basically, the telomerase prevents DNA from getting lost, by taking up the spaces at the end of the strands with non-encoding material. 

Telomerase can also be used to replace lost sections, but as cells divide over and over again, those strands of telomerase get shorter and shorter, and the shorter strands of telomerase at the end of your DNA mean that stuff that *does* contain encoded instructions gets lost, and larger and larger sections of your divided DNA are filled with stuff that doesn't do anything except fill in the gaps.

Now stem cells can fit in and start the whole process fresh, because they're brand new and they can become anything. But once they pick a definite type of cell to become, they also begin the mitosis process and eventually decay themselves.

This is why a lot of defendants win their trials by their lawyer just saying, ""Is that all they have?

I swear to God, about half the class reached up and scratched their head.  The teacher always stopped at this point in his classes because he had observed this happening regularly over the years with this character at this point.

However, the theorem doesn't strictly apply: only part of your head (for most people--Chewbacca is an exception) is covered with hair.

ilyouk,"A hair whorl is a patch of hair growing in the opposite direction of the rest of the hair. Hair whorls occur in most hairy animals, on the body as well as on the head. Hair whorls, also known as crowns, swirls, trichoglyphs, or cowlicks, can be either clockwise or counterclockwise in direction of growth.
Hair whorls on the head (parietal whorls) have been studied by some behaviorists. Most people have clockwise scalp hair-whorls. Parietal whorls which are considered to be normal scalp patterns could be a single whorl or double whorls. Cases of triple parietal whorls are less common but do not necessarily indicate abnormality.[citation needed]
Amar J. S. Klar conducted research to see if there was a genetic link between handedness and hair-whorl direction. He found that 8.4% of right handed people and 45% of left handed people have counterclockwise hair-whorls. His research indicates that a single gene may control both handedness and hair-whorl direction.[1]
Another result concerning handedness of the progeny of discordant monozygotic twins suggests that lefties are one gene apart from righties. Together, these results suggest (1) that a single gene controls handedness, whorl orientation, and twin concordance and discordance and (2) that neuronal and visceral (internal organs) forms of bilateral asymmetry are coded by separate sets of genetic pathways.

Black singers tend to have particular muscle groups that are stronger or are used more/differently, and this creates certain colours in the voice. These same muscle groups also impact on your speaking voice. Im not going to say thats genetic, i have absolutely no idea. I guess it could easily be like how a family of loud talkers use more diaphragm support and then their kids would have that too because they had more practice at it.

 These singers also more often have a 'thicker chord setting' that sounds beefy. Different harmonic partials, a darker or warmer tone etc. This is what gives that strong sound. Yes, other not-black singers can do this and sometimes will do it naturally or can learn to do it. And yes, there are of course black singers that have different voices.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"Detachment (more commonly called, non-attachment) is a very important quality in many Eastern spiritual and religious traditions (as well as under many Ancient Greek and Roman philosophical schools).  Many people believe that it's an absolute necessity if you want to maintain happiness, peace of mind, tranquility, and physical, mental, and emotional health.  Many people spend years studying it, meditating on it, and practicing it.  But I don't think it requires all of that for everyone.  

If you want to learn detachment/non-attachment, start with reading the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Zen works and commentaries, the Vedas and commentaries, Seneca, Cicero, and Marcus Aurelius.  Those will get you started and lead you yo further useful study.  

The word ""emotion"" derives its meaning from the Greek word that means ""disturbance,"" and many people think that emotions are hellish disturbances to remove. Entire cultures throughout the centuries have focused on this as one of their primary life objectives and most valuable life achievements.  

Please note that words are very limiting in many (all?) cases and are just symbols for real underlying things.  So, many people would define love and joy as emotions, but most who practice detachment/non-attachment would say that true love and actual joy are fundamental qualities of just existing in your true essential nature and they have no opposites and, therefore, they are not emotions.

eideid,"A bank's function is to underwrite good debts and fund them by borrowing either from depositors or other institutions. It gets paid through the fees and interest it charges, but a substantial portion of this has to be used to cover debt which turns out to be bad. In order to do this, it has to maintain a fund of cash (or cash-like) assets which the bank draws on when debts it has underwritten are not repaid by the debtor. If a bank writes way too many debts which fail, this fund can be exhausted and the bank becomes insolvent.

The predominant view of regulation prior to the recent financial crisis has been dubbed 'micro-prudential' in that it cared about ensuring that each bank was stable independently with the belief that a bunch of individually sound banks would result in a sound banking sector as a whole. A major factor in the severity of this financial crisis was that more mainstream banks began using methods of shifting risk around such as credit default swaps which made their individual books each look very good, but which made the banking system as a whole more vulnerable to failure. This has led to calls for regulation which has greater awareness of these systemic risk dubbed 'macro-prudential'.",null,1,cdltyc4,1rcjpb,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6
MasterAdkins,"From http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/04/how-dick-came-to-be-short-for-richard/ 

How Dick became a nickname for Richard is known and is one of those “knee bone connected to the thigh bone” type progressions, somewhat similar to how the word ‘soccer’ came about.  Due to people having to write everything by hand, shortened versions of Richard were common, such as ‘Ric’ or ‘Rich’.  This in turn gave rise to nicknames like ‘Richie’, ‘Rick’, and ‘Ricket’, among others.  People also used to like to use rhyming names; thus, someone who was nicknamed Rich might further be nicknamed Hitch.  Thus, Richard -&gt; Ric -&gt; Rick gave rise to nicknames like Dick and Hick around the early 13th century.

While few today call Richards ‘Hick’, the nickname ‘Dick’ has stuck around, and of course has come to mean many other things as well.  Its persistence as associated with Richard is probably in part because around the 16th century Dick started to be synonymous with ‘man’, ‘lad’, or ‘fellow’, sort of a general name for any ‘Tom, Dick, or Francis” (which by the way appears in Shakespeare’s Henry IV, written in the late 16th century, with Dick at this point firmly established as an “every man” name).  It may well be that this association with ‘man’ is in turn how ‘dick’ eventually came to mean ‘penis’.",null,70,cdlz6oi,1rcjuo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,503

panzerkampfwagen,"The BEF (British Expeditionary Force) was holding its own but the French forces to their south fell back.  This put the BEF in danger of being surrounded and cut off so they had to fall back.  They fell back to Dunkirk where over 300k British soldiers were rescued, minus their heavy equipment, by a flotilla of navy and civilian ships. The saving of so many troops enabled the UK to remain in the fight but the loss of so much heavy equipment meant that they were a bit more lightly armed than they wanted to be for a while.  

Goering, commander of the Luftwaffe (Air Force), stated that his aircraft could destroy the British at Dunkirk, so Hitler ordered the Heer (army) to hold.  His Wehrmacht (military) commanders had been worried that the Heer was being overextended and was in danger of being cut off if the French or British launched a counter attack so Goering's boast provided a needed excuse to get the Heer to stop and regroup. The RAF (Royal Air Force) fought the Luftwaffe in the skies over Dunkirk and prevented them from destroying the BEF.  However, a lot of the fighting took place in cloud cover and so the soldiers on the ground thought they were being mercilessly attacked by the Luftwaffe and believed that the RAF did nothing to help them.

The push forced these Northern forces back and, in order to save the BEF it was ordered to fall back on the Channel ports and evacuate - of these Dunkirk was the only port open which the BEF, together with parts of the French army, fell back on. It was about this stage that non-combatants and non-essentials were evacuated.

When this happened the Belgians (until their surrender) and the BEF held the right flank and the French most of the rest of the line. This then got smaller and the French army took over more of the line to hold it.

The evacuation took place mostly from a jetty on the port which was suitable for large warships to get into. Men also went on the beaches and even up to their necks in water - this leads to the famous little ships of Dunkirk which does what it says on the tin: small ships, crewed by civilians from all over the South coast of Britain including London picked up men off the beaches and sailed them either to waiting warships or back to England often under air attack. 

Towards the end of the evacuation French troops were also evacuated in part because most of the BEF had gone and also for political reasons. 

For reasons unknown to this day Hitler halted his Panzers and left the job to Goering and the Luftwaffe. The RAF's home squadrons - which were desperately needed for the inevitable defence of Britain - fought to keep the German planes from the beaches but because of both cloud cover and the need to shoot the bombers down before the reached the beach (for obvious reasons) meant this battle went largely unseen by the troops leading to accusations of the RAF not helping. Of course some ships were sunk

On June 4th the remnants of Dunkirk surrendered, most of the troops captured were French but approximately 330,000 British and French troops made it safely to England to continue the fight.

MockRocDoc,"As someone else here said, the simple answer is that the roughness prevents enough surface contact to make a strong mechanical bond, but there is also a deeper reason.  Before getting to wood I will say that this does happen with some solid materials under the right conditions.  Copper can 'friction weld' to itself.  Well polished metals can do this much more easily because of the type of bonds they form.  

Wood is a composite of strong bonds and weaker bonds.  If you could sweep away the weak bonds you might be able to create strong bonds in their place.  Think of firing ceramics.  The water holds the clay together, but if you heat it you drive the water out and eventually form strong bonds between the clay particles.  There is more to it than that but it is a reasonable example.

I can be a little more specific about the bonds and why this is so difficult with wood.  The strongest bonds in the wood are likely chains of carbon which have hydrogen on the sides of the chain.  Hydrogen weakly bonds to water which also weakly bonds to itself.  It would take a lot of energy to strip the water and hydrogen out which is mostly why this won't happen.

marmelukes,"First off they're solids. Solids exist in a mostly or completely rigid state and they don't have a lot of free energy, so they're not good at forming new bonds quickly.

Second, they're biological. Biological bonds are not energetically favorable. Your body expends serious amounts of energy to grow or even just maintain their form. When you no longer have the energy to fight this entropy you're dead, and you begin to decompose. Decomposition is your chemical bonds breaking apart, bit by bit.

Therefore, two pieces of dead wood can not fuse without some sort of goofy process taking place. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's not normal.

Liquids can only fuse because they are less rigid and have more free energy to form new bonds. In water for instance the H2O is constantly making and breaking bonds. Forming H30 and H0 and switching back. However if you sap energy from the system and turn that water into ice, it forms a more rigid structure that is less capable of fusing.",null,3,cdm5q85,1rcljv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,16

This universe is made of tiny things called atoms.
Atoms are made of even tinier stuff.
Some atoms are positively charged, some are negatively charged, and some are neutral. 
When you rub two objects together, you're actually rubbing off some of the negatively charged stuff from one object to the other. 
This is is called ""static electricity"" because the electrons [negative] aren't really moving, they're just being sort of brushed off.
Negatively charged atoms always wants to stick to positively charged atoms.
Neutral atoms always want to be left alone.
Because all things are made of atoms, and some atoms are positive and some atoms are negative, you end up with clumps of atoms called molecules. 
Molecules exist in three main states.
&gt;Solid
&gt;Liquid
&gt;Gas

Gasses have a lot of energy stored inside them, [valence] so much energy that molecules are flying and bouncing around everywhere. It's easy to mix gasses because there's so much room and chaos between molecules. 

&gt;Liquids are much harder to mix together because the molecules in liquids have less energy than the molecules in gasses and there's not much space for the molecules to move around. Some liquids like oil and water will absolutely refuse to mix together because they repel eachother, and water is heavier than oil.

Solids rarely ever want to mix with other solids. In fact it's incredibly difficult for a solid to mix with anything because the molecules in a solid aren't moving at all. The molecules are at such a low level of energy that they sit around hugging eachother like me and Jess on Sundays. 

Because wood is a solid, it's hard to mix it with more wood.
However, it's easy to excite the wood fibers on the surface of a piece of wood, and get it to stick to another piece of wood with static electricity. 
&gt;OR you could even use some semi-liquid molecules in a higher state of energy called glue, to raise the fibers on the surfaces of two pieces of wood and get them stuck together and wrapped in a solid once the glue dries.

bloonail,"Metal, as with the other objects in your surroundings will tend to achieve the temperature of the ambient air. There are some subtle differences. Things that have a light cover that are exposed to infra red light, even in small amounts - will tend to be bit warmer. Just at the surface. This is because the fabric both obsorbs infra-red and insulates it from the deeper material. Its difficult to measure but a thermal camera would show that.

Its maybe more interesting to point out what happens when you touch an insulator, fabric, wood or tile that's a few degrees colder, Lets says 20 Celcius versus 33 for your feet. In that case the surface reflects back heat, your skin mostly doesn't touch the object and only a few points in the surface of the tile, kinda speckled, will immediately become the temperature of your skiN. You'd heat the a tile a floor just a bit walking on it - a high speed thermal camera following your walk should show the whorls of your footprints on the surface for a few seconds afterwards. If you rested in one spot you'd quickly feel warmer under your feet.

With metal the same walk would bit by bit cool your foot in a very small layer. This would feel cold because the surface of your skin would be matching the 20 Celcius floor as you walked. You are heating a greater volume of the metal floor because its a conductor. A thermal camera will show your feet barely heating the surface of the floor. Your steps would disappear quickly behind your feet as you walked. The floor may reflect in the infra-red back at your foot but that's more than compensat4d for by the heat you've lost through conduction. you can lose or gain heat only through radiation, conduction and mass transfer. Only the first two matter in this case.

Sitting on a good insulating chair for a while, or on something that's been exposed to infra red light, even just a bit, like by a lamp, will feel warm, even if the chair is mostly 20 C because your body will quickly heat the surface up to your body temperature, and then warm it further because the chair cannot dissipate the heat your body is generating.

The US tends to go through fairly long cycles of major political alignments. It's political structure heavily favors two national parties which are each a coalition of various interests. To hold such diverse interests together, an important tactic is focusing less on what unites the party and more on why the opposing party would ruin everything, making party defection a scary prospect for coalition members.

The US trajectory has been tending toward policies of social permissiveness combined with economic non-intervention since the end of World War II. The most recent major political realignment occurred beginning in the mid-1960s and finalizing, roughly, with the election of Ronald Regan in 1980. Since then, both parties have been pushing their agenda where it agrees with the national trend and reluctantly retreating in areas which are in opposition to it.

An ""econimically liberal, socially conservative"" party would be economically interventionist (against the trend) and socially impermissive (also against the trend). Non-hispanic Catholics in the US are not a terribly reliable voting block, with a great many being much more socially permissive or economically non-interventionist than official church doctrine.

It has also involved emotional and physical feelings and manifestations  from having a sense of connectivity to the earth and affecting the weather to having pretty realistic faux sexual encounters. I can say that subconcious/repressed feelings can manifest (such as having marathons at night of everyone you feel you've ever wronged coming inside you and judging you to I guess, get some feeling of forgiveness). All in all it's almost evolved into a sort of different reality, for awhile I dulled out with opiates and alcohol and it didn't seem real some sort of ignorant repression; but after that it sort of bit me in the ass and now my ""reality"" involves more external that internal feelings  constantly under scrutiny, (after dabbling in that whole lightworker/energy/shaman bs) feeling under attack and fighting to retain my ""energy"" which actually feels like being drained by people

Later, cartoonist Thomas Nast used the Democratic donkey in newspaper cartoons and made the symbol famous.

In a cartoon that appeared in Harper's Weekly in 1874, Nast drew a donkey clothed in lion's skin, scaring away all the animals at the zoo. One of those animals, the elephant, was labeled “The Republican Vote.” That's all it took for the elephant to become associated with the Republican Party.

When they do this, some of their mass is changed straight into energy.  The famous equation E=mc^2 describes this relationship.  For every gram difference between the starting materials and the end materials in a nuclear reaction, 8.98755179 × 10^13 joules are produced.  That's apparently about a seventh of the energy the average hurricane releases in a second, which, if you consider the size of a hurricane, is quite a lot. It's also the energy equivalent of eating 92 million mars bars.

They do by releasing three different types of radiation - alpha, beta and gamma.  Alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons, and are the same as the nucleus of a helium atom (don't worry about that specifically, but I'm including it for completeness), beta particles are electrons, and gamma radiation is high frequency electromagnetic rays, similar to visible light but much higher in energy.

Alpha, beta and gamma radiation are called *ionising*, and it's this property that makes them dangerous.  These tiny ionising particles can penetrate into our bodies and disrupt our cells (most notably our DNA), damaging them and potentially triggering cell death or cancer.  Alpha particles are the most damaging but can't get through your skin.  Beta particles sit somewhere in the middle, and gamma particles are lowest energy but most penetrating.

In nuclear fission, we split uranium atoms. When the atoms split, they break apart and release energy (which we use for boiling water to steam. We then use the steam to make electricity).

Fission occurs when a neutron hits a uranium atom. When we split the atom, we get more neutrons out to continue the reaction. (This is why it is called a chain reaction).

The split uranium atom becomes 2 random smaller atoms. These smaller atoms are usually radioactive. Some of them are so radioactive that as they give off radiation, they heat up everything around them, similar to a microwave.

The split atoms are so radioactive that they are dangerous for humans. They need to be constantly shielded.

bigfish42,"There's been a ton of research on this, and there are at least five big drivers: Waste, Price Insensitivity, Technology, Market Pressures, and Regulation. 

Something like 30% of our health spending is pure waste. Well, worse than pure waste because of the risk of negative outcomes (hospital acquired infections, death, etc.). This can be from all kinds of things, from outright fraud to doctors and systems simply covering their butts, to doctors agreeing to treatments that patients asked for so they don't lose their future business. 

If you understand supply/demand models, I hope that you know a bit about price sensitivity. There is an assumption of a downward sloping demand for healthcare services with respect to price paid (higher cost -&gt; less demand for it). The trouble is that the payor is not the same as the recipient of the service, and neither is the one who makes the recommendation. Here, the one that recommends the treatment is often the one who gets paid for doing things (the doc), the one who pays often just gets a bill for what has been done (the insurer), and the one who receives the service (the patient) just pays their copay - a cost that has little to do with the total price of the service. 

A huge driver of costs is the ""arms race"" of the latest technology. This has all kinds of drivers that are worth diving into - like our current patent and approvals process - but I'll leave that for the inevitable flood of comments. The consequence is that doctors and health system spend a massive amount of money on new technology that patients demand that has little (if any) positive effect on outcomes.

In terms of market structure, there is massive fragmentation among providers. And they are the ones who have to buy supplies. Since there isn't one big purchaser of supplies (including meds, devices, durable medical supplies, etc.) and there are just a few major players for specialized (and patented) supplies, the providers have little bargaining power to keep costs of supplies down. The higher costs from less market power get passed on to customers. Additionally, consumers - patients - don't have any real power, except through their insurers, to keep costs down. (But if there exists a patients' union, let me know!)

Finally, regulation. It costs a lot of money to comply with all of the regulations. This goes from staffing (doctor training is massively expensive and heavily regulated), to job designation (there is generally a very well-defined scope where an individual can practice), to required emergency care (see EMTALA) driving up the cost of bad debts, and even to requirements related to safety. These all cost a lot of money, and those costs all get factored in when the providers set their prices. With the general price insensitivity, and lack of customer power, these costs generally go straight through to increase the cost of care.

It's messy, but those are the top 5 IMO.

Ahrius,"A few reasons: ER/COBRA, Malpractice and Medicare.

Basically, every so often, the government decides that the reimbursement rate (what the Dr. takes home) goes down by 20%. Once this happens, ALL the other insurances follow the same practice.

In the USA, medicine is the ONLY profession that gets a GOVERNMENT MANDATED PAY CUT. As a result, doctors may try to compensate by ordering a more expensive test or doing an extra procedure, because:
a) he's trying to be thorough for the sake of friends/family
b) he's trying to be thorough so if something happens, he can't be blamed
c) he's trying to put food on his table because the gov keeps cutting his pay

Malpractice is another huge issue - a physician's work can and will result in death sometimes. The family wants to blame someone because that's more comforting than accepting that there was nothing else that could be done. Doctor's get sued left and right and if there happens to be a guilty verdict involved, that doctor's career is over. Sure, we pay insurance to cover this and technically it's alright, but no hospital will ever hire that doctor again. Since death is involved, the verdict's tend to be high in number, so malpractice charges a lot. As a result, things cost more because doctor's have bigger bills to pay.

Finally COBRA law - if you walk into an ER, you cannot be denied because of poverty. So you get treated. Something as small as a cold or requiring a multi-million dollar procedure, you get treated. But who eats the cost?

The hospital.

The cost of running/maintaining machines, ordering tests, buying materials, etc. all goes to the hospital and they have to front the bill. That's why there's an issue with illegal immigrants. Many illegal immigrants who do hazardous labor jobs get into accidents and go to the ER. Illegal immigrants also have no insurance (because they're illegal), so they visit the ER for everything. 

Essentially, hospitals pay for illegals to have free health care. The hospital then passes that cost on to the insurance companies by raising the prices of their procedures. The insurance then raises your premium to pay for the new prices. 

TL;DR - Malpractice, COBRA, and MEDICARE make it hard to be a doctor.

dvfw,"1. **Licensing** - Medical schools, pharmacies and hospitals are heavily licensed. This drastically reduces supply of doctors and hospitals, while demand increases, leading to higher prices. It also reduces competition leading to the same result.
2. **Regulations** - Burdening businesses with regulations forces them to increase the costs of their goods, and often kills smaller competitors, contributing further to monopolies. An example is the FDA. After the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the FDA Act were singed in 1962, and by 1976, the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated $24 million, 10 to 20 times as much as in the early 1960's, while development times had climbed from a couple of years to the better part of a decade. These amendments also caused longer production times, causing many deaths by making consumers have to wait for new drugs. Prior to the Kefauver-Harris Bill of 1962, the average time from the filing of an IND to approval was seven months. By 1967, however, the average time to approval had increased to thirty months. Time to approval continued to rise through the late 1970s, when on average a successful drug took more than ten years to get approved. In the late 1980s and 1990s, times to approval decreased somewhat, but are still eight years on average, far higher than in the 1960s.
3. **Subsidies** - The US has heavily subsidized the sick - with, for example, Medicare and Medicaid - by providing them special benefits when they are sick. Subsidies create more of whatever is being subsidized. This encourages carelessness and dependency on government, as opposed to responsibility and self-ownership. Also, corn syrup, a leading cause of obesity, is subsidized heavily. The worse health problems that result, cause more demand for health care, and higher costs.
4. **Employer-provided insurance** - When insurance is paid for by someone else - in this case, the employers - customers are not likely to shop around for the best deals, and they will overuse health services. This increase in demand leads to higher costs.
5. **Patents** - Patents basically grant a monopoly on the production of a certain patented drug. Monopolies, as everyone knows, lead to higher prices.",null,0,cdmfbtn,1rd0ud,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

To understand what I mean by ""paired"" and ""unpaired"", look up orbital filling and the pauli principle.  Each orbital can have two electrons of opposite spin.  If all orbitals are filled in this way, there will be no net spin in the system.  So you need an orbital with only one electron to create a net magnetic moment.

1.It just so happens that electrons have an intrinsic (they just have it) property called spin. While you can visualize this as the electron spinning this isn't really whats happening, but I feel that for this explanation we don't need to go any further. This spin can be either + 1/2 or -1/2 depending on which direction the spin is in. A spin of +1/2 negates a spin of -1/2 .

2.The electrons in atoms populate atomic orbitals, and the way they fill these orbitals depends on the aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principle.

3.When the electrons populate the orbitals in such a way that there are unpaired electrons left over. As in some of the electrons don't have their spin of +1/2 or -1/2 negated, then the material is paramagnetic.

On a side note, not only are metals magnetic, an example being dioxygen. While not possible to see the magnetism in the gaseous phase due to the high kinetic energy of the oxygen molecules, it is possible to see the magnetic properties of liquid oxygen.

yellowsquare,"In the US at least, the reason why monetary compensation is not offered for whole blood donation is because money is too good of a reason to donate. Many studies were conducted, and long story short, intravenous drug users were donating blood to get drug money. The American Red Cross and other blood centers around the country do not want intravenous drug users to donate their blood because of the very high risk of those people having undiagnosed hepatitis or HIV.

Plasma centers (like Biolife and CSL) are allowed to offer monetary compensation because they use that plasma primarily for research purposes, and isn't put into patients' bodies (usually). Some parts of the plasma can be used for medical purposes, but that's after being highly processed and screened.

Now the next question you might ask is why don't blood centers just screen all the blood that's donated so they can still pay money? The answer is they do, but the national blood centers have decided to take this extra step to ward off potential high risk donors in order to build redundancy and (therefore security) in the field of blood banking. 

Taking someone's blood and putting it into someone else's body is a dangerous process, and the entire system from donor to recipient is layered with redundancy in an attempt to make the process as safe as possible for recipients.

The notion that plasma is used ""mostly"" or ""usually"" for research is misguided.  Next time you're in a CSL center count the beds, count the chairs in the waiting room, do some multiplication.  That one company collects millions of liters of plasma every year.  Nobody is doing that much research.  The primary driver for increasing collections is the manufacture of Intravenous Immunoglobulin.  It's a great therapy for the people who need it, and it costs a fortune currently.  Plasma also makes therapies for burn victims, hemophiliacs/other blood disorders, fibrinogen ""glue"" used in surgery, lots of stuff.  Many types of vaccines are manufactured from plasma also.  These are all for-profit pharmaceutical products.  (Good products that are important therapies for the people who receive them, not boner-pills, but not 'research' either.)

There are some specialty facilities around that do perform mostly targeted collections for research purposes or reagent manufacture, so you weren't necessarily lied to if someone told you a particular donation was for research.


On the actual question, there are many additional rules applied to plasma donors that are not applied to volunteer whole blood donors that are part of the quality control system approved/inspected by the FDA and add safety to the compensated donation process.  If a whole blood donation center wanted to jump through all these additional hoops, they could most likely be licensed to perform compensated collections as well.

1) You must have a permanent home address within a defined area (generally 50-60 miles) of the facility.  Your address must not be on a list of known long-stay motels, flop houses, half-way houses, missions, etc.

2) There is a nation wide list of every person who has ever had a positive HIV/Hepatitis test in any plasma clinic that is checked.

3) You must donate twice, so there are two sets of viral test results.  If you only ever donate once, that bottle goes right to the incinerator.  This is why you get paid more for your second visit!

4) Plasma donors must have annual physicals by an actual doctor or approved substitute.

5) Plasma collection facilities must report their positive test result rates to the national association.  They face audits and corrective action if they exceed normal levels for the population.  This incentivizes them to do a good job screening and not let in questionable donors to make more money.

6) Plasma clinics are required to share information with all the other plasma clinics in their area about who is donating when, to stop them from donating more often than allowed.  This is more to protect the donor, but it does identify and eliminate people who are desperate to score cash quickly.

That is not exhaustive, but I think it's a decent overview of the additional steps that go into being allowed to do compensated donations above what a regular blood bank does.",null,0,cdmhi6r,1rd4v6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

AnteChronos,"&gt;What is Settlers of Catan (besides being a board game)

There is no ""besides being a board game"".  All it is is a board game.


&gt;and why is it so good?

It follows a specific design philosophy associated with [German-style board games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game).  In a broad sense, this includes things like a total lack of player elimination (so no one has to sit around bored for an hour while everyone else keeps playing), both public and hidden scoring criteria (so no one is the obvious loser until the very end when you tally the score), randomized board configurations (allowing for greater replay value), a greater emphasis on strategy over luck, and less emphasis on direct player conflict.",null,7,cdm0sa8,1rd5ld,explainlikeimfive,top_week,36
Taken4GrantD,"Gives a unique gameplay, with the exception of the robber, a piece that lets you steal a resource and block a tile, all competition is passive, you can't hurt your opponents, you can only really get in their way.  Much of the game is weighing you options, is this a good position or is it just in theory?  Would I be better off with more resources or more trading options? In this way its easy to pick up, but high level decisions are extremely subjective.

People_Are_People,"As a huge Catan fan I just want to add a few points to why I think it separates itself from other games.

1) I think game perfectly balances luck and skill in a way that keeps everyone involved. Your strategy can only put you so far ahead because you do not know what resources you will end up getting. Unlike hardcore strategy games a beginner who understands the rules will not be put so far behind a seasoned player that they cannot win.

2) You are involved in every single turn. Games like monopoly and risk can be hated because when you are not moving you are basically sitting around. In Catan you have the possibility of benefits and there is ""action"" on every move. This keeps everyone involved in the game which prevents the ""whose turn is it I don't even know"" problem.

3)It always is progressing towards the end. Everyone knows the monopoly game where money is just being pushed around in no end in sight. In Catan unless there is a super high fluke in low percentage numbers or robbers, the resources are always progressing towards the end goal so there is never any dreaded board game purgatory. 

4) Because of the changing layout and randomness of the board every game can be different so every game could have different successful strategy. 

Seriously I could prob go on and on with other reasons these were the first few I thought of. If you have never played give it a shot if you can. I fell in love after the first time. If you are playing with friends, ask them to honestly give you some advice on where you should put your first cities and strategies so you have a decent chance.

blandrice123,"You begin with two settlements on an island gameboard, lush with rich forests, wheat fields, deep mines, quarries, and tracts of grazing land.  By roll of the dice, luck and strategy dictate what resources you receive each turn and, therefore, the infrastructure of your empire. Perhaps you will gather the brick and wood necessary to build long, impressive roads between settlements, or the eclectic variety of resources needed to raise a large and fearsome army.  Maybe you will expand your empire, creating new settlements- all of these bring you closer to victory. 
But beware the others who inhabit the island gameboard with their own budding empire states.  They seek the same goal as you: to settle the wild island of Catan and dominate its resources.  Despite this competition, you must often seek to forge alliances and open trades- a stack of wood for a bundle of wool or some brick for the wheat to feed your people.  Alliances beget rivalry, and treachery is always underfoot.  In a single turn a once-close ally can trade to you the ore you need to upgrade your settlement, only to turn around and build a road through what you thought was your territory, effectively destroying your well planned strategy.

About gathering resources, trading and expanding on the same island with limited space but with no moving entities besides one single ""barbarian/pirate/robber"" that can be teleported by everyone. The lack of movement on the game map, besides expanding roads villages and cities, saves a lot of time playing a civilization-like game that is spend on free trading.

Hexagonal tiles give one of 5 different resource types when their number is rolled in a turn. numbers are rolled with two w6, making 7 most common and some tiles worse. But 7 is a bad stealing/blockading event against the greediest players, limiting fast expansion. resources are gained by players cities on tile corners. cities of a player must be connected by roads on tile borders. a city/village usually has 2 or 3 ressource gaining tiles next to it. resources buy expansions or options/upgrades/structures but they are very resource specific, forcing to trade or wait. this gives each resource type various specific optional uses. the maps border usually has evenly spread npc-trading-posts that give one of any for 2 speficit resources, or 1 of any for 3 of any (of the same) resources. but borders have no resource-gaining tile. each turn allows to trade with the active player.  the game is a race for the best spots.

The luck of the dice is countered by trade embargoes.

What made the game explode is its combustibility and modifyability, adding other victory conditions like building world wonders or having a few moving entities per player.

Enchanted_Bunny,"It is a board game in which each player builds up an ""empire"" of sorts made of roads, settlements, and cities until one player reaches 10 victory points and ends the game. 

Why is it so good? Let's compare it with a more standard American game: monopoly. Think about what happens when you play monopoly. It starts off okay. Then one person gets eliminated. Then another person gets eliminated. Now only two of the four players have any stake in the game'a outcome. The two eliminated players have the choice of staying at the table and spectating or going off and doing their own thing. The two person slug fest can last for hours and a lot of the time the game is just given up on. It's no surprise really as the game in its original iteration (the landlords game) was designed specifically *not* to be fun. It was meant to be a teaching tool of the folly of capitalism. 

Contrast this with settlers of catan. The German style board game design philosophy that catan follows is designed to keep all players engaged in play until the game ends. Catan specifically has several different methods and strategies that can lead to victory. So if for example you just aren't getting the materials you need to build that road or city you need to score points, you can buy developments cards, or if you roll a 7 you can steal cards from someone else.

Quetzalcoatls,"The US emerged from the Second World War as one of two global superpowers. The war devastated much of Western Europe and the US  tasked itself with rebuilding the continent. The Soviet Union, former ally of the US, sought to spread Communism throughout the world and soon become the chief economic, political, and military rival of the United States. This is a period known as the Cold War. In order to stop the advancement of communism the United States adopted a policy of containment and worked both diplomatically and militarily to prevent its spread. 

Since the fall of the USSR the US has shifted its focus to removing regimes that destabilize world markets, terrorism, or preventing genocide/mass killings. Additionally the US, like most developed nations, now field a professional military (no conscripts). This means that wars and police actions more often than not do not directly effect the population which limits how much people really care.

sir_sri,"In WW1 the US was a natural strategic competitor to Britain and much of the population was german or Irish so they didn't even like Britain.  

So in WW1 the US stayed out as long as it could because it was playing both sides.  The Royal Navy dominated the oceans of the word, so trade meant going to the UK or France (or allies) - in return for money, that way, while they were bleeding themselves fighting germany, and the US could still buy technology and that sort of thing from Germany without needing much direct physical trade.  

Then Germany made clear just how far they were willing to go to win - that included being willing to Ally with Mexico against the US and roll the US back to the pre 1848 borders.  They were also willing to shoot anything that might be shipping arms to the UK.  That wasn't acceptable so the US got involved, because if it didn't americans were going to get killed selling stuff, and if the Germans won there could conceivably be a massive extremely powerful and dangerous german army liberating a huge portion of the western/south western US.  

In WW2 the situation was similar but different.  The US had massive financial interests in germany (including significant loans to the german government and banks), and largely (correctly) felt that France had to some degree brought this upon themselves.  The problem was that germany was sinking US ships (even when  the US was neutral), and Japan was threatening US interests in the Pacific - although the Japan/China thing could easily have gone the other way and China allied with Germany and Japan on the allied side.  Most of the western countries didn't really like the soviets and so given the choice letting the germans and soviets beat the hell out of each other seemed  like it wasn't such a bad plan.  Particularly for the US who could scavenge the remnants of the british and French empires at the end of it.  

In both cases the US was involved whether it wanted to be or not.

Then came the end of the war and the breakup of british and French Empires.  The soviets were happy to communist up any state willing to join them, which left a problem for the US.  The US needs customers and resources, and the soviets where going to eat up future customers  and supplies of resources.  If it hadn't been involved in the world it would have essentially handed most of the worlds supply of oil and rubber, and potential customers for cars and aircraft to the soviets.  That would have been problematic. 

And so it is today.  The US is big and rich,and depends on large swathes of the world to buy its cars an computers and airplanes, and other swathes of the world to make it cheap socks and sell it oil and whatever else it needs/wants.  

The relative balance of power in the world has changed too.  In 1950 the US was the third or 4th largest country (depending on how you count the Soviet union) but it only had about 3x the population of the UK or France.  Today that's more like 6.  So the relative state of the world means that the US is  proportionally much larger than it was compared to other developed powers - some of the poor countries have grown a great deal faster than the US (pakistan, bangladesh, brazil, lots  of africa), but  they are not yet capable of securing trade lanes or defending other countries.   And therein lies the problem, the US very much depends on stability in the world, so does most everyone else, but now the US is so big it pretty much has to be involved because the list of options  to do it without the US is quite limited.  Europe aims to challenge the US as a global power, while at the same time being an ally - that would let the US take on a lesser more cooperative role, but unfortunately the EU can't organize  itself out of a paper bag .  


&gt;more often than not when their presence was neither needed nor ultimately helpful.

While that was true in Iraq, round 2, that was an exception rather than a rule.  The US has been needed in a lot of conflicts, Korea, somalia, vietnam, Iraq round 1/Kuwait, Columbia, the Balkans etc.  Even if you (correctly) think the way the US handled some of those things was utter incompetence and made things worse it had legitimate interest in trying to be there.  Trying to do the right thing is a lot easier than actually doing the right thing.  

There are also lots of places the US has been needed where it hasn't gone, most notably Syria, where it appears Assad and his Iranian and Russian backers are going to win.  That lack of intervention may be based on the (probably correct) assessment that the US would just fuck it up, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have served US interests to have had the FSA take over 2 years ago.

When WWI broke out, public opinion was against getting involved in the war. European nations had been trying to destroy each other for hundreds of years, why should we spend our resources and sacrifice our young men just because they can't get along? (Not saying I agree with this argument!)

Less than 30 years later WWII breaks out. Now, WWI was really, really ugly.  At the time it was called the Great War and it shocked the conscience of the world. It's no surprise some Americans didn't want to get involved. There is even a retarded school of thought that says we shouldn't get involved because Hitler is not really that bad! If you don't believe me look up Charles Lindbergh and ""America First.""

So WWII happens, and America emerges as the premier superpower.  Europe and Japan had been brought to their knees and America was almost totally untouched.

Homeopathic remedies are solutions that have been diluted to such an extreme that they contain not a single molecule of the supposed active ingredient. Now the original homeopaths knew very little about atoms and molecules (and hence that their dilution practices are somewhat extreme), but 'modern' homeopaths have attempted to solve this by proposing 'water memory', which always reminds me of a line from [Tim Minchin's *Storm*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U): ""*[sarcastically]* Water has memory! And while it's memory of a long-lost drop of onion juice is infinite, it seems to forget all the poo it's had in it.""

AmerigoVesa,"Homeopathy was invented when what we consider to be real medicine was just getting started. Back then, most things that a ""doctor"" did for you would kill you. Homeopathy became popular because it did not hurt you, and you might get better anyway if you let things run their course. It is based on the idea that something which mimicked the symptoms of a disease could cure it. For example, if eating a certain kind of toad caused a person to break out in hives and develop a fever, that would be the thing which cured a disease that had the symptoms of fever and hives. But the new thing here was that it wasn't the thing itself that did the cure, it was the energy of the thing. That is why you had to put the thing in water, shake it a special way, then keep diluting it: the water ""remembered"" the thing, and that is what cured you. What you had left by the time all the diluting and shaking was over was basically pure water. This would ""cure"" you only in the sense that it would keep you away from a doctor long enough for a disease to run its course so maybe you could survive.

Do not confuse herbal medicine and homeopathy. While there are a lot of problems with so called herbal remedies, they are at the very least based on the idea that some active ingredient in a plant or whatever could counter act a disease. A good example of this is willow bark, which led to aspirin. Homeopathy, by its very nature can not work that way, because it has been diluted past the point where any of the original ingredient is left. ",null,1,cdm2etc,1rd99h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

Ideally, your first credit card is one that you will use every month, and will pay off entirely every month, to build credit. You don't want to incur the interest fees, so you need to pay the bill in full (this also keeps you from spending beyond your means). Also, if there is an annual fee on the card, you don't want it.

You may want to talk to your bank about a secured credit card to get you started. In this scenario, you give the bank a deposit (the security) for the card and after while  they'll give it back.  

Store credit cards are often not hard to get, but are limited to the store. For example, my first card was a Victorias Secret card with a $700 limit, which I chose because at the time I shopped there at least once every few months.

Rewards/cash back cards are my personal favorite, but may be tougher to get. These cards reward you for using them, and if you pay the card off each month, this is just free money. There are plenty of websites discussing the pros and cons of various cards. You want to choose a card that works with your spending. I chose an AmEx Blue Cash card because it pays a decent return on grocery/gas, so I use it for that. My bf who was just starting out went with a Chase Freedom card.

There are some perks to using a credit card: most credit cards will cover the accident insurance on a rental car if you use the card to pay for the rental. Also, a lot of them offer extended returns/accidental damage policies, so look into that (and this means, use the card to buy your electronics and breakables).

When you're looking for a credit card to get, look for something with no interest for the first year. That way you're not paying interest in your first year and can get used to having the card and understanding how credit works. It's NOT free money. Don't let yourself look at it like that. You have to pay for it all eventually, and it will destroy your credit if you don't. Don't just pay the minimum every month, either. Especially once the interest kicks in. Then you're just paying the interest, will never get the balance down, and you're ultimately digging yourself into a hole. Occasionally, sure. Some months suck and you can only afford the minimum. But always do your best to go higher if you leave a balance. Trust me. I ruined my amazing credit because I was poor and relied on credit cards, but then I couldn't always afford to pay them.

Don't pay an annual fee for a card. There are PLENTY of free ones out there. I've had both Chase Freedom and Chase Slate cards which are free and were interest free for the first year. I got rid of my Slate card when I paid it off, but still have the Freedom card. It accumulates points that I can redeem for tons of stuff, depending on the point balance. Personally, I like that.

It really depends on what you want. The Freedom card is great for just a credit card. You get the card plus the point system. Some cards offer different rewards, whether it's for flights or trips or what have you. I recommend going with a really basic one for your very first card, but it's up to you and what you like/need. You can often find comparison sites that'll tell you interest rates, any rewards, annual fees, etc. bankrate.com has a comparison tool, so does nerdwallet.com, and countless others. Or pick a company (Chase, Capital One, etc) and you can often look at what all of their cards offer.

TardisDyskinesia,"I guess there are two things you want to think about. The type of card and your limit. 

**Type of Card**
The standard is a Cash Rewards card. You should probably go with one that has no Annual fee. I graduated in May and got a Cash Rewards card from my bank with 1% back on all purchases. I've never heard of less than that %-age, but you can do better. I got a Costco membership and the American Express that they have gives me 3% on Gas, 2% on Restaurants, and 1% on everything else.

**Limit**
I started out with a limit of $500, but once I started getting paychecks, this was way too low. You don't want to max out your credit card, so try to get a limit that is higher than what you earn in a month, maybe twice what you earn. It's actually better for your score to use a lower percentage of your available credit, so you should probably go as high as you can. If your bank won't let you go higher, you can try to get another card.

Once you have a card, you can start putting whatever you need to on it. Keep track of your balances, make sure you don't overspend, and pay the bills every month. It's simple.

**Other tips**
I manage all of my accounts with Mint.com. It's a lot easier to log in one place and see how I'm doing financially. It also tells me when my bills are due, so it's much easier to keep track. Never miss a payment.

You can also (but was not recommended by my bank manager who I sat down with when I applied for my first card) set it up such that the CC bill is auto deducted from your checking account, essentially making it operate exactly like a debit card.  He didn't recommend it because it's a control issue, it might withdraw at a bad time of the month or withdraw an incorrect amount, or if you *are* planning on not paying the card off because of an emergency expenditure then you'll overdraw your checking account.

Usage wise use it like you would a debit card but be mindful (like when people here say use it for utilities) that you don't max it out by mistake.  For example by the time you pay for groceries, household supplies, etc you might be pushing the $400 mark in a month and when you suddenly throw in another $200-300 in utilities you'll be pushing the max.  Just be careful and work out a budget, then keep track of how much you spend.  Make a simple spreadsheet in Excel or something and when you buy something, keep the receipts somewhere and once a week tally everything up into the spreadsheet to make sure you're within budget.

Also, if you can try to find something with rewards like cash back so you can get 2-5% back on things like gas or groceries or general spending.

sir_sri,"&gt;I heard that the fabricators that Intel uses to create their processors are top secret, but is that keeping foreign companies left behind to play catch up?

Intel is basically one fabrication process ahead of everyone else in the industry, including AMD which is sort of a US company (they are based in the US, publicly traded but a major interest is owned by Abu Dhabi).  

In the history of computing equipment IBM, which has been around since before computers, was the big dog.  They bought any 'business machines' that seemed to be useful to them, including european ones.  As time went on and you had branching of the industry most of it went to US companies closely connected to IBM (not necessarily allies but competitors too).  Where IBM owned the business market Microsoft (which got its start working for IBM), and Intel made stuff for IBM computers.  Then someone came up with the idea of an IBM clone (I'm being vague that's a whole history tale unto itself) but Intel and MS took off, AMD formed to compete with Intel and Nvidia hit it big when 3DFx imploded. 

Prior to the 1960's there were some big microelectronics companies in Japan (that still exist in one way or another), as well as smaller ones in the US.  Siemens, the german megacorporation has always been involved in some ways but they seemed to leave the integrated circuit business mostly to other people.  

So that's kind of it.  IBM bought local because they could rapidly develop with other local oufits.  Taiwan particularly has picked  up a LOT of high quality manufacturing of semiconductors, but the big guys for a Long time were Intel and AMD's manufacturing (what is now Globalfoundries) which are mostly US and Europe.  The east asian stuff all came later.

Japan has always had a toe hold in the market - particularly storage, but Intel processors were so much better than anyone else that no one can compete with that market, and since Intel owns x86, well, Intel owned the computing business.  ",null,0,cdm5s6q,1rdcjg,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

TimeTravellerSmith,"From a business point of view, if they can't adapt they die.  Especially if they can't shift to the new media formats.  Newspapers would have to charge for online subscriptions but can't compete with other free online sources of news.  They end up out of business.

Same could be said of production companies for things like HD DVD vs BlueRay or VHS vs BetaMax.  Some company who ""prints"" movies ends up investing in one or the other and when a winner is declared the companies on the losing side lose on their investments and can't afford to re-tool, and thus go out of business.  With stuff becoming more and more digital this isn't really a problem anymore though.  I'm not sure how much different it is to burn an HD DVD rather than a BluRay and the other way around.

You also see it with rental companies like movie stores.  With the ability to get just about anything online via Hulu, Netflix or On Demand there is no real use for the Blockbusters of the world.  Same could be said of libraries for print media.  If you can download the ebook on your iPad or Kindle then why would you bother going to the library for borrowing a book?

From a customer point of view it's a similar story.  How would you like it if you invested several hundred dollars in a nice turntable and VCR only for them to be replaced by CD's and DVD's?  Now you can't buy vinyls and VHS tapes anymore so you re-invest in a CD/DVD player.  Ok cool, now DVD's are getting phased out for BluRay and Digital Streaming.  So *now* you need to *re-re-invest* in a BluRay player along with a computer with a good internet connection or media-box to stream online stuff.  Now that you've got all this shiny new equipment nothing uses component, composite or coaxial but instead HDMI.  Now you need to replace your perfectly functioning TV with a newer one that can support the new peripherals and to actually gain use of the HD picture.

So from a consumer perspective it's a constant tech arms race to be up to date with whatever the new supported format is and being able to actually use it.  You need to keep buying and replacing otherwise perfectly functioning hardware because now it's obsolete and you can't use it with new stuff.

From a consumer point of view this should be leveling out pretty quick.

Maybe the premise of your question is off. Is it true that we acquire a taste for the things we need? I mean, look at this list:

* Air - no taste
* Protein - no taste (Most of the flavor in meats comes from fats, blood content, etc. Pure protein powder tastes like nothing.)
* Carbs - often no taste (like refined flour)

Sibbour,"Short and sweet answer: 1) The countries aren't attractive for immigrants and 2) Anti-Immigration laws. I'm assuming that you're referring to East Asia more-so than Central Asia/Middle East. 

1) To have immigration, a country must have a higher living standard, wealth, opportunity, etc. than the country the immigrants are coming from. For many Asian countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia, Bangladesh, the -stans, etc, that isn't the case.

2) The richer countries tend to have strict immigrant laws or limited opportunities for Immigrants. Japan, while wealthy, is very racist and has strict laws against immigrants, so immigration isn't very large. China has a population issues of its own and has limited room for immigrants outside of certain cities such as Hong Kong, where immigrants are usually domestic servants. South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are similar to Hong Kong in that that immigrants don't have much opportunity beyond domestic servants (edit: This does not include already rich individuals immigrating to Singapore and other locations to avoid taxes).

That covers East Asia. If you also meant India and the Middle East ....that will require a little more explanation.  ",null,6,cdm6e15,1rdmbt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9
sir_sri,"&gt; but asian counties have stayed asian why is that?

Define 'asian'.   China has been the most populous country for several thousand years (depending on how you count india), people don't move there, people move from there.  And they have ended up in a lot of  places.  

China (well parts of it) along with Korea did have problems with Japanese 'immigrants' - in the sense that the Japanese moved in and tried to massacre people  and take over, and Japan and Russia and China clashed over territories in northern China for a while, but Japan was late to the colonization game.  

India is an artificial construct by the british (as is Pakistan and Bangladesh)- the various predecessor states had movements of people and religion and in many cases at the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.  And they had a mass migration with the partition of india that packed up a huge chuck of hindu's and muslims and shuffled them all around.  

But generally you don't immigrate to places that have a lot of people already - that sort of defeats the purpose.  Vietnam, Malaysia the Philippines etc. have all had chinese immigrants (some more recent than others) but there's not a whole lot lot of it.  

And that's kind of it.  Japan didn't really become a power capable of colonizing until the 1860's - and they invaded China and Korea (and left after WW2).  Up until 1820 or so basically the entire world except china and south east asia was under the thumb of one imperial power or another.  After the Napoleonic wars Spain lost control of central and south america, but then the Europeans started making moves on Asia - the Asian powers never really had the chance for a lot of immigration, as the europeans were usually not letting them in, and there was no where you'd want to go in south east asia - except malaysia that needed labour for tea and then rubber.  

To have migration you need to be rich enough to leave, but poor enough that you don't want to stay - and need to have somewhere that will take you.  Chinese workers and Japanese were able to move with very unpleasant restrictions in the mid 1800's but they were not really full citizens most places they could go.  Everyone else was either too poor to leave, under the thumb of a colonial power or not welcome.  And most of the time that applied to Japanese and Chinese as well.

bunker_man,"The short version is that western countries decided they need to let in more immigrants, and eastern ones didn't. In part this can be traced to America, since America was always built on immigrants flooding into it to build it up, since the times of it's creation. So western countries having a tie to America kind of internalized this ""we need immigrants"" mentality, where as other places generally still do not want too many. That, and of course after WWII, they wanted to strongly divert from anything that seemed like a racist policy.

daveisnotafk,"TFSA's and RRSP's do have similarities, and differences (I assume you're Canadian)

Let's talk about RRSP's:

RRSP stands for Registered Retirement Savings Plan. Basically, these are more or less savings funds that you set up before you retire, in hopes of creating an income stream for yourself in the future (thus by, converting it to a RRIF 'income fund'). How it works is that you are taking money out of your earnings and putting it away until you retire. Any money you put away then gets 'deducted' from how much you earn in a year. So for example, say you made $30,000 this year, and you've put $10,000 into your RRSP. The government will tax your income as if you've only made $20,000. Pretty neat huh? By doing that, you have the opportunity to put money into an investment (free of taxes), allowing it to grow (yet again, free of taxes) until you retire. Once you hit a certain age ( I believe it's 71 ), you're essentially 'too old' to maintain an RRSP, so you'd have to move your funds into what's called an RRIF (registered retirement income fund). Once you have your RRIF, you can start withdrawing the money you've saved all your life... and pay tax on those withdrawls. 

So if you can deduct so much money from your income tax, doesn't it make sense to put away .. 80% of your annual income in an RRSP so you can enjoy awesome tax breaks? Nope! Doesn't work quite like that. Every year, the government sets a limit as to how much you can put away in your RRSP. It's about ~18k-21k (double confirm with your bank, or financial advisor) CAD or up to 18% of your income. Now, not everyone can afford to put away that much money, so the money that they didn't put away the year before, carries away to the next year. So say if the limit last year was $8000, and you put away $5000; you still have $3000 limit that can carry forward to next year. If the limit next year is $9500, you can put up to $9500 plus your previous year's left over limit... total $12500. 

If it's your first time buying a home, you can take up to $10,000 from your RRSP in a program set up called the ""home buyer's plan"". It allows you to take a tax-free loan from your RRSP's as long as you pay it back within 10 years. This helps you put towards a down payment on a home for yourself. 

If you're in a bind and you need money right away, any money you take out from an RRSP will get taxed as added income. So say if you needed cash, and you took $10,000 out of your RRSP, and your annual income is $30,000; you will be taxed on $40,000 worth of income (nasty!). 

RRSP's are good because they can help you reduce your tax rate if you contribute enough. 


TFSA's

TFSA's are a new 'invention' that allows you to invest pre-taxed dollars, allowing it to grow tax-free. There's no limit as to how much you can put, because the money you put in has already been taxed.

How has the money been taxed already? Simple. When you file your annual income taxes, any income you make is subject to your marginal tax rate (the rate at which you pay taxes based on your income level). 

The government is allowing you to deposit money, and letting it grow tax free. The cool part about this is that since you've already paid your taxes, the withdrawls are tax free. 

What about the fees for managing a TFSA? Most banks have what's called ""zero load"" or.. ""no fee"" accounts that you can open. They are no fee, and also offer low interest rates. If you go with a higher end fund with another fund company, you may be charged a DSC (deferred sales charge) based on the provisioning of the fund, for a set term, before it becomes 'free'. In the sense of a bank though, it's pretty much zero fees. There's other things to consider too, such as MER's (management expense ratios) if you're going with a fund that requires a higher degree of management, but like I said, if it's at a bank, it's not likely you'll incur those expenses. 

Last thing to note, RRSP's and TFSA's are not some ""off the shelf"" product you can just go out and buy. Most people are mislead to believe that you just go ""get an RRSP"" or ""get a TFSA"". It doesn't work like that. 

RRSP's and TFSA's are merely CONTRACTS WITH RULES THAT YOU FOLLOW. A financial institution, be it a bank, or investment firm can offer RRSP or TFSA's on ANY of their funds.. be it a savings/chequing account.. a bond, a GIC, money market fund, mutual fund, ... virtually anything. 

For example: 

Person A's RRSP is based on a GIC. 
Person B's RRSP is based on a mutual fund. 

Same goes for TFSA's.

eternalfrost,"It probably would not rot in a biological sense. There would be no oxygen available, and the tomato would become freeze-dried fairly quickly in the vacuum of space. These are both conditions used in commercial food packing to prevent spoilage.

However, it would degrade rather quickly for other reasons. Space is a harsh place. Without an protective atmosphere, one half gets the full force of the sun's heat while the other is in bitter cold. This is the same sort of reason that Africa is very hot while Antarctica is very cold; but magnified to even more extreme levels. This is why most satellites are wrapped up in that shiny foil looking stuff (a space blanket). They are very good at reflecting heat. They bounce heat from the sun back away into space and bounce your own heat back in towards you; this helps keep the satellite a constant temperature instead of swinging all over the place. 

If it were spinning, it would go through severe heating and cooling cycles that would cause all sorts of physical and chemical damage. Imagine taking your tomato and putting it in the oven for an hour then the freezer for an hour; it would get destroyed quite fast.

diMario,"It is a bit different than that. In normal physics, when you don't measure something you don't know the value of whatever it was that you did not measure.

When you *do* decide to measure the value (you *observe the system*) you find one single value. You deduce that it did have that particular value all along, even at the time when you hadn't measured it yet. Furthermore, when you repeat the measurement you expect to find that exact same value, no matter how often you measure it. Within tolerances of accuracy.

In quantum physics, this is not the case. You can make measurements, and each time you measure something the outcome can be one of several possible values. The first measurement yields 3, the second and third measurement yield 7, and the fourth measurement yields 3 again. You cannot know in advance what value will be measured, only that it will be one of several distinct values that follow a certain statistical distribution.

This phenomenon is explained by assuming that before the measurement, the quantum physical system has *several different values for the same quantity at the same time*. In quantum physic speak we say that the system can be in different states at the same time. We do not know what state it is in until we make a measurement (observe the system) and as we make more measurements, we will find different values grouped according to some statistical distribution.

Now, the experiment involving Schr&amp;ouml;dingers cat says that a certain elementary particle has or has not decayed during a certain time. If it has, the cat is poisoned, if it hasn't, the cat lives. Because it is a quantum physical system, we say that the two states (decayed particle/not decayed) both exist at the same time for the system. This translates into the cat being both dead and alive at the same time prior to the measurement. Only after observing the system, one would find that the cat is either dead or alive.

Scenario_Editor,"[Wiki section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_solar_cells#Cell_temperature)

So your run of the mill solar panel works because the electrons in the silicon are separated into two layers. There is a bottom layer of electrons with the silicon itself (the valence band), a layer of no electrons (band gap) and a top layer of electrons that move around (conduction band). A photovoltaic cell works be having a photon (light particle) come in and give its energy to an electron in the lower layer so that it can jump from the inner layer over the layer of nothing and into the top layer where the electron can move around and essentially create a current. [This is also why silicon  is called a semi conductor, because it conducts in some situation and insulates in others]. 

Now, that band gap (the layer of nothing) is partially dependent on temperature. Temperature is sort of like the average energy of all the electrons, the majority of which are in the lower valence band. A higher temperature means that they will have a bit more energy and the band gap will be smaller, so you'll get more current out of your cell which is good.

 Bandgap has its fingers in many pies though, and changing the temperature is changing the bandgap. Changing the bandgap will change the highest possible voltage that the circuit can have. Higher temperatures end up having lower maximum voltages

[This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:I-V_Curve_T.png) pretty much explains what happens with temperature. Higher temperatures mean higher current and lower maximum voltage. The voltage rapidly decreases though, so you can think of it as either on or off, and so you'd generally want higher temperatures. At any rate, the effect is fairly marginal.

In someone with near/far-sightedness the focus point of that light is either in front of or behind the retina. The part that hits the retina from some direction is a small blob of light. This blob overlaps with those from nearby directions, so one spot on the retina sees light from a whole region of space, leading to blur.

But with WW2, the losing side was completely and utterly wiped out and erased from existence.

(Just to clarify, I am by NO MEANS defending nazis, simply that their annihilation makes the basic story a simple one to tell compared even to WW1)

So the basic story of WW2 is simple for school kids to understand: Hitler and the nazis try to take over the world because they are evil. The basic story of the holocaust is simple too compared to other genocides. Hitler tried to wipe out an entire race of people just because he didn't like their faces essentially. In other genocides I've studied, while the actions are no less horrific, the details are murkier. There is usually a civil war or some other huge internal upheaval in the country. There is a lot of violence and death and destruction other than the genocide, and it can be hard for observers to tell what exactly happened. The holocaust was also very coldly organised. People were singled out for a particular reason, rounded up, imprisoned, starved and murdered on a massive scale. Life was more or less as normal for the rest of the population while Jews were stripped of everything. Compare that to the Khmer Rouge which was trying to purge 'subversive elements', and essentially picked victims on random whims and slaughtered masses. People still don't really understand what happened there. 

The final reason is the nature of the victims. Jews have always lived all around the world. The trait that singled them out for murder is shared by many people in many places. In other genocides this isn't the case, the people picked are very localised, and don't really live anywhere else. How many Tutsis do you know? Or intellectual Cambodians? Or Bosniaks? How many of them are middle class Americans? Not many I'd guess. The holocaust is remembered because it was relevant to powerful groups who wanted it remembered. A genocide that happens to middle class white westerners makes more of an impact on the world than one that happens to Africans or Muslims.

Tl;dr: the holocaust was clear cut, well documented, one sided, and its victims were middle class and scattered across the world.",null,1,cdmifp8,1rdvms,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

Inside the large part of history, the enemy in WWII of the current western civilizations was committing genocide on a massive scale.  People were disposed of in mass quantities because they were seen as inferior and sub-human.  Sure, there have been many genocides throughout history, but nothing happened on the scale of the holocaust.  6 million (or more) people were exterminated because a small group of powerful people decided they shouldn't continue living.  On top of that, the Nazis couldn't get rid of the Jews quick enough, so they invented ways to kill them more quickly, cheaply, and efficiently.  Many people argue that Stalin killed more people and should be talked about more in regards to his evils, but while he may have caused more death and suffering, nothing was as systematic and deliberate than Hitler's holocaust.  The American school system probably wants to highlight the fact that so many people died because a small group came into power, under the will of the governed, and caused so much destruction.  Judging by the values a majority of Americans have of civil rights, they'd probably want to emphasize the Nazis terror in order to make it less likely to happen in the United States under our noses.",null,0,cdmdegm,1rdvms,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

Dont_RecognizeMe,"While the feeling is involved with the nervous system and thermo-receptors, the reason your body doesn't react so sevrely to colder temperatures is because of the temperature at which proteins denature.



All parts of your body have proteins, and without them, you could not function. What gives these proteins their abilities is their unique shape. Proteins are really one long chain of amino acids bent in various shapes depending on the order of the aminos. At certain extremes, pH extremes, and other situations, these proteins unwind back into their original shapes. At this point they are useless.



In most mammals, proteins much sooner when in contact with heat than with cold. The 20 degree change is enough to ruin those proteins so your body responds.

There's your intravascular space full of blood and its constituents. Then your extra vascular space which is basically everything else. When you burn your finger on the frying pan and you get that fluid filled blister, it is basically fluids from your IVS that migrates out in response to the injury. Google transudate and exudate for more info on why fluids from the IVS might seep through the blood vessels to the other side. 

The two compartments are separate. So you aren't just filled with blood. In acute inflammation for example, your white blood cells must respond to the injury or pathogen. So lets say you get a splinter  your WBCs will want to eliminate the threat. But they are in the IVS so they actually migrate to the walls of the blood vessel and squeeze out of the vessel through the cells of the vessel wall to reach the EVS. 

Now for what is between your organs. Your lungs are covered by a double layered membrane called pleura. And it's double layered so it has a potential space between the layers filled with a fluid. It's to reduce friction. To imagine how it's double layered, imagine a balloon that you blow up. Then you press on side of the balloon until you reach the other side. That's sorts how the lung bud develops. It pushes into the balloon and eventually the balloon is just a double layered membrane surrounding it. Between your lungs is the mediastinum which has its subdivisions. Basically the heart and its pericardium etc, the trachea, oesophagus, various nerves (vagus, phrenic etc) reside between your lungs. 

The GIT is a little more complicated. But it also has a similar concept like the pleura but its called the peritoneum.  Interesting fact: the peritoneum is completely closed in males but in females it just goes around the uterus and is incomplete lower down. If the peritoneum covered the entire female reproductive system, then the baby would have to bust thru that on its way out. So technically you could blow into a vagina and air would seep into the peritoneal cavity. It's not as crude as that but p there are procedure involving introducing air or fluids to check for leaks, if I'm nit wrong.

The big difference now though, is that in QM nothing is certain. Our world is now based on probabilities. What is the likeliness of finding an atom at a certain energy or a wave penetrating a barrier?

One of the key principle of QM is the uncertainty principle. The more precisely we measure one aspect of a particle (like its velocity) the less certain we can be of another aspect (like location). Think of it like this. If I want to measure the location of something, I'm have to see it. How do I see something? I shine a light on it and observe it. Now if I shine a light on a car, it won't do much to the speed of the car, will it? And my measurement of the cars location is very large, say on the order of inches. Now the flip side. I shine a light on an electron to see where it is. Well I saw it, but now the photons (particles that make up light) hit the electron and off it speeds. I no longer know it's speed. Thats because I have to measure its location to a lot more precision, say microns, so my knowledge of its speed must be larger.

Trans people are a small, stigmatized minority group that the general public doesn't understand, so even if a group of us gets together to pool our scanty resources and do something about the situation, public backlash is usually so extreme that provincial gov't will throw us under the bus to appeal to their non-trans constituents who are yapping about our ""lifestyle choices"". To government, it's win-win: we're officially covered by provincial health (so the province looks good on paper from a human rights perspective) but in practice, it's incredibly difficult to get care (so as little funding as possible actually goes towards helping us and the uneducated voters don't get their shorts in a twist). If they tried doing that to people who need dental care, the odds are 100% that they'd piss off people who were in a position to take them to the cleaners.

SamLehman617,"It's a combination of factors.  

The one with the most impact is infrastructure.  We designed the telephone system a long time ago; this was way before we had the capabilities to capture and send the same audio quality we deal with today, thus the infrastructure was designed to only handle this level of data and quality.  

On top of that, there is the ability for a phone to record audio.  Cell phones typically receive audio through a tiny hole in their framing.  As you can imagine, a tiny hole cannot record the same quality of sound as a high-end microphone.  

Lastly, there's playback.  Like the phone's microphone, the speakers are also sub-par.  If you've ever listened to music on a smart phone, you can tell the quality is obviously no where near the quality you'd get from a good sound system.  Most smartphones also don't play the audio in a phone call through the larger speaker; they play it through the even smaller speaker that's close to your ear.

With all of these factors into play, the audio quality is severely reduced.",null,1,cdme446,1re74y,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

robbak,"The quality standards for phone audio were set long ago, based on analog audio connections over thousands of miles. In order to do this efficiently, they put a limit on what range of sounds are transmitted something like from 200 Hz up to 3000 Hz. Limiting them to this range made long distance calling possible.

When we switched to digital transmission, the same sort of standards were retained. This reduced the amount of information needed to transmit the audio, getting more calls over the same, expensive data connections. 

Now, of course, this nickle-and-diming makes no sense - connections are cheap and fast. But there is still old equipment in exchanges everywhere, and some long cable runs and amplifiers will still play up if we allowed higher frequencies on them. We also are now using some higher audio frequencies for DSL internet - ADSL2 is audible if you don't have a filter! So we are stuck with poor quality audio for some time to come.

Ray229harris,"I workin a meat department so i can partly explain this question to the best of my knowledge. 

A cow is like a human. We are both pretty much bones, muscles, and fat. 

The more a muscle gets used, the tougher the meat is. So if someone was gonna eat a human, arm meat would be pretty chewy. So would leg and thigh meat. 

Since the animal's legs and neck muscles do the most work, they are the toughest/chewiest/least tender

The butt of the cow (known as the round) is the fairly cheap cause cow rumps are hard and muscly and have little fat so the meat is tougher. 

Ribeyes on the other hand come from the upper rib cage area, which does not support much of the cow's weight, so they are perfect. A little bit of fat (intramuscular fat aka marbling) and tender soft meat makes this a delicious easy to eat cut of meat.

Going the other way most things hit some people in their immune systems, and they get fought off.  The disease is weak enough as to not kill large numbers of people or not sufficiently infectious to spread fast enough, or not resilient enough to stick around in people travelling large distances.  But then one evolves that is one or all of those things, and it kills anyone that can't fight it off, and then it dies off because enough people left alive can fight it off and it can't get passed around.

With these assets they buy certain liabilities such as treasury bills (foreign and domestic), gold, and lately, mortgaged backed securities. Once purchased these become part of their balance sheet.  

The Fed has two main objectives - to stabilize interest rates and keep unemployment low.  There is debate whether any thing they can do has any effect in the short term.  However in the long term, there is evidence that they can pull off these objectives.

Your question is rather open ended and the topic is very deep, but I assume you are asking because of the the qualitative easing programs that have been going on since the start of the financial crisis.  The Fed's balance sheet has quadrupled since the beginning of the financial crisis.  This is unheard of in the history of the Fed.  The two main liabilities that have been purchased with all this printed money have been mortgaged backed securities and US treasury bills.  The reason that these two liabilities were purchased is to maintain low interest rates of US t-bill and get toxic housing assets of the balance sheet os the banks.  The reason that inflation has not exploded is because, although this money is out there in the economy, it is not being used for many everyday transactions yet.

There is much debate about what would happen if some of the liabilities default but as we have never seen an inflated Fed like we do today it is impossible to say what the actual consequences would be.  I believe not much would change and they would just print more money and buy more liabilities.

That's less than $1500/month for a single person, and just under $2500/month for a household of three.

I live in Brooklyn and have made about $800/month for the last six months while stupidly trying to save a failing company.

**How people get by:**

* Roommates. Even if you aren't poor, if you aren't *rich* you probably have roommates. If you tried to rent alone you're unlikely to find anything, even an illegal windowless basement apartment in the outer boroughs that floods when it rains, for less than $1000/month. Get three or four rent-paying adults together, and the cost per individual starts to go down. If you don't know anyone in NYC you could move in with, check Craigslist room-share ads.
* Every room can be a bedroom. My boyfriend and his roommate shared a one bedroom; my boyfriend had the bedroom, his roommate's mattress was in the kitchen, which was the only other room they had. My apartment is officially a 3 bedroom with a basement; we subdivided the basement with curtains and turned it into two more bedrooms.
* Think small. When I first got here, for $500/month I slept in a 6ftx9ft windowless room that was legally classified as a closet.
* Think alternatives to conventional apartments. A friend of mine really wanted to live in Manhattan, and not have roommates. For $650 he rents a small dorm-style room with shared bathroom and kitchen in a building otherwise mostly populated by elderly Chinese immigrants.
* A lot of artists also rent ""studio space"" that isn't legally zoned for housing, then ""secretly"" sleep there. But they have to be pretty discrete, can't have a visible bed or anything that obvious. I've known some who set up lofted ""storage space"" that hides a futon mat behind rows of paint buckets. Bathroom is down the hall, and there is no kitchen or shower, so get a hot plate and a gym membership so you can shower there.
* Forget Manhattan; the outer boroughs are much cheaper. Average commute is 45 minutes; bring a book. 
* Debt. I racked up a lot of credit card debt when I first moved here, buying stuff like food and toilet paper and my train card. Recently I went a bit further into credit card debt, sold my car, borrowed money from relatives, and finally had to cash out what little retirement savings I had.

police-ical,"Wires are a common analogy for neurons, the main cells of your brain (and the rest of your nervous system.) It's a fair comparison: neurons are long and thin, rapidly conduct electricity to carry signals, and even have a coating of insulation.

Neurons communicate with other neurons at points called synapses, where they almost but don't quite touch. Instead, one neuron sends chemicals called neurotransmitters to the next neuron; different chemicals make the next neuron more or less likely to keep the signal going.

Whereas most body cells divide to make more of themselves, neurons mostly only come from neural stem cells. By adulthood, your brain has (almost) all the cells it will ever have. As a result, you can't rely solely on making new neurons to make new memories, learn new things, change your emotions, and such.

Synapses, on the other hand, can be made or eliminated (and strengthened or weakened) throughout your entire life. This process of changing the connections between brain cells is what ""rewiring"" broadly describes. In that sense, rewiring happens anytime you learn anything, make a new memory, or even use an old memory; it happens every minute of the day. People commonly use ""rewiring"" to mean something more like ""changing my patterns of thinking or behavior in the long term,"" which is obviously a little harder than making a new memory, but still very much possible. We'd have given up on cognitive-behavioral therapy a long time ago if it weren't.

Big picture: Given that you have maybe one hundred billion neurons, each with thousands of synapses, the total number of connections is likely in the hundreds of trillions.

Anyway, what you can do in this case is to break the memory into parts, like movie clips, and in between clips, imagine a moment that is strongly positive: like locking eyes with a loved one or your puppy, so you get a little oxytocin.

MCHaker,"A credit card isn't actually a necessity, though it is usually one of the first things that come to mind when people think about credit in general. There are a lot of ways to build your credit, from paying bills on time, leasing a car or renting a home from an agency that reports to credit bureaus. As you mentioned, though, the initial step while purchasing or leasing something is usually a credit check. Another good way to build credit is to take out loans for which you have the assets/cash on hand to immediately pay back. It is good to have a somewhat substantial payment history, but you can pay them back right away (just be sure there are no early repayment fees). 

I believe you are asking why is having credit better than having no credit history at all, while assuming that if you have no credit history you are not living beyond your means and can afford what you want to purchase. The problem with that is that businesses, such as banks, have no way of knowing whether or not it is actually you that is the responsible party funding your lifestyle. Many people rely on parents or whoever for money, so giving a mortgage (for example) to someone who is perhaps relying on someone else for money (or at least can't prove a reliable track record for making payments on time) would be an irresponsible business practice and would almost surely result in financial loss. In summary, if you can afford what you want to buy, and that object is a house, buy the house out right and do not take a mortgage out. That shows that you can't afford the house, but you can afford a mortgage.

If you don't want a credit card, paying off student loans or a car loan can help build credit. Having no credit history doesn't give a creditor the idea that you don't buy things you can't afford.  Lenders for mortgages might examine your expenses to income ratio and that's going to be a clear indicator of that anyway.

Having a credit card doesn't mean that you live beyond your means.  They can provide liquidity and opportunity costs when used properly.  A BAD example is using a credit card to buy a huge TV because it's on sale--that's not helpful at all.  

But for a good example, I keep very little savings in a liquid account.  Most of my savings are in ETFs or Mutual Funds.  So that way I theoretically can earn a good return on my savings as opposed to the ridiculously low interest the banks pay.  If I have a major unplanned expense (car needs new tires?) I will usually just charge it to my card and pay it off in the same month when I get my next paycheck.  If there's a major difference in what I can come up with from my check, then I'll withdraw money from my stocks.  

Keeping a running balance on a credit card is only a good plan if it's a lower interest rate than you'd get from something like a home equity loan or some other non-revolving account.

You would not want to give it back due to things like fibrosis(scar tissue), etc. Also when you transplant a kidney you put it in a different place than where you take it(in the pelvis area). So it's not like you can just ""put it back.""

Interesting fact:  The kidney transplant center will lie for you if you want, it's something they offer you.  For example, your close relative is in need of a kidney and asks you for one.  You agree but before the surgery you have second thoughts.  So instead of having to tell your close family member ""No, I will not give you my organ"", the kidney transplant people will lie to them and say ""Sorry, your relative cannot give you your kidney because he is not a viable candidate due to genetics/some rare condition he has/compatibility/etc...""  They will make up some bullshit so that way it doesn't look like you are refusing to save your family members life, it will look like you simply were not accepted due to whatever medical guidelines.

If any of you have, please let me know. This is an interesting question!

rearviewclouds,"The short answer is no.

The longer answer is way longer than this post, but it starts something like this: 

You hit the nail on the head with one of the reasons - transplant surgery is ""major"" - there are risks involved with all elements of the surgery:   anaesthetic, the laparotomy  (i.e. it is 'open' surgery), and the surgery is technically difficult and fiddly. 

To be allowed to donate your kidney in the first place, you must be in sufficiently good renal (and otherwise) health to operate on just the one - essentially, you are pretty much perfectly healthy, just with one kidney. Thus there is no need to subject a ""healthy"" person to the risks of a major operation/anaesthetic and the challenges of post op recovery (infections, blood clots, pneumonia etc etc)  


Another big reason is that organs need a blood supply to survive, and decay starts as soon as the blood supply is lost.  In transplant surgery there are strict time limits for taking organs out of a 'donor' and being put into a 'recipient'. Sooner is better. 

After a certain time, the organs undergo irreversible changes that mean they won't be able to usefully operate, even if they were put back in another person.   Organs are put on ice until they are ready to be plugged into the donor, which limits the rate of decay of the organs, but damage from a lack of blood supply is always inevitable. (Google things like ""cold ischemic time"" and ""warm ischemic time"" for further details.)

Essentially, most of the donors are patients in ICU environments who are 'brain dead'.  They are on 'life support' which means that machines have taken over the job of keeping the airway open and providing oxygen/nutrition to the body. Blood is still pumping around their body, getting to the organs (kidneys, liver, heart, lungs etc) - but not the brain.  

So the kidneys are still alive and working, and are suitable to be put into someone else. During the transplant retrieval operation, this blood supply is cut and the organs are removed. Ultimately, the donor dies during the donation surgery. Clearly, this is a huge thing to consider for the donor's loved ones - one of the many reasons organ donation is such a complex area. 

(The other main scenario is a 'live donor' situation such as you are talking about - where the donor has an operation to retrieve the organ,  thus normal blood supply is maintained right until the operation to donate)

So... in our scenario - it would be technically possible to get your kidney back, if the person you gave it to became brain dead in an ICU type environment. 

But you would be doing fine without it.

(Organ transplantation is a huge and complex topic - this is only the beginning of the explanation. The ethical/spiritual side is also fascinating)

anubis_of_q,"Unfortunately no.  When your kidney goes into the recipient, their body immediately starts attacking it.  Doctors do some testing to help reduce the amount of damage host does to the donor kidney (HLA typing), but it doesn't check for everything, which is why transplant patients are placed on immunosuppressive medications (medications that reduces the immune system of the host). 

Those drugs are also toxic to the kidneys as well.  So its a balance between drug toxicity and immunosuppression.  Thus, the kidneys will undergo damage, and over a period of years will become dysfunctional (people with transplants do not return to normal life-expectancy, it is just temporarily elongated).  Longterm causes of mortality of people who undergo transplantation will be that they either die of the infections secondary to immunosuppression, diseases secondary to the cause of the original disease requiring the transplant, or kidney failure from drug or host damage.  

so in the end the risk of the surgery does not outweigh getting the kidney back.  You would be hardpressed to find a surgeon who would be willing to do the surgery.  

Now i do remember an article published awhile back that stated that a transplanted kidney was retransplanted into another patient who needed it (not back to the donor), because the cause of death was irrelevant to the kidney itself.  The first host also had the kidney for a short period of time. But this would be the exception rather than the rule

lmckl1,"Hey reddit. I work for organ transplant. Although it is not outside the realm of possibility for this to happen, if you were in need of a kidney you would likely receive one from another donor. There are a few points to take into consideration:

-The kidney you donated will likely be in rough shape from years of anti-rejection medications and other meds the recipient is likely on.
-How functional is your own remaining kidney? If you're fine and don't need a transplant, they are not going to do it. It is no small surgery.
-Speaking of surgery. Do you want another one. Many living kidney donors end up having complications after their donation such as large hernias under their incision site. When receiving a kidney, it is attached to your abdominal aorta, so you would have an incision site at your belt line.
-What did the recipient die from? If they died from renal failure, you probably don't want that kidney back.

I can only think of one organ donor that I've seen that has also been a recipient- but their heart was going for transplant, so that's probably why.

Fairleee,"The default position for humanity on any topic is, 'do nothing'. If there is a particular problem that needs to be tackled, you need to somehow motivate enough humans that, instead of defaulting to doing nothing, they do something. We can see this on a micro-level. I'm sure a lot of kids don't want to go to school; they'd rather stay at home (this is the 'do nothing' option). The aim is to get them to go to school, i.e., 'do something'. So, how do you do this? A combination of carrot and stick: you promise them both long and short term benefits that going to school offers (long term includes better jobs and therefore standard of living resulting from an education, short term includes seeing their friends, being offered activities that they enjoy such as music, sport or drama etc.), and have both long and short term 'punishments' in place if they don't go (missing out on education harms their future education and career prospects, repeated absence increases likelihood of social services getting involved, absence results in discipline from parents in whatever form - being grounded etc.). The end result is, the kids are motivated to go to school because doing something will yield a net positive result (both in terms of rewards and by not being punished) compared to doing nothing.

When it comes to climate change, the science is agreed that humanity is having an effect on the climate, and this effect will likely to be detrimental to humanity (of course we aren't going to destroy the planet, but we can make it far, far harder for humans to live on). But, as with anything, our default position is, 'do nothing'. So, we need politicians, business leaders, societal leaders, religious leaders etc. to take a stance, that something needs to be done, in order to motivate us to do something rather than do nothing. Unfortunately, the things we need to do are pretty hard - it would involve massive reductions in the amount of fossil fuels we use, widespread curbing of CO2 emissions by factories and vehicles, major investment in green technologies. Furthermore, we aren't likely to see the benefit from this for some time, so it is hard to motivate people with promises of future benefits without some short-term, immediate benefits. Of course the benefits will be there - less air pollution, better designed cities, disruptive technological development etc., but this is years down the line. In the meantime, there will be a cost to pay. You know how much we like to buy cheap things? Put in place carbon reduction requirements for business, and those cheap things will get a lot more expensive.

However, these issues are not insurmountable, if we have a consistent message from society's leaders that they are necessary. Unfortunately, there is entrenched opposition to this, from people who are benefitting from the status-quo and don't want to see it changed (looking at you, Big Oil). They are responsible for putting out two messages; firstly, that there is not sufficient evidence that the problem exists (which isn't true), and secondly, that the cost of it will massively outweigh the benefits. They use a number of techniques, including exploiting people's well-known propensity for conspiratorial thinking by suggesting that all academics are part of some shadowy plot designed to pull the wool over the world's eyes in order to continue receiving funding (FYI, the amount of funding that goes into climate change research is nothing compared to the oil industry's annual revenues). People who oppose the human cause of climate change don't try to disprove human-caused climate change, and don't need to - besides, they can't. But, by muddying the waters, by insisting on the need for further research, that the evidence isn't there, that models climate researchers users have some flaws, the general public does not have the education they need on climate change, and therefore there is not enough impetus to do something. Because the people aren't demanding that something be done, politicians, business leaders etc. don't need to do something. Yes, there are calls to do something by a number of groups, and some things are being done (Germany for example is massively investing in green energy), but there isn't sufficient will to carry through on a broad enough scale to make the changes that are needed.

garrettj100,"OK, if you want a visual way of looking at this problem, imagine you're starting out in a x,y grid at 0,0.  And now imagine there's a circle inscribed around the origin (0,0) with radius = 1.  That's called the *Unit Circle*.

Now, let's take it a little further.  Imagine that you've got a horizontal line going from 0,0 up toward 1,0.  That line defines a created from the angle it forms with the y-axis.

When it's at 0 degrees, then it's a horizontal line and you're not defining a triangle rather than just a horizontal line.  But as you increase that angle θ (imagine the minute hand sweeping **backwards** across a clock face) you define a triangle.

The *hypotenuse* of that triangle is the line emerging from (0.0) at angle θ.

The *adjacent* side of that triangle is the x-axis, going exactly as far to the right as the hypotenuse goes.

The *opposite* side of that triangle is a vertical line, dropping down from where the hypotenuse hits the edge of the circle.

Here's a diagram of what I'm talking about:

http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa09/Rosonet/EMAT%206690/essay2/rosonet_unitcircle2.gif

Now, it's pretty easy to see what the sine, cosine, and tangent functions do.  They calculate out the ratios between the opposite and adjacent sides relative to the hypotenuse, but in this example, the hypotenuse is conveniently stuck at exactly 1, so you can see the opposite and adjacent sides of the triangle growing and shrinking.

There's also a ""shorthand"" way to remember the values of the sine and cosine functions at important angles:

* sin(0°) = (0/4)^0.5 = 0
* sin(30°) = (1/4)^0.5 = 1/2
* sin(45°) = (2/4)^05 = 2^0.5 /2
* sin(60°) = (3/4)^0.5 = 3^0.5 /2
* sin(90°) = (4/4)^0.5 = 1

These values are part of the continuous function, sin(x):

http://i.stack.imgur.com/ghCG1.gif

________________________

* cos(0°) = (4/4)^0.5 = 1
* cos(30°) = (3/4)^0.5 = 3^0.5 /2
* cos(45°) = (2/4)^05 = 2^0.5 /2
* cos(60°) =  (1/4)^0.5 = 1/2
* cos(90°) = (0/4)^0.5 = 0

Here, for cosin(x)

http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/cos-graph_clip_image003.gif

This last image is **particularly** valuable, as it's showing the values of cos(x) as they relate to the vertical value of the triangle's *adjacent* side in the circle.  I couldn't find a corresponding image for sin(x).  If I had, it would've probably had to have the graph of sin(x) above or below (instead of to the left/right) of the circle.

________________________________


There's one last thing to keep in mind.  Often, sin, cos, and tan values aren't shown for 30°, 60°, 90°, etc...  Instead they're shown for values like π/6, π/2, or π.  Why?  Because there are two commonly used *units* for measuring angles.  The first is degrees.  But sometimes people use a unit called *radians*.  The reason they use radians?  Because radians work out such that an entire circle is 2*π radians.  Why?  Because for a unit circle, that just so happens to work out as the circumference of the full circle as well.  It's not an accident.  The idea is you can trivially determine the circumference of the arc defined by an angle by expressing it in radians.",null,10,cdmhdui,1reilz,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

Draw a right-angled triangle with the same angles at different sizes, and see how dividing sides leads to the same number.

Draw triangles with a differing angles, do the divisions of side lengths, and see that the numbers you get are the published values for Sine, Cosine and Tangent of that angle.

As a bonus, consider a right-angled triangle with two 45 degree angles, and short side length of 1. Use Pythagoras to find the hypotenuse, and derive cos, sin and tan of 45°. Then consider half of a equilateral triangle, which will be a right angled triangle with 60° and 30° angles. You can derive the ratios for both those angles for that.

Throwcrastinator,"While I would want to elaborate on the background of nuclear proliferation in Iran (Assassination of Mohammed Mosadegh, Bushehr, Natanz etc.), that would take quite a while, and frankly, I'm lazy. So lets make this quick.

&gt;1) Why are we scared of Iran's nuclear operations? Even if they create a nuclear weapon, it seems to me extremely unlikely that they will be dropping the bomb on countries? Does the world seriously consider that Iran might drop a nuke on a western country?

Well, you are right, It would be highly unlikely that Iran would even dare announce that it is creating nukes, more than actually use them. Such an announcement would only invite more sanctions, wrecking their economy, 

and as far as usage is concerned, I doubt ANY nation would want to even CONSIDER using nuclear weapons, as nuking any other country is plain suicide, and WILL warrant retaliation from either the said nation, or any of it's allies. This was the basis of the cold war, the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. (Google it if you wanna know more)

Now the point is, Iran making nuclear weapons will most definitely spark a nuclear arms race in the middle east, which is something which the P5+1 does not want. Considering the Israel-Palestine situation, and much more recently, the situation in Syria, it is safe to say that the region is unstable. If Iran were to enrich weapon grade uranium, well, chaos would ensue.

Moreover, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, or the IRGC, the national guard of Iran, has several links with Hezbollah, Hamas, Jabhat Al Nusra, and various other 'terrorist' outfits and non state actors in the regions. While nation states wouldn't bother using these weapons, the western world sees a real threat in nuclear terrorism. Iran could potentially supply these groups with weapons grade uranium and wreak havoc. 

Furthermore, Iran is setting a dangerous precedent to other countries, in possibly violating parts of the NPT, which could worry the P5.

&gt; 2) The recent nuclear deal from what I understand is to delay Iran's nuclear operations for six months in return for removing sanctions. How is this a historic deal? They will be at ""it"" again in six months. I guess I do not understand how this is beneficial in the long run. Six months seems like nothing.

It's historic because, in the years since 1979, this is the closest we have got to, in getting Iran to quit their nuclear program, and this is a much better result than the failed six party talks with North Korea. This is beneficial for both Iran and the world, because
i) Lesser economic troubles for Iran, due to the removal of sanctions
ii) Gives the P5+1 more breathing space, and of course, more time to engage in talks.

In the long run, these six months could mean more talks with Iran, which could result in better relations with Iran and the west, and seeing that diplomacy is one of the weaker departments of our current dealings with the Middle East, this could be extremely beneficial. 
With this, one could be more confident of the complete removal of sanctions on Iran, which would mean a lot to both Iran and countries (like Germany) involved in trade with Iran.

They bundled all these risky mortgages together and then sold them under the assumption that statistically the majority of the people with mortgages would be repay them and make the owner some money. Nothing illegal here, a risky investment but risks aren't illegal. What happened was that credit rating agencies started rating these bundled mortgages as AAA, meaning the safest of the safest investment which was complete bullshit. This high rating led to many individuals, retirement plans, businesses, etc all investing in these plans under the assumption that they were safe.

The smart move was to buy as much house as you could afford.  An interest-only mortgage was a minimal amount out of pocket every month.  It had a balloon payment after 5 years, but by then the price would have increased and you could sell the house, pay off the principle, and get a nice profit.

In 2008 prices stopped going up.  New home sales slowed.  Interest-only loans started to mature, but now the homes weren't worth as much as projected.  People started to default on loans, increasing the supply of homes.  House prices dropped.  Banks were more cautious about who they loaned money to.

rixross,"Banker's bundled mortgages together and sold them to investors (these were called mortgage backed securities, or MBSs). The rating agencies rated them AAA (the same rating as bonds issued by the US Government), due to the fact that each MBS has mortgages from all over the country. The models that the rating agencies used assumed that there would not be a general decline in home prices across the country. 

It's actually more complicated than that, because what the bankers really did was bundle together hundreds of mortgages and then they separated it into different securities in a process called ""traunching"". In essence the security was split into several layers, all the losses would be born by the riskiest layer first, then the second riskiest layer, then the third, etc. In order for the final layer to have any losses every single other layer would have to be wiped out. Those layers were rated AAA by the rating agencies, even if the underlying mortgages were crap (for instance if the owner of the house doesn't even have a job).

The problem was that everyone assumed these securities were safe, so banks would hold them as ""Capital"" or the cushion used to absorb possible losses. These securities turned out to be pretty much worthless, and many banks found themselves essentially bankrupt. 

There is even more to this, as AIG and other banks sold ""Credit Default Swaps"" on these traunches of mortgage. This was essentially insurance that said ""If the homeowner doesn't pay you, I will"". The sellers of this ""insurance"" had to pay up and nearly went bankrupt (or would have if the government didn't bail them out.

The question is, however, why did all this happen? Some people would blame it on greed, but that would be like blaming an airplane crash on gravity (can't claim that analogy as my own). In my opinion, it was the housing bubble that caused the crisis, as banks and potential home buyers thought that prices could never go down and therefore all the investments described above were extremely safe.

There are lots of different branches of economics, Austrian, Keynesian, Mainstream, Post-Keynesian, Chicago, Marxist, even Feminist economics, and depending on the model you use you will get a different answer to the question.


Basically banks gave people lots of loans to buy houses. The price of houses kept going up so people bought houses as an investment (i'll buy it for $10 today and sell it for $15 next year, and use the $5 I made to pay back the loans). One day the market crashed, and houses that were worth $10 one day were all the sudden worth $5. Since some people were counting on making money later from their houses (which kept going up in value) to pay back the loans, when the market crashed they couldn't pay back the loans, and all the money the banks loaned out basically disappeared. This crash which really hurt the banks eventually hurt the stock market, and then hurt the whole economy. 

That's about as simple and objective as I can make it.

Kanye West may not be the best rapper out there, but his songs sound good (to most people), and they sound good because he produced them.  He's produced lots of songs for other rappers, like Jay-Z.  

If you were more interested in the role of a rap producer in general, basically most producers will start off with either a sample of music or a general drum beat and build a song around it.  A sample is a snippet from another artist's song that is altered in a way to incorporate it into a new original song.  Take Kanye's song ""Gold Digger,"" he started with a sample of Ray Charles's ""I Got a Woman"" and incorporated it into the song by looping it and laying it over a beat.  He created the drum beat in a similar fashion, using sampled drum sounds, but he likely didn't sample those himself.  Many producers can buy large batches of drum sounds as well as other instrument sounds from independent sample libraries.  If you gave 100 music producers the same sample from Ray Charles ""I Got a Woman,"" they may end up making 100 very different songs, of which, chances are, you'd end up liking Kanye West's the most.  Just like giving 100 chefs the same ingredients, chances are the best chef will create the tastiest meal.

In the context of electronic music, pop music and rap music - a producer's role is far greater: often develops beats, layering sounds, playing instruments or even *writing the song*. 

Look at someone like Deadmau5. When he's in the studio, he is not a DJ. He's not playing records, he's *making* records. He's writing songs from scratch, mixing, mastering, creating sounds, playing synths, programming drum machines and rhythms, recording, etc, etc. He's a *producer* in the studio, but a DJ on the stage. 

Kanye is similar. His ability to mix, master and engineer sound is highly technical and impressive.

The gas station across the street that is a few pennies more isn't necessarily trying to make more money from their fuel, they simply may have purchased their fuel at a price that necessitates the resale price at what you see at the pump. 

Gas stations do not change their price of fuel based on market fluctuations, they change their price of fuel based on market fluctuations that are passed along to them when they fill their in ground tanks so they can't make adjustments to fluctuations until the next time they buy fuel. If fuel dropped ten cents in the last week, they may be able to skim a few pennies per gallon off the top but they still need to charge at least what they paid for the fuel to recoup costs until the next fill up at which time they would pay a much lower price and then pass that savings along to you. 

Contrary to public opinion, higher gas prices actually lead to less profit for gas station owners. As prices rise, consumers become more scrutinizing of prices at competing stations than they normally would so station owners have to cut prices to compete with each other leading to smaller profit margins per gallon than they would otherwise see.

Most of the SNMP systems I've dealt with were more for monitoring and graphing trends, and alerting when thresholds were hit on the system(s) being monitored. 


Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an ""Internet-standard protocol for managing devices on IP networks"". Devices that typically support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and more. It is used mostly in network management systems to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.

SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications.",null,0,cdmpdrc,1rf4qo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

OrangeCrack,"There are many different methods for dating things and usually more than one is required before scientist will confidently declare that they are certain that the age of something is within a specific range. (Don't read past here if you are happy with the tl;dr version)

Here is a list of different dating methods:

Absolute methods

Absolute dating methods rely on using some physical property of an object or sample to calculate its age. Examples are:

Radiocarbon dating - for dating organic materials

Dendrochronology - for dating trees, and objects made from wood, but also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates

Thermoluminescence dating - for dating inorganic material including ceramics

Optically stimulated luminescence or optical dating for archaeological applications

Potassium–argon dating - for dating fossilized hominid remains

Numismatics - many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record

Archaeomagnetic dating - Clay lined fire hearths take on a magnetic moment pointing to the North Pole each time they are fired and then cool. The position of the North Pole for the last time the fire hearth was used can be determined and compared to charts of known locations and dates

Lead Corrosion Dating.

Amino acid dating

Obsidian hydration dating - a geochemical method of determining age in either absolute or relative terms of an artifact made of obsidian
Rehydroxylation dating - for dating ceramic materials

Relative methods

Relative or indirect methods tend to use associations built from the archaeological body of knowledge. An example is seriation. Ultimately, relative dating relies on tying into absolute dating with reference to the present. One example of this is dendrochronology which uses a process of tying floating chronologies of tree rings together by cross referencing a body of work.

In practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of stratigraphic relationships.

Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers

Paleomagnetism: the polarity of the Earth changes at a knowable rate. This polarity is stored within rocks; through this the rock can be dated.
Tephrochronology: volcanic ash has its own signature for each eruption. In a sedimentary sequence the associated material within the ash layer can be dated, giving a date for the eruption. If this ash is found anywhere else in the world, a date will already be known (bearing in mind transportation time).

Oxygen isotope chronostratigraphy: this is based on the climatic stages displayed in SPECMAP relating to different cold and warm stages experienced in deep time; for example, point 5.5 in the SPECMAP chronology describes the peak of the last interglacial 125,000 years ago.

Colbolt,"There are lots of methods to date fossils but the two main ones are radiometric dating and carbon dating. Carbon dating is only useful for carbon based objects such as shells or trees and can only be used to date objects up to 50,000 years due to it's half life. Carbon dating uses C14 isotopes, half life is the time taken for the isotopes to decay, we can work out the remaining amount of C14 isotopes left thus giving the age.

Radiometric dating is mainly for fossils because it's very accurate and can date objects that are millions of years old due to it's half life. I believe it uses U/Pb isotope ratios due to their massive half life and U can be vary common is bodies of rocks.

I believe dating water uses 016/18 isotope ratios and these can be correlated to various events.

A civil war in some other part of the world arguably *should* be of more interest to the general public, but hearing about some local issue which could affect them gets higher ratings.  

So, a lot of news focuses on local issues, rather than global ones and tackles shallow issues or gore, which attract attention and viewers.  More viewers equals more money, which keep the networks going.

sir_sri,"Print Journalism is being eviscerated by bloggers and web savvy amateurs who can put stuff out faster if not more accurately.  This is not entirely bad - journalists don't know a lot about most topics and bloggers who are actual experts and don't try and reduce concepts to a 6th grade level end up being better than journalists on the whole.

But as was pointed out, journalism in TV/Radio etc. is much different.  For several centuries almost all journalism was Print.  Then along come radio and TV.  TV journalism worked well in the past because it was necessarily condensed and there were rules about 'fairness' in the US or the BBC in the UK.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine  is a summary of the US rules.

BBC still exists and it still going - as an arms length government agency it goes through periods of bias but ultimately they succeed because they first and foremost must report the truth, or parliament will rake them over the coals.  

The end of Fairness doctrine in the US has meant that rather than neutral independent journalists news now can have activists and advocates and pundits.  These are  people who present opinions in the style of a journalist.  

Where BBC can send people all around the world to do serious stories about countries americans  never heard of the big 24 hour US cable news networks aren't going to spend money on that.  They're chasing money, so 2-3 hours a day worth of news got spread into 24 hours of repetition and filler.  

Enter the Internet.  The internet undercut everything about journalism.   Traditional print media, which tries to sell ads on print and basically distilled news into a once every 24 hours or once a week type segments was crushed by instant reporting and experts (and non experts) who would weigh in on any topic for free.  Sort of like reddit. 

Big cable news networks have agreements with huge masses of local stations, but they're all too slow for the internet.  Packing equipment into a van and driving somewhere can take an hour, on the internet the first vulture gets the best meat, meaning a citizen journalist with a cell phone camera is going to win.   

The internet also provides essentially unlimited space for all manner of ideas - even things that are complete nonsense.  There's no way to enforce any sort of quality standards on the internet.

Real journalism takes time, not always very much, but in an era of instant gratification 24 hour news filling air time with speculation and babble, and the internet rapidly undercutting print the opportunities for serious journalism as a paid profession are seriously weakened.  Some of that is good quite honestly - being able to collect and organize actually serious experts on topics who can say serious things is a huge boon to humanity, adding a journalist filter to that made everyone worse off.  But most of the time you need journalists to figure out who the actual experts are, and to do serious reporting on serious issues, unfortunately that isn't as good for the bottom line as screaming stupid people filling air time.

lumpy_potato,"Part of the problem is that there are many different types of journalism. 

The older forms of journalism - long form journalism like Gay Talese, Tom Wolfe, Capote, etc. are harder to get into. The atlantic or Harpers or the New Yorker don't have the same reach they do today as they used to before the internet was ubiquitous. Getting published is hard because you have a smaller number of such publications, and fewer people willing to read an entire long-essay or book to get what they could get from USA Today in 800 words. 

Furthermore, what people look for in news has changed - news articles have to be fast in order to keep up in the internet era, so artistic or descriptive investigations are replaced by fast releases with skimmed details and quick-and-dirty pieces.

This is not to say that all articles are like this, but if you look at the media scramble that happens after any major disaster, you can see that the type of 'journalism' that most people see is very slap-dash. Print now fix later kind of stuff, which for someone really interested in Journalism is a big turn off. So now you want to write news articles, but not *that kind* of news article, which puts you at a disadvantage because *someone else will do it*.

That said, where long-form journalism doesn't see the distribution it used to, now there are new forms of journalism - technology writers, game writing, independent blogs, video journalism, live streamers - many of whom are taking advantage of new technologies to provide a different kind of 'news.'

the hard part is monetizing this - its not easy to make money on articles in the internet era. Ad clicks are not guaranteed, and paid ad space only comes with a certain level of readership that is not easy to come across. A newspaper could be run with an editor, a few writers, and a few people to help distribute. You didn't need to shell out thousands of dollars to web developers and engineers and network administrators to keep a website running with large amounts of viewers.

(1).  Copyright violation

In the case of copyright, the quick and dirty rule is that ideas cannot be copyrighted.  The idea of a game where you get points through a rotating ""it"" player deciding what the best answer to a given card was from a selection of cards in their hand, probably is not copyrightable.

CAH would have to be taking either the language from the cards, or some copyrighted language from the rulebook for Apples to Apples, for a copyright suit to fly.

Trademark is all about identification to the public.  There's some interesting stuff about the strength of a trademark, but we'll focus on the things that would make a trademark suit untenable here.

First, a trademark can only cover a specific thing.  I can cover an emblem, or a name, but it can't cover a general category of emblems or names.

afcagroo,"At the lowest level (almost), it runs due to the actions of transistors. Transistors in digital logic circuits are used mostly as switches. You want the transistors to be either all the way OFF (no current flow) or all the way ON (lots of current flow). And you can use the output of one transistor to control the input of other transistors, so you can construct a complicated circuit by wiring them up in certain ways.  

Using just a few transistors, you can build very simple logic circuits to implement binary digital logic (called ""Boolean"" logic after the guy who invented it).   
  
For example, imagine a light bulb hooked up to a battery through a switch. Switch on, light on; switch off, light off. Now imagine that there are two switches in a row, A and B. The light is only on if A and B are both in the on position. This is what a digital logic AND gate does! If you hook the switches up differently, you can just as easily make an OR gate (A OR B turns on the light). Label a switch backwards and you have a NOT gate.  
  
It turns out that you can build any digital logic function with a combination of just a few simple circuit types, such as AND/OR/NOT (you can actually do everything with just one, but no one really does that). By combining those simple circuits, more complicated circuits can be made (such as an adder, a multiplexer, etc.). You can use those circuits to make even more complicated ones. Like a CPU.  

It's like if you had a bunch of little Lego blocks, and you could use those to make larger Lego blocks, and you could then use those to make even larger Lego blocks, and so on. Today's integrated circuits use more than a billion transistors to make something that is very complex, but it is built up out of very simple things. Transistors are great for building these things because they are small, fast, reliable, cheap, and don't use a lot of power. These are all important properties when you are trying to make something that uses a billion or more devices.  
  
After you've built a bunch of different chips and put them into ""packages"", you solder those packages onto a Printed Circuit Board (such as a PC motherboard). The PCB has copper traces on it that act like flat wires to connect things together. (It is cheaper, simpler, better performance, and more reliable to use a PCB to do this rather than a bunch of individual wires.) It even has many layers, and connection vias going between layers or clear to the other side of the PCB. So now you can connect up different chips that do different functions, like CPU, memory, graphics, etc.  

They ""talk"" to each other via the traces on the PCB according to certain pre-determined rules, called ""protocols"". Kind of like the circuits, these protocols are built up in layers, with the lowest level protocol defining what signals mean ""0"" and what signals mean ""1"". These protocols get pretty complicated, and allow the different components to pass very complex information back and forth.   

The different parts of the PC have different functions, with the CPU acting kind of as the main brain and control center. It gets program instructions and data sent from the hard disc to the memory and then to it, manipulates the data as dictated by the stream of instructions, and sends data out to where it is needed. But the CPU does what it does according to the digital logic that has been built into it. 
  
  
  
Now that everything can pass binary information around and do things with it, what remains are ways to represent information, and describing how to do things to it. The latter is where programming comes into the picture...programs describe, eventually at the binary level, how to manipulate information that is in digital form.

mkautzm,"It's a lot, a lot, a lot of complicated steps.

So in Computer Science, there is this concept called 'abstraction', which is basically saying, 'you can ignore the details of how stuff under you works, and just know it works'.

By posting on Reddit, you are engaging in this because you don't really know how a computer goes from binary (1s and 0s) to a full, feature rich website.  And that's OK.  You don't have to know.  You just need to know that typing stuff in a box and hitting 'post' makes text show up.  That's abstraction.

So, it's well known that computers speak natively only in 1s and 0s, which would more accurately be described as a switch (on and off) instead of a 1 or a 0, but that's splitting hairs.  Know that each 1 or 0 is a 'bit' of data

So if your entire number system included just 1 and 0, how would you represent 2?  how about 20?  200?  What about the letter 'a'?  The long story really, really short is we ended up the byte system, and while bytes have historically been made up of 16, 14, 12 and 32 bits, today, they are almost universally always 8.

So a byte (8 bits of data) representing the value of '0' would look like this:  00000000.  '1' would look like this: 00000001.  '2' would look like so:  00000010.  And 3':  00000011.  And so on...

So, a byte being 8 bits gives us room to express 256 different *things*, and this is the foundation of basically everything.  A really common system to represent different *things* is ASCII.  In ASCII, each value represents a character and a complete table can be found here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters

----

A small aside here.  A lot of older games, especially NES games had a bunch of items that only every went up to 255.  This because it was stored as single byte in memory (or an 8 bit variable.  It's the same thing).  0 to 255 makes up the whole 256 values you can have, and going any higher is impossible.  That's the significance of that number.  

In more modern games, when numbers are really buggy, you might see a number like 4,294,967,295 or -4,294,967,295.  That's the upper and lower bounds of a 32-bit variable, so when you see whacky numbers around that, it's usually a result of an overflow error of some kind.

----

ASCII is about the 4th layer up from pure hardware in the really thick, onion that is computing.  Eventually, you develop programs where we say, 'Hey, the first 2 bytes of this document are going to represent what color shit is going to be!' and then we can say, 'Hey!  The first 6 bytes of this file is going to describe the font size, the color, and the distance between new lines!'.

This happens over and over again, adding new layers of complexity over the next 40 years, and we eventually end up with the shitstorm that is what we have today, and it's all possible because of abstraction.

Programmers generally don't know shit about computer hardware, because they don't need to.  You generally only know as little as you need to about your domain because knowing about every layer of computing simply isn't possible.  Hell, they generally don't know much about the specific layer they are working on.  I'm a .NET developer and I can tell you fuckall about how memory is managed in a computer, outside of the very basics of it because I don't have to worry about it.  Or if I want to generate a random number, I just say Random.Next(0, 100) and I know I'll get a number between 0 and 100.  I have no idea what is actually happening to get that number though.

Abstraction.  It's fuckin great.

mredding,"/u/afcagroo has the best answer here, but I just wanted to add that to be clear, a computer has no concept of a zero or a one, this is just an analogy for the flow of current or the lack thereof.

Computer programmers and computer scientists are less interested in talking about the flow of electricty or not, and it's too hard to be that pedantic.

We use the idea of zero and one for more than the flow of electricty or not, we use it to refer to a transistor emitting current or not, whether capicators (fundimental electrical components most often used to physically construct RAM) hold a charge or not, magnetic media (hard drives) being north or south pole, and more... All these things can be spoken of as either a zero or one, and what's physically going on is hardly the point when we discuss computation.

captainskybeard,"It starts with the CPU. At this point, the ""logic"" is still hardware based - very tiny physical circuits that can transform data in a very basic way - multiply or add and subtract, for example.

The ""language"" the CPU speaks is a little different for each family of CPU. For example, it's different between 32 and 64 bit CPUs, mobile vs desktop, etc.

A computer program at its most basic level is said to be in assembly language, the language of the CPU. This is very difficult to read for humans. It is a series of these simple instructions we talked about earlier. Yet, every single application, game, and kind of program eventually boils down to assembly language.

We make assembly language by taking a high level programming language and running through a compiler. A compiler is nothing more than a very complex translator - translating from high level coding to machine instructions (assembly). A high level programming language like c++ for example, will be readable by humans and use things like if/else constructors, for loops, etc.

These are layers of abstraction. They go up yet higher, you can have a very high level language like Python for example, that deals even less with the low level system.

Really the highest level of abstraction is the user interface, with a GUI being the ultimate level of abstraction.

dts316,"At very bottom, like others have mentioned, you have circuit board with transistors with ""0"" as OFF (low current) or ""1"" as ON (high current).  Using this as a building block 0001 could represent numeric value of ""1"".
This is what CPU or machine understands, and hence machine language.

All CPU's come with set of instructions in the form of architect's machine code (machine language).  For example, set of instructions might consist of: 0001 as ""1"", 0010 as ""2"", 0011 as ""3"" and 1100 as ""+"" (addition) then 1100 0001 0010 would translate to ""add"" ""1"" and ""2"".  Which would output 0011, value of ""3"". 

However, this becomes unbelievably unreadable as you try to program more sophisticated programs.  So, low-level languages came.  Think, ""Assembly"" in early days of computer programming.  It's close to machine language but it bridges machine language with human readability by using mnemonic codes.  For example, instead of writing 1100 for addition you simply type ""add"".  And when Assembly language ""assembles"" it translates the word ""add"" to 1100 for you.  Now you have ""add 0001 0010"".  Low-level languages have whole set of operations.  I can explain more about different operations and symbols but I believe it would be beyond the scope of this. 

So, using the assembly or other low-level languages to bridge between machine and human readability, Operating Systems are made.  Microsoft Windows uses some assembly language for very low-level programming and C/C++ for higher level.  Once you have OS running you can begin programming in higher-level programming, such as C/C++ or Java, for more sophisticated programs like web browser or microsoft word.

Most feral bees from the American SW south, and in the southern half of Florida are Africanized bees. Beekeepers keep them and local people have learned to deal with their unique behaviors. There are feral hives of Africianzed bees in central Miami, being 30ft up in a palm tree until someone goes over and kicks the tree repeatedly they aren't a problem. 

Africainzed bees are the same species as European honeybees just a different subspecies. Without lab tests they are indistinguishable from European bees. And since they breed freely with European bees our Europeans bees have almost all picked up African traits. 
The Africanized bees are more defensive not more aggressive. They defend the hive with more bees and are more likely to follow an attacker a longer distance once aroused. They also tend to nest in places that Europeans won't which causes more disturbances. European bees like tree cavities. Africanized ones will nest in the ground, like in the water meter, they will nest in electrical transformers or any cavity big enough to hold them with a small entrance. This means that people are more likely to find them, and accidentally disturb them than European bees. Imagine being an electrical worker in a cherry picker opening an box on a pole and finding a nest of bees. It doesn't really matter if they are Africanized or not if you cant get away. But its more likely he will find Africanized ones in an unexpected place like that.

Africanized bees also tend to swarm more. This means they form new hives more often and maintain smaller hives making the possible nesting locations larger. They are also willing to abscond, just pickup and leave a bad nest site and relocate, so it is more likely that they are found in an unusual place they just moved into.

(1).  Many crimes exist at both the state and federal level (most forms of fraud, arson, extortion, bribery, kidnapping).  So, if I engage in fraud in Colorado, I could be charged with violating both the state law against fraud, *and* the federal law.

(2).  There are also many crimes which exist only on the state level.  There is no federal law which governs (for instance) murder or rape if done within a state.  Both of those apply only to crimes within ""the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.""  So, if I commit murder in Colorado, there is no federal law I could be charged with.

This new definition was used to establish Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). And this is the time most clocks and computers try to sync to. As the new second definition is not in sync with the Earth rotation, it happens that the UTC clocks and the solar clocks get slowly different readings.

barryspencer,"Well, it's difficult for me to explain what a migraine is without violating the ELI5 rule that we aren't supposed to express an opinion or argue a point of view. Trouble is, I'm the only person with my view of migraine.

My view: migraine is caffeine withdrawal headache.

Migraine / caffeine withdrawal headache is caused by adaptation to caffeine followed by abrupt withdrawal from caffeine. 

Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors. The nervous system adapts to caffeine by becoming more sensitive to adenosine. When caffeine is abruptly withdrawn, the caffeine-adapted person is left excessively sensitive to adenosine, and as a result the adenosine system malfunctions. Excessive adenosine receptor activation causes the headache and other symptoms of migraine / caffeine withdrawal headache.

Adenosine is a neurochemical that performs many functions. It dilates blood vessels in the head and neck. It also causes pain peripherally (outside the central nervous system): a tiny drop of adenosine placed on the skin causes a red spot (due to vascular dilation) and localized pain.

What causes migraine-related photophobia and phonophobia:

Adenosine is released from neurons (nerve cells). The major sensory apparatus of the head (retinas, olfactory bulbs, vestibular apparatus and semicircular canals, lips, dorsal surface of the tongue, and tooth pulp) contain dense concentrations of sensory neurons. During a migraine, those densely-packed neurons emit adenosine. Excessive intercellular (between cells) adenosine causes sensory neurons to malfunction. That's what causes the sensory disturbances associated with migraine.

A migraine doesn't ""achieve"" anything. The human nervous system resists plant toxins by various methods including neurochemically adapting to a toxin best it can. Caffeine is a plant alkaloid neurotoxin some plants make because it interferes with the normal functioning of the nervous systems of insects and thereby protects the plant by inhibiting the ability of insects to eat the plant. Humans who consume caffeine adapt to caffeine by becoming more sensitive to adenosine. That adaptation allows us to function fairly normally despite the interfering presence of caffeine. Unfortunately that same adaptation also renders us susceptible to withdrawal symptoms when caffeine is abruptly withdrawn. Nearly everybody uses caffeine, a headache-causing drug. Not surprisingly, therefore, humankind is plagued by headaches called primary headaches, including the severe headaches called migraines.",null,0,cdmurnf,1rfc7z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

Once they have 8z they will convert it back to x and end up with 1 + 2/6 = 1.333x.

thepatman,"&gt; it seems to me overkill that police officers use handguns with high capacity clips, while being trained to ""aim for center mass"" in order to quickly kill their opponent.

Let's correct this misunderstanding first: police officers do not 'shoot to kill' - they shoot to eliminate the threat.  

Your scenario starts with a misunderstanding of technology and the applicability of less-than-lethal(LTL) force.  First, most LTL options aren't disabling - which means that the threat still remains.  A person who is pepper-sprayed or maced still has their weapon, and can still fire with good accuracy.  Tasers **may be** disabling, but also may not be.  Often, people can take two or three shots from a taser and can still function.

For nearly all LTL methods, the deploying person must be quite close.  Pepper spray, mace and batons all require the officer to be within three to six feet of their opponent to deploy.  That's far too close for comfort when the other person has a gun.

Police officers are(usually) cleared to shoot when the subject displays the ability to use deadly force(gun, knife, et cetera) **and** the intention to use it.  Once someone with a gun indicates they're going to use it, by pointing it at the officer, reaching for it, or whatever, the officer isn't taking a chance that pepper spray or a taser are going to disable him.  They need to use the fastest, most effective disabling weapon - a gun.  It is far, far more likely that the gun will disable him than anything else.

But when they fire a gun, when they pull a trigger, the mentality has to be ""I am trying to kill someone"". Why? Because pulling a trigger is the ultimate extreme measure. It is absolutely not to be taken lightly. You don't shoot a gun to disarm a person, or scare someone, or hurt them ""just a bit"". Guns are lethal, and they should be thought of as such. And avoided whenever possible.

Now, as to why we're seeing a lot of reports of police shooting people (sometimes excessively), well, there are a few factors to that. 

First, there's the whole thing where the news isn't going to report ""Police today did not shoot a suspect"". I'm pretty sure there are dozens of non-lethal police interactions a day. Or hour. Or minute, depending on where you live. I read the police blotter for where I live and there's occasionally a chase, but that's it (and yes, I am in the US).  

Second, yeah, there does seem to be a rise in the ""shoot first, ask questions later"" mentality. 

But the thing about that is, being a police officer is *dangerous*. If they go into a dangerous situation, they're going to react to it that way and be ready to defend themselves. I don't know that we want to send police into those kind of situations and train them that it's better for them to get killed by a maniac than to shoot someone they perceive as a threat. And police officers probably feel threatened a *lot*.

I'm no expert, but one argument I have frequently heard against wider use of non-lethal defenses, is that cops who have tasers &amp; pepper spray tend to over-do it, perhaps not giving those weapons due respect because they're not viewed as ""lethal.""  However, I don't think I've ever heard that argument posited from the point of view of *replacing* guns with tasers, only in the context of what has actually happened when cops carry them *in addition to firearms.*  Personally, I think police would take their tasers more seriously if they are trained with the perspective that the taser (or pepper spray or whatever) *is* their gun, and should be respected like a gun.

The physical part, which would be considered withdrawal, is bad. But if you don't have a psychological reason to want to do something than you will not want to start back up.

For example, I was on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs for a year and quitting was difficult, withdrawal was a bitch. But I don't have cravings for these drugs as they don't create psychological rewards for me personally (although anti-anxiety drugs like benzos can be extremely addicting).

RjoTTU-bio,"Yes, you can quantify addictive chemicals based on how the alter your brain chemistry.

Iirc cigarettes target the reward centers of your brain, so cessation of smoking will cause jitters, anxiety, frustration, and other manifestations from lack of nicotine (the addictive chemical in cigarettes). 

For long term heavy drug users (such as alcoholics/heroine addicts) you form a physical dependency to the drug. Basically, your body gets used to having the chemical compound in the blood and tissues, and reaches homeostasis (a natural balance) with the chemical and your body systems. This is when you lose enjoyment of the drug and just use it to not feel terrible. Withdrawal symptoms occur when you use a drug for a long time, your body gets used to the drug, then your remove it. 

Picture it this way. Lets just say in general drugs turn on or turn off parts of your body. When you take the drug for a long time, parts of your body are turned off or on (such as opiates and pain receptors). When you remove the drug, the part that was previously turned off turns back on (and even can turn ""hyper""-on) and the parts that were turned on can turn off. It throws your entire body into a frenzy and you get very sick. 


**Edit:** I should also mention that over the a long period of time, your body gets better at breaking down drugs. For example, when people have a high tolerance for alcohol, it just means that certain enzymes in their liver have become very efficient at processing this chemical.

That doesn't mean they need slightly enriched uranium (they don't really need enriched uranium at all), that doesn't mean they need plutonium etc.  Which would be for nuclear weapons.  But of course they need those too, as Israel has them, Pakistan has them and appears to have an agreement to sell them to Saudi (saudi being an enemy of Iran) and the US has them.

Japan has about 127 million people, so it's a fair bit bigger than Iran, but they have turned off ALL of their nuclear power.  That has made them post their first trade deficit in 28 years.  Oil and Natural gas are expensive, Iran is better to have some nuclear power and sell more of those to everyone else.  

The thing with nuclear power is that it has a long deep and complex pipeline to get going, along with the political squabbling.  Iran is going to want wind power and solar power too. But no one is going to complain about that, so they can go and buy those things the moment they're ready.

The ELI5 answer is that two things are going on: the people with illegal jobs are settling their disputes the only way you can when you can't sue someone or call the cops (the first book I mentioned), and the people with legal jobs are suffering from PTSD and other stress-related breakdowns (the second book).

**Illegal dispute settlement:** Let's say that a friend or business partner or a family member of yours gets shot, or robbed, and you think you know who did it. The problem is, you can't go to the cops, because the reason you know is that you're involved in some illegal business, because that's the only job you can get that pays enough to feed your kids, whether it's doing illegal oil changes in the alley or pimping or running an uninspected, unlicensed catering firm or dealing drugs, and if the cops investigate your story, you're going to jail and your kids starve. So what are you going to do, let the guy who did this to your friend get away with it?

**Breakdowns:** Even the people who do have legal jobs are working way more hours than you can imagine, at jobs that don't pay enough to afford transportation, let alone health care or child care. As were their parents, which means that they're doing this despite having had to raise themselves. They and their families have also typically had to spend at least some time couch surfing, which means leaving their kids with lots of unfamiliar adults, which means that disproportionately large numbers of them were molested, raped, and/or tortured as children. Probably somewhere between a third and half of the working poor in America have PTSD or an even more severe mental disorder, for which they cannot obtain any legal treatment at all. The only treatment available to them, if they pursue even that much, is to try to treat their own symptoms with illegal narcotics, and that never goes well, and exposes their kids to even more risk, making the next generation's PTSD even worse. There is basically no way to raise healthy children in a working poor environment, not without at least some help from people who are much luckier in their circumstances and a lot of luck yourself.

BrooklynLaw,"When the United States was made, there was a lot of differences between the states, as there still is today.  So in order to preserve those differences, the Constitution made a list of things that would be controlled on a federal (national) basis, and let the states make up the rules for everything else. The federal government is, in theory, a limited government, with all of its powers spelled out in the Constitution.  Any power not described in the Constitution is reserved to the states.  

For instance, the Constitution says that the federal government can declare war against another country.  Alabama cannot declare war because this ability is specifically given to the federal government under the Constitution.  Conversely, the Constitution does not list, in the powers of the federal government, the ability to generally police the population for crimes.  This is why you have 50 different rape laws and no federal definition of rape.  Alabama may have a different age of consent than what Maine wants.  There are tons of differences, but the fact that the federal government cannot do whatever it wants is the reason why there are 50 state constitutions with state legislatures making different laws.  This is also the reason why some federal laws are occasionally declared ""unconstitutional,"" because the Constitution specifically limits Congress's power to make laws in certain areas.  

The preservation of limited federal powers to the benefit of the states is to make the states experimental labs for different policies.  New York has much harsher gun laws than Florida, and policy makers can look at the results of those different laws in deciding how to move forward.  

The wikipedia article is very focused on the specific cases that expanded and contracted the dual federalism principle, and this could be confusing.  But all you need to know is that the Constitution spells out the federal government's legislative powers, which are limited, and anything not spelled out in the Constitution could then be legislated by the states or the people.  One more thing, the supremacy clause is important because it says that federal laws trump state or local laws.  So in areas where the federal government can legislate, if a state makes a conflicting law, the federal law trumps the state law.  A state is allowed to make supplementary laws that go beyond what a federal law says so long as it is not in conflict.  For instance, the United States congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect certain minority groups.  Many states have their own civil rights laws that mirror the federal law, but also include additional protected groups.  This is fine so long as it doesn't conflict with a federal law or the constitution.  

If you have more questions about the actual cases in the Wikipedia article let me know.  The cases are pretty interesting in learning how we got from a very, very limited government to a much less limited one today, but if you are just interested in the basic concepts, the article could definitely be confusing.

_watching,"One thing to remember OP is that SCOTUS cases aren't always that simple. The justices don't work by going, ""does this fit what the party says is our political agenda? Welp I'm voting such and such a way then.""

How a justice decides is generally informed by their interpretation of the Constitution. You can read the opinions of justices on cases to see how they interpret it.

Generally speaking, as I understand it but don't my word for it please read up on your own on this, justices either have a ""strict constructionist"" interpretation (a restricted reading, basically 'go by exactly what the paper says') or a more loose interpretation that tries to find intent behind the document.

Of course, one could say one interpetation is more liberal or conservative, and this is what the president will care about when appointing a justice - does their interpretation back up my politics?

Of course, this interpretation business is heavily influenced by personal beliefs that also form political beliefs. I just want to point out this stuff. It's not like the justices are political entities like Congress members are. For instance, Scalia is very conservative, but was a fierce defender of video games as free speech. 

This is really rambly...

BrooklynLaw,"Generally, ""conservative"" opinions limit the federal government's power while ""liberal"" opinions expand the power of the federal government.  ""Conservative"" opinions interpret the Constitution literally and derive meaning by looking at the intent of the people that wrote it.  ""Liberal"" opinions generally treat the Constitution as more of a living document with a meaning that changes as the country changes.  

The Obamacare decision is a good example.  The question was whether the government had the constitutional authority to enact and implement the federal regulation of the national healthcare system.  The decision, which upheld the bulk of Obamacare, was seen by some as an expansion of the traditional role of government, and was thus considered a ""liberal"" decision.  Another example, the District of Columbia vs. Heller case, looked at the extent of the federal government's power to regulate private gun ownership.  The court found that the existing gun laws were beyond what the constitution allowed, and thus reigned in the power of the government.  In determining what the Second Amendment meant, they looked to what the founding fathers understood the Second Amendment to mean at the time they wrote it.  This decision was widely seen as a ""conservative"" decision.  

There are many exceptions, like the case Gonzales v. Raich, which dealt with the federal government's regulation of private marijuana production.  The ""conservative"" Justice Antony Scalia concurred with the majority, but his opinion supported an effective ""expansion"" of government power.  In this case, the ""conservative"" nature of his opinion could be said to fall in line with ""conservative"" political philosophy, which is different from ""conservative"" jurisprudence.  The conservative Justice Thomas dissented in that case, sticking to his literal interpretation of the constitution, which does not explicitly allow for the government to regulate a private individual's non-commercial activity.

Liberals typically see the constitution as a ""living"" document whose text must be reinterpreted for a changing world, while a conservative looks for the original intent of the text to apply it as it was meant to be applied. There's grey area in between, and judicial philosophies can mix with political philosophies to create different versions of the same thing (for example, ""Originalism"" is a judicial philosophy that favors applying the original intent of a law... a liberal originalist will attempt to divine how the original intent applies to a potentially unforeseen circumstance, while a conservative originalist will rule that the law doesn't apply because the lawmaker could not have foreseen the circumstances).",null,0,cdmy6ut,1rfkxi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

So, when people refer to Obama as black, this is what they're talking about: he looks black, *and this is relevant because it affects how he grew up.* When people refer to him as half-black, they're giving more credence to his specific family tree; both are, in a sense, correct.

DavidLieberMintz,"I'm seeing a lot of jokes and people referencing the ""one drop rule."" Race cannot be determined biologically. There is no gene for black, white or Asian etc. There are, however, genes for the pigment of your skin, the color of your eyes, how curly or straight your hair is and on and on and on. It is the combination of all these physical attributes that we as a society use to invent and reinvent race.

Obama is considered black because that is the racial group he chose to identify with. Given the time and place he was raised, I'd say he didn't have much of a choice. But the key concept here is that race is something made up by people. YOU have just as much a say in your race as society dictates.

Consider the following.
Bob is a teenage boy who's father is black and mother is Puerto Rican. Bob and his parents live in a major US city. If the neighborhood Bob grew up in is predominately Hispanic, he will most likely identify with that group because he sees himself as Hispanic. Whether he looks more Hispanic or more African American certainly plays a role in making his race, but it is not the determining factor. What if Bob grew up in a black neighborhood? What if Bob grew up the wealthy suburbs? You can understand how this might change how Bob sees himself.

This will probably get buried, but I hope it helps you understand where race comes from!

If anything, though, I would consider myself black (after biracial, of course) due to my complexion. I may not be a dark chocolate brown but... I'm brown *enough* that I have encountered racism multiple times in my life--even though I'm not considered ""fully black."" If a person sees my color, they will look at me and know that I'm definitely not white...I'm some sort of ""other."" This also posed a problem when I was younger, as white students didn't see me as white, black students see me as black, and I damn sure couldn't speak Spanish.

If I were to look at Barack, not knowing his heritage, I would see a black male. This, I think, speaks for what he was able to accomplish in a white-male dominated political arena. Sure, you could argue color doesn't matter and yadda yadda he's half white etc. Still, take away the suit and tie and most Americans would look at him and his skin and see a black male.

aeo2013,"As with almost all foreign policy pronouncements, you should consider what audience is being targeted and what the speaker's incentives are.  In this case, there are good strategic incentives for Israel/Netanyahu to appear hardline on this deal.

First, Netanyahu's domestic political situation is dependent on him being seen as hardline on Iran.  He has staked his reputation on this position and so, *whatever deal was agreed to*, he has to appear more hardline than that.  So, even if he actually thinks that this is a good deal, or a step along the way to a good deal (good in terms of what Iran would eventually accept), he has to publicly appear ""pissed off"", using OP's language.  

Second, there is the international audience.  The P5+1 negotiators (from the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany) will be able to get a better deal from Iran if they can point to a hardline Israel stance and say to Iran, ""Look, look at the pressure we are under here.  If you don't want Israel to reject the deal (and maybe unilaterally bomb your nuclear facilities), you are going to have to give a better deal"".  The P5+1 negotiators also seem more reasonable and moderate next to a hardline Israel.  

In addition to strategic incentives, there is a thing called ""fundamental attribution error"".  Briefly, this is a psychological phenomenon that all humans are subject to to some extent, where you think that you are a good person and forced to do bad things by your environment, but other people do bad things because they are bad people.  So, even though Israelis trust themselves to only use their nuclear weapons defensively, they think that Iran would use nuclear weapons offensively, even if that means effectively committing suicide (through nuclear retaliation).  This means that they are far more concerned about *ensuring* Iran doesn't have nuclear weapon capabilities than is reasonable/rational.

Israel not getting what they wanted from the US in regards to an issue like Iran is very unusual, and so they're likely just as upset about that as they are the actual terms of the deal.

On a more personal level, the Israel Prime Minister (Netanyahu) has generally campaigned on the idea that Iran is an imminent existential threat that can never be reasoned with,  and that his leadership is the only hope that Israel has of surviving.

Those opposed to a Iran gave up some of the bargaining power.  Currently, there are economic sanctions (penalties) against Iran to pressure the country.  The recent deal agrees to reduce the existing sanctions and to avoid creating new ones.  In exchange, some feel Iran's not doing much, so the US is surrendering its position of power for very little.

Concern that Iran will continue to make efforts to develop nuclear weapons despite the deal.

Issues relating to Israel's involvement in the negotiations.  Specifically, negotiations existed for months before anyone from Israel was informed.  Israel wants its views considered when negotiations with Iran take place.

Interpretations on what the deal says about Iran's nuclear future.  Israel doesn't just want nuclear progress halted.  It wants development stopped completely.  According to the Iranians involved in the deal, the agreement strongly implies that recognition that the country has a right to nuclear capabilities.  This is directly against the views of Israel.  

Limitations on what Israel can do.  In the past, Israel has made unilateral strikes against perceived nuclear threats.

People often mix up Serotonin (the feel good hormone) with Dopamine (the reward hormone) and it should be noted that they are two distinct, different chemicals with different effects. 

Because it is a stimulant, side effects include jaw clenching, dry mouth, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping.

TheRockefellers,"The ""wildcat offense"" is an offensive formation in (American) football.  It's a single-wing formation, meaning that (most of) the linemen and backs line up on one side of the center.  In the wildcat formation, the ball is snapped (usually) to a running back, usually to rush the ball with an option to pass. The QB lines up at a different position, or may not even be present at all. In some trickier iterations of the wildcats, the ball may be snapped to any one of 2-3 players, which keeps the defense on its toes.

One of the big advantages of the wildcat is that it effectively gives you more men on a rushing play. In a typical running play, the QB receives the snap and hands it off to the running back, then just kind of watches (instead of blocking). By snapping to the RB directly, you cut the QB out of the equation, and have more boots on the ground to block (or if the RB elects to pass, you have another receiver).",null,0,cdmrq6m,1rfnrq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6

The Blockchain is a big list of which addresses hold what balances. Each block hereby represents a set of updates to be made to the balances. By following the blockchain from the Genesis Block and applying all transactions that were validated in each block in the correct order, you arrive at the current status quo.

Each block contains:

A timestamp

The hash of the previous block as a reference (except the Genesis Block)

At least one transaction: The coinbase transaction and any other that were validated

The Merkle Root

The block's own hash

Difficulty statement

**As many miners compete to find the next block, often there will be more than one valid next block discovered. This is resolved as soon as one of the two forks progresses to a greater length, at which any client that receives the newest block knows to discard the shorter fork. These discarded blocks are referred to as orphaned blocks.**

When a transaction is submitted to the network, it is passed on peer to peer by all clients. Upon discovery miners will put it on their list of transactions that they want to verify and update the Merkle Root.

1. Checking Account - this is where you store money you plan to spend. You will at minimum have a Checkbook that links to this checking account, and typically a Debit Card. The Debit Card is the one you use at ATMs to withdraw money. The checkbook lets you write checks that eventually result in money being withdrawn from your account.
2. Savings Account - this is where you store money you don't plan to spend. There is usually some small amount of interest you gain on the amount in your savings. Think of it as a 'safe spot' that is a little safer than under the mattress.

Now, depending on where you go, a Checking Account has some requirements - they will have packages that vary depending on how much you have in the account.

Lets take a look at [Value Checking](https://www.wellsfargo.com/checking/value/) from Wells Fargo

So they have a 7$ a month fee and a minimum $50 deposit to open it up. To waive the monthly fee, you need one of the two:

* $1,500 minimum daily balance, or
* $500 in direct deposit per month

So lets say that works for you - you go into Wells Fargo and ask to open up a Value Checking account. You have cash on hand, lets say $250.

You will need at minimum:  

* Drivers license or state ID (Photo ID is a must)
* Social Security Number

You will at first talk to a Teller, who will then get you to a Banker - sometimes they have a desk just for new accounts.

Anyways, you do some paperwork, they run some checks, and usually within a few hours, you have your bank account! A debit card will take a few days to arrive, typically, but some banks can issue them on the spot. 

Now, you have your checking account and a checkbook. Ask for a Direct Deposit worksheet or form - it will have info you will give to your employer, who can set up Direct Deposit for you. If you get that $500 in per month, bingo! No more monthly fee.

That's the basics - depending on how much you are storing, what banks are available, and what sort of advantages they provide, you might want to shop around and see what works best for you.

strOkePlays,"Oh god... this is almost not an ELI5 concept, because you must have the concepts of math and logic available, and no amount of simplifying will change that....

With that said, here goes. There are two main kinds of encryption: symmetric, and asymmetric.

Everyone knows *symmetric*; if you put a password on a Word document, that's symmetric encryption. The password encrypts it, the same password decrypts it. Useful, but vulnerable to a lot of things, including someone else finding out the password.

Asymmetric, which public key encryption is the best-known example, doesn't use a password. It uses *keys*. The relationship between the keys is simple and straightforward: they do the opposite of each other.

There are two things you want to do to a document: *encrypt* it, or make it unreadable, and *decrypt* it, or make it readable again. In symmetric encryption, the ""password"" does both tasks. In public key encryption, you have two keys, and each does one at a time, and **only one at a time**, of those operations. If you use Key A to encrypt a document, you can't use Key A to *decrypt* it, it won't work. You can only use Key B to decrypt it. And vice versa; if you encrypt with Key B, then only Key A will decrypt. **Never ever ever can you use just one key to do both things.**

So smart people worked out that if you keep one of the keys secret, or *Private*, and expose the other key to everyone, or *Public*, you can accomplish two cool things:

* You can invite people to send you secret things. They encrypt with your Public key, and the encrypted file is safe. The public key can't do *both* things at once... if you use it to encrypt, it's useless to decrypt. So any sneaky spy bastards can steal the encrypted file but they can't decrypt it, only the other key, the Private key, can do that.

* You can send out messages encrypted with your private key. The message is NOT secret, because the public key is... public. Anyone can decrypt it. But that public key can *only* decrypt things coded by the private key, so they know it's from you. And remember, it can't do both things! If they change your message and try to encode it again, with the public key, well, that public key can't then decode it (it can never do both things), so everyone knows it's *not* from you. This is the basis for **electronic signature**.

Now, as for ""how does it actually work,"" there are two answers: logic and math. The logic answer is, there are some problems that are very easy to solve, but very hard to *unsolve*; we call these one-way functions. The simplest, classic case is prime factoring (there's a fantastic little algebra equation that lets you do a cool trick with prime numbers). It's very easy to multiply 67 x 107 and get 7169. But because 67 and 107 are prime numbers, they are the ONLY numbers that divide evenly into 7169. It's challenging for a human to look at 7169 and realize it's 67 x 107. It's even challenging for a computer, though computers are so fast they'd brute-force it instantly.

When you start looking at numbers like 8080031, and wondering what two numbers it factors into, it gets daunting for a human, though a computer still doesn't care. Where the computer cares is when the number looks like 77546620056920588113012600033948388271650013, and you have to figure out what two numbers it factors into, even computers start sweating. And numbers get much bigger than that.

Even so, we're getting too good at teaching computers to do it, and quantum computers will practically spit out the answer, so we are finding other one-way functions...elliptic curves, for instance, are very promising.

I'd add links, but a) other posters have already done so, and b) there is absolutely no such thing as ELI5 for the actual math. Good luck!",null,0,cdmwhjz,1rfri7,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

One thing that can be tricky to understand is the concept of trapdoor functions. These are functions that are difficult or impossible to reverse without more information. Believe it or not, you were taught one of these in elementary school; you just didn't know it. Mathematicians call this function ""modulo"" (usually shortened to mod). Regular people call it ""take the remainder"". The mathematical equation 7 mod 3 = 1 just means that 7 divided by 3 equals 2 with a remainder of 1. You can't ""unmod"" an equation without all the numbers involved because some of the information necessary to solve it has been thrown away (the 2 in this case).

sp31415926535,"Imagine that you (I'm gonna call you Bob) and I (Hi, I'm Alice!) want to talk to each other securely, so that if there's someone else is listening to everything we say (call her Eve), she can't understand what we're saying to each other.

For this to happen, we'll need a [shared secret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret) - a piece of information that only you and I know. If we had such a secret, we could use it as a password for a regular, symmetric encryption algorithm (say, [AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)) and encrypt everything that we say. Now, if Eve can hear everything we say to each other, how can we come up with such a shared secret?

Here's one easy way ([Merkle's puzzles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%27s_Puzzles)).

I (Alice) create a million short messages, along the lines of

* Password number 1 is cat

* Password number 2 is dog

...

* Password number 123 is kitty

...

* Password number 1,000,000 is rabbit

I then generate a million random passwords. I'm gonna use short passwords though, say, no longer than 10 letters each (you'll see why!). I encrypt each message with a different password, then throw away the passwords, and send all these encrypted messages to you in random order.

You, Bob, pick one message at random. Pick any message you like. Knowing that my password is short, you can [brute force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)... well, just try all 10-letter passwords and decrypt the message you picked. You call me over the phone, and tell me - hey, Alice, I've happened to pick message number 123, so use password number 123. And now we have a shared secret! We both know to use kitty as the password, because I have the original list of passwords, and you've read of the messages I've sent you.

Eve would have to break about half a million messages before she stumbles upon the message number 123, so she has to do a lot more work than you did. Hopefully, she can't do it quickly enough and by the time she's done with it, we're done talking and enough time has passed so that the topic of our conversation is no
longer a secret.

Easy, right? Now, this isn't an algorithm that people use in practice (you can read about [Diffie-Hellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), [RSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29), etc. if you want), but I hope it illustrates the concept well enough. In any case, there must be something that is easy for you to do knowing only something that you know (your private key), but hard to do for anyone who doesn't know your private key.

This includes paying for classes, housing, meals, books, and other supplies that are often required for whatever course is being taken. It is then subject to interest rates and the like, forcing people to set aside a fairly large chunk of their income just to pay for what was borrowed and then some. Add this to the fact that the economy and job market are in the shitter and you have a LOT of people who attended college for XX years and worked their ass off to get their degree only to find that their is no job for them and, as such, no way to pay the loan back.

It has hit the younger generation the hardest, both financially and socially. In the past, one could pay for an entire year's worth of courses with what it costs to take a single class today.

BitCoin is set up in such a way that any individual ""coin"" acts, for all intents and purposes, like a physical thing.  As in, you can't make a copy of it (like, say, an MP3), and when you give one to someone else, it's now not yours and you can't run a hard drive backup or something like that to get it back.  They achieve this with several clever uses of cryptography (which gets complicated pretty fast).

So the mere fact that BitCoin acts like physical coins and was the first one to become popular is probably the reason why they're in demand (and therefore worth so much $$).

If I start accepting monopoly money as real currency at my store, other people know (and trust that) they can come to my store and purchase goods with monopoly money. Because I accept monopoly money, another person may start offering a currency exchange service for others who want to convert their regular currency (e.g. US dollars) into monopoly money so they can purchase goods at my store. Likewise, the currency exchange may also convert Monopoly money into regular currency (e.g. US dollars) because they know there is a market for monopoly money and people are willing to buy monopoly (to purchase goods at my store). I also want monopoly money because I believe in the future many stores will begin to accept monopoly money (after following my example) and the value of monopoly will continue to increase as a result.

Now imagine this scenario on a much larger scale with thousands of stores accepting Bitcoins as payment and many different exchanges offering currency conversion to and from Bitcoins. That's basically what's happening. Enough businesses have started accepting Bitcoin and there are enough exchanges to convert regular currency into Bitcoins that people have started to trust that Bitcoins do actually have value and can be used to purchases goods, so the value continues to appreciate over time.

It has to do with the way that your hand (in this case, but, if it was another body part, similiar results would be seen--however, the palm of your hand has ALOT of nerves) is more rigid when it is cold. This makes it LESS flexible, and MORE prone to superficial injury....even without frost nip setting in. In the event that actual frost nip set in, this would be even more sensitive, as you have tiny crystals beginning to form in your cells, like little shards of glass......and, smacking them, rubbing them, or scraping them would be like SMACKING, RUBBING, or SCRAPING your neutral temperature hand against shards of glass.

When it is cold, your nerves are VERY sensitive to the temperature, as it ISNT numb yet, and still....blood flow is slowed down tremendously. In fact, your body has begun ""vaso-constricting"" all it's blood flow AWAY from your hands and feet, then the arms and legs, resulting in nerves being pressed upon by the less suple skin and vascular tissues.

(think of it like this....your hand swells---you cant get a RING off your finger. SO, you get told to run your hand under cold water---really cold water for about 15 minutes.

They used the rock to sharpen the stick. Then they used a stronger rock to break another rock and put little bits of it on a stick.

As time has passed, the rate at which technology improves has increased. We built better tools to make better things, which allowed us to make better tools.

But the main thing that's fueled this massive boom in tech in recent years (like 1970 til now) is the integrated circuit, and the fact that [the number of transistors double about every two years](http://www.mstech.com/nh-it-blog.php?show=171).

Eventually that turns from a broad curve into a straight line up. 

So either we create advanced AI, which solves problems we don't even know we have, or the rate of technological change slows down.

sir_sri,"&gt;Why has technology developed so quickly in the last 10 years in comparison to the last 100 years?Explained

The short answer is that it hasn't.

new technologies come out and there's a period of exceptionally rapid growth where it goes from a parlour trick to a major technology, and then it settles into a long period of slow progress.

Aircraft went from from a rickety pile of wood that was more likely to kill you than get you from point A to point B to a something actively used in serious combat in about 12 years.  20 years later and you had aircraft that sort of looked like today's commercial aircraft, though with propellers rather than jets.  Then jets caught on and there was another burst of development and then... we've had 40-50 years of progress but not rapid leaps and bounds.  

Metal ships are something similar, the first iron ships started showing up around the 1840's (with varying degrees of metal-steam-wood-sail).  By 1860 there was a ~9500 tonne ironclad sea going warship, HMS Warrior.  She's still afloat at Portsmouth in the UK if you ever go there.  By 1912 (Titanic) the biggest ships were almost 60 000 tonnes.  That's absolutely huge progress, but since today we regularly build ships over 100k it doesn't seem like such a big deal.  But that was tremendously rapid progress, especially considering how long it takes to build huge ships and make ports and for them.  

The first hot air balloon was basically a death trap.  Within 10 years they were dropping bombs with it, eventually they were the size of an aircraft carrier and could carry a couple of dozen passengers across oceans.  Then they were replaced by heavier than air aircraft. 



What happens is that engineering and innovation catch up to science.  The underlying principles of most of what goes on in microprocessors is E&amp;M and Quantum mechanics, we've had those understood pretty well for the better part of 70 years, but the microprocessor didn't really take off until the 1970's.  So it's rapidly catching up to the limits of our understanding of the science, and in 20 years or we'll probably start to hit a wall where you cannot make a microprocessor based on traditional semiconductor physics work any better.  Someone will figure out how to build a quantum computer we'll have a race to reach the limits with that, and then it will be slow marginal improvements for a while. 

Certainly things like the printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, the internet all speed up communication and speed up development, and there are a lot more people alive than there were at any previous point in history (word pop in 1800 was about 1 billion for the first time, by 1900 it was like 1.6 by 2000 it was about 6 billion. ) so there are a lot more scientists doing a lot more science with much better tools.  

But technology tends to go through spurts and things we think of as unchanged for ages started out as some ridiculous magic trick or gimmick then someone had a revelation about what you could do, and that rapidly progressed to something, and then did very little for a while.  

One of the common questions here is why do batteries suck and microprocessors increase so rapidly.  Well between 1800 and 1900 batteries went from being a misunderstood lab experiment to an actual technology people understood and could use.  Basically from the first battery in 1800 until the mid 1830's no one had a clue what was going on.  Then someone figured it out, made better batteries, that actually worked and could be improved on reliably.  By 1860 we had lead acid batteries, which are still in use in cars and the technology basically went unchanged from 1860 until 1970.   From 1800 to 1860 there were huge advances, and then many decades of very incremental progress.  Expect something similar with lots of the tech you see as so incredibly awesome from the last 10 years.

StupidHockeyPlayer,"&gt; As a type of road, a boulevard (often abbreviated Blvd) is usually a wide, multi-lane arterial thoroughfare, divided with a median down the center, and ""roads"" along each side designed as slow travel and parking lanes and for bicycle and pedestrian usage, often with an above-average quality of landscaping and scenery. 

&gt;A street is a public thoroughfare in the built environment. It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. ... The word ""street"" is still sometimes used colloquially as a synonym for ""road"", but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction.

&gt;Traditionally, an avenue is a straight road with a line of trees or large shrubs running along each side, which is used, as its French source venir (""to come"") indicates, to emphasize the ""coming to,"" or arrival at a landscape or architectural feature. ... In US and Canadian urban or suburban settings, ""avenue"" is often simply a street name used to differentiate some streets from others, along with ""way"", ""road"", etc. Thus a community might have a ""Maple Avenue"" and a ""Maple Street"" to avoid confusion between addresses. In some cities in the United States (most notably in Manhattan, New York City), there is a convention that ""avenues"" run in a north-south direction, while ""streets"" run in an east-west direction, or vice versa. 

&gt;The word lane has several meanings, including and especially: 
1. a narrow road or street, usually lacking a shoulder or a median; this is typically applied to roads in the countryside, but can also be applied to urban streets or areas that used to be streets, such as Drury Lane in London, the Brighton Lanes, or the Cathedral Lanes in Coventry. 
2. a portion of a paved road which is intended for a single line of vehicles and is marked by white or yellow lines. 

&gt;In Northern America and Australia, the term also may refer to rear access roads which act as a secondary vehicular network in cities and towns. Large cities in the U.S. states of Nevada and Texas tend to apply the term to many arterial roads. &gt;

Why our eyesight is worse than, say, an eagle's?
An eagle depends more heavily on its eyesight for survival (scanning the ground far below for prey while flying by at great speed), therefore over the evolution of the species of eagles we are familiar with, a genetic mutation that resulted in better eyesight almost always resulted in a better chance to survive and reproduce. 

In humans on the other hand, at a certain quality of eyesight (roughly that which we currently possess) an improvement in eyesight no longer improved chances for survival; we already saw well enough to run and hunt on foot. Therefore, genetic mutations resulting in better eyesight- even though they were just as likely to happen and most likely did happen- were not made ubiquitous in our species by natural selection.",null,0,cdo52zt,1rgb09,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

Why do we have serious bee allergies? Assuming it is hereditary, it gets passed down because we have epi-pens and medicine that allows people with this allergy to live beyond a bee sting and pass the trait down. If we didn't have this, people would get stung by bees before having the chance to reproduce. Not that I wish for this to happen AT ALL, but if all people with bee allergies just died, it's likely that this allergy would be largely eradicated from humanity. Worth it? Probably not.

Likewise, if we were nomads had to hunt for our food to survive, people with nearsightedness would be toast. They'd die before having the chance to pass their traits down. Now glasses and modern society allow people to live with eye problems and pass those traits down. If everyone who needed glasses (a LOT of people) suddenly died, the human race would be more ""fit"" (in the Darwinian sense of the word) and basically better off. But it doesn't matter because quality of life if you have money is basically the same. And we can't kill hundreds of millions of people.

The other thing is with old people. As life expectancy grows, the organs tire and grow weaker, which is why more old people need glasses. So that's the other element.

Destroyers and frigates are small ships (commonly called escorts), typically meant to keep enemies from harassing the big ships. Currently they are interchangeable, but destroyers used to be the smaller of the two, and focused on anti-submarine warfare, while frigates could bring down larger ships when operating in packs. Also, frigates and destroyers could operate alone, due to their small size and higher maneuverability.

Battleships (along with cruisers, battlecruisers, and dreadnoughts) are what are known as capital ships, and are meant to provide a boat load (pun intended) of firepower. One-on-one, they can outshoot any other ship other than enemy capital ships. The largest ones typically served as the chief admiral's ship, and almost always operated in fleets with smaller ships because of their slower speed. In addition, they often served ended up being statements of nationalistic pride (particularly the Yamato, the Bismark, and the Missouri during and after WWII).

Larger capital ships have largely been replaced with aircraft carriers (which are also capital ships), as aircraft are much more useful in combat that the main guns of a battleship.

In the age of sail 18th and 19th century.

* Battleships / Ships of the Line - These are the big warships that would fight fleet to fleet battles.
* Frigates - These are large ships that are faster than battleships. They are out scouting, fighting pirates, escorting civilian ships, and occasionally joining in the big fleet battles.
* Corvettes/Sloops/Brigantines/etc. - There are also a lot of little ships with various roles running around.

As ships developed and got armor, bigger guns, and power plants things changed.

* Battleships - These were the biggest nastiest ships in the various navies.
* Cruisers - These replaced frigates. Faster than anything they can't outshoot and nastier than anything they can't outrun. While the battleships clumped together for big battles, the cruisers were running around doing most of the ""work.""
* Destroyers - When torpedoes were invented they changed the game, now a small boat could carry a weapon that could sink a Battleship. So these ""Torpedo Boat Destroyers"" would screen the fleet from anything little. They had a lot of small guns (couldn't hurt a Cruiser) to blow up little boats.

By WWII this was largely still the same.

* Battleships - Still the same.
* Cruisers - Still the same, but most now carried torpedoes for an extra punch.
* Destroyers - Mostly these had become the Torpedo Boats, with a dozen torpedoes they could pack a big punch in a small size. And because they were smaller and cheaper they picked up a lot of new jobs. They were given sonar sets and sent sub hunting. They were given radar sets and were back on the far edges of the fleet looking for other ships, and more importantly planes.
* Frigates - These were smaller Destroyers, usually dedicated to a single purpose. An anti-sub frigate for example was pretty much a sitting duck to a surface ship or an air attack.
* Carriers - These were the new big kid on the block. Able to find and sink ships before the other ships knew they were there, they completely changed warfare.

In the post WWII era things have changed somewhat

* Battleships - These are now obsolete. Only the US operated them for very long. In the days of missiles bug guns are of limited value. As this moment. There are none operating.
* Cruiser - This is a bigger destroyer. Only the US and Russia have Cruisers any more.
* Destroyer - This is the main ship now. Capable of dealing with any threat, they are large (much larger than the WWII destroyers) ships and form the core of almost all fleets.
* Frigates - These are still the Destroyers' little brothers. Less capable and usually dedicated to a single purpose.
* Carriers - There are a lot of different types carriers out there. The US is the only one who runs the massive super carriers. But both the US and other fleets operate smaller carriers for Helos and small planes that don't need runways.",null,0,cdnf0av,1rgfxj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

andgiveayeLL,"So, the goal of interpreting a statute is to figure out what Congress intended.  You want to know what the legislature wanted to prohibit, or incentivize, or regulate.  

Scalia, like every other judge and justice in the country, thinks that we should look to the text of the law to figure that out.  This is always the starting point.

But, most judges think that if there is something in the text that isn't clear, we can look to other sources to help resolve that ambiguity when all of the tools we have to interpret just the text itself fail.  These judges are willing to look at things like legislative history (what does the committee report for the bill that led to the creation of the statute say about the ambiguity?).  Some but not all judges will also try to use their own common sense and experience to reconstruct the purpose of the statute, drawing from as many sources as possible.

Scalia, however, thinks that we should stick just to the text.  He says that the answer is in the text and nowhere else.  He will not look to legislative history 99% of the time (he has done it twice to my knowledge).  He will not engage in some inquiry into the overall purpose of the statute as he reconstructs it.  All he cares to look at is the text itself, plus a dictionary (but he likes to use old dictionaries, like Webster's Second instead of Webster's Third).

Basically, he is a textualist, who tries to figure out the intent of the legislature through the text alone.  There are lots of tools to interpret text that he uses (just like all other judges).  These are called the ""canons of statutory interpretation"".  I'll walk you through an easy one

One straightforward canon of interpretation is called ""noscitur a sociis.""  That means ""a word is known by the company it keeps.""  This canon tells us that we are going to look at words around an ambiguous word in a group of words to try to make some sense out of it.  So in the list, ""No person shall possess: cotton candy, Skittles, ice cream, or treats,"" the word ""treats"" is ambiguous.  What if to me, salad is a treat.  Am I forbidden from possessing salad? No, because just using the text, we can figure out that the legislature did not intend to prohibit salad.  All the other items in the list are sweet things that are bad for you in large quantity.  Salad isn't like that.  So it's not a ""treat"" for the purposes of this law.  

Scalia uses tools like these to figure out ambiguities in language of statutes.  So does every other judge.  The difference is that Scalia prefers to stop with just the text.  But if there is an ambiguity that this tool and other tools like it cannot resolve, most judges will look to other sources.

To answer, let's just pick a number, say 686. Let's rewrite this in a slightly different form. 

6(1+99)+8(1+9)+6=686

Now we distribute:

6+6(99)+8+8(9)+6=686

let's rearrange again:

6(99)+8(9)+6+8+6=686

Any number multiplied by a number that is divisible by 3, is also divisible by 3. (eg. 4(3)=12 is divisible by 3). This means that our first 2 terms are divisible by 3, since the 9s are divisible by 3. This means that if the sum of the last 3 terms is divisible by 3, the whole number is divisible by 3.

ie) if 6+8+6 is divisible by 3, 686 is divisible by 3. in this case 6+8+6=20, which is not divisible by 3. 

Example 2)

7(1+99)+5(1+9)+3

`= 5*(99999+1)`

A simple way to understand this is if the government one day told everybody to take out their money and add an extra zero to the end of all of it. All of the businesses would then raise their prices accordingly, and everybody would go on their merry way.

Primarily, cultures all over the world are very different.

matingslinkys,"One of the issues with anti-depressants is the order in which they can treat the symptoms of depression. Depression comes with a whole grab bag of symptoms, and they are all linked but separate in a complicated mess that is different for each person, and can respond differently to medication in each person.

Often one of the most significant things that can affect a person with depression is a lack of motivation, an overwhelming lethargy that leaves them unable to perform sometimes even the most basic of tasks. This is the reason that the advice ""just snap out of it, get up and do something"" is so useless to folks with depression. The illness cruelly takes that option away, by filling a person with leaden thoughts and an inability to even contemplate taking the next few steps in their recovery. I have worked with people who have sat soiled on a sofa until someone physically moved them to the bathroom to clean up, people who have not eaten in days being unable to summon up the energy to see the point in getting something to eat. 

This lethargy and lack of motivation is linked, but separate to any suicidal ideation. People may have suicidal thoughts, or they may not, or they may develop suicidal thoughts only when in the very depths of a depression, when the lethargy has already kicked in. Sometimes a person may entertain the idea of killing themselves, but be unable to summon up the energy to put together a plan to do so (after all, many suicide methods require some sort of supplies, which means getting dressed, leaving the house, and interacting with people to purchase things, or may require the effort of driving to somewhere or other such activities. Sometimes even just the effort of making a decision and coming up with a plan to kill yourself is just too much to overcome).  

Now, here's why people suffering from depression should always have someone to help keep an eye on them when they start a course of medication. Sometimes with modern anti-depressants the first symptom that reacts to treatment is the lethargy. All of a sudden the person who was unable to leave the same position on a sofa, or in a bed, for days on end is able to get up in the morning, or to summon up the energy to have a shower, or to go out to the shops...

You can see how this is the start of a positive recovery for many people; however sometimes the suicidal ideation does not go away at the same time. So what happens is that a person is still very much in a place where they wish to end their life, but now they have more energy and motivation. And therin lies the rub. 

I must stress that this is not the case for every person with depression, perhaps not even for most people with depression, everyone is an individual, and everyone reacts to both depression and treatment in different ways. Antidepressants are without a doubt good things that help many many people to recover, but sometimes they come with a risk that needs to be managed, and that's why they put those warning on the packet.

**TL:DR**    Sometimes Antidepressants can give a suicidal person the energy to notice their suicidal feelings (and sometimes act  on them) by bringing them out of a lethargic state in which they may not even have realised they felt that way. ",null,0,cdn1zrg,1rgj2f,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7

It might not react well with their body and make them feel even worse, prompting more thoughts of suicide. Some antidepressants are possible to OD on, giving the person a new convenient way to kill themselves. Someone starting on antidepressants for the first time may have only recently come to the conclusion that they have a mental health issue. Becoming conscious of it may make them feel even more pathetic or hopeless. For these reasons it's very important to monitor a person starting a new antidepressant drug, or if you are taking one yourself, to frequently tell people how you are feeling and not hesitate to talk to your doctor if they aren't working out for you.

eideid,"There are several things in effect here, but the biggest one is an issue of surface area to volume ratio. If you have a cube with sides of length 1, then its volume is 1 and its surface area is 6 with a surface area to volume ratio of 6 (ignoring units). Now imagine a cube with sides of length 2 with volume of 8 and a surface area of 24, giving it a surface area to volume ratio of 3. The bigger things get, the lower the surface area to volume ratio gets.

This has a large impact on how well the energy from changes in momentum is felt. Relatively more mass for a similar area of surface structure means it takes less of a change of momentum to reach the surface structure's breaking point. This explains many characteristics we find amazing regarding small creatures, such as the immense strength of ants compared to their body weight. It also means that they can have chitenous armor all over their body and still be agile. It is also why smaller animals have a much easier time surviving falls from great heights, or why it is so difficult to injure a flying insect with your hand.

Air on the other hand is compressible. if you have a small block of air, the pressure from the heart simply compresses the air; thereby not transmitting the pressure through the full length of vessel. This distorts the pressure gradients, literally stopping blood from flowing.

eideid,"First off, your definition of species is a lie which continues to be repeated, particularly by high-school science teachers. There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. Most organisms aren't sexual and even then, there are countless examples of organisms which can and sometimes even do interbreed with fertile offspring, but their populations are generally separate enough that we treat them as separate species (for an example, look at polar bears and northern grizzly bears).

In paleontology, the general rule is, ""Is there another thing out there which has been discovered which would be difficult to distinguish from this thing that I just discovered?"". If we were to find modern dogs in the ancient archaeological record, we would think they were all separate species, but we currently think of them as all members of a single species. There have been fairly recent reports of skull analyses which might call into question how many early hominid species there really were. It's all just best guesses with a bit of academic politics thrown in for good measure.",null,1,cdn1mg6,1rgmpx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3
DoggoneCat,"While I agree with eideid's comments, I'm going to take a little different approach, starting first with extant species. Where eideid says, 
&gt; ""There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality, the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by high-prestige scientific committees. ""

I would say that there are several acceptable definitions of species, and all are rather context dependent. If two species are asexual but closely related, how do we determine if they are species or subspecies (races or breeds in some contexts, but not others)? What about two groups of organisms that appear nearly identical but are separated (say on different continents)? They can't (naturally) interbreed. There are literally dozens of scenarios we could suggest to snag someone stuck on a simple definition. So, we use morphology, behavior, and increasingly, genetics, to test hypotheses about the relationships between extant species. I don't know that I'd call the decision-makers, ""high prestige scientific committees"". A single author, publishing a convincing set of evidence may decide to split a previously single species into 2 or more. If her argument is sound, and the data support it, ""consensus"" in the scientific community may simply be that other authors cite the work and accept the argument. Some taxa have a richer history of committee decision however. Birds have long had a devoted following, and there are numerous large and prestigious organizations which have committees that review the literature on taxonomy and vote on what the official relationship will be. So each year, the American Ornithologists Union publishes an update to their official checklist based on the decisions of the committee. 

When we consider extinct species we have much less data to go on, both quantitatively (the number of fossilized examples of a putative species) and qualitatively (the different types of evidence). There are no behavior observations, though we might make some inferences. There may be no usable genetic material. There are rarely skin, or feathers... anything to compare looks. We might only be left with a partial skeleton. At that point, paleontologists measure, and compare, and hunt for more fossils and do the best they can to make informed decisions. Often, someone coming along 10-100 years later, having much more data at hand, will revise those initial findings to a greater or lesser degree. It is messy, and somewhat subjective, but the idea is to apply any and all new, relevant information and to try and let the data suggest the most parsimonious answer - that is, the simplest answer is generally the most likely unless you have data to the contrary.

Some pros include the power to protect rights of workers, ie, to prevent an abusive boss from hiring only specific groups of people or from firing specific people based on unreasonable claims.

However, unions can allow easier access to striking, which can massively damage a business, because the union wants to gain some sort of benefit to its members.

thatssoright,"Unions in the United States came about as a response to some particularly harsh working conditions that workers were subjected to back in the late 1800's-early 1900's when the industrial revolution was getting into full swing. Mostly manufacturing and labor intensive jobs. Workers were treated as interchangeable. In some cases they were paid in  Company Money that could only be used in company stores. Essentially, you belonged to the company. Labor Unions began as a natural response. The individual may be interchangeable, but the workforce as a whole is not. This led to some very bloody confrontations before the US government eventually stepped in and the existence of a labor unions and protections were added. Other countries have their own similar stories with somewhat equivalent time-frames.

The pros of having a union - In theory, all workers are treated equally and fairly. The company makes an agreement with the employees and the union is supposed to safeguard that agreement. Things like working hours, overtime, work conditions, training, disciplinary measures, layoffs and terminations are all usually spelled out in a legally binding contract. In some of the skilled trade professions (Electrical, Plumbing, etc) being Union Certified used to mean you were current on your training, and generally knew what you are doing.

The Cons - Everyone is treated and viewed exactly the same, regardless of how hard or well they work. The pay scale is the same for everyone in the same job title as you and the only way to earn more money is to work whatever overtime is offered. EVERYTHING is based on seniority. If there is training available but not everyone can attend at once, better hope you have high enough seniority. Volunteers for overtime? Better hope you have been there long enough. Layoffs? Better hope you aren't one of the low guys on the totem pole. Job opens up in another department? Not yours if the the guy who sleeps half the day and can barely do his job puts in for it and has even one day more seniority than you.


I am a bit biased against unions. I worked in one for 3 years and then worked along side that same union for the next 12. From what I could tell, they do nothing but push mediocrity. I regularly heard union stewards tell people to stop working so hard because it made others look bad. When companies started outsourcing, the response was to show the company just how good an idea that was by organizing work stoppages on a regular basis. Most unions have become just as bad as the big businesses they rally against. They protect their own interests and not the interests of their members.

Having said that, I am mildly surprised (and I think it speaks to the mindset of most unions) that non-government union membership hasn't started to go up in the last 5 years with how large corporations have been treating the employee base. ",null,0,cdn7qun,1rgngc,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

Snafu_Coaxer_2013,"A lot of these answers ignore the fact that that profit rarely translates into the ability to takeover other companies if you're a listed, public company. Spyker, for example, bought Saab (briefly), despite Spyker being a tiny company.

The reasoning is completely economic. If your cars are cheaper and you sell more, you're going to have bigger facilities and spend more on things like research. Lamborghini (if they were independent) aren't going to have the scale to effectively invest in R&amp;D without outsourcing it. But R&amp;D can be pretty much equally used by all car marques (i.e. it would be more efficient for Volkswagen and Lamborghini to share research as their research needs aren't all that different).

So a company with a lot of facilities like Volkswagen or BMW is going to be able to make better, cheaper cars than a company like Lamborghini. But that's not why people buy Lamborghini's, they buy them for the name and values of the brand: they buy them because they want a sports car with the character of a Lamborghini. So if Volkswagen made a car to compete with Lamborghini, it might be faster and more efficient and cheaper, but it likely won't make much of a dent in Lamborghini's sales. If Lamborghini makes a good car, it will probably cut in to Ferrari's sales, however.

So from that, logically, If Volkswagen bought Lamborghini, Lamborghini would better compete with Ferrari, and Volkswagen itself wouldn't lose any sales because their brand doesn't compete in the same markets as Lamborghini.

Well sometimes that's the case. 

The thing is, as others have pointed out, being rich is actually quite complicated.  Most rich people build up to the process, you own a local store, then you own 2 stores, then 5, then 50, then 500.  Or you invest in one place, then 10 then 100 or whatever.  Or you just own one business and that's it for your career.  

Athletes, celebrities and lottery winners all have a problem, athletes particularly because you are at a young age with no experience with money handed a fortune.  You don't know what to do with it and you don't even know who to ask.  So you try and hire accountants and lawyers and the problem is you don't have the skills to know the good ones from the bad.  Most americans can't do their taxes coming out of highschool for a 30k a year job, when it's 3 million earned in lots of places with all sorts of complexity you basically hire an accountant, follow their advice and hope you don't fuck it up.  Assuming you know enough to even do that. 

Wesley Snipes got himself an advisor who didn't believe income tax was legal - which as you can imagine the IRS does not agree with.  So Snipes was in a world of trouble.  

Now in the case of athletes they are in the worst of it, because your career doesn't usually gradually slide into oblivion, you make 10 million dollars one year, and 0 the next, or you get injured part way through, cannot play anymore, and suddenly your lifestyle that expected making  X million dollars before you retire at age 30 now has you trying to make do with 15% of X.  Or 2% of X or whatever.  And you're boned.  

Actors can just keep working, even if you get less money you at least can make something by doing more movies and commercials and you can make bad movies or take your clothes off, do stage work etc.  

Lottery winners and athletes though, they have no idea what to do.  The guy at H&amp;R block you pay 40 bucks to do your taxes isn't going to talk to you if you have millions in income.  So you need advisors and you have very poor prospects for long term income.  

Add to that divorces, failed business ventures, theft by crooked advisors and well, you get the idea.  When you have a lot of money and you get a pet project (think 38 studios) that you hope will keep you going for years and it fails suddenly you can't pay your bills and part of that ends up being taxes.

Pros: It allows individuals or groups with interests in issues to ""sell"" their position. If I really believe that abortion is bad for my country, it allows me to have a professional try to persuade the politician.

Cons: Lobby groups don't necessarily represent the public and tend to represent wealth individuals/groups as those are the people that can afford lobbyists. It also can lead to unethical behaviour with conflicts of interest or political gifts being used to sway votes.",null,0,cdn2p92,1rgqor,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

sir_sri,"&gt; I've read that you need to do a SEO and make back ends? 

What *YOU* need is to find a company in your area that does SEO, and pay them to do it for you.

So a couple of things to keep in mind:  any time SEO actually works it means the search algorithm is defective.  So you're gaming the system only until someone fixes the algorithm.  That said, you gotta do what you gotta do, and Google specifically makes a defect in its search algorithm - called adwords, and they're happy to sell you access.

The SEO company is going to do a few things, they're going to follow a guide like this one (not mine)

http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/05/12/a-beginners-guide-to-buying-google-adwords/

and they're going to buy a bunch of adwords for your business with your money.  Basically this is a competitive bidding process, if you're competitors are doing the same thing you're going to be stuck in a bidding war.  Sorry to say.  There are a few minor things that need to happen here too, your website will need to be properly configured to be easily searchable by google and have the right keywords in it.  

The second thing that's going to happen, and this is really what you need a SEO for, is you're going to start getting reviews of your business, you're going to need mentions in blogs etc.  Fairly basically this is the bread and butter of SEO.  Making shit up.  How many yelp reviews does your business have?  Whatever it is, multiply it by 10.  Lots of people had 4-5 star experiences at your business.  It doesn't matter if you sell coffee that smells like sewage, dozens or hundreds of people love it.  

The next thing that needs to happen is that you're going to do advertising beyond just 'google'.  Probably this is obvious enough, but if such things exist you're going to want to have your site featured on 'meta' sites.  Things like a local business association - you're now a member and you have your webpage linked.  You have a facebook page, a twitter page an instagram page etc. that are all full of keywords and that point to your main website.  The more legitimate places host ads for your site, the more google will see things pointing at your site the higher you will rank.  

The reason I recommend finding a local company is that it's important to have someone you can meet face to face with, that knows the local geography, terminology and your competitors.  If people in your area do searches based on neighbourhood names or street names or something else you need to know that, and a local outfit is more likely to be better at that than some random company in another state/province/country that doesn't know anything about your area or your business.

A common use is to prevent certain things from affecting your real computer by doing them in a virtual machine. This is especially useful if your virtual machine solution supports snapshots. 

Another common use is to save hardware costs by having one computer do jobs you might ordinarily spread across multiple computers. The downside to this is since each virtual machine shares the host machine's abilities, the more virtual machines you have running, the less performance each one will be able to consistently put out.

allahsnackbars,"The computer is essentially a small device called the CPU (Central Processing Unit) plus other devices which the CPU can communicate with. Since those peripheral devices are optional, we'll discuss the simplest emulation possible and then I'll explain how it can grow to become more complex.

So it all starts with _just_ emulating (there are a lot of ways to sandbox object code it doesn't _have_ to be emulation but the general process is the same) a CPU. The CPU is a device which retrieves a series of _instructions_ from a source and responds to those instructions. Instructions can be a series of statements (done in order) like so:


Add 5 to x


add y to x


subtract 6 from y


Where X &amp; Y are small sections of memory inside of the CPU. In a real CPU (the x86\x64 architecture) these instructions are a lot more complex and there are also many more complex instructions.


These instructions and encoded into a series of bits and then stored in a location (usually the RAM) where they are read from by the CPU. The CPU uses a series of logical hardware gates (and, or, xor etc...) to decode these instructions and perform their respective task.


To emulate the CPU, one does the exact same thing, except rather than using a physical CPU, they are using a program which reads a series of bits, decodes them as instructions and executes them in a sandboxed environment (emulating also the temporary storage locations X &amp; Y.)


Now that the CPU has been emulated, and as the CPU is the device which reaches out and communicates with the peripheral devices (USB interfaces, SATA\IDE (storage), VGA (video) the communication with the emulated CPU can also itself be emulated.


This results in emulated RAM, etc.

NOTE: In the real world, there are various methods to sandbox objectcode and have it run on the physical CPU to dramatically speed up the 'emulation' process.",null,0,cdn5rf9,1rgtek,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

lumpy_potato,"OK, so you are you.

You can, at any given point in time, imagine a box. You might paint this box pink with white stripes.

Now, you decide to imagine several boxes, all pink with white stripes. You can imagine as many such boxes as you can remember at a time. The more complex the boxes get, the harder it might be to remember them all and keep them all out there at the same time.

A VM works in roughly the same way - you have one physical machine, one set of physical hardware. The VM Software works to create a 'virtual' machine, that lives in its own little sandbox and accesses a portion of the hardware you have. You might have a quad core CPU and 16 GB of RAM. You could then set up a VM sandbox with 1 core and 4GB of RAM. You could do 4 of those sitting side by side without any issue at all.

Your example is very common - you have a physical server, and rather than trying to set up multiple booted OS's on that server, you virtualize - now instead of needing one server per OS, you just use VM to do it instead. This is easier, and management can make life easy as well - I can set up a base image (the pink box with stripes) and just start new VM instances with that pink box, and know it will look like all the other pink striped boxes.

Depending on how its configured, you could have multiple users remoting into multiple virtual machines. You could *also* remote into the physical machine. A sysadmin would likely have control over the physical machines *and* virtual machines, while the users might only have access to one or more virtual machines at any given time.

What I've used VMs for personally is I have a stock Ubuntu image I have through VMWorkstation. When I need to do web work, I spin up a new VM to play with. Once I have it stable, I save that down as a new 'baseline' image. Now if I ever needed to re-create that baseline apache build, I just create a new VM machine from that image.

If I need to mess around with something, I just clone from my existing VM Machine, fuck with it, and if I break it, its no big deal, I still have my original setup safe in an image.

Depending on my hardware, I might be able to run many VMs at the same time. Maybe I can only run a few of them at the same time. There is a lot more to VMs as far as hardware configuration that I'm not familiar with, but if you are interested check out /r/sysadmin or /r/techsupport and see if the guys there can shed more technical light on VMs.",null,1,cdn3kxd,1rgtek,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

Alkaven5,"Joseph Kony is a real person, and he's pretty obviously done some terrible things, so the idea of stopping Kony is a good one. However, the viral video publicizing his actions and the charity behind it were majorly flawed. 

Kony leads the Lord's Resistance Army, a violent religious group that is known for creating thousands of child soldiers and child prostitutes and for breaking apart many more families. Unfortunately, we don't know too much more than that. Because he's a criminal and on the run, the facts about Kony are mysterious and questionable. For example, did he create 60,000 child soldiers, or 30,000, or far less? What countries did he operate in and when? Kony was rumored to be dead multiple times, although he's actually still alive--he might be about to surrender to the Central African Republic government, but even that is questionable.

However, the video about Kony 2012 didn't address any of this uncertainty and used outdated and exaggerated information to convey its message. One of the largest flaws was the focus on Uganda; while Kony has spent quite some time in Uganda, he hasn't been there in years, and has instead spent his time in various African countries. Essentially, the video was far more propaganda piece than it was documentary. Furthermore, the charity funding isn't very good quality; few enough of the donations went to stopping Kony or helping his victims.

Kony 2012 brought JK to the public's attention, but the poor quality of the messenger caused the movement to flop. People who had never heard of the issue watched the video and became passionate about stopping Kony; when they learned that they had been misled, they dropped the cause entirely (to be fair, it's a foreign political issue that the average American can't do much about anyway.) So, the general public now feels quite sour about the issue. The people who already knew about Kony were rather unaffected by the Kony 2012 movement in that it didn't distort their views, so they were rather unaffected.",null,0,cdnbb55,1rgtlk,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5

When you're tired you have less energy to go around and you become more aware of how much energy it takes your eyes to see. It's easy to underestimate how sophisticated our vision can be. From scanning the words to this answer to adjusting for the distance of your computer screen and the light it emits, your eyes do a LOT of work that goes for the most part unnoticed. 

To rest your eyes, close them gently and cover them with the palms of your hands, cupped to cover them without squishing but still giving them a break in the darkness. Also, it is easier for eyes to diverge (look far away) than converge (look closely), so when doing a lot of reading take frequent breaks to look out the window or across the room. Deep breathing to relax is also helpful, as sometimes we tense up when concentrating and don't realize it.

As the link you give points out, an itch can be caused by a very small stimulus, while eczema can affect large areas of skin, which seems to make the two different.

However, eczema is an irritation of the skin that is usually more minor than that which would cause pain. The explanation of itches that you link to emphasized the size of the thing causing the itch (or rather the number of pain receptors being affected), but the important thing is that the pain receptors can be stimulated not only by small *things* but also to a small *degree* over a larger area (as is the case with eczema). More generally, itches result from an irritation of the skin, and the dryness, crustiness, and inflammation of eczema are a type of irritation, so they cause itches too.

Pros - It's open source. People can change the code however they want. So you get a lot of different options in terms of how your desktop works.

romnempire,"Ukraine has been in talks to join the EU for several years.  Many Ukranians see entry into the EU as a step forward in economy, job creation, mobility, development, etc.  This is because several postsoviet states, including the baltic states and Poland, have experienced growth and prosperity over the past couple decades because of the EU.  Things like increased foreign investment to develop infrastructure and create jobs and better chances for emigration would directly affect the standard of living for the individual.

Ukraine is a major postsoviet state.  It is contiguous with russia.  Russia is attempting to create a regional organization cum economic bloc comparative with the EU to compete with it and increase its influence.  However, being part of this is not well thought of in Ukraine, well, in most postsoviet states because Russians, who dominated the soviet governments, badly mismanaged nationalisms and resource distribution under the soviet system.  For non-russians, the soviet system was, in a simplified analogy, simply a new imperialism.  As well, Western Europe has more capital for investment and more opportunities to offer.

If Russia cannot convince the Ukraine to join its regional organization, it basically means the organization will be geographically fragmented and, well, not very sensible.  Russian politicians have put political pressure on the Ukraine to join their bloc rather than the EU by threatening to renegotiate their gas sales, which the Ukrainian energy infrastructure is dependent upon.

As well, the current Ukrainian leadership, under Yanukovich, is viewed circumspectly by a number of indivduals, because he has jailed the former PM, Tymonshenko, (actually, over supposedly shady energy dealings with russia) as well because he seems to be more culturally and politically tied to the Russo-Ukranian linguistic/ethnic community and to Russia itself.

Now imagine the whole process from the perspective of a tiny water droplet. As it travels from the shower head to your skin, air is rushing past it. That air cools the droplet down to room temperature almost immediately. Therefore, the water hitting your skin **is actually much colder than the shower**.


Note that this doesn't apply to the main line of water coming from your shower because those droplets are much bigger and the air that they pass through has already been heated by all of the water that already passed so it doesn't do nearly as good of a job at pulling heat away from the water.

C47man,"The reason we have airspeed and groundspeed is because they serve different purposes. For an airplane to gain lift (fly) it has to move through the air at a certain speed so that the wings will work. To make sure we are at that speed and not coming close to falling below it, we measure airspeed. This is how fast the plane is moving through the air. If air never moved anywhere and stayed in the same place all the time, then airspeed and groundspeed would be the same thing. However, air also moves! We all know that. We call it wind! The airplane is a part of the air mass in the same way that a fish is a part of the water mass. A fish can swim through the water at a certain speed *relative to the water*, but if that water is itself moving with respect to the earth, then fish's speed with respect to the earth is *also* changed the same amount. So if our airplane (a sky-fish!) in the air is flying north at 50mph through the air, and the air itself is moving 10mph *south* relative to the earth, then we have two speeds happening to our aircraft. We are going north at 50mph through air, but only 40mph over the ground, because the air itself is pulling us back as we move forward!

Groundspeed allows us to calculate how long it will take us to arrive at a given destination, and is particularly important so we can make calculations for fuel consumption. Our airspeed is important because the plane will behave differently in the air depending on its speed. Too fast and we could stress or damage the airframe. Too slow and we risk losing lift and ""stalling"", which is basically falling out of the sky (don't worry, we can recover from those easily!).",null,1,cdn8ayt,1rh898,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

PKMKII,"Assuming you're just talking about the filming process itself, and not things like DVDs, advertisements, merchandise, there's three main stages to film production. Appropriately enough, they are called pre-production, production and post-production.

Pre-production is when they set things up so that the actual filming goes smoothly. This usually means things like storyboarding (rough drawings of how scenes are expected to look), getting an production office set up, and hiring crew for the film.

Production is when the film itself is being shot. This is both scenes shot on location, and on sets.

Post-production is the last stage. This is when things like the films background music gets added and mixed, some lines that weren't clear in the filming get re-recorded (and sometimes added entirely with off-screen characters, or characters whose mouths aren't visible at the time). This is also when things like special effects and computer graphics get added. There's also more simple stuff, like editing the film.",null,0,cdn9hw4,1rh9u2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
jayman419,"There's a lot of variation in how a movie gets made. Here's one general example of how it could happen.

For starters, Spielberg doesn't always write his own stuff. So the first thing he does is look for inspiration. Then he gets together with a writer to come up with a treatment. He takes the treatment to the studios and tries to sell it.

Assuming the studios want it, they'll ""greenlight"" it ... that is, draw up contracts, assign a budget, and agree on certain dates (like start of production, completion of principle photography, target release date, ect). They'll usually have ""notes"" or suggestions, like asking him to work with a particular writer or using the film as a vehicle for a star they have under a multi-film contract.

Once the contracts are signed, pre-production starts. This is where the script gets hashed out completely. At the same time, people are sent out to scout locations. Sometimes they plan of filming on location, other times they just take pictures to build the sets somewhere else. They start working on wardrobe concepts and set dressings and all that jazz.

Once the script is pretty close to finished, Spielberg give his shortlist for actors to the casting agent, and they see if any are available. If not, they move down the list and/or hold open casting sessions. Meanwhile, he starts storyboarding the script and comparing it to the location info that his team gathered up.

Once the actors are set, they agree on a date to start working, and then begin actually building all the sets and securing the rights to film in the locations they've chosen. They also hire a studio to start early work on special effects, like the big space battle and the alien ships or whatever.

They will bring the actors in for costume fittings, promotional shots, and script readings. They might walk through the sets and talk about the scenes that will go on there, and spend a little time getting to know areas that they're supposed to be familiar with.

The big day comes. They have the sets looking just the way they want, the actors are in their trailers, the script is good and the actors are satisfied, craft services have snacks out for everyone, the lighting department has everything perfect, the camera crew are set, it's the start of principle photography.

This is the easy part. You have a list of shots that need to be completed. They're usually organized for convenience, rather than the order they'll appear on the screen. Like if you have three scenes in a particular house that all take place at different times in the movie, they'll all be filmed in the same general time-frame, with wardrobe and lighting and set changes as necessary.

There's also a second and sometimes a third team of actors and directors working on things like tracking shots (where you can't see the actors close enough to notice it's really their stunt double) and insert shots (like a close-up of Batman grabbing something off his utility belt) where it doesn't really matter whose hand it is.

Once all the shots are ""in the can"" they move on to editing all the footage together into a film. The actors are free to go work on other projects. Now Spielberg is in a little room with his editor, a screen, and a tool for cutting and splicing film. They look for the best takes, and the best lengths for each scene. It's usually around this time that scoring and special effects work begins. (Some bigger FX-heavy movies, they send the scenes for special effects as soon as they have the actor's parts shot, instead of dumping the whole film on them at once.)


So he has FX shots coming in on a regular basis, he has the composer coming in to look at scenes and get a feel for things, and then returning with music, which he adds to the scenes. If necessary, he'll bring the actors back to shoot new scenes or record new dialogue. Maybe the wind was muffling the mic, maybe he decided he needs a scene where someone else builds a mashed potato mountain, stuff like that.

Once he has the cut he likes, he shows it to the studio. The contract will determine who has the final say in the film's edit. Spielberg has a lot of clout, so he generally will get his own way. Some films go to test at this point, where they bring in an audience and gauge their reaction. This might result in new edits or other changes, and it can also take them back to reshooting scenes again if necessary.

Once the studio, the audience, the director, the producer, the editor, the composer, and everyone else is happy, they create a master print of the finished product. This is usually the version of the film that gets screened at festivals and such. 

Around this time is when director and actor commentary gets recorded, usually at some festival or other promotional event.

Then the studio takes the master and uses it to print the copies that get sent out to theaters. This is generally about the time TV advertising starts. The promo shots were probably already released, but they'll use some of those to make posters and print ads and whatnot. 

The studio has a deal with theater chains, where they get a certain cut of ticket sales (on a sliding scale, the more recent the film, the higher the cut the studio takes). They send out the films, the people pour in, they buy lots of popcorn and snacks that the theaters actually use to stay in business, and the reviews start.

Meanwhile they use a copy of the master to get the DVD/Bluray production going. They slap in the commentary and other special features and schedule a release date.",null,0,cdn9iwx,1rh9u2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

Italy, by comparison, was full of old cities with narrow streets. Their economy was hurting because they had to recover from being on the losing side of WW2.  Scooters are small, inexpensive and take a fraction of the gas that a full-sized automobile does.

2) Infrastructure - Italy is old. Very old. The road system was built up on the assumption that most people would be on foot or a donkey, so in many places (especially smaller villages out in the country), there are streets a car can't even get down. 

And in the cities, as the population grew and more people bought cars, the traffic became (and still is) terrible. A scooter can scoot (naturally) through traffic jams, down unpassable back alleys, pedestrian-only streets, etc. 

And, last but certainly not least:

MisterFiftyFifty,"The Cuban Missile Crisis began, basically, as a combined result of two things: the Cuban Revolution that had happened fairly recently (1959), and NATO missiles that were placed in Turkey. 

The Cuban Revolution overthrew a particularly brutal dictator, Fulgencio Batista, who was backed by the U.S. basically because he was anti-communist. Once this happened, the Soviet Union saw a great opportunity for an ally: a communist nation led by a widely popular and charismatic leader (Fidel Castro) on the front doorstep of your arch-nemesis.

The missiles in Turkey were widely believed to be pointed at the heart of Soviet Russia, as Turkey is in a strategically valuable spot for doing so with ICBMs. The Soviets needed a counterbalance to this, and they saw it in the form of Cuba. 

What went down in a nutshell is that the U.S. noticed these huge missiles 90 miles from their coast, and through diplomatic maneuvering (and a naval blockade of Cuba) by President Kennedy and his entourage, convinced the Soviets to back off and remove the missiles in exchange for the missiles in Turkey being removed (they were later replaced by nuclear submarines anyways). No one wanted a nuclear war, despite the large amount of dick measuring that went on in the Cold War.


I'm not exactly sure what you mean in how the Cuban Missile Crisis connected into Vietnam. Vietnam was a completely different situation, and *official* involvement did not start until 1964, two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis. While the latter was more of a direct threat to America itself, Vietnam was somewhat more of a political gamble to stop the spread of communism, as had been done in Korea (though only halfway).

DeweyCheatemHowe,"The expense comes from legal fees and expert fees. 

Once the state declares it's intention to seek the death penalty, a defendant will automatically be appointed not only an attorney (assuming he's indigent), but probably a couple attorneys as well as a mitigation investigator. That person will go back to the defendants roots and dug up everything they can from the persons life that would help sway a jury to recommend life. There will likely be a sanity commission to determine whether he is competent to stand trial, consisting of several doctors. 

The state is also hiring experts, and will be spending extra man hours to ensure everything goes exactly right so a later court has no reason to reverse. Same thing goes for the trial court. 

So all that happens before trial. Day one of trial starts an exhausting version of the standard jury selection. Before the normal process starts, each juror may need to be media qualified (have they been biased by prior coverage of the case), and will need to be death qualified (whether they could vote for death under some set if facts or are they too against the death penalty to consider). Only then can the attorneys start regular jury selection. 

Trial will probably run 1-2 weeks. If guilty, then the jury comes back and hears testimony about the mitigating an aggravating factors (this is where that investigators work becomes relevant). Then they will vote on life/death. 

If death, (at least in my state) the defendant gets an auto appeal to the state Supreme Court. He will be appointed a different attorney for this, who will have to learn the case, go through the whole deal. Defendant argues anything and everything that he says went wrong from the moment the crime happened. 

If affirmed, he can petition the US Supreme Court to hear his case. Unlikely here. Then he starts state post conviction. New attorney, goes back to arguing constitutional challenges in the same court he was convicted. If affirmed, back to state Supreme Court and the petitioning the US Supremes.

 If he hasn't managed a new trial yet, he will file a petition for habeas corpus in fed district court, again arguing constitutional issues. If affirmed, he can go to the appellate court, and then petition the US Supreme Ct again. 

Only when the supremes deny his petition or affirm does his conviction become ""final."" Meanwhile, this whole time he's been housed in an ultra secure area of the prison by himself, rather than in the GP. 

Every appeal (except US Supreme Ct and maybe US Appeals) are of right. He gets them regardless, and taxpayers are paying his attorneys and fees (think of all the copies, for instance). If any court finds a a significant error, process restarts. Also, it's in the defendants best interest to fight to delay all of these, waiting for new rulings, new facts, or just more days on earth. 

Most defendants will then file some sort of 1983 claim alleging that the method of execution is unconstitutional. Usually some interest group pays his fees here, but the people still pay the state and the federal judge that'll hear it. 

Overall, it's not hard to see how the costs pile up.

A death sentence trial, with appeals, when totaled up in number of days averages around 1500, as compared to about 500 days for a life sentence. Three times as much. But the kicker is, recidivism. Yes. Recidivism! The term used to describe a failure, the failure to reform criminals, who serve their time and go free, only to end up back in jail as repeat offenders.

Brelya,"The death penalty in most states results in a bifurcated trial where the same jury (most of the time) sit through two ""trials"". The first is the guilt phase where they decided whether to convict a person.  The second is the penalty phase where the State and defense counsel each present relevant evidence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances so that finally the jury may decide whether that particular defendant should get the death penalty.

Defense counsel should invest a lot of time in looking for mitigating information prior to the case even going to trial because if convincing enough and if in the right place, the State may waive seeking the death penalty.

In some states the decision to impose death is then automatically reviewed by the State's supreme court for a proportionality review. They decide whether this person truly deserves the penalty in light of every other defendant that has received it.

During this time, appeals and post-conviction motions run wild. The defendant can assert many claims such as : ineffective assistance of counsel, unfair trial, etc. There are many avenues to have not only state courts but federal courts to review the case and claims the defendant might have. In every instance the State most likely will defend their position.

The prosecution (State) is financed by the state government and where the defendant is being represented by public defenders, that is also financed by the state government.

It is a long and arduous process but it costs money because **death is different**. It is a lot more sensitive and dangerous to put someone's life on the line without making sure the process is fair.

Now, he can go to federal court and ask for habeas corpus relief. When that is denied, he can appeal. Then he can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. When they choose not to hear the case, the defendant often tries desperate measures such as contesting the method of execution or claiming that there is newly discovered evidence that warrants a new trial.

All these appeals and due process take time. Transcripts of proceedings need to be ordered and created. Briefs need to be researched and written. Oral arguments are heard. The courts' written decisions need to be researched and written. This results in these appeals taking years.

Lizzipp,"Because if you want to kill someone, you've got to be *really really certain* they're guilty. An innocent person who was sentenced to life in prison could come out twenty years later when DNA evidence shows they were innocent, or the guilty party comes forward, or they could successfully appeal. That's not *ideal*, of course, but the point is it's not irreversible, where the death penalty is. If someone's been sentenced to death, you want to get all your appealing done *before* the sentence is carried out, and you have to delay it for as long as possible to ensure no one is going to come forward with new evidence that could potentially re-open the case, and also you *want* to delay it for as long as possible - you're going to demand every single appeal and retrial and whatever you can because at the end of all that you're going to die. You're going to be the biggest pain in the arse you possibly could.

Add to this the fact that the death penalty isn't legal in most countries, and in the ones that it is which are also a functioning democracy (the US) it's only legal in a handful of places. Say you commit your crime in Texas and flee to the UK, even if you're arrested in the UK you've got to be extradited back to Texas with is an extremely lengthy and therefore expensive process. The touchy nature of the subject is a real hindrance, since lots of countries believe the death penalty is immoral and may refuse to extradite someone if they believe they would face execution, in the same way they do for potential torture victims.

Also, ""life in prison"" is not always *life* in prison. Where I'm from, ""life in prison"" more often means 25-30 years although you can be sentenced to a ""whole life order"", which means there's no possibility of parole. It can easily take fifteen, twenty, thirty years on death row before the actual execution, maybe even more. So although the cost of an execution itself is pretty low, you're already adding that to what's essentially a life sentence, and that's before you take into account the cost of thirty year's worth of legal work.

poppop_n_theattic,"The level of judicial process to execute someone is much higher than for a life sentence, for three main reasons.  First, you cannot take back an execution.  Second, the public wants to believe that we only execute guilty people.  Third, the Supreme Court has said that only certain crimes and criminals are eligible for execution under the 8th Amendment, so there are additional legal issues in death cases that are not present in life-sentence cases.  The result is a very expensive legal process that usually goes on for years.  This is all aggravated by the fact that states often appoint lawyers who are inexperienced, underfunded, and in over their heads to represent capital defendants in their initial trials.  This leads to subsequent challenges that the trial was unfair due to inadequacy of counsel.

MistaSchlong,"Ok, so you know about digital devices.  Think about a binary switch: something that just turns on and off.  That's what a neuron does: it just turns on and off.  At the end of a neuron, there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too.  These signals are made of molecules, and we call these molecules neurotransmitters.  We won't need to talk about these neurotransmitters, but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them, they're really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn on.

OK, your brain is made of neurons.  (It's also made of other types of cells, but the most simple, straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail.)  ""Knowledge,"" is stored in these neurons.  Now, because a neuron can only, essentially, turn on and off, the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easier.

Making the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms.  You can make the neuron more ""sensitive"" to neurotransmitters.  (This can, for instance, happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor.)  Likewise, you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing ""sensitivity"" to neurotransmitters.

Note: you may have heard of the term Action Potential.  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns on.

Now, knowing that a neuron can turn on and off, and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off, I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar.  Chords are made up of notes, and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings.  Basically turning them on or keeping them off.

However, and this is the key, with just a few chords, you can play millions of different songs.  It's just about how the chords are played; the timing, the tempo, the coordination.  Similarly, the firing of neurons, on and off, in combination, generates recall of stored knowledge.  And knowledge is stored in how easily or difficult these neurons are fired on and off.",null,0,cdnep8v,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

airor,"The memories are stored in the pattern of sequences your neurons fire throughout your brain.  

A single neuron will tend to fire at a rate determined by the neurons attached to it, so groups (cortical columns) of neurons tend to fire at the same time and at a steady rate.  This rate can be influenced by other groups of neurons firing at nearly the same rate such that the two groups start to synchronize.  Patterns form as the different rates compete for synchronization throughout your brain.  

Some of your neurons are directly connected and influenced by sensory input and tend to sync to that input.  Due to the feedback of all the other neuron groups the input can be predicted: the pattern is recognized and other groups start performing the pattern that is the expected future sequence of input.  The brain is built to allow for many layers of this pattern recognition dance, each layer ""predicting"" the future output by simply repeating the patterns that occurred the previous times it received that input.

When the pattern is 'confirmed' and the input really does follow the expectation, the two groups stay in synchronization and new connections are made to strengthen that pattern.  When dissonance occurs and the input does not match with a group, the connections to that group weaken.  So in effect your brain evolves the connections between neuron groups that correctly predict the future.

How is that a stored memory?  There are areas of your brain that can 'fake' sensory input into the system and let it perform it's dance.  This ability gives us the power to imagine situations and remember previous input.  The feedback and the flurry of patterns that emerge as we 'think' is horrendously complex and not well understood because we can't reproduce how it actually works.

Human beings are far from the most physically powerful animals. A human living alone in the wild is putting himself at great risk and has a statistically lower chance of surviving. So, our evolutionary survival strategy is cooperation. One human in the wild might be weak, but 150 humans? The chances of survival drastically increase. Throughout history we have seen countless examples of the society that cooperates more out competing societies that focus on the individual. It's how the Romans were able to defeat the Gauls so easily. A single roman soldier couldn't hope to defeat a single Gaul warrior. But put two or more of those discipined Romans together, and something happens.  They become stronger than two individuals. They become a synergy: where the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Thus, the people who have a natural inclination to cooperate with each other are more likely to survive and pass those traits to their offspring. Now to your question. 

In order to survive and thrive, a stable home is needed. Our ancestors survived due to a stable home and family unit. The desire for a stable and lasting home was passed down to us.

Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy,  and even Gluten Ataxia.

Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes.

Celiac is a life threatening response to gluten.  However there isn't much science investigating the responses that aren't as pressing.  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance, which is characterized by a host of symptoms including ""bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain.

indianatodd,"There aren't many ELI5 responses so I'll give it a shot. Gluten is a protein in wheat and other grains that causes an immune reaction. Some people have a greater response than others and since it is an autoimmunity deal, it effects people differently (digestion, joints, sinuses, etcetera). Just like a vaccine, when you have antibodies against something your body sees as harmful, they stick around as your soldiers and fight for you for a long time. If you got fat/sick/unhealthy while simultaneously eating a bunch of gluten, your ""soldiers"" don't want you to go back or continue down that dangerous road and fight for you anytime they see gluten. Cutting out gluten stops that immunity response (chronic systemic inflammation) and avoiding traces of it keeps your antibodies from getting to work without an actual threat.

Disgruntledtech,"I'd like to also throw in here that celiac is not the only..feasable reason people eat glueten free foods.  There's also a theory about a link between gluten and autistic children.

The theory is that autistic children have a hyper-sensitivity to foods containing gluten and that they process peptides and protiens differently than other people do. The idea behind the use of the diet is to reduce the symptoms that come with autism.

So..there's tons of studies for this, and tons against it.  I dont work with autisic kids but my son is autistic and we do things with the autism society here in my town, so i know MANY special needs kids and their parents that are advocates of this theory, and say it helps.

I'd attribute the boom in gluten free products to this theory coupled with the rise of kids with autism, awareness of celiac, and health nuts in general.

Before people start jumping to the downvote button, id like to say that i'm not advocating this theory, and im not against it.  We know very little about autism as a whole, and if your child is afflicted by it, then you'll try anything to help.  Im simply letting people know its out there because it pertains to this post.

They also had a bunch of other physical symptoms that we didn't attribute to gluten until they were off gluten for about a month. Headaches, joint pain.

Apparently due to the creation of genetically modified crops of wheat to make the wheat more resistant to pests and the fact that this heartier strain of wheat has essentially spread everywhere it is the only wheat available. Hence you're hearing about more people who can't properly digest what was a staple food for thousands of years. Though gluten is in other things such as rye, oats, and maltodextrin (which may be a wheat product) so I'm not terribly sure how those fit into the hearty wheat theory.

It's more than a little worrisome seeing that we can actually make our food supply inedible even if it's a small percentage of people.

legowife,"As a diet (as in a way you eat to lose weight) it's a fad. Replacing non-gluten free foods with gluten free foods has no garuntee to make you lose weight. One caveat however is that if you do not replace wheat bread and other gluten products with a comparable gluten free product (which are often higher in calories and sugar) then the likelyhood is that you will have actually entered into a low/lower carb diet than you were eating previously and maybe even a lower calorie diet purely because you are avoiding foods with gluten and haven't replaced them with something else. Low carb diets do have a great track record for weight loss. Whether it is a healthy method or not is a matter of some debate.

On the flip side, the gluten free diet (as in what you eat to live and sustain yourself long term) is imperative for people with Celiacs who are directly allergic to it, and some other conditions like crohns which are deeply irritated by the gluten protein, and it can also be beneficial for those who have or suspect they may have other digestive sensitivities as they work with their doctor to eliminate possible causes.

In no case is purchasing a gluten free product a necessity for eating gluten free as the number of foods that are naturally gluten free is enormous, but it does make the transition easier for some.

There's even a subreddit for it here: [/r/frisson](http://www.reddit.com/r/frisson)

Frisson is a fear response. You can read about its link to music [here](http://www.thesandb.com/article/science-links-music-to-goose-bumps.html).
This article states that the reasoning behind the ""fear response"" is the ear responding to the ""threat""--aka something similar to the pitch of a scream.

But, now, *what I want to know* is why we feel frisson when we listen to a moving speech, recall a memory, look at a beauty scene etc (something that doesn't necessarily involve a pitch.)

My only guess is that I think, in general, fear is not just overwhelming feelings of being scared, but the basic feeling intended to help you identify change (and thus orient yourself to your surroundings to avoid possible danger.) Perhaps beautiful things can be so striking to us that it fires off a ""noticeable change in the environment"" signal. Even though it's not something that can threaten us, it's something that affects us/causes us to hyper focus our attention so much (and usually so suddenly) that it triggers the same response.

maestro2005,"Okay so, nobody here is right.  Not even doovidooves with his 110 upvotes.  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording, and ""classical"" versus ""modern"" isn't the right way to break things down.

First, some terminology.  I'm going to refer to it as ""Classical"" versus ""Popular"".  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music (e.g. Gregorian chant), certain types of Renaissance music (motets, madrigals, etc.), the Baroque period, the Classical period, the Romantic period, and modern periods that we don't quite have the historical context to classify yet.  It continues to be written today.

Popular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created, which today involves the rock combo with guitars, basses, drum sets, keyboards, etc., but includes folk music all the way back.  It actually predates Classical.

Popular music has always been meant to be easily imitable.  In the days before recording, it was meant to be played/sung by amateur musicians in the home, or around the campfire, or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be.  It's simpler music, not that impressive in its composition, so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer.  And usually, there aren't that many performers, which makes it simpler still.

Classical music is not meant to be easily imitated.  The forms are longer and more complicated, and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master.  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits.  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor.  We marvel at the composer's ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece.  We still marvel at the performers, but we marvel more at the composer.  Many people can both write and play Popular music.  Few can play Classical music, and even fewer can write it.

Recording and distribution has changed things a bit.  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular (we do still use that but not exclusively), we can record the world's best Popular musicians and distribute that recording.  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction (see: Metal).

Bob Dylan was the first major artist to really cross this bridge--a number of artists popularized his work (e.g. Peter, Paul &amp; Mary--Blowin' in the Wind, The Byrds--Mr Tambourine Man, Jimi Hendrix--All Along the Watchtower) but there was no mistaking how powerful an artist Dylan was once you heard him (with all this non-commercial idiosyncrasies) perform his own compositions.

It's simple, the composer of the classical piece is of course the one to have his name associated with the piece, he/she wrote it. 

The popular artist may not have written the song, but they are performing it, they are the artist and it is on their album. It *does* say on albums who wrote the song. But you know it by the artist who performed it and it appears on their album. For example, it wouldn't make sense to say, ""Thriller"" by Rod Temperton, because it was ""made popular"" by Michael Jackson. Thriller is a part of Michael Jackson's catalogue because it was written specifically ""for him."" He performed it on his album. 

Imagine saying, I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Burt Bacharach. That doesn't make very much sense, but ""I'm going to listen to ""Walk on by"" by Dionne Warwick makes sense because she is the performer. Stating the composer tells nothing about the particular version of the song for popular music, where on the other hand: I 'm going to listen to ""Moonlight Sonata"" the performer is not as important because each version will be the exact same rendition of the piece written by Beethoven, who also made it popular. 

It doesn't have anything to do with the times being different or money, orchestral music is still composed today, but it's the composer's piece, therefore his name is on it.

Classical music has no lyrics, and therefore the only person who stands out is the conductor (someone who doesn't actually play or write the music, rather, interpenetrates between the two).

afcagroo,"There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.   
   
To broadcast a radio signal, we make an antenna that will resonate at the frequency we want to send. This is done mainly by controlling its length, so that as a wave travels down to the end and bounces back, it does so in a way that provides constructive interference (rather than destructive). The wave in the antenna creates a field that propagates out into space as an electromagnetic wave.  When it hits an antenna of the proper length, it induces a wave in it, and again constructive interference helps to keep it strong enough to be amplified and demodulated.  
  
Electrical current doesn't follow the path of least resistance.  That is an oversimplified saying that is not accurate.  Electrical current follows *all* possible paths, with more current going where there is less resistance.  
  
But in an antenna, there generally isn't a lot of current flow, because there's no place for the current to go. What happens is that the electric *field* propagates down the conductor.

This means that in order for food to get down it, it has to pass over the trachea's opening. If it goes down there, it can obstruct your airway, and you choke (to death is optional).

Normally you don't choke. This is because of a handy flap of tissue at the top back of the trachea, which flops down and covers the opening when you swallow. Most of the time this works and you don't choke, occasionally it doesn't. When it doesn't, the food will undergo one of a few possible outcomes.

It'll usually be expelled by coughing; The lining of the trachea is very sensitive to foreign objects.  For very small particles (or water) it'll pass down into the lungs. Here it will usually be destroyed by macrophages (little cells that absorb stuff, a lot of them hang out in the lungs for just this purpose). Option 3 is that it doesn't come out at all. This may or may not be fatal. For example, bones from meat can lodge in an airway and not actually kill you (although you're at high risk of infection).

Digital, though, is just 1s and 0s.  Literally. A series of on states and off states.
If that comes through weaker, it's still just 1s and s.  
So, with digital, it's an all or nothing thing, so, signal quality does not matter as much.            
Secondly,  and this one is why people get so about it, is that all those quality enhancements on monster cables? They are complete lies.  Gold plating does nothing to enhance signal, and almost nothing to enhance the connection.  If they used gold the whole way through, it would, but it would also make the cables heavy and far too expensive to be profitable.     
The extra rubber around the outside? it does nothing for the signal.  Just makes the wires more physically durable.    
Those fancy connector heads? all for show.  They do not enhance signal at all.        
In short, monster cable has always lied about why monster cable was better; In modern times, even if they're promises were true, they'd be irrelevant, because the way we send signals does not care about strength much anymore.          
Oh, and the 200 monster cable is not only indistinguishable in quality from a 4 dollar one-

Posty1980,"This applies only to their analog audio cables, anything digital is 100% or nothing. According to Monster Inc. they learned that high frequency and low frequency signals travel though the cable at slightly different speeds. They created a special type of wrapping for the cables, thicker gauge wire in the center, and thinner gauge but more tightly wrapped on the outside. Basically it slows the high frequency sounds down because they wind up having to travel farther. I've done a side by side comparison with analogue Monster audio cables and regular audio cables, and there was a very noticeable improvement.

Good greenscreen footage requires specific lights which may not be what the set would call for without green screen. Hair or green reflections in skin, as well as other tricky materials cause all kinds of trouble.

josh4rim,"**Jaw Impact**

A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin around. This quick motion of causes trauma to the brain that knocks the recipient out leaving him unconscious. Points on the jaw that are especially vulnerable to knockouts are the sides of the chin, and where the jaw is attaches to the skull.

**Acceleration and Deceleration**

When the jaw is punched, the head quickly accelerates around. After a fraction of a second, it quickly decelerates as muscles, tendons, and bones prevent the head from spinning any further. The brain inside the skull is floating in fluid. It accelerates slower than the rest of the head. This forces it to crash into the inside of the skull when the head stops.


**Brain Trauma
**
When the brain slams into the inside of the skull, it suffers trauma. It then bounces off the inside of the skull and slams into the opposite side. This causes even more trauma. Depending on the force of the punch, this can happen several times before the brain comes to rest inside the skull.

**Nervous System Response**

The trauma to the brain stimulates an overwhelming number of neurotransmitters to fire at the same time. This essentially overloads the nervous system sending it into a state of temporary paralysis. The person who is hit in the jaw loses consciousness and his muscles relax. The injured person falls to the ground with no memory of being hit.

**Recovery**

A person who is knocked out by a punch to the jaw suffers a severe concussion. It can take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes to regain consciousness. It all depends on the severity of the brain trauma. In mild cases, the person who is knocked out can shake off the punch with little more than a headache. In severe cases, brain trauma from a knockout punch to the jaw can cause cerebral bleeding and death.

The best way your brain can do this, is to turn off as much of the brain as it can as to avoid damage to active parts - sort of like how you can drop a hard drive when it's off and it can be fine but when you turn it on the slightest drop can really mess it up.  
It's a bad analogy but you get the point I assume.  
This is how brain transplants are possible without damaging someone's brain.  
This isn't the only reason however, as the brain also perceives you getting hit as a threat that you could possibly make worse by acting out of fear or knee-jerk reaction.  
So your brain hits the wall of your skull, decides ""If I'm working too hard while this keeps happening it can cause serious damage so I'm going on standby until I feel safe.""  
This is why some people can pass out from being frightened, as they perceive a threat and the brain wants you to just relax and stay still, that is what it feels is the safest.

School, Movies, Sitcoms, Religions, Youtube, Fraternaties, and everywhere else you go, the mind is treated like a shake-toy.

Children are encouraged to hit the soccer ball with their head.  Kids put their heads in hard plastic spheres and hit it against others as the crowd cheers.  Take your jet engine and wrap it with some padding and throw it off a one story building. Your brain has the consistency of jello and your skull has the consistency of stone.  If I take your brain and pour it into a square bowl, it will take the shape of that bowl.  Vibrating your head will cause ripples and vibrations in that jello.  Shake hard enough and you get scarring, blood clots that expand and push and leak between the modules to cause destruction of neurons.

Getting knocked out causes undiagnosed subdural hematomas which is when blood leaks out of the arteries to flood the neurons and it suffocates a sub-net of your mind as scabbing occurs to stop the leak.  The brain being the most remarkable instrument on the planet can remap old functionality onto new hardware in an instant.  Normally scarring occurs anywhere along the edges of your mind, and your dedicated employees of yours (the 30 million layers of hierarchical hidden markov models) disappear.  Car accidents.  Getting punched.  Hitting your head on the ice.  Contact sports, falling out of the crib cracking your skull open.  Being ""Knocked out"" or a having a concussion.  If your brain experiences a shock of more than 7 G's, you may get brain damage.  The brain can re-map functionality (quite quickly) to other parts of the brain, it will heal itself, but you will be running your hardware system with fewer resources.

noptotsch,"Basically, a person knocked out is saving energy for primary body function by blocking functions strictly unnecessary to survival. It's physically processing a (huge) blow (to that person). This can be mentally, coming from a shock or otherwise difficult context of input to your brain, this can be physically as a reaction to a huge slam, bloodloss or otherwise. The result of knockout is in any case a physical reaction where the body physically switches back to survival mode by disabling secondary physical body functions such as seeing, smelling, moving. Sometimes the body already does this to prevent further damage by say assessing and processing any mental or physical (most often sudden) blow to its perception of reality (you can get knock out as shock, no physical blow recieved here), so this can happen as a precaution where physically your body doesn't necessarily needs to shutdown these secondary functions. 

BTW, going more directly into your question, assuming 'trend game' is something like people kneeling down and suddenly stand up to faint; this is like physically draining the oxygen from your head, people sometimes do it by kicking each other in the lungs or stomach too, by suddenly standing up your brain notices decrease of oxygen in bloodflow and shuts down to save the energy for primary function, sort of survival reflex.

PRATFO,"I don't know about any of the explanations that the brain ""shuts down"" for protective reasons, I just don't see the adaptive benefit to this unless you're arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult. This simply is not the case, if anything, the blood flow is increased following impact. This is the basis of second-impact syndrome. When there is concussion, brain function is altered, resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time. Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate. As a result of this dilation, there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edema.

As to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness, I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement. There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal. The details probably aren't worth going into. But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries. This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness, likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants, such as the Moro reflex, which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change. This reflex originates in the pons. 

ELI5: Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem, where the arousal network is. This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed, this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem, this is called the fencing response.

Whether it be getting hit on the jaw, being in a car crash, etc, all of this causes a fast acceleration to your head. Your brain is suspended in fluid and there is nothing else that keeps it apart from the skull. When sudden acceleration or deceleration happens, it will cause the brain to smash against the skull. This will cause trauma or damage and result in being ""knocked out.""

Another way can be when your brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters. Whether it be pain, flashing lights (epilepsy), and so on, if the brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters it will overload and shut down for it's own safety. 

In the case of an oxygen deficiency, do people remember the ""game"" where people used to play by choking each other until they pass out? In order for the brain to function, it needs a continuous stream of oxygen being . When oxygen is cut off, it results in cerebral hypoxia. When you get choked either by someone else, a belt, a rope or anything, it cuts off the blood supply to your head. The oxygen is carried through your blood, thus it results in cerebral hypoxia.

Why porting Android to a device is a hassle is because it's not as simple as just compiling it against a certain version of the OS. Pretty much all of your time is spent making the kernel work properly with the new version of the OS.

For example - 1 blade does not work because it'll rip itself apart (imagine spinning a large bucket around yourself while staying on the same spot. the bucket will pull you off your feet). 2 blades fix this problem somewhat but they are not as efficient. 3 blades are great and way more balanced.

Now the size consideration comes mainly from the fact that it's important for you to turn the blades as fast around as possible (to generate electricity) and not how much air you can actually collect. The size and shape of the blades balances between the strengths of the materials, costs of construction and maintenance and power generated.

Up until the K-T extinction event, one could have easily asked ""Why does evolution in the long run seem to favor larger animals?"". Terrestrial vertebrates had been steadily getting larger ever since they crawled onto land in the Devonian period, culminating in the truly gigantic archosaurs during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. 

This was a period from roughly ~400 million years ago to 65 million years ago during which animals pretty much kept getting bigger. That's over 300 million years worth of evolution, a much longer trend than the reversal in the last 65 million years.

Using the same principle I described you can see that the new animal has only 4 times the surface area of the smaller animal. So you have more animal and less area for heat to escape from.

At this time, the animals that are best adapted to the old environment, will suddenly lose all of their advantages and either die outright or be displaced by something else.

Fairleee,"The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history - it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures, because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing - this universally agreed thing is called a standard. There are a number of different standards, and sometimes we don't have a single one. Consider something like transferring data between devices. The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer, but it isn't the only one - however, because it is so popular, most devices will have a USB port.

In terms of distance, these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do - basically, if we didn't have a standard system of measurement for length, then mass production of components couldn't exist, which would mean that we wouldn't be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform way.

The meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length. This is similar to the celsius system of temperature, which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system. However, the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough, or constant enough, to be fully acceptable. So, part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant. To measure time, a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom - I can't remember details off the top of my head. For distance, the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain (incredibly tiny) period of time.

As for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere, yes, there is! There is a prototype meter (kept in France, I believe), and a number of almost identical (with the tiniest, tiniest variations, and the variations of which are recorded) meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards. So basically, precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter. Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these, and so on, and so on. 

So, a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate, but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing. However, if you are doing a job that requires a very, very, very high degree of accuracy (such as precision engineering), then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration. And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the world.

ELY20 (explain like you're 20):
Before van Gogh, what mattered was the subject. The painting had to look like the object it was supposed to represent. An artist was only good when creating a variation on a subject matter.
After van Gogh, the intent of the artist became more important. The painting no longer had to represent a specific object. Van Gogh is part of a larger move towards abstraction where the final painting is only the end-product of a longer process. The [Starry Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) is a picture of a starry night and the way van Gogh felt before that scene, both at the same time. That is why the psychological aspect is so important in understanding his paintings. It would take the work of other great artists before full abstraction became recognized as a form of art.

TedTschopp,"TL;DR:  Van Gogh is considered good because he tricks you into thinking you are seeing a painting of a flower, when in reality you are looking at abstract brush strokes.

Let's take his [Irises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gogh,_Vincent_van_-_Irises_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) painting.  The reason he is so considered to be so good is that the painting above generates inside of people the impression of seeing a field of Irises while not actually using all the forms and colors of an actual purple [Irises](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BWtpA40ghG4/TaNyV4qcyCI/AAAAAAAAASk/6-5q4Rq2hHY/s1600/purple_irises.jpg).   

To see where this started; painters at one point were basically cameras and someone like Martin Johnson Heade produced a painting called [Birds and flowers](http://www.painting-analysis.com/oiseaux300.jpg).  Then people like Monet started to question this dogma with paintings like [Nympheas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nympheas_71293_3.jpg).  When Van Gogh and other painters at his time came around they pushed these questions harder and with more rigor than those before.  Following Van Gogh people like Picasso pushed this idea even further [Flowers in a Grey Jug and Wine-Glass with Spoon](http://www.artgalleryabc.com/images/stories/P/Picasso/picasso232.JPG).  In all of these images you get the idea and feeling of a flower and that is what an artist does.  Its not their job to reproduce a flower as it is seen.  Their job is to make you -feel- like you saw THE FLOWER.

i_accidently_reddit,"To understand this, we need to look at the history of writing in the west.

In the modern day western world, we use the Latin alphabet. The Romans however first wrote in Greek.

But maybe you know, just how much of a chip the Romans had on their shoulder about not being seen as as smart and as cultivated as the Greeks. So while Greek still was lingua franca in the Roman Empire, they got really obsessed with their own culture and language and tried very hard to make Latin the dominant language in the Mediterranean.

And of course, developing a own typography goes a long way in setting the two languages apart. This led to what we now know as the Latin alphabet, excluding J, W and U, and all upper case.

Seeing however, that it is quite tedious to write all those big capital letters all the time, the written language evolved into what is called a uncial script.

All the letters are still majuscules, but the beginning of a sentence or a important wort is capitalized. so essentially its smaller capital letters, if that makes sense?

Now this is were the fun part starts: typographers are a weird bunch of people, they are both artists and geometers. Back then, every written text was basically a piece of art, with the capitalised letters being carefully ornated, trying to reflect the tenor of the writing. And the typographer himself knows how the properties of some letters within the text, impact the whole synthesis of his art work.

And seeing that he has some sort of artistic freedom, he just cant allow a A, H or R to destroy the natural flow of text he is trying to convey.

Fun fact on the side: there are Latin papyri dating back to around the turn of the eras, that include lower case letters for the before mentioned a, h or r.

So from there on, it is basically just years and years (two thousand and counting) of improving on the given letters. And this is still happening, for example the upper case S used to have two lower case letters, "" s  "" and "" ſ "" which we got rid of basically just recently, in the beginning of 20th century. Or the english ""th"" used to be the a rune called thorn and fell out of favour in the middle ages.

so **TL;DR:**
Romans wrote Latin in Greek.

Now repeat that over hundreds of words and all you have are hundreds of different rectangles where the only difference is their letter length. It all comes down to word recognition based on something called ""shape contrast"". 

For example the words ""PENNY"" and ""PENCIL"" are hard to differentiate quickly when they're all caps. However, ""Penny"" and ""Pencil"" are much easier due to the shape contrast of ascenders and descenders.

OnionSquire,"When you sleep your body releases a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). What GABA does is effectively paralyze your body, or at the very least, your brains ability to move muscles. This occurs during REM sleep when you're dreaming; it's to prevent you from acting out your dreams, your body expends next to no energy in this state and consumes very little oxygen. This is only one reason why you don't fall off the bed though. REM sleep, when you're actually dreaming, only happens in 90 minuet intervals and only lasts a precious few minutes. So that dream you had where you were skate boarding down a big hill that lasted for hours, only took up a few moments of your actual time. 

There are 5 stages to sleep. N-REM 1, N-REM 2, N-REM 3, N-REM 2 again, and REM. During this cycle, outside of REM, your body and mind are effectively awake. You're not aware of your surroundings, but you're aware enough to know when there's an edge near you, or a predator, and you move away. Incidentally, if you ever get the feeling like you're falling when you're going to sleep, this occurs in N-REM 2 where ""sleep spindles"" happen.

Throne3d,"Speaking from past experience, braces which are not removable do not really seem to have sharp points on the individual brackets (the metal pieces glued to the teeth), except for on those brackets where elastic bands could be required (in my case it was the third tooth from the middle on both sides, on both the top and bottom of the mouth).

The wire, however, which is attached to / threaded through these brackets, is made of some sort of memory alloy which (when bent away from its ""set"" position) will try to bend back to what it was ""set"" to (the 'correct' shape of the mouth / layout of the teeth).

Sometimes the wire is not cut enough towards the back of the mouth where it pokes out at the end of the brackets, and is (usually) able to cut the inside of the mouth. If the gum scrapes along it (while chewing or speaking, for example), it is likely to damage the inner lining of the cheek. 

Alternatively, as the teeth move into position, the wire may end moving around in the braces (as it is not fixed into position, from what I can tell, but instead is kept close to the brackets by being enclosed). This could cause it to be fine when the orthodontist first puts the wire in, but then get worse as you go along (until the next time the braces are 'tightened' / rewired).

Oh, and as /u/Sunfried has mentioned - there are two main types of pain with braces, in my experience.

Braces suck. They don't look great, they're painful, uncomfortable, and even when they're gone they leave you with shitty bits of glue on your teeth, but for all their crappiness, they do leave you with nice straight teeth!",null,0,cdnoddj,1rhzq1,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
Pandashriek,"I am a current bracers wearer and I am one of those unlucky ones. You see, not all people have those sharp bracers. For example, after the 3rd tooth, all my bracers have hooks which are damned sharp. Those are used at a later stage in order to correct the whole jaw. Rubber bands are put on those hooks in order to exert pressure and correct the jaw.

To be honest, to say that no one has come up with a solution to the problem is bull crap. You just didn't research on the matter enough. When I did put my bracers, I was allowed to choose from multiple designs. I chose titanium, mini bracers which resemble the classic ones - just smaller. However, there were all sorts of other materials and designs. There was these ones made of some kind of a ceramic material, which was the same color as the teeth and the manifacturer claimed that they are way smoother. The most interesting ones where a type of bracers that were glued to the inside of your mouth, rather than the outside. Initially, I though of getting these, but my dentist told me that the classic design is the most efficient.

If your little girl suffers from the bracers, there is another clever solution - dental wax. You can get it from every drug store/pharmacy etc. It is a bit like chewing gum, but more dense and hard. You just take a bit from the dental wax, roll it into a ball and stick it to the the places that cause pain to your little girl. It's purpose is actually to smoothen the bracers so they dont tear the inside of your poor girl's mouth. This clever thing saved from countless of sleepless nights.

Good look to you and your little girl.

debman,"There are several parts to braces that can be sharp. The braces themselves, which may cause some irritation at first but her lips will get used to. The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth, like others have noted. However, they also have to be cut to fit her mouth— sometimes if the wire is too long, they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain. This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire, bending the tips of the wire, or using dental wax as others have suggested. I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself- it's a few cents to them, free to you, and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter. 


As to why it's metal, there are several other statements that essentially address the issue. The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth, yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire. Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheap—there simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility, cost, etc. Unfortunately, cutting metal leads to sharp edges, unless it's treated with something to smooth out the edge. As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out, they don't do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut.

Salacious-,"[Because there is a big treaty that most countries signed that says ""We won't try to get nuclear weapons""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty).

restricteddata,"[The same question came up on here a day or two ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rf3m3/eli5_why_can_some_countries_decide_who_can_and/); here's what I wrote there:

In the early 1960s, the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb. Maoist China had just set one off, and was considered a pretty looney ""rogue state"" at the time (Cultural Revolution and all that), and was a mutual enemy to both. Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism, there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future, as opposed to the five that then existed (US, USSR, UK, France, China). They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence (e.g. once China has nukes, you can't threaten China with nukes without being threatened back), and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to all-out nuclear war (which neither the US or the USSR wanted).

But the problem is that they didn't want to give up their own nukes. They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation. Once a country has nukes, a whole new (potentially stabilizing) political order emerges. They didn't want to give that up, they just wanted to stop _new_ political orders (which they saw as destabilizing) from cropping up elsewhere. 

The countries without nukes, of course, were like, wait, you guys get nukes, but we don't? Lame. So they made the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) include sections that said that the so-called Nuclear States (the ones that already had them) would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well. This is Article VI, which states:

&gt; Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.

Well that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding. All of them are willing to say, ""sure, we'll get rid of our nukes if everyone else does"" but they all know that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

So why would a non-nuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is? Not so much because of the disarmament clause, but more because the NPT also says that non-nuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of ""peaceful"" nuclear energy as well. So they get help with reactors and things like that, as long as they agree to safeguards that won't let them weaponize any of it. It's also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region — if everyone in, say, South America agrees to not get the bomb (and this is enforced by means of the NPT), then that means you don't have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get one.

In practice things have always been messier than that. For one reason, not everybody signed the treaty. There were _many_ non-signatories/non-ratifiers until the end of the Cold War. Among them were two of the named nuclear states (France and China, both of whom did help other states proliferate), and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear (Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa), as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear (i.e. Egypt, Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil).

rsdancey,"After WWII ended, the United States thought that there were only two options.  Either nuclear weapons needed to be turned over to an international agency for use only in the enforcement of collective security, or there would be unlimited proliferation leading in short order to a nuclear Third World War.

The civilian benefits of nuclear technology were overstated.  People thought that nuclear power generation would replace conventional power generation very quickly.  The potential of nuclear medicine was just being investigated but hopes were high.  So most countries wanted access to nuclear technology.

The problem is that nuclear reactors using uranium, the easiest and first technology available, produce plutonium as they operate.  That plutonium can be removed from spent fuel and reprocessed to make nuclear weapons.  There is no good way to allow unlimited nuclear power generation without creating a nuclear weapon proliferation risk.

Once the Soviet Union developed its own nuclear weapon, it was no longer possible for the US to imagine giving up its own weapons to an international body.  In the end, an international treaty was developed that traded the right of a country to operate nuclear reactors for the enforcement of rules that prohibited the development of nuclear weapons.  This treaty called on the powers that had nuclear weapons as of the date it came into force to eliminate those weapons ""as fast as possible"" so that eventually no nation would have nuclear arms.  Those countries were the US, the USSR, the UK, France and China.  Coincidentally, those countries are also the veto-wielding permananent members of the UN Security Council which, via the language of the nuclear weapon / nuclear power treaty serves as the arbiter and enforcer of that treaty.

A small number of countries have never signed the treaty, or have withdrawn from it, which is how India, Pakistan, North Korea and Isreal have built their weapons programs.  Technically they should face crippling economic sanctions and potentially military action to force them to comply with the treaty even though they are not signatories, but practically the decision has been made to enforce those penalties ad hoc or not at all.

The problem with the treaty is the danger of dual-use.  A country can remain within the limits of the treaty while preparing itself to make nuclear weapons.  It can create enriched uranium or extract plutonium up to a limit.  It can conduct research on the triggers and controlled explosions used in nuclear weapons.  And then it can break the treaty and ""dash"" for a weapon, trying to get the work done before it faces international consequences.  North Korea shows that once you have nukes you probably can't be forced to give them up.  This is why Iran is so worrisome.  They are following the classic path to use the legal limits of the treaty to position themselves for a quick sprint to a bomb.  In fact they have repeatedly violated the treaty,and been caught, which reinforces the world opinion that they are planning to make bombs.",null,2,cdnkqx7,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

DrCeratops,"Police officers only enforce a portion of all laws. Only federal law enforcement can enforce federal law. Federal law enforcement officers cannot enforce state/town/city ordinances or laws. The opposite is true for local officers and federal laws. Additionally, most police officers enforce only criminal (statutory) laws, which is a small portion of the law as a whole. 

The laws that are enforced are usually agency and division specific. This means that the San Francisco Police direct the majority of their patrols to fight San Francisco-specific crime, whereas the California Highway Patrol focus on the highways that run through San Francisco and California, and the BART Police focus on crime occurring on the transportation systems of the San Francisco/Bay Area. Furthermore, different divisions of different agencies have different focuses. Examples are drug enforcement units, gang units, alcohol licensing units, etc. Individuals of those divisions will know their specific areas better than they would other laws.

For the most part you only need to identify that a crime has or is occurring. For example, if you see someone snatching a purse and running away, you don't need to know the specifics of the law that was broken to respond, you know that a law was broken (don't get me wrong, you SHOULD). You can stop that individual/deal with the situation, and look up the most-specific charge afterwards.

Consider every human farting,. Or even,.
Consider the first bacteria that changed the world by using photosynthesis to make our planet have so much oxygen.

The environment is always changing. The environment we want to keep is one that ensures humans can live in it.

So what we want to do is eliminate things that can change the environment. Pets produce many environmental waste just as making pencils do. The idea behind it is to eliminate as much as we can slowly over time. Pets do not produce that much of a concern to the ecosphere as coal burning does. If we changed green house emissions,. Suddenly we need to learn how to clean up these landfills. If we learn how to get rid of landfill waste, suddenly we need to learn how to incorporate our society and cities from being invasive to other species. The list will always go on. Someday we might get to pets, and if we ever get to that point, it just means that pets will be the number 1 on the list of changing our environment in a way we don't want.

Remember that climate change and environmental impact isn't necessary black and white. What we are really doing when we tell people to be green and conserve, is just try and manipulate the change of the ecosphere in a way that is beneficial to human society. We are really worried about things that could really impact our ecosphere and change it in ways we don't want, and those factors are much larger than the pet industry.

TheRockefellers,"There are about a million ways of scoring tennis, but I'm assuming you're talking about what you see in the pros. Here's the big picture:

To win a tennis match, you must:

* Win a majority of the **sets** (best of 3 for women, best of 5 for men);

* To win a **set**, you must be the first to win **6 games**, and you must win by two; or if both sides are tied at 6 games each, they play a **tiebreaker** (a specific type of game) to win the set;

* To win a **game**, you must win four (or more) points, and **you must win by two points.**

Now, as for game scoring:

* 0 points = love

* 1 point = 15 (or sometimes called ""5"")

* 2 points = 30

* 3 points = 40

* A tie at 3 points or more = deuce

If both players reach deuce, we kind of stop keeping track of the total number of points, since all that matters at this point is winning by 2.  So at this time, you abandon your numbers. Instead, the score is:

* Deuce, if the players are tied (as noted above)

* ""Ad in"" or ""advantage in"" if the **server** has one more point than the receiver (in which case the server wins the game if he wins the next point)

* ""Ad out"" or ""advantage out"" if the **receiver** has one more point than the server(in which case the receiver wins the game if he wins the next point)

Also, before each point serve, the score will be announced. The order of the numbers matters; the first is the server's score, and the second is the receiver's.  So if you hear ""30-15,"" you know that the server has two points to the receiver's one.

So here's an example of a single game being scored between S (who's serving) and R:

* Game starts at 0 (love) all
* S wins the point; 15-0
* S wins the point; 30-0
* R wins the point; 30-15
* R wins the point; 30 all
* R wins the point; 30-40
* S wins the point; deuce
* S wins the point; Ad-In or Advantage S
* R wins the point; deuce
* R wins the point; Ad-Out or Advantage R
* R wins the point; R wins the game

Also within these rules there are a few aberrations.  For example, in Wimbledon, there is no tiebreaker in the final set of a match. You have to win by two games. This can result in some loooong matches, like the championship a few years ago, which lasted something like 11 hours.

TurtleHerder_,"Tennis is broken down into 3 components; These are points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games(usually 6), and games consist of points. It takes 4 points to win a game. The points however, have different names.
0 points= love
1 point=15
2 points=30
3 points=40
4 points=60
Once a player reaches 4 points, the game is over, unless the game was tied at 3 points a piece beforehand(ex:40-40). This occurance is referred to as 'deuce'. In this case you can only win this game by becoming 2 points ahead of them. Once a game reaches 'deuce', it stays in deuce until the 2 point margin is reached.
An example of an in-progress game score would be:
Player A has 3 points and Player has 2 points. Therefore, Game score=(A)40-(B)30.
If the game is tied, the score is followed by 'up'. Ex:15-up

Overall tennis matches are usually played best of 3(women) and best of 5(men) sets. In order to win a set, the player must win 6 games by at least a 2 game margin. Ex. 6-4.

afcagroo,"When a CPU reads an instruction, it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer. It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips ""Give me the information at this address"". It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus - high voltage means 1, low voltage means 0. The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion. It toggles some control pins to say ""Here ya go"" and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the 1s and 0s corresponding to that binary data. The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory. (This description is actually vastly simplified, but hopefully gets the idea across.)  
  
Similarly, the CPU (or other devices) can move data/instructions from the HDD into DRAM, or to/from network interface chips, etc. One thing asks for data stored in a particular set of locations, the other thing says ""OK, here it is"" and sends it, and the first thing (sometimes) says ""Thanks, got it!"". Or, something says ""I'm going to send you some information to store/work on"" and a similar handshaking goes on.  
  
All of this communication is built up in layers. The lowest layer that I described above, where voltages change to represent something, is called Layer 1, the physical layer.  Sometimes a ""1"" is sent via a high voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage, sometimes it is a change of voltage simultaneously on two different wires.  There are lots of different ways to do it, and some are better for some uses than others.   
   
Higher layers define the protocol for decoding that information and deciding what it means and how to use it.   

These generic layers are described in the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). But there are various different bus protocols (SATA, PCIe, Ethernet, etc.), and to understand any one of them you'd need to read up on its specifics.   
  
Processors tend to have their own proprietary or semi-proprietary bus protocols for some things; this has been a recurring issue for companies like AMD who are trying to compete with the 500 pound gorilla in PCs, Intel. For other things (like DRAM) they tend to use protocols that the industry has agreed upon (like DDR3).  
   
Wireless communication adds a bit more complexity. Since things aren't connected with wires, information must be sent by modulating a radio signal. There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   
   
One simple way is to use signalling. You can pulse the light on and off like [Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code, you can transmit information.  This is actually done in some fiber optic systems. (They don't use Morse code, and it is much much faster than a human could do. But it's the same general idea.) This technique isn't really used with radio broadcasts, though. 
  
Another way is to *modulate* the signal.  If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/emanim.gif) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif/250px-Amfm3-en-de.gif). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   
  
That .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fx_files/30581/1/FSK.jpg).  
   
You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.    ",null,0,cdnjdst,1ricgj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
lumpy_potato,"Depends. Are we talking wired or wireless?

Wired, its all just electrical signals representing binary digits, 0 and 1.

Lets say I have a chip that has 1 input and two outputs. The two outputs go to a red light and a green light.

When the input is off (0, no current) the red light stays on. When the input is on (1, current) the red light turns off and the green light turns on.

Electronics, when you get down to it, are a lot of red-light-green-light sort of operations, turning things on and off until you get the required output from a particular input.

With wireless, its the same thing, only you use some form of wireless medium - e.g. radio waves. You take your binary 0s and 1s and transmit it via radio, the same way you transmit music from an antenna to your car radio.

The receiver picks up the signal, decodes it, and turns it back into electrical 1s and 0s.

OrangeCrack,"A cell phone is actually a radio -- an extremely sophisticated radio, but a radio nonetheless. 

Before cell phones, trucks would talk to each other using CBs, however, this was limited to the number of people that could talk at the same time due to the  range and the fact these typically only had about 25 channels. 

The genius of the cellular system is the division of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously.

In a typical analog cell-phone system in the United States, the cell-phone carrier receives about 800 frequencies to use across the city. The carrier chops up the city into cells. Each cell is typically sized at about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers).

Because cell phones and base stations use low-power transmitters, the same frequencies can be reused in non-adjacent cells. 

Here are the basics:

 - As you drive through the city areas are divided into cells
 - The cells read a unique ID on your phone to identify you and what carrier you are with.
 - If your ID matches that of the tower, you will be considered in your home network.
 -  Along with your ID, your phone also transmits a registration request, and the cell tower keeps track of your phone's location in a database -- this way, the tower knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone.
 - The cell tower gets the call, and it tries to find you. It looks in its database to see which cell you are in.
 - The cell tower picks a frequency pair that your phone will use in that cell to take the call.
 - The cell tower communicates with your phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use, and once your phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected. Now, you are talking by two-way radio to a friend.
 - As you move toward the edge of your cell, your cell's base station notes that your signal strength is diminishing. Meanwhile, the base station in the cell you are moving toward (which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies, not just its own one-seventh) sees your phone's signal strength increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each other through the cell tower, and at some point, your phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies. This hand off switches your phone to the new cell.

tl;dr - Your phone acts as a radio and cell towers communicate with your phone and each other to automatically transfer your call.",null,1,cdnjtsw,1rid4r,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9

ThreeDigitIQ,"found on google: 

A sociopath is one who is affected with a personality disorder marked by antisocial behavior. A psychopath is a person with an antisocial personality disorder, manifested in aggressive, perverted, criminal, or amoral behavior without empathy or remorse. The two might sound the same to some, however the differences between sociopaths and psychopaths are very real.

Characteristics of a sociopath are as followed :

    Sociopaths are very charming.
    Sociopaths can be extremely manipulative and will try to con you whenever possible.
    Sociopaths feel that they are entitled to everything.
    Sociopaths will lie continuously to get what they want. They can even sometimes manipulate a lie detector.
    Sociopaths have no remorse, shame or guilt.
    Sociopaths will show love and happiness only when it serves their purpose. None of the feelings are genuine.
    Sociopaths have no room for love in their life.
    Sociopaths need to have excitement in their lives or live on the edge.
    Sociopaths have lack of empathy hen their victims suffer pain that they have caused.
    Sociopaths believe that they are all mightier than tho, there is no concern on how their behavior impacts others.
    Sociopaths usually have a long history of juvenile delinquency as well as behavior problems.
    Sociopaths will never take blame for anything they have done to anyone no matter if it is family or friend.
    Sociopaths have many sexual partners and tend to act out many sexual acts.
    Sociopaths rarely stay in one place for a long time (home/work).
    Sociopaths will change themselves if they know it will keep them from being found out.

Characteristics of a psychopath are as followed:

    Psychopaths use superficial charm to lure their victims.
    Psychopaths are extremely self-centered.
    Psychopaths must always do something to keep themselves from boredom.
    Psychopaths are very deceptive and tend to lie continuously.
    Psychopaths show no remorse of guilt towards their victims.
    Psychopaths are very predatory and usually will live off other people.
    Psychopaths have many sexual partners in their lifetime.
    Psychopaths are very impulsive with their lifestyle.
    Psychopaths are always blaming other people for their actions.
    Psychopaths never have a realistic view of their lives. (king of the world or from another planet)
    Psychopaths always want psychological gratification in sexual and criminal activities.
    Psychopaths tend to try suicide, rarely succeeding.

devodeevs,"Like one user said above, the DSM-IV does not list a diagnosis/criteria for ""psychopathy"". Antisocial Personality Disorder is the real disorder and most similar match to psychopathy. Additionally, see the Hare checklist for psychopathy here: http://www.arkancide.com/psychopathy.html 
This is not included in the DSM but was created as a test for psychopathy. Each criterion gets a score from 0-2 and all are added up to determine psychopathy.

Additionally, the following is a direct excerpt from an interview I did with Dr. Peter Langman for a research paper of mine about active shooters (Cho, James Holmes, Columbine shooters). He is the author of ""Why Kids Kill"" and is a leading expert on school shooters. He has an interesting perspective.

I asked:
Psychopathy has not been included in the DSM-IV. If you were to include psychopathy as a personality disorder in the new DSM-V, what would the criteria be? 

It's hard to say. In some ways, psychopathy seems like an extreme version of narcissistic personality disorder. One thing I might add as a possible criterion would be sadism, though this is not one of the traits Robert Hare includes in the Psychopathy Check List. Possible criteria might be extreme narcissism; disregard for rules, laws, social norms, the feelings of others, etc.; lack of guilt/remorse; meeting own needs at the expense of others; inability to engage in mutual relationships. Violence and criminal behavior would not be necessary for the diagnosis, but are often part of the picture.

The word ""psychopath"" tends to be more clearly defined in accordance with [Dr. Hare's checklist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_Psychopathy_Checklist), while ""sociopath"" is more up for grabs, so, while both words can be used differently by different groups, sociopathy tends to be the one more liable to a given groups own interpretation. There is no official definition for ""sociopath"" while there (kind of) is an official definition for psychopath, laid out by Robert Hare. 

Different groups will make their own distinctions but these distinctions are not official or universally accepted. A common one is to say that psychopathy is rooted in abnormalities of the brain while sociopathy is rooted in environmental causes. Sometimes a field or group will prefer one term and simply not use or define the other term. More often than not the terms can be and are used interchangeably.

While we're at it, sometimes both terms are used to refer to someone with Anti-social Personality Disorder, though this disorder is not synonymous with psychopathy in the sense that Robert Hare conceived it. ADP's criteria have been criticized as being essentially synonymous with criminal behavior making it useless as a disorder. However ADP is in the DSM while psychopathy and sociopathy are not.

It does not prohibit the ownership or carrying of automatic knives or switchblades inside a state while not on federal property, nor does it prohibit the acquisition or disposition of such knives in an intrastate transaction or an interstate transaction that is noncommercial and/or does not substantially affect interstate commerce (as defined by recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court).

Switchblades are illegal in lots of jurisdictions, but not all. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade#State_laws

I went into a knife store in Arizona and saw a boatload of knives they would happily have taken my money for, but that would have been illegal for me to carry at home.

I have heard, but can't prove, that in California, the legal definition of a switchblade includes a length (maybe 2""). So it's illegal to buy, sell, possess, carry, etc., an automatic knife over 2"", but knives under that length by definition are not illegal. Apparently there is a whole subculture of people who make, sell, trade, and collect these little miniature switchblades - in-state only, since interstate sale is illegal.",null,0,cdnkvz2,1rigkq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

Schnutzel,"**Stack overflow**

Whenever you call a function, memory for that function is allocated in a place called the call stack. When the function completes its run, that memory is released. A stack overflow happens if too many functions are called, and there's not enough room in the stack (which has a hard size limit) to allocate more memory.

How can this happen? Look at the following code for example:

    int foo() {
        return foo();
    }

When you execute foo() for the first time, memory for it is allocated on the stack. But then the function calls itself - so memory is allocated again. The 2nd invocation of the function calls itself a 3rd time - and so on, to infinity (and beyond). Eventually the stack will run out of memory and the program will crash.",null,3,cdnm8mi,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,18
Schnutzel,"**Buffer overflow**

A buffer overflow when you try to write data into a buffer (an array), and the data exceeds the size of the array. For example:

    char buffer[8];
    scanf(""%s"", buffer);

The function scanf reads a string from the user into the buffer, which is 8 bytes long. However, scanf doesn't limit how many characters will be read - it will read until it's done (until a whitespace character is reached). So what happens if the user enters ""helloworld""? The first 8 bytes are written into the buffer, but the rest are written just outside the boundaries of the array.

Now one of three things can happen:

1. The overwritten memory can be unimportant, and nothing bad will happen (for example, the memory could have been used previously in the function but not anymore).
2. The program is not allowed to write to this memory, so it will report an error (and probably crash).
3. The worst case is that the memory being overwritten is important, but the program continues running. This allows the user to change parts of the memory they shouldn't normally have access to, which is a security flaw (thanks /u/BrQQQ for expanding on this!).",null,3,cdnmsqz,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14

MEaster,"Buffer Overflow: Any random piece of data has a certain size. For example, an ASCII character is 1 byte. So if you have a string of 10 characters, you would need 10 bytes to store it. A buffer overflow would be when you write data past the end of this string overwriting other data.

Stack overflows are a bit more complicated. Firstly, a stack is a way of storing a list of data. It's what's known as a last-in-first-out list. Basically think of it as a stack of plates. You add data to the list by putting it on top of the stack, and then remove data by taking it off the top.

Another thing to explain is that in programming your code will generally be separated into subroutines. A subroutine will generally be things you want to do multiple times without having to rewrite it every time.

When a program enters a subroutine, it needs to keep track of where it came from so it can return. It does this by adding the current address to the stack before entering the subroutine. If you keep going into subroutines without returning the stack gets bigger.

In an operating system such as Windows, I believe each program has its own stack of limited size. If the operating system detects that the stack is full when the program tries to add something to it, then it will halt the program with a ""stack overflow"" error to prevent the program from causing problems.",null,1,cdnmnhf,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
RandomRobot,"The two can be combined or independent, depending on the context. A buffer overflow is very common in the C/C++ languages. It just means that you try to fit more data into a buffer than what it can holds. In those languages, you can access memory directly, so a string can be shown as 

    char myString[10];

If you try to copy more than 10 chars into it, then it will overflow. A stack overflow means that the data was on the stack when it overflowed, like in the previous example. However if you dynamically allocate memory, that memory will be on the heap, a large chunk of RAM that your program has access to. 

    char* myString = new char[10];

This string will be stored on the heap so when you overflow it, it will not be a stack overflow but a heap overflow, which is handled slightly differently by the program.

Overflowing the stack is especially bad since the program stores a lot of useful addresses on the stack, such as return addresses. If you carefully craft your 10+x chars, then you can potentially control the execution of the program. If your buffer was large enough, say... char[1000], then you could embed assembly code in the buffer and control the return address to execute the buffer. Those assembly codes are usually called shellcodes, because what an attacker want(ed, back in the days), was to get a shell, or a command line to the infected computer. There are whole books dedicated to this, how to write them and how to detect them.

Another way to generate a stack overflow is to call too many functions. The stack is a limited place, with around 1M (depending on tons of factors, such as your OS, your language, your compiler...). Recursion is a common mistake to generate a stack overflow like this.

    void func(){
      func();
    }

Those kinds of overflow are not as dangerous as the previous ones, first because they are easy to detect, even by just reading the code. The first execution will also crash fast. Secondly, the first kind of buffer overflow is more tricky to detect and an overflown buffer might not cause any problem to the execution of the program, while leading an attacker to complete control of your machine.

There is a very good tutorial about buffer overflows and how to execute arbitrary code with it called [Smashing the stack for fun and profit, by Aleph One](http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=49&amp;id=14).

Modern OS such as Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 have built in protections against those attacks, since they are so dangerous and difficult to avoid. A common protection is a canary on the stack. It means that the OS puts a special, magic value at strategic places on the stack. After some instructions, the OS checks if the magic value has changed. If it has, then the stack was smashed and some kind of error is returned to the user.

There are other kinds of attacks that are directed toward the heap overflows, but they are more difficult to execute properly.",null,0,cdnv0ez,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1
kyz,"The implications:

""The stack"" is some memory that keeps track of where you are in the computer program. Every time you call another function, it saves your current state on the stack, and where to come back to.

The called function runs, and when it finishes, it restores the state to before you made the call (stored on the stack) and jumps back to just after the call instruction (also saved on the stack).

If you *run out* of stack, the program simply has to stop running. Where can you store the details of the next function call? Nowhere, you're outta space! The OS has to abort the program.

However, there's something worse. Imagine you take input from the user, and put it into space located *on the stack*. What if the user tricks you into putting more data there than there is space for?

... it means that the end user gets to control what's on your stack. They get to overwrite it with whatever they like. They now control the *state* of your program. They get to control *where your program will go to* once the next function returns.

If it's easy enough to guess *where* the stack is (if it's at a predictable location, like it used to be before [address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) was promulgated), you can tell the program to jump to... the stack data itself, which is something you, the attacker, have control of thanks to the buffer overflow. This is called **[smashing the stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smashing_the_stack)** (for fun and profit). The stack data which is actually code is called ""[shellcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode)"".

So now you have *complete* control of the program. Just from supplying input to a program, you have made it start running your own code, and you get to take on the privileges it had and access the resources it has.

One fix against this (as well as ASLR and not writing exploitable code) is to mark the stack memory as ""[No eXecute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit)"", which means that if the CPU is told to run code on the stack, it will immediately end your program.

Great visual aid to understand the concept more thoroughly.

Edit Edit: A few people have commented on various scenarios, but when it comes down to it, its only going to be entrapment if the Officer(s) involved create a situation in which the person *has no choice but to commit the act*, with degrees of variance depending on context.

/u/CornellBigRed posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rimmo/eli5_how_come_undercover_police_operations/cdnv6qx) that [this court case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._United_States#Majority), which shows that there is a line that is drawn - but it will likely be drawn in court where more evidence can be presented

Chances are that if you are arrested and want to bring up entrapment, its going to be very situation specific, taking into account a lot of context and investigation to figure out if the police/agents involved in the arrest provided too much pressure, to the point where the intent was more strongly influenced by the government, rather than the accused's actual predisposition to commit the crime.

Edit Edit Edit: Lots of scenarios - guys, look, when it comes down to it, if you are arrested by an undercover cop, its going be centered around how you defend yourself in trial. You have to prove that you simply would not have done it if it were not for the pressure on you, and it has to be believable. You have to convince the judge, or the jury, or both, that you were coerced. Whatever scenario, tip, trick that you have, when it comes down to it, if you're arrested, then its all up to how you defend yourself and how much proof you can bring to the table. I do not believe you saying that you were coerced is going to be enough - you want enough proof to make it such that the prosecution cannot mount a good argument for why you did it willingly.

I'm going to explain this like you're all 5, so please hold onto your hats folks. 

**What is entrapment?**

Entrapment is an illegal act by authority figures to MAKE people do bad things (Illegal). An example of this would be: An undercover Police Officer begging a person (Not a drug dealer in this case, just for example's sake) to sell them drugs. This person, who actually just so happens to have drugs, repeatedly refuses the Officer's requests, until he finally gives in just to shut him up. The Police Officer then arrests the person for drug trafficking, takes the ""offender"" to court, and then has to duck as a Judge throws his little mallet at him for entrapping some poor person. 

**Entrapment is the act of reasonably forcing a person to commit a criminal act they would not have otherwise done.**

Understand that so far? Good. Now. What the general problem is, people don't have a basic grasp of what entrapment isn't. Entrapment IS NOT:

- Being an undercover hooker.

- Operating a child porn website

- Being a drug dealer. 

""But why, internet anon? Surely, the Police are luring these poor, innocent people to their doom!"" LOL. No. See. Get this: People suck, and actively seek these things out. And when they do, it's no longer entrapment. That John looking to get his dick wet with undercover Suzie? He willingly tried to solicit her. Yes, she could have asked, and all he had to do is say no and go on his merry way, and he wouldn't be handcuffed. Uncle Robert getting his door knocked down in the middle of the night by the FBI? No one FORCED him to watch little kids get fucked on the internet, he was looking for it. Your dumbass friend Marley who asked the wrong guy for drugs? He shouldn't have been asking ANYONE for drugs. Nor should he have accepted any offers.

**ENTRAPMENT IS: LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCING SOMEONE TO COMMIT AN ILLEGAL ACT, OR PRESSURING THEM INTO AN ILLEGAL ACT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE COMMITTED.**

**ENTRAPMENT IS NOT: PLAYING UNDERCOVER HOOKER ARRESTING EVERY JOHN, DICK, AND JOE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR POON. IF PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO COMMIT CRIMES AND THEY STUMBLE ACROSS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER, THEY'RE SHIT OUT OF LUCK**.

Additional fun fact: Undercover officers can do nearly anything to keep their cover, just short of killing someone (Presumably, they might actually). No, they don't have to admit they're cops just because you asked. Yes, they will deal drugs and kick you in the face. With undercover agencies, the ends justify the means.

This is entrapment, because had the police officers not set up this scenario, Father never would have made the purchase. As well, the officers lied and they used a random civilian.

He also came home to find the babysitter left earlier than she was supposed to, and that Mother's maxed out the credit cards for the fifth month in a row.

neanderthalman,"Simplest terms with some inaccuracy - atomic nuclei are made of little particles called protons and neutrons. The protons themselves are made up of quarks. The quarks are held together by the strong force, to make the protons and neutrons, and the protons and neutrons are also held together by the strong force to make the nucleus.

The weak force is tougher to explain, but one thing that it does is keep a quark 'stable'. Quarks can change 'color', which can in turn change a proton into a neutron, or a neutron into a proton. In doing so it will release energy in the form of an electron or positron, which is ejected from the nucleus as radiation.",null,1,cdnmpfi,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3
Infinite_Ambiguity,"The strong and weak nuclear forces are two of the four fundamental universal forces.  As you mentioned, the other two fundamental,universal forces are electromagnetism and gravitation.  There are many interesting theories about why we have four and how they started, including that they all,started as one combined fundamental force and separated over time after the Big Bang.  

In any event, the strong nuclear force allows for the otherwise counter-intuitive formation and integrity of an atomic nucleus.  An atomic nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons, but gravitation doesn't operate a sub-atomic scales (and is a very weak force in any event) while electromagnetism says that protons should repel each other in such close proximity and prevent any atomic nuclei from forming.  Obviously, without atomic nuclei forming, we would not have anything we see, including life forms. So, the strong nuclear force is what overcomes electromagnetic repulsion among protons and allows atomic nuclei to maintain structural integrity and thereby for atoms, molecules, and things we see.  The strong nuclear force is very strong, but only within very short distances (such as atomic scales).  So, in summary, the strong nuclear force is what holds atomic nuclei together allowing the formation of atoms and obviously molecules by extension.  

The weak nuclear force allows for radioactive decay. It is different from and weaker than the strong nuclear force.  The crucial practical effect of the weak nuclear force is that it allows for nuclear fusion within stars. Nuclear fusion within stars is essential for fueling the stars and for ultimately allowing for the formation of the higher elements.  ",null,1,cdnn7on,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

Those tanks will provide enough oxygen for the fuel to ignite and explode.

As for implosions - those are impossible to occur on a space ship. The fact that the Cosmos is a vacuum means that there is no pressure, which means that there is no force being exerted on the ship, making it implode. Actually, the main force being exerted on the ship is coming not from the outside, but the inside. The ship is actually a pressurized container and all that pressured air tries to escape in space. This is the reason why when a rupture occurs, everything is sucked out into space - you should've seen it in the movies and that is actually true.

The power core was large enough for ships to fly in. Most things in the movies use exotic means of power. Take Star Trek for instance, they use anti-matter generators, warp cores, singularity cores, and other exotic things like that. It's not unlikely that the explosions seen in Star Trek are realistic to some point. Most explosions are caused by either a warp core breach, self-destruct, or from the detonation of a photon/quantum torpedo. For comparison a quantum torpedo is rated at roughly 1380 gigatons; a asteroid that passed at 38 lunar distances yesterday had 231 gigatons of energy. The secondary means of self-destruct on a Federation ship is the detonation of explosives around the ship. This is equivalent to 1,500 photon torpedoes, or roughly 42000 gigatons. Strangely enough, a warp core breach is rated at 100 megatons. One would think such an advanced engine capable to bend space would create a larger explosion. One would only need to look at our own test of nuclear devices in space to imagine what would a much larger one would look like. Without the shock wave, most of the energy would most likely vaporize everything within the explosive radius.

As for your second question it becomes trickier to use sci-fi as a resource. Assuming a hull breach occurs then the atmosphere in the section would vent and assuming the section seals itself, not much else would happen. You would merely have a section of the ship that was exposed to space. I believe most of the explosions seen in sci-fi is caused by a hull breach occurring in a place near a critical (explosive) component, such that whatever has pierced the ship has also pierced and compromised the component. Explosive decompression is also a possibility, but how likely it is I don't know.

Alright, bad question, the US has gone to war for less and Japan/the Republic of Korea (ROK) are pretty pissed off by having their citizens abducted and the occasional ""Woops, almost hit you with a rocket. Say, how about a bit of food for us?"" attitude, amonst other things like ""coal tunnels"" under the demilitarized zone.  
Still, what entitles anyone to screw with a souvereign nation just because they don't like their way of handling things?

* China. China doesn't want war for several reasons, the least of those is because they actually like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They have actually told the US ambassador how annoyed they are by the childish sabre-rattling of then still Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il, as illustrated in correspondence somewhere in the Wikileaks documents. It is highly unlikely China would actually perform a military intervention if the DPRK started hostile actions, their main focus is having a buffer zone between them and the pro-US ROK, even if it means occasionally supporting a crazy dictatorship at huge losses. China wouldn't mind a change of regime as long as the two Koreas stay apart.

* The DPRK basically has held Seoul hostage for decades. They have hundreds of long-range artilleries and rocket artilleries aimed at the city constantly ready to fire. The ROK knows basically every bunker's position and can retaliate and destroy them but that still means several volleys hitting a major population centre, even if said city is riddled with bunkers. Although Seoul is full of Chinese diplomats, CEOs, important politicians and their kids so the DPRK probably screws itself over with that bombardment.

* War. War is hell. The DPRK may be under-equipped, under-trained, with fuel reserves for a few months at best and material mostly made up of handed-down Soviet stuff and some of their own but that doesn't mean they can't drag it out into bloody genocide before they surrender. Their Navy is crap from the 60s and in direct battle could probably be dealt with by a single Ohio-class sub, their pilots get about 20 hours of flight training a year in old equipment because of constant fuel shortage, conscriptees and partly even professional soldiers can't be properly equipped because they lack enough weapons for everyone and their supply chain is so ineffective and train-reliant it's ridiculously easy to completely obliterate.  
*But* they have vast hidden bunker systems, thousands of defensive structures with well-equipped artillery bunkers and hidden explosive charges all over their south border, territorial advantage and a big pool of dedicated and indoctrinated infantry (plus 5-10 times that in general population reserves) that will fight to the last man if necessary. And even if they don't use nukes, which would be foolish as even China would immediately get to business on them, they have one of the biggest arsenals of chemical and biological weaponry in the world and are quite capable of deploying it via rocket artillery over several hundred kilometres.

Mooi_Weer,"The most used anesthetic in surgery is propofol, 

Propofol works by making it harder for your nerves to transfer signals. If your nerves don't transfer signals you won't feel pain, can't move, are not conscious and you don't make memories. 

Propofol can make your nerves stop transferring signals through (at least) two pathways.

1. Neurons (the cells that are (mostly)your nerves) communicate with each other through neurotransmitters. There are neurotransmitters that make a nerve cell send a signal, but there are also neurotransmitters which prevent a neuron from activating. Propofol makes your nerves more susceptible to an inactivating neurotransmitter called GABA. By doing this it makes sure signals don't go from neuron to neuron. 

2. To transfer a signal through a single neuron, an electrical charge must pass through it. A resting neuron has a portential (voltage) between the inside and outside of the cell of ~-70mV when activated this is raised to about ~+40mV thereby sending an electrical signal through the cell. The potential goes form -70 to +40 by opening sodium (Na+) channels which makes Na+ flow into the cell increasing it's potential. Propofol blocks these channels making it impossible for neurons to transfer a signal. 

So basically neurons are less able to send send to other neurons and are less able to send information through the neuron itself.

lumpy_potato,"/r/buildapc  is a nice community :)

Anyways, here is how I break down the basics whenever I'm going into a PC Build:

* CPU - the brains of the outfit. While most modern CPUs are plenty powerful, there is something to be said for picking quality AMD/Intel processors for your gaming needs
* Motherboard - tied closely with the CPU. Newer motherboards act like the nervous system of the computer, tying everything together. High quality or new motherboards often have newer features, better speeds, etc.
* RAM - the memory (well, fast memory) - the more the better, but you aren't going to be hamstringed if you only have 4/8GB. for gaming 8GB is good enough for most applications
* Hard Drive - this is where your long term storage is. Size is good, speed is also good - SSDs are fast, but storage is expensive. traditional hard drives are big, but not as fast. There are some hybrid models out there - go with what you can afford first, you can always upgrade later
* Power Supply - you can't run a computer without power. Gaming requires juice, and i've rarely seen a gaming PC with less than a 600W power supply, especially with the newer high-end video cards. If you can afford a big PSU, you might as well future proof yourself. Look for good warranties on these puppies, they can burn out on you!
* Case - where you store all your PC crap. A good quality case is easy to install components into, has good airflow, fans, and usually looks aesthetically pleasing. My Antec 900 was my favorite gaming case, and it survived a UPS cross-country kickball match to NYC, keeping the internals of the computer mostly intact. 
* Video Card - now is where things get interesting. You need good card to game. Mid-range will last you, but sometimes there is something to be said for buying high. I like to buy one generation back, and the highest possible where I can. Some people argue this is stupid because graphics cards come out practically yearly, but for me, I keep components for 2-5 years at a time, so if I don't buy high, it might cause problems in the future.

KahBhume,"Motherboard: The board which binds all other components together. Make sure whatever components you buy have the same slots as your motherboard supports.

CPU: Does most of the work of the PC. Higher speeds means it can process more data per second. More cores means it can handle multiple processes simultaneously.

Graphics card: For PC gaming, does most of the graphics processing, taking the heavy load off the CPU. Basically, it's a specialized CPU optimized for standard operations to generate graphics.

Hard drive: Data storage. When you install anything or download files, it is stored here. Solid State Drives (SSD) are a variant that has a much faster access time but at an increased cost per gigabyte.

Memory (aka RAM): Short term storage with a faster access time than the hard drive. If an application needs more space than you have RAM for, it will run a lot slower as it has to grab data from the disk instead.

Power Supply: Graphics cards and high end CPUs draw a lot of power. Make sure your power supply can handle the sum of all your components. Leave a large buffer, as most power supplies run more efficiently when not at max load.

Pandashriek,"First, a bit of introduction: Voltage is measured in volts, current is measured in amps, resistance is measured in ohms and power in watts.

Watt is the actual power an electrical unit, lets say a light bulb, consumes. The higher the watts, the more power is needed to feed the unit. Engines power is also measured in watts - 1 horsepower being around 700 watts.

As for volts, ohms and amps - water pipes are a good analogy. The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure, the current is equivalent to the flow rate, and the resistance is like the pipe size.

I hope that it makes more sense now. I am not so familiar with electricity and if you want a more detailed explanation, I'd suggest asking wikipedia or googling the topic. ",null,0,cdnolc3,1ritvw,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
meldyr,"Usually people start using the water analogy. I have a couple of problems with it.

1. You have positive and negative charges. That would be the equivalent of water particles with positive and negative mass.

2. Current goes in circles (at least in circuit theory). Water doesn't do that necessarily.

3. Usually they say voltage is height or pressure. The problem is that voltage is just energy. It is thus a little bit of both, that can complicate the thinking sometimes.


**Charge**

Particles can have a charge. You have positive and negative charged particles. Two particles with the same charge repel each other. Two particles with an opposite charge attract each other.  Charge is expressed in Coulomb. E.g: An electron has a charge Q=1.9x10^-19 C.

Q is the symbol of charge and C is the symbol for Coulomb.

**Current**

Charged particles can move. If charged particles move through a wire you have current. Current tells how much charge goes through a wire in an instant of time.

If 1 Coulomb of charge travels to a wire in 1 second you have a current of I = 1C/s =1A

Where I is the symbol of current and A the symbol of Ampère/Amps.

**What is voltage**

An electrical particle causes an electrical field. Suppose you have a non-moving electrical charged object. Let's call it object A. 

If you bring another electrical charged object close to it. (This is object B). Object B starts to move. Object B starts to gain speed. You could say that just because B is put on a given start position it has some kind of energy. When it starts moving that energy is converted in kinetic energy (energy because it gains speed).

The voltage represents the electrical energy that particle has because it is on in that position in proportion to its charge. To every position in space we can assign a voltage V.

V = E/Q

Where V is the voltage, E is the energy an electrical particle would have on that position and Q is the charge of that particle. 

E.g:
Suppose the object B has a  charge Q=1C. Because of being at that place it has an energy of E=1J. We say that on that place the voltage V=1J/C=1V.

Note that the first V represent the voltage. And the second V stands for Volts.
.
**Resistors**

In this [figure](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/OhmsLaw.svg) you see that on the top is a high voltage called V^+  and on the bottom we have a low voltage (V^- ).

We know from the previous section that a charged particle that is in the high-voltage area will flow down to the low voltage area and gain speed. The problem is that it doesn't go that simple.

When the particle goes down it has to travel trough a resistor and the particle will bump against a lot of other things. How more things that it will hit when going through the resistor the slower the current will flow.

We can characterize a resistor by using Ohms Law.

V=I.R

If the Voltage difference over the resistance is 6V and the current I=2A the resistor has a resistance of 3 Ohm.

**Watts**

Previous I explained that a charged particle has trouble to go trough a resistor. 

The particle will lose speed as it goes trough the resistor. This means that the particle lose energy. Because the current runs in a circle we can assume that at any place the speed of the particle should be the same. (The kinetic energy doesn't change)

So the amount of energy that is lost in the resistor equal to 

E=V*Q

Where V is the voltage and Q the amount of charge that went trough the resistor.

If we want to know how much energy we use for a given time instance we can do the following. (dividing trough a time t).

P=E/t = V*Q/t= V*T

P is the power that is lost in the resistance. The power is expressed in Watts. 

**Buying a light bulb**

* Voltage: The light bulb is designed for a given voltage and the wires in your house provide that given voltage. (So nothing to worry about)

* Power: This is the amount of watts. The more power it uses, the higher your power bill will be. On most light fixtures you can find something like 53W. In that case you should put a light bulb in it that consumes less than 53 Watt.  If your light bulb consumes more power than your light fixture can provide you could damage/burn your fixture. 

* Light Intensity: The more Lumens (L) the more light it gives. Don't assume that because a light bulb uses more power it will produce more light. 

* Color Temperature: It is expressed in Kelvin (K). But it's tricky, what scientists call a low color temperature describes colors which normal people would describe as warm. So if you buy a light-bulb choose one that has a low co lour temperature to keep your house cozy. If your light color is too high you will have an unpleasant hospital-like light. A right choice depends on the atmosphere you want in the room. I wouldn't go above 4500K.

**Buying a microwave**

Here you have to be careful. You have two times a number in watts which describes different things.

* Power consumption: the microwave consumes 1100 Watt. (This is the number that ends up on your bill).

* Microwave Power: this is how much of the power is actually used to heat your food.

An average microwave oven uses about 1100 Watt to provide 700 Watt microwave food. If you buy a microwave oven you should check that it provides enough microwave power and the efficiency.

**Buying a generator**

For a simple generator you shouldn't mind the voltage. (It produces the same voltage as a power plug).

Power: The more power it can produce (In Watts). The more electrical appliances it can support at the same time.

Efficiency: How much fuel it needs to create one Watt. Sometimes given in liter/Watt, sometimes just given as a number. (Note: don't compare these two different numbers.)

**TL:DR; The power in Watts you see on your appliance ends up on your bill. Something that gives power (e.g: a light fixture) has a maximum power it can supply. Don't attach anything to it that uses more power or you might break something**

However, since the invention of tools to fight the misalignment of teeth and universal healthcare ""they"" have a fair chance of reproducing. So natural selection stopped sorting ""those people"" out. That's why someone who has crooked teeth because of a mutation can also have children, as opposed to dogs with crooked teeth.

thejennadaisy,"What you mentioned likely has had an effect (I would argue less because the social nature of humans means we take care of each other), but our change in diet has also had a big impact. 

It all comes back to [Wolff's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff's_law), which states that chronic strain on a muscle causes the bone(s) to which it's attached to become stronger. 

Over time (especially since the agricultural revolution), the human diet has become *much* softer. Our ancestors used their jaw muscles a lot more than we ever do. Going back to Wolff's law, this means that their jaws adapted to that use and became larger, stronger and (most importantly) wider than ours, meaning that their teeth actually had room to come in straight. 

Science daily talks about this principle in [this article](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110805135351.htm). 

To get back to your question, the reason animals don't need braces is that their diet hasn't drastically changed in the last thousand years. ",null,2,cdnqvww,1riy05,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7

Vox_Imperatoris,"No. What you are saying is referred to as the idea that the world is a **zero-sum game**.

A negative-sum game is one where the total value of the players' assets is less than it was before the ""game"" was played. War, for example, is negative-sum: one side may end up better off than it was before, but the total wealth is less. All of the dead soldiers, and the production of (now) useless tanks, bullets, and bombs is a loss. If one side ends up better, it is only because the other side got *really screwed*.

A zero-sum game is one where the total value of the players' assets is the same as it was before the ""game"" was played. A poker tournament is a zero-sum game. Everyone buys in at $50, and gets 50 chips in front of him at the beginning. After the tournament is over, one guy has all the chips and wins.

A positive-sum game is one where the total value of the players' assets is more as it was before the ""game"" was played. A market economy (including the modern global economy) is a positive-sum game. Some individuals and countries get richer. Some may even end up poorer than they were before, if they make poor choices. But overall, the total wealth is greater than it used to be.

If China gets richer, it does not hurt countries in Africa. In fact, it makes it easier for them to modernize, since all of the goods they need are now cheaper than ever.

The only sense in which one country getting more powerful hurts other countries is in a *relative sense*. For example, after WWII, every other country was smashed, but the U.S. was untouched. Americans were vastly richer than even Western Europeans. Later, Western Europe caught up, but it was not because Americans got poorer. Europeans just got richer, too.",null,2,cdnqfoo,1riyx7,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5
Infinite_Ambiguity,"Not necessarily, but possibly.  Assume that each nation is actually one person for simplicity.  

If I (representing my nation) walk into your house (representing your country), put a gun in your face, and take all of your stuff, then I'm necessarily richer and you are necessarily poorer.  There are also external effects on people who become aware of this event, but we can ignore them for purposes of your question.  This is a case where my wealth increase correlates precisely with your wealth decrease. 

However, assume that I walk into your house and offer you to sell you a car for $10,000 and you agree.  Assuming that's the car's actual fair market value, then neither of us are better off at all, but we're both in the same positions at that transaction's moment.  But then, I take that $10,000, invest it, and get $20,000 back from the investment.  I've now increased my wealth by $10,000 while you haven't lost anything.  And, presumably, my investment has also benefitted third-parties who are also better off also without you losing anything.  

Now, further assume that you use the car to get a lucrative job that would have been too far away for you to take in the absence of having an affordable and reliable car, which I sold to you.  This new job pays you much more than anything you had before, and so your wealth increases without diminishing my wealth. Presumably, your employer has also benefitted from your labor too in amount that exceeds your cost to the employer.  And let's say you then leverage this job into even better jobs while also accumulating investment capital, which further enriches you.  

In this second scenario, I'm richer, the recipients of my investment are richer, you're richer, your employer is richer, and the recipients of your investments are richer -- and nobody is poorer.  

These same scenarios with an infinite number of permutations happen every day at national and international levels.  These free, voluntary, and consensual transactions -- overall -- lead to better aggregate wealth results for all, assuming full information, zero coercion, and zero fraud. Obviously, there are individual exceptions, but the system overall -- with inherent disadvantages that we work to minimize -- seems to be the best devised and implemented as a practical matter. 

So, if there's force, coercion, trickery, or violence, then one nation's wealth will probably come at the expense of the other nation's wealth.  With free, consensual, voluntary, and informed trade, then it's likely that all participants will benefit (although it's unlikely that they would benefit in exactly the same amounts).

Le_Squish,"Oooo me..me!

I grew up in a movie theater and I think more detail about the process required.

Everyone makes a lot of money but who gets it all depends on how well the movie does. 

There are a lot of people paid up front for their services. 
Many of these people are technical/support and are often paid at a flat rate but depending on their talents might be able to negotiate royalties. 

Actors, producers and directors often receive their pay in a combination of flat pay and royalties over-time. Even if the movie flops, they already get some cash. This is why this group has to negotiate, because if the movie does really well you don't want to have worked for too cheap and screwed yourself out of ass tons of cash. 

Next we move to the theaters and producers. 
For theaters deciding what movies to show are a gamble. Producers don't take a flat cut of sales. They take different percentages over time and these percentages vary from company to company. 

A producer will present a movie they want to distribute to the theater operators. The producer may ask for something like 80% cut of the profits for the first 2 weeks of box office receipts and then maybe bring it down to 50% later. (random imaginary numbers). The theater owner then looks at the movies being offered and tries to ascertain how long the movie will stay popular or if it will be popular at all. If theaters think the movie is too risky and turn out will be poor they haggle down the price or refuse to show the movie in their theater. Now that the terms have been decided, theaters have to pay up front to purchase rights to show the movie. Then they hope to god that they movie will be popular for more than 2 weeks because they won't really be making any money before that time period. 

So now the movie premiers and the producers starts to make bank. The first weekend is the most important because that is when studios mop up the biggest cut of ticket sales. 

2 weeks pass, movie is still popular and now the theater can mop up without the huge cut going to the producers. if it turns out to be a movie popular as long as the Avengers, theaters will make ass tons of money on top of their concessions that is their primary source of income. 

But what if the movie flops immediately?
The reputation of the all the people that made/starred/worked in the movie is diminished and you lose your bargaining power with the theaters and hence can loss access to key markets. 
The producer absorbs the loss. 

If the movie flops later, the theater takes most of the loss. Sometimes people lose interest in a movie after a week of it being out. The theater next time will be wary of this producer and probably negotiate a shorter run and less seating for that producer as well as a larger piece of the profits.

Broadly speaking - When fluid flows through a pipe (or straw in this case), the driving force is a pressure difference between one end and another; from high pressure, to low pressure.

When liquid is flowing vertically upwards, the pressure difference between the two ends of the pipe (high pressure at the bottom, low pressure at the top) has to work against the weight of the liquid in the pipe itself.. Thus for taller pipes, the water flows more slowly...

When you suck liquid up a straw, you create a ""low pressure"" zone in your mouth. The glass itself is open to the air, so the pressure on the fluid there is [atmospheric pressure.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure)

The problem is that atmospheric pressure isn't all that high for a ""high pressure"" zone, and the very minimum pressure achievable is absolute 0 (a.k. perfect vacuum).

AyCarrumba,"Stereoscopic vision is only one component of how we perceive depth, and not even aparticularly good one! Because our eyes are closely spaced, it's only really good for close depth perception. Combined with convergence (How much our eyes have to look towards one another to focus on a close object) these ""binocular"" methods of depth perception are really only effective out to about 10 metres.

Monocular methods of depth perception that don't depend on having two eyes include:

* Parallax - things move relative to one another as out point of view changes

* Relative size - smaller things are further away, example in a field of cows

* Familiar size - Ships are big, dogs are middle sized, insects are small. We know this.

* Perspective: Line converge to a point which indicates the size of an object.

* Occlusion: If one object passes in front of another, blocking our vision of it, we have perception of their relative size and so distance.

* Defocus Blur: As our point of focus shifts, different ""depths"" are resolved in and out of focus by the eye. This gives important depth information.

* Distance to horizon. In a natural landscape, the closer something is to the horizontal horizon, the further it is away. This is a function of our elevation above ground level.

There are more...

So, as you can see, our depth perception is NOT limited to ""stereoscopic vision"". We use many subtle effects to judge depth. One of the reasons 3D cinema can be nauseating or confusing is because it uses simple binocular effects to ""brute force"" our perception of 3D, which is uncomfortable when other queues are  mis-placed in the footage we're viewing.",null,5,cdnvtoc,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,29

Rakaicius,"I'll take a crack at this one.  

The brain uses several different cues for judging distance, some of which only require one eye.  

- if object A is partially covered by object B, our brain assumes B is closer than A.  
- the more detailed we see something, the closer we think it is.  This is why studies have shown people tend to underestimate distances in foggy conditions
- our brains already have an idea of the size of familiar objects due to past experiences.  
- objects closer to the horizon appear bigger because we assume it is closer to the ground.   Next time you see a low-hanging moon that looks big, curl your hand into a very loose fist and look through it, you should notice the moon now looks smaller.  

The brain will use these cues to give you an idea of the relative distance of an object but it's not a perfect system.  If you ever try to play a sport with one eye closed you'll notice a huge difference.  Nothing beats having two perspectives to compare differences.

/u/justanaprilfool is correct that we can perceive distance with motion.  It is called optic flow: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow which is where you determine distance based on how stationary objects move in your field of vision when you change perspective.  For the ELI5 part: pigeons do this when you corner them.  They will bob their heads around while they watch you to get a better idea of how far away you are.  The amount that you appear to move by will tell them how far away you are.

/u/nos_esse_quasi_nanos is talking about relative size comparisons and is also correct.  If we know about how large something is we can gain some perspective on it based on how large it appears in our field of view.  This is also one way that we can perceive depth in 2D images like drawings or paintings.  ELI5: the closer something is, the larger it will appear.

There are other clues that we can use as well.  I'm not super sure about how our brains process all of this information, but I do know that they have many different sources they use to compute the information we perceive.

Well, little Timmy, just like you have muscles in your arms and legs to move you around, you have two muscles inside your ear! But these two muscles don't move anything you can see. The muscles in your ear can actually block sounds and make them seem quieter to you. For example, when you hear a really loud sound, they will tense up to help make the sound seem quieter. This helps protect the insides of your ears when your sister sneaks up on you and screams as loud as she can. Those muscles stretch tight, and that's why you have trouble hearing out of that ear for a few seconds after. The muscle that makes your ears rumble is called the tensor tympani muscle. Mostly, it makes your chewing sound quieter to you (like when your mom and I tell you to stop crunching your cereal so loud, and you have no idea what we're talking about). Now, why does it make that sound when you flex it? Because all muscles vibrate when you flex them. Make a fist as tight as you can. See your hand shaking? The muscle in your ear does the same thing. And because it's inside your ear, you can hear it vibrate.

Cogythea,"Condenser microphones work by having a metal diaphragm right next to an electrical circuit (http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/microphones/condenser.html). Put simply, when the sound waves hit this diaphragm, they push it back onto the circuit (as sound is a vibration), thereby completing the circuit. This then sends an electrical signal down the wire the microphone is connected to (or the sound card in the case of the camera), and this signal is then interpreted and converted into its original form. When a microphone is exposed to wind it is constantly pushing that diaphragm back onto the circuit, so the signal is being sent when it ordinarily would not be. This creates an anomalous sound. The volume of this sound depends on the windspeed - a higher speed means that the signal is being sent more times per second. 

I would assume that we don't hear wind as loud because we have evolved to filter some of it out. Not 100% sure though, but that's my explanation as to why microphones pick up wind very loudly.

Futures contracts are essentially a document that says ""I, Bob the Farmer, agree to sell Paul the Processor x amount of corn, soybeans, etc."" These contracts are typically traded in set amounts (5000 bushels is pretty standard for agriculture) at an agreed upon price. These futures contracts help to reduce price risk because the person can ""lock in"" a favorable price, months or even years in the future. The farmer knows what he will be paid ahead of time so he can plan his expenses accordingly and the processor will know what they are paying for inputs. Most contracts are never actually settled through the physical commodity, but rather in cash. Because they can be settled in cash, many investment firms speculate on these contracts almost as if they were stocks. What most people find lucrative is the fact that when you purchase or short a contract, you only have to post a percentage of the value of that contract. Example: 5000 bushels of corn at $6.00/bu=$30,000 but the buyer might only have to supply $3,000 when they buy the contract. They can complete the payment when they sell the contract.

AyCarrumba,"Back in the olden days, computers were expensive. Really Expensive. They also took up a huge amount of space, and energy.  To make investment in buying and running a computer worthwhile, organisations had to make a single computer available to a number of people simultaneously. It would have to be able to access data, process it, and return it to ""users"" via screen outputs. This was a ""mainframe"" computer. It was multiuser. Things like old UNIX terminal are just that: you can think of a UNIX (or Linux if you've played with that) as a user terminal connecting to your own home computer, which is behaving as a multi-user mainframe. More than one user can log into a Linux operating system at one time, and the operating system shares resources between them.

As computers have gotten more powerful and much cheaper, most people have a computer capable of day to day tasks on their desk. There are still specialist requirements: You might need to compute very complex problems quickly, or you might need to store and retrieve huge files. This is where ""supercomputers"" and ""Servers"" come into their own.

Supercomputers still look a bit like the mainframes of old: Power hungry, taking up rooms with rack after rack of parallel processing boards. They do things like computational fluid dynamics for Formula One racing teams, calculate the effects of time on the yield of a nuclear warhead, or do stress analysis on complex machines.

Servers are a bit more abstract. Many programs operate on a server-client model. The server stores and retrieves files, the client asks the server what it wants and displays the results. Minecraft works on this model whether you play it single player or on a remote server. The entire internet is based on the principle of computers communicating and sharing files via an agreed protocol. Servers can also be massive - Google data centres for example take up whole buildings. It all depends on how much data you need to store and how you do it. But virtually any organisation (or even home) that holds large amounts of data but needs it to be accessible by multiple people or devices will use a centralised server so that files can be viewed, shared, updated and backed up efficiently.",null,1,cdnxzxc,1rjiib,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
Miranas,"A mainframe is a fridge size computer you can run a business with. It is redundant and generally does transaction work 24/7. 

A supercomputer has high speed connections between components. This makes the largest systems with hundreds of thousands of processors possible. Supercomputers are generally used for science.

A server is a computer system you can make requests to. While mainframes can be quite good servers, most servers are smaller, less expensive, and  more like personal computers. Supercomputers  are not usually general purpose servers or publicly available.

It is likely that your online weather forecast was calculated on a supercomputer, processed by a back end mainframe, and published with a relatively cheap web server.

BioCRN,"You have to go out of your way to get sued. Here's what happens...

It's suspected that you have GMO crops on your land, this is usually reported by other farmers or by seed elevators that buy crops from farmers.

The owners of the technology (Monsanto, usually (thanks to their patent portfolio)...but can be Dupont/Dow/BASF/Bayer/etc depending on the crop or technology) will approach the farmer/farm and ask for voluntary documentation on their seed source and/or a sample of their seed/crops.

Things can go a couple ways from here...either they comply or they resist. If they resist, things can go into legal wrangling (especially since pretty much everyone who denies to comply in order to investigate the issue is in the wrong). If they comply (or once compliance is legally won) then they send the samples off to labs to test for priority genes. Sometimes it gets to the point where it's a case of ""well, go ahead and harvest and then we'll take samples"" when farmers are adamant they're doing nothing wrong...they will be busted or cleared once sampled after harvest without any impact to the value of the farmer's crop or harvest if in the clear.

Here's the thing about GMO accidentally ending up on your land...Monsanto/etc. have programs in place which will pay for the contaminated crop, it's clean-up, and the labor/chemicals used to remove it from your land...even in border lands like ditches and runoff-protection areas that aren't in production fields.

Here's the other thing...there is no way on this planet someone accidentally has 70-80-90%+ GMO contaminated seed in their fields. This only happens when buying illegal seed or (more commonly) cultivating, selecting, and saving GMO seed when you notice it's shown up on your property. If I happen to be driving a truck holding 10,000 copies of MS Windows and a copy falls off the back of my truck you don't have the right to install that on 1000 computers at your business or go around installing copies on other people's computers because you found it on the ground.

Monsanto has never lost a case they've sued a farmer over...and it's only been a few dozen farmers in the past 18-ish years...and well over 1/2 of them happened in the early years of GMO adoption before a lot of people knew exactly what was up with the legal limits of using this technology.

If you're farming 100s-1000s of acres, you know exactly what you're getting into when you choose to cross the line into stealing intellectual property. The only farmers that have gone up against this system were either testing the system for it's limits and/or were simply trying to steal intellectual property. It's a very deliberate act in either case.

Beyond all this, it's a case of farmers who WANT to crop GMO crops without actually paying the higher seed price for GMO seed. They are no different than GMO seed purchasing farmers, use no more or less chemicals, nor are they somehow saintly or innocent for wanting to do this...they just want to cut out the ""paying for it"" part that helps brings this intellectual property to market.

I'll paste an excerpt from Monsanto's FAQ:

&gt;**What is Monsanto’s standard policy if we discover a farmer is violating his or her seed contract? **

&gt;If there is evidence of seed piracy, we work with the farmer to confirm the facts and discuss how to resolve the issue quickly, amicably and professionally in accordance with our Commitment on Farmers and Patents. This commitment clearly outlines a strict code of conduct we must operate under if we are investigating possible violations. In particular, we do not threaten farmers, we respect their privacy, we do not trespass, and we do not pursue farmers for the accidental presence of our patented technology in their fields or crops.


From my knowledge (I worked on a farm for quite some time), the vast majority of farmers sued by Monsanto and similar companies are for what is known as ""saving seed."" Under the contract for using the GM seeds, the farmer promises not to save seeds from the harvested crop to plant the next year. This is so that farmers cannot expand the seeds they bought earlier and is the farming equivalent of saying that you cannot pirate music.

In the case of Food Inc., one of the main farmers interviewed claimed to run a small family farm to have been harassed by Monsanto unfairly. Despite this, his farm was worth several million (I could be in the wrong range, but it was by no means small), and there was audio evidence of him trying to convince his neighbors to save seed.

There is a reason why those in the farming community have a significantly more positive viewpoint on average than the average member of the public.",null,5,cdnw33i,1rjkfk,explainlikeimfive,top_week,20

The small fraction of these farmers that Monsanto brings to court are [guilty as fuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser). There is no way the contamination was accidental, and the court agrees. US Courts do not hold farmers liable for accidental contamination and the burden of proof lies with Monsanto.

AyCarrumba,"There are a number of reasons.

Firstly, cost. A high quality system is hugely expensive. IT takes good quality optics and highly sensitive cameras to work well in low light conditions, and high definition is very memory intensive, meaning you need large arrays of hard discs. Whilst some organisations are willing (or legally obliged) to fit such system,s the vast majority aren't. Is a small store owner going to pay $10,000 or even $100,000 for a multi camera high definition system with 3 month recording? No. He'll buy the $1000 system.

Secondly, detail is inversely proportional to field of view. If I want a camera with a 90 degree field of vision, to cover a parking lot, for example, then it will necessarily be too low resolution to capture faces or numberplates - unless I spend a lot of money. If I want to capture numberplates or faces, then I need to place the camera accurately at a ""choke point"". Bear in mind that even 1 megapixel resolution, 1000x1000, if a persons face only ever occupies 1/10th of it, we will get a 100x100 pixel image of their face: This may not be enough to conclusively identify them especially in poor light.

So, to cover your last point:

&gt; if low-quality cameras fail to catch criminals, then they are worthless and a waste of money from the start anyways which would defeat the purpose of installing the low-quality cameras in the first place.

CCTV is used primarily as a deterrent. You put in your $500 Home Depot chinese sytem, rig up some cameras, and stick up your stickers saying ""You are on CCTV"". This might just be enough to put off those who were thinking ""should or shouldn't I rob this store?"" And overtime hopefully your investment will pay itself back. IT may also be that your insurance stipulates that you must have a functioning CCTV system to be valid - but no mention of quality.

CCTV doesn't ""Fail to catch cirminals"" POlice caught Criminals before widespread CCTV, and they continue to catch criminals where there is no CCTV evidence. However, even if CCTV doesn't capture a recogniseable facial image, it can still be very useful in the investigation of crime and the prosecution of criminals.

Whether the values are fractional or integral doesn't really matter to what you are doing, and since we often use mathematics with fractional values (for example, measured from the real world), such methods must be equally applicable to any real number values to be useful.

On the other hand, there are some things (think not just mathematics, but more generally), that do not make sense with fractions. For example, how many ways are there to arrange the three letters A, B, C? The answer is six, and there are ways to figure out what the answer might be for any number of letters, but the answer, as well as the input (the number of letters) can only be an integer, never fractional. There are many areas of mathematics that deal with such things like ""if we have this many of something, how many…"" or ""if such and such, then is so and so true?""

Koooooj,"You just need a Bitcoin wallet.  Note that in Bitcoin the word wallet means several different things, including:

* The application or website that manages your balance

* The file that stores your private keys (the data that indicates that you own the Bitcoins)

* The collection of addresses that you own

For this post I will be using ""wallet"" to refer to the first definition.  There are several options to choose from when selecting a Bitcoin wallet.  You can change your mind at any point, though, so don't stress out about it too much.  I would recommend Electrum for a new user--it's a wallet that will store all of the sensitive data 100% on your computer, meaning that you have zero reliance on any website, while it allows 3rd party servers to store the ~30 GB of data from the Bitcoin blockchain.  If you want to use a completely standalone wallet then either Bitcoin QT or Armory would be a good choice (the latter is built on the former but has more features for advanced security).  You could also consider using something like Blockchain.info's online wallet, which can be done carefully to minimize risk of losing your coins due to the actions of a 3rd party.  If you have a smartphone then the Android or iOS wallets would be a good choice since they easily allow you to see that you've received a payment without needing to carry around a laptop.

When you select your wallet application there should be some button that says something to the effect of ""generate new address.""  When you hit that button you'll be given a string of numbers and letters that represents the new address, something that looks about like 1ABsAj8enaBjyPx6y95Tjvk2Bhp65re8JT (this is an address I own).  When you go to sell you just have to give the buyer that information and tell them how many bitcoins to send.  When they send the bitcoins you should get a notification that there is a transaction incoming, and some time later the transaction will be confirmed by the network.  Once confirmed the odds of the buyer scamming you are virtually zero, although many buyers will not want to wait for the confirmation--it can take a while.  For most transactions it is reasonable to consider a transaction as being complete when it is first received, unless you stand to lose quite a lot of money in the event of a scam.

As always, make sure you use good common sense.  Don't meet people in locations where they can easily rob you and what not.  If all you give the buyer is an address and an amount to pay then there's not much they can do to scam you, though.  Honestly they'll probably be more worried that you're scamming them, since there's no way for them to un-send the bitcoins once they've paid--they have to trust that you'll hand over the goods.  Keep that in mind to keep the buyer at ease.

You should also look into securing your wallet (2nd definition).  Most wallets (1st definition) have the ability to encrypt the wallet (2nd definition) with a password.  Be sure to use a strong password--a good choice would be a phrase that doesn't appear in any literature or anywhere online; nonsense makes a good choice here, *provided you will remember it.*",null,1,cdo1xky,1rjs58,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

As time passes, the hedges grow and the vines eventually block the pathways you don't physically walk everyday. When you finally try to get to a box you haven't opened for a while, the path is blocked, so you wander around the maze for a while until you find another route to it.

Melodic is a series of notes (potentially in rhythm) and harmonic would be notes in played simultaneously. The former has few ""aesthetic"" boundaries. Some people like complex, experimental jazz where hundreds of notes are played seemingly at random, some people like 4-note pop music. Harmonic patterns are slightly more easy to classify. Smaller intervals (half step, whole step) are generally (HUGE generalization here) less pleasing than larger intervals (major 3, perfect fifth) because larger intervals produce more ""even harmonics"" (double, or quadrupal the frequency), that is to say, the harmonic frequencies support each other, rather than producing the ""beat frequency"" of uneven harmonics (Think two guitar strings playing the same ""note"", one string slightly out of tune)... Another level to this question is the human perception factor. The inner ear (where sound is collected) has tiny little hairs (called cillia) that vibrate when a sound reaches them, These hairs are sorted by length into 'critical bands', frequency ranges to which the ear is most sensitive. People don't like hearing two notes very close together because it stresses the same critical band, which is physically irritating. Now a good question to ask is why our brains developed this way...

They are trying to combat this now with TAPS (Transition Assistance Program) and other programs like that - yet it's something where you'll only take out as much as you put in.

For a normal, unmarried enlisted member of the military there is a lot they don't have to worry about.  You get a meal card so you can eat at the chow hall (food is taken care of.)  You get a barracks room (housing is taken care of.)  This leaves them with pretty much all of their income as disposable.  Young members of the military (not all, but I'd be willing to bet that it's 50%+ from personal experience) basically pay for cable/internet, junk food, alcohol and whatever else they want to spend their money on (video games, weekend excursions, etc.)

Imagine doing that for 4+ years straight, then being shoved to the curb quickly (as helpful as their transition programs can be, it's really a 'check in the box' and they don't care what you take from it as long as you do it and GTFO when it's your time) to now having no real-world education (though leadership training in the military is better than any college classroom can prepare you for), a lesser income WHILE having to pay for rent/food/etc.

The GI Bill can help take care of some of this, but it's a toss-up as to if the person wants to use it.  Not many 22 year-olds fresh out of the military feel like going to university if they didn't feel like going before they joined.

This is just going into the more... general(?) points of it and not taking into account the PTSD/TBI type victims who can rarely afford the help they need, if undocumented and everything like that.

pythonpoole,"Most phone calls are not encrypted, and it's my understanding that it was Merkel's personal phone (not her secure phone) that was being tapped.

When a call is transmitted 'in the clear' (unencrypted) it can be tapped into at many different points.

Firstly, it's possible for the device (i.e. the phone) itself to be compromised, such as by the installation of some sort of malware/spyware.

Secondly, the call can be intercepted at the local mobile phone carrier level (typically with assistance from / co-operation with the carrier).

Thirdly, the call can be intercepted by tapping into / splitting fiber optic lines carrying phone calls at the intra-provider level (e.g. on back-haul links from cell towers to the carrier's central routing facility), the inter-provider level (e.g. at carrier-neutral facilities where telephone call traffic gets handed off from one carrier to another), or at the undersea/international level (where there are only a limited number of cables carrying data/call traffic between countries and tapping these lines provides access to virtually all data/call traffic entering or leaving the country).

When calls are encrypted, basically the only way to get the unencryped audio is either to compromise the phone of one of the parties (i.e. somehow get malware installed) or to gain access to the encryption keys (such as by forcing the mobile manufacturer to hand over the keys if they retain such records). Brute force cracking is largely ineffective (virtually impossible) unless there is a particular weakness (or backdoor planted) in the encryption algorithm being used.

djslinkk,"Freemasonry is a philosophy of moral standards, mutual understanding and brotherhood in which all men are on a level and equal. While many people talk of secret conspiracies, the truth is that many aspects of the craft are not secret at all. Freemasons believe that:

Since God is the Creator, all men and women are the children of God. Because of that, all men and women are brothers and sisters, entitled to dignity, respect for their opinions, and consideration of their feelings.

Each person must take responsibility for his/her own life and actions. Neither wealth nor poverty, education nor ignorance, health nor sickness excuses any person from doing the best he or she can do or being the best person possible under the circumstances.

No one has the right to tell another person what he or she must think or believe. Each man and woman has an absolute right to intellectual, spiritual, economic, and political freedom. This is a right given by God, not by man. All tyranny, in every form, is illegitimate.

Each person must learn and practice self-control. Each person must make sure his spiritual nature triumphs over his animal nature. Another way to say the same thing is that even when we are tempted to anger, we must not be violent. Even when we are tempted to selfishness, we must be charitable. Even when we want to ""write someone off,"" we must remember that he or she is a human and entitled to our respect. Even when we want to give up, we must go on. Even when we are hated, we must return love, or, at a minimum, we must not hate back. It isn't easy!

Faith must be in the center of our lives. We find that faith in our houses of worship, not in Freemasonry, but Freemasonry constantly teaches that a person's faith, whatever it may be, is central to a good life.

Each person has a responsibly to be a good citizen, obeying the law. That doesn't mean we can't try to change things, but change must take place in legal ways.

It is important to work to make this world better for all who live in it. Freemasonry teaches the importance of doing good, not because it assures a person's entrance into heaven -- that's a question for a religion, not a fraternity -- but because we have a duty to all other men and women to make their lives as fulfilling as they can be.

Honor and integrity are essential to life. Life without honor and integrity is without meaning. ",null,0,cdo9quy,1rk450,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

blehonce,"""lose so much money"" is false. most consoles which lose money, lose less than 4 games worth of revenue to get back to netural.

which is why they don't collaborate. the money lost on the console is small relative to the money brought in through games, music, videos, and services (like xbox live or psn).

so why not collaborate? the profit model is specifically against collaboration. it would be nice to be able to play mario games on xbox. but nintendo knows only a couple titles will sell the game console in order to play the games, and those same games will lead the console distribution to be neutral. and then since the end user already has the console, the user will be more likely to buy more content for it as there is a relative pay wall when going with the competition.

this is good for the companies which make the consoles because it allows them profit monopoly. whereas only getting a portion of the revenue of games would mean they would lack profit negotiation (or cost to develop) capacity. and the only games they could tax would be ones which only and exclusively use their controller.

imagine if a dev made a FPS game which only ran on PS4 and wiiu because xbox was being greedy. they would potentially lose out on allot of sales. but even if it was for all three consoles, the one with the best hardware would dominate the game sales which benefit by having the highest performance. that is, while angry birds would sell about the same for both ps4 and wiiu, a fps when benifits from every little bit of graphic processing would orient consumers (in general) to buy their brand. so it costs more R&amp;D to make a console which has that zing i need the game for it rather than competition, but it also brings in a larger portion of the lot from sales.

consoles aren't just machines but also methods of excluding others compatibility. so rather than trying to argue with some counsul that their preferred feature needs to get added to the standard, they can just go off and make their own product and let the consumers choose which base feature set they prefer. do you want to be able to snap multiple chats, or do you want ps4's social networking stuff?

and with community projects you can't exclude a support for a product against the will of the majority. and it gets even worse if the code is open source so free alternatives are competing with standard stuff. which leads to brand confusion. do you want a proprietary wiiu game pad, or a tablet, or kinect, or a wiimote, or xbox/ps4 controler to have games designed for it? do you want to bundle them?

going to OS features, will the all in one console have a profanity filter? is a feature like that a demographic niche you could profitably pander to?

Like you said it really depends on placement.  For example, just because your oven makes some waste heat doesn't mean it's going to heat the right parts of the house.  Same could be said of your dryer or whatever else makes a decent amount of heat.

Otherwise I do something similar to this all the time (or at lease I did).  When I lived in an apt that had drafty windows and bad radiator heating in the winter I'd just run my desktop computer and make it do things to run up the CPU (I used SETI@home) which would put out a decent amount of heat actually.  Problem is that it's not very energy efficient to do something like this.

&gt; Or is there some other way the energy could be wasted that's not useful for home heating?

There is still a mechanical efficiency that doesn't create waste heat, or any proper amount that you'd be able to feel.  For example, in a washer or dryer it's got to spend a lot of power to get the drum moving and then fight air resistance, imbalance and friction to keep it going.  Transmitting the power to the drum and pumping water in and out all include some losses and it adds up.  Same with just about any electrical appliance...there is an efficiency loss from all sorts of things and the lost energy might not always be in the form of ""usable"" waste heat.",null,0,cdo2dz4,1rk6rf,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
t0mbstone,"Before you can answer ""What is Github?"", you must first answer ""What is Git?"".

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005.

Basically, Git provides a mechanism for multiple people to work on different offline copies of the same code project, and then (relatively) easily merge the two copies of the project together at a later point in time.

The Git server (in addition to many client-side implementations of Git) is open source and anyone can run their own Git server and Git repositories for free.

Github, on the other hand, is simply a company that provides Git hosting. They handle all the server-side stuff and provide a nice web interface. This makes it easier for people around the world to just focus on their code projects (instead of worrying about server administration).

Github hosts public repositories for free, which means they are a great place to put an open source project. This friendliness towards the open source community has greatly increased the popularity and adoption of Github over the years.

Due to the massive popularity and growing adoption of Git (and Github), many companies nowadays are expecting candidates to have a working knowledge of Git on their resume. It is not uncommon for a company to ask for your Github username when they are interviewing you, so they can look at your open source contributions to try and gauge your competency.

Git (and Github) are both fairly easy to learn and use once you get them set up.

yakusokuN8,"For finite sets of numbers, we say that the cardinality of that set is equal to the number of members of that set.  So if A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then |A| = 4.  

When we get into infinite sets of numbers, it gets a little bit trickier.  Let's start with the counting numbers (non-negative integers), that is, {1, 2, 3, 4...}.  There are an infinite number of members of this set.  We call this set countable if we can make a one to one correspondence with the set of counting numbers.

So, the set of integers is also countably infinite.  

We can order them like this:

0 1 -1 2 -2 3 -3

and pair them off with all the counting numbers:

counting numbers:integers

1:0  
2:1  
3:-1  
4:2  
5:-2  
6:3  
7:-3

Yet, there is a larger kind of infinite size of a set.  The set of real numbers can't be grouped in this kind of one to one correspondence.  The real numbers are all the rational numbers plus the irrational numbers and we can't pair off all the irrational numbers the way that we can the rational numbers.  Rational numbers are written as x/y, where x and y are both integers, but irrational numbers cannot be written as a fraction.

If you ever close your store, traditionally those three days are the bare minimum. And Thanksgiving was the only one that wasn't explicitly religious. Even in the recent past (last 10 years) it was hard to find anything that was open. Even gas stations would close for the holiday.

The only people that would work Thanksgiving were those that were absolutely needed. Even vital facilities like hospitals and utilities would run on minimum staffs. And those people were treated almost like heroes. I worked it for a utility about 15 years ago. I was paid 2.5 times my normal hourly pay rate because I sacrificed to cover it. And a lot of companies have senior managers who would cover shifts to let as many plebs as possible have the day off.

It is something entirely different for an electronics store to remain open. And until about 2 years ago, they wouldn't. But now the stores are opening on Thanksgiving.

If someone reached Da-Vinci skill levels in everything he did, but in a modern context, they would just be someone who is quite good at a lot of things, but far from being notable in any of them, as they would be competing with a global industry of people who have been training their whole lives in just that one thing.

It takes far too long and too much specialisation to reach the level of skill/knowledge on something that would make you globally notable these days. 

As mentioned by others here, what makes them notable is their *relative* knowledge levels compared to the rest of the world. They didn't know much, but jeez, compared to everyone else back then, they knew everything. And they got there without the internet, supportive government and societal infrastructure, and without a lot of the inspiration we have now.

That sort of knowledge and skill monopoly concentrated in one person is unlikely to happen again, due to the sheer amount of time and effort it takes to be the best at something these days; to be great at something means sacrificing the necessary time to be good at something else. Also back then they didn't have electric lights, appliances, modern transport, communications and information infrastructure we have; just daily life was so time consuming that there was far less time for creativity and learning. The standard of skill and knowledge among everyone else was far lower. The amount of free time we have now allows people to specialise in a skill and reach levels of proficiency in months what would have taken years for someone many years ago, there are now people with after-work hobbies that are better skilled at them than people who were once considered the best in the world in that field.

EDIT: A lot of people have taken my view of Da Vinci as that he was not an incredible genius with equally or even more incredible drive and focus. This is not my view, he was indisputably an unprecedented genius who hardly slept and worked incessantly. If Da Vinci were alive today, he would almost certainly be still doing very notable things.

When you think of those artists, you think of them doing classical sculpture, paintings, architecture, etc. People still work with those classical, naturalistic styles, but they're not the styles that are really in vogue anymore. 

There are artists that work in--even master, depending on what you think of them--a variety of art forms, but they're not going to do it in a way that looks like the naturalistic paintings or sculptures of the Renaissance artists.

A good example off the top of my head: Kurt Schwitters was a Dada artist who invented hundreds of subgenres of art. He painted, made ""house-sculptures"" (see Merzbau, Merzbarn, etc.) did poems, stories, music/sound poetry, etc. There are a lot of other artists that had crossovers into more than one type of art. John Cage did music, but also poetry; Warhol did painting, but also photography and films. If I can think of better examples I'll edit this. 

Another thing. People are saying that Da Vinci and Michelangelo were more famous than modern day artists are because skill and knowledge were more of a luxury back then.

Faustroll80,"Basically, notions of creativity, skill, and quality underwent drastic shifts beginning in the 19th century.

It is imperative to understand the word ""master"" in historical context, which at the time connoted skill, but also (crucially) described an artist who had a studio in which he (rarely she) trained other artists. Students had a fairly rigorous training in academic drawing for a few years before they learned painting. This method created a kind of consistency and helped encourage the notion that artists with large studios were true masters. The exceptions here are Michelangelo, who was notorious for not having a studio and for berating assistants until they abandoned him, and for Leonardo, who worked in relative isolation.

So, ""master"" in the Renaissance more often implied individual skill but also skill as a teacher. A notion of individuality plays a role in forming a notion of the master during the Renaissance and at this moment it meant the extent to which you could teach others to make art that looked so much like yours that it was indistinguishable. It's interesting that you picked Michelangelo and Leonardo, since neither of them had studios.

Another piece of this has to do with the Renaissance belief of where in the process creativity actually happened. Drawing was the central node of intellect at this time, it was why artists studied it for so long, and it was why assistants generally carried out the majority of painting in the studios, after which the master generally did touch up. That was your entry into the grand style, in which drawing was seen as the place where the real thinking happened. So if you were good at drawing, then theoretically you could be good at anything. Drawing in Italy (""disegno"") implied that design, the putting together of something, occurred before the execution of it. 

All of these ideas of creativity and individuality underwent a massive change in 19th century Europe with the decline of academies. Artists gradually began pursuing the idea that real creativity did not hinge on excelling in an accepted style or having a studio in which you taught others. So the word ""master"" changed drastically at the time and became a question of unique personalities. The focus on personality and emotion was best seen in unique styles that shied away from the polish of the academic style (Impressionism) and turned quality into something that was way more granular. 

So to ask whether an artist is a master, the reply could be ""a master of what?"" In determining a master, there needs to be a comparative body of less talented artists. With collective style dissolving, art was no longer something that had a collective, comparative premise. Artists were judged by their sincerity to the motif, which was a personal question. Most importantly, total emulation like the kind you would find in a studio system gradually vanished. So while a young artist was ""inspired"" by Picasso, actual copying was anathema.

Artists today create in different media, but judging mastery is based more on the taste of the viewer for different specific artists and everyone has an opinion.

Sorry if this is kind of meandering, but it is a complex issue with lots of aspects that feed into each other.

A good source for how these ideas came about in the 19th century is Cezanne and the End of Impressionism by Richard Shiff and The Academy and French Painting in the 19th Century by Albert Boime

One such modern day genius that experienced a wealth of intellectual influence across different domains/sub-domains within mathematics and science would be [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing).

Can't forget to mention he help cracked the engima code in WWII, in addition to being a world class runner, and a mathematician that worked in very specialized areas of math most people never heard of (and ones he isn't typically mentioned for, but had influence in as well). If there were ever a modern day renaissance man, it'd be Alan Turing. Unfortunately, his accomplishments and success often get politicalized due to his barbaric treatment as a homosexual/bi-sexual (he did have a girlfriend during WWII). Whenever Turing is brought up, it is usually in defense for gay rights, not to celebrate him as a genius, it is more like 'we killed this man because he was gay', but most people don't understand why he is really well known to begin with.

It's hard to hit the limits of the medium when we have what we have available now.    Also, it's hard to find patrons interested in ONE perfected skill and effort expended in two runs the risk of excelling in neither.   

As far as quality artists in a single specific field, there are bunches.  I work with a marble sculptor that has maybe another 10-15 pieces in his remaining years.  His work is stellar.  He's nationally known, but in terms of raging economic success, sculpture is not the path to either fame or riches.   Art is generally only a reliable path to personal expression and satisfaction, to growth in perception, and to continuous improvement.  ( I will note that I visited a studio not long ago where a modest talent was making  a paid-for granite sculpture honoring a deceased dog.  THAT, apparently, is where some bux flow with reliability.) 

You also have to remember... the folks we know about, like Da Vinci and Michelangelo are western-centric.  (In fact, these two are who 99% of people would choose if needing to name a few.)  They are no where near the only ones.  This planet teems with the output of millions of unknown artists of all societies and media.  Lascaux cave paintings, Pacific island statues, great and still-jungle-covered-undiscovered architecture, long rotted paintings, ironwork, precious metals.  That just in the physical media.  There's poetry, dance, song, too... work of genius long dead.   Every professional artist I know has hundreds (sometimes many, many hundreds) of completed pieces crowding studios and storage.  One aging friend is burning hers.  Another sending things to the land fill.  My sculptor mentor?  Viewing a catalog of his plaster models and wondering what will become of them.)

Both M an DaV, were gifted with something equivalent to their hard-earned skills... they were awarded financial support, major assignments, prominent positions for their art, WHILE still alive.   With the vast wealth we have now on this planet, and vast number of people/artists, it seems a lot less common that it should be.    Part of extreme success is extreme assignments.  Almost no artist can afford such things on their own.  Finding willing patrons is an ever-present sub-task, equivalent in every way to the greatness arising from artistic skills.   Bernini built Rome.  You can't throw a bowling ball in Rome without hitting something he did that would cost a billion dollars to make today.   If you could, you'd need a venue.  The best are taken.

My opinion as an amateur student of marble sculpture.   This kind of question makes me pontificate and wonder and ramble, as you can tell.

From what I remember, the three big names of the High Renaissance (Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael) only became famous after their names were propagated by Georgio Vasari (who was from the same location as them, but I don't remember where that was. Florence, perhaps?). The reason he was so successful at this propaganda was because he wrote one of the only surviving literature on art and great artists (of that time period....books were just coming into popularity and books on art were rare). Vasari didn't acknowledge other artists who were of the same calibre because they either weren't from the same location or didn't suit his artistic preference.

That being said, there could have been other great artists, and there can still be great artists now, but nowadays it's all about being 'different' and 'selling the artist' instead of the art (This concept was first initiated by Marcel Duchamp, I believe, with his controversial urinal fountain-- his idea was that anything can be made into art, if you believe in the artist). 

The term art has become so subjective now that great artists are often passed over in favour of those who can produce something different and unique. Even before the Renaissance, when all you usually find are unrealistic illustrations by tribal people or eastern cultures, the capacity for realistic art was still present, but nobody believed in it due to religious beliefs. They believed that portraits should emphasize specific traits. Realistic art was considered offensive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath

I'll try to contribute this. Certainly, there are still some really amazing artists and scientists out there. Now, more than ever. However, we don't generally have ""true Renaissance people"" anymore for the following reasons:

1) Lack of Forced ""Focused Education."" - Leonard and Michelangelo both endured very focused apprenticeships starting in their teen years. Both received specialized education before that. Most of the First World eschews such focused educational practices.

2) The Less a Culture Knows, the Easier it is to Be a Master of Several Basics - To attain a PhD in the United States from a respected University now requires an immense amount of specialization. The idea that you could get a PhD in both quantum physics and architecture is very rare and exceedingly difficult. The idea that you could get both of those and like... five others is unheard of.

During the Renaissance, you could point glass at a star and become a master of astronomy. That's an exaggeration of course, but today, even if you're really good at science, no one really cares unless you're the freaking best at it.

3) Financers (Rightfully) Think There is Only Enough Room in People's Heads to Think of Someone in One Way - The people that finance projects have done enough research to know that a large number of people can really only ""think"" of someone else in one particular regard. So, whereas some artists might want to be both musicians AND sculptors, the people that publish and distribute their art will generally only choose one medium to sponsor.

Look at someone like Natalie Portman. Sure, some people probably know of her work in the sciences, but most people don't. And even more people don't give a shit.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/science/01angier.html?pagewanted=all

You can find this again and again. Creative people that are good at things tend to continue trying to work. However, financers rarely back these ""side projects"" for fear that the less profitable venture may actually detract from the profitability of what they see as the more promising one.

4) Lots of Things Can Now Be Produced with the Same Skill - Someone below mentioned how awesome Kanye is. Which is true. However, everything Kanye does boils down to ""digital work.""

I'm not trying to denigrate anyone here (I myself am a ""digital artist"" of sorts), but being able to produce music digitally, movies digitally, and graphic design digitally has more in common with the ""digitally"" than it does with ""art"" portion.

Working with real, physical stone, and sculpting it is WAY fucking harder than creating a 3D image of it on a computer. Again, I am NOT saying that creating a 3D image isn't difficult or that it ""isn't art,"" or any such polarized interpretation bullshit that some people will make up because they feel threatened when their work is called into question.

But simply put, the ""copy and paste"" functionality and the fact that ""undo"" allows you to make an infinite number of attempts while simultaneously removing the scarcity factor makes all digital work vastly easier to produce. Better, too, but just so much easier.

It's because of this ease of using digital mediums that generally, no matter how many types of things you can do with them, most people will simply recognize you as a ""digital artist"" of some kind rather than a Renaissance Person.

And that's fair, because sculpting and painting the Sistine Chapel while lying upside down are two very different skills. Yes, there's still some overlap in the skills, especially with the concepts (such as the understanding of perspective, foreshortening, etc), but they require much more practice, talent, and skill to actually accomplish.

5) Void of Competition - The Renaissance produced a large number of ""grand artists,"" but nothing compared with today. Now, everyone with a computer is an artist with something to offer the world. And everyone's attention, yours, mine, art critics, everyone's, has universal access to their art.

So now people compare and argue about which was a better movie, ""Citizen Kane,"" or ""Dolemite,"" because our experiences are inundated with the work of artists.

oechsph,"Forgive my interpretation of this question, but I think that it's difficult to answer provided that your two examples had significantly different roles during the Renaissance. Michelangelo would have been considered an artist during the Renaissance while Da Vinci's role as an artist is only secondary to what made him so successful. His name would have resonated more as a scientist and engineer than an artist. In other words, it's like asking if there are any modern artists like Nikola Tesla and John Cage. The problem is that one was an innovator while the other was an artist. I'm guessing you are looking for an artist.
Also, I would like to point out that Da Vinci DID NOT do many different art forms. He did painting and drawing. He never did ceramics, sculptures, glasswork, etc. So again (and I know I'm being a stickler) it seems like your question doesn't even know what it's asking.
That being said, I might take the liberty of revising your question, then answering it:
""Are there any contemporary artists like Michelangelo who are masters of several artistic mediums?""
Simple Answer: Yes. YES! DEAR GOD YES! Not only are there a few, THERE ARE HUNDREDS. The Renaissance popularize the sentiment that the artist does not need to stick to one medium. Since the Renaissance you can find artists from pretty much every movement who were masters of their movements in painting and sculpture (but not exclusive to those two mediums). Looking to what we deem as modern art you could claim that Salvador Dali (film, photography, sculpture, painting), Picasso (sculpture, painting, costumes, theater), Boccioni (literature, painting, sculpture), Braque (sculpture, painting) , Kollwitz (woodblocks, sketching, sculpture), THE ENTIRE BAUHAUS MOVEMENT (textiles, painting, design, architecture, theater, music), the list goes on. From the perspective of art history, they were all masters of many different mediums.
We now live in the age of post-modernism and arguably post-post modernism where the idea or concept behind art is more important than the work itself (you may know this as conceptual art). In a sense, this is now the norm. An artist who does one thing and one thing only is easily swept under the carpet. Why is this? This is subjective, but we have a tendency to want something new constantly (eg iPhones). Art is no different. We want to experience new things, making a demand for multiple mediums.
Also, it should be noted that the living artists (or ""masters"")whom we consider celebrities today may very well be forgotten in a hundred years. This is pretty common practice in art history.

Now, look at some pictures of the wreck as it currently is. It's basically a heap of beaten up, rusted metal. And that's exactly what it's going to look like when you get it above water too. It's not going to be nice to look at, you couldn't safely have tourists going inside it, and locals are going to complain that you put this heap of rusty metal next to their town/area of natural beauty. Of course, you could do a massive clean-up operation, maybe even try to beat everything back into shape and put it together just like new (although I'm not even sure this would still be physically possible), but by then, the amount of money and effort you've spent you might as well just have built a replica from scratch.",null,0,cdo3uxm,1rkbtz,explainlikeimfive,top_week,19

Which is to say that, when we sleep we relax, the brain doesn't shut off, neither do our sense. It takes stock of going on and says, ""Well, this is normal."" In your case, noise in the background. When it stops, your brain notices and says, ""Uh-oh, something out of the ordinary just happened.""

Think of it this way. You're an ancient caveman from way back in the day. But you smoked too much fun time plant and you decided to hit the slab that night. Everyone else in your tribe is still partying it up with a bonfire and drums and hootin' and hollerin' and whatnot. Your brain says, ""This is ok, this is normal.""

adlauren,"I don't know enough about collars to ELI5, but I know puts and stop losses are both tools used when an investor anticipates the stock will drop in value. 

A stop loss order of 10% under purchase price of an investment is the investor saying ""I think a 5-10% fluctuation in this security is normal, but any more than that I'm not comfortable with and would prefer to sell rather than hold it.""  From what I've seen, it's usually used when the investor typically is pretty involved in day to day, but plans to be less involved in the future and wants a fail safe against a drop down the line.

A put option is the right to sell an agreed quantity at a certain price for a certain amount of time. This can be purchased independently of the actual stock and is you paying a certain amount per stock or per contract (covering 100 shares) in exchange for the right to sell X amount at Y price for Z amount of time. 

Put options are a good hedge or an investment tool for people who believe a stock is overvalued or will drop soon. An example would be paying $2 a share to buy a put option giving you the right to sell 100 shares at $30 within the next 30 days. The cost of the put option would be 100*$2 or $200. 

The ""strike price"" in this case is $30. If the stock was selling at $30 (and your put is for $30) when you purchased the option, then it drops to $20, you can now buy 100 shares at $20, then immediately sell at $30 using your put. The profit would be the sell price of $3000 ($30*100) less the purchase price of $2000 ($20*100) less the amount you paid for the put ($200) for a total profit of $800. 

This differs from shorting a stock in that your total risk at any time would be only $200, the cost of the put option, rather than risking a bigger loss by shorting at $30 and having to buy and return to your broker at $40 (-$1000) if the stock goes up instead of down.

dazfive,"A collar is a method of attempting to make money on a purely options play. It is used separate from any position on the stock. There are many strategies like this, and are often named other types of buzz words (calender spread, Iron Butterfly, etc). They are fancy names for taking a position on both puts and calls, long and/or short, in an attempt to profit while mitigating risk.  

As for when to use options, unless you are a sophisticated investor, never. The options game can be dangerous, but as well lucrative (I am an options trader).  I use options to make money, usually as a seller (or writer).  The best use of options for an average investor is to protect against downside, or lock in a profit. If you are long ABC and its has gone up sharply (I would say just sell), but if you want to participate in more upside, while ensuring some profit, you can buy and out of the money put. This put give your the right (but not the obligation) to sell at that (strike) price, regardless of where the stock is trading. 

options can also be used as a cheap method to play in a stock.  IF you think AAPL is going to rise, you can buy an out of the money call, which gives you the right to purchase the stock at that price, regardless of where it trades. Effectively, if the stock goes up you can sell the call, as opposed to exercising the option to purchase the stock.  An out of the money call may only cost $5 per share, rather than the $500+ to buy the actual stock.  WARNING:  options have an expiry date and are subject to what is known as time decay.  The closer the expiry, without the equity moving towards your strike, the faster the price of the option will drop. This can be a tricky game to play. 

I hope this helps.   ",null,1,cdo6gha,1rkcbx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
ostifari,"Options are best used by non professionals as a hedge against bets that they have already made on stocks, and as a way to cheaply enter the market without a whole lot of risk.

PUTS gain value as its underlying stock goes DOWN in value.

CALLS gain value as its underlying stock goes UP in value.

Options contracts are written (aka bought and sold) in the same bid/offer manner that stocks are traded. One buyer, one seller, agreeing on one price.

Options expire weekly and monthly. For learning purposes, lets say Weekly options expire every Friday, Monthly Options expire on the 3rd Friday of each Month. Option are listed and are available to buy for up to 39 months before they expire, depending on the corresponding Stock. All Stocks have different, and often confusing, pricing and issuing for Options due to factors like volatility and time decay, 2 things that you'll have to look up more in depth independently, and are the cause of the price fluctuation in my second example below. 

Options are issued at what is called a 'Strike Price'. General Electric, (GE), for example, has 44 different Options for the month of December, 2 at each Strike price, ranging from $12 - $31 Strikes - One for the PUT, one for the CALL.

GE stock is at $26.80. A few of the relevant 'Strike Prices' and cost for that particular GE Options-

25 Call  --- cost 1.85

26 Call  --- cost 0.97

27 Call  --- cost 0.33


22 Put  --- cost 0.03

21 Put  --- cost 0.02

20 Put  --- cost 0.01

When buying a Call Option, you are essentially *buying the RIGHT* to own the Stock at the Strike Price. So, if you buy a '25 Call' Option, you are paying 1.85 for the right to *exercise* the Option, which turns the Option into shares of Stock, for an additional $25 (or $26 or $27, depending on whatever the Strike Price is). So, it would be like paying $25 + $1.85 = $26.85 for a Stock worth $26.80 right now. Why would you pay that extra .05 (which is also refereed to as a 'Premium')? Because if the stock has bad news and plummets to $21, your Option would be worthless, $0.00, and you will lose your $1.85. However, if you had instead bought the Stock at $26.80, and NOT the option, You would've lost $5.80, ($26.80 - $21).

Now lets look at the change in Option Prices with such a dramatic drop in Stock Price.

25 Call  --- cost 0.03

26 Call  --- cost 0.02

27 Call  --- cost 0.01


22 Put  --- cost 1.10

21 Put  --- cost 0.35

20 Put  --- cost 0.08

Notice now that the Puts have gained value and the Calls have lost value. The 22 Put, which is now 'in the money', has increased almost 40 fold in value, and will continue to gain a penny for every penny the Stock loses in value. The Calls are almost worthless because the move hasn't gone in their favor. A wise investor who owns a lot of Stock in GE would want to have bought many of the 20, 21 and 22 Put Options when they just pennies each. Now that his investment in the Stock has taken a blow, he is covered on the downside by owning Puts, which gain as much value as the stock loses, once the Option is in the money. If the Stock goes to $10, the 22 Put will then be worth $12.00. ($22-$10=$12)

Now lets look at a completely different hypothetical situation. 

I'm looking at the $10 CALL options in each of the months of NOV, DEC, JAN, and FEB. The Stock is at $9.50. All the people that own these options believe that the stock will go above $10 at some point between now and the 3rd Friday of the Month that the option expires. Obviously, as time slowly moves on without any big move in the Stock, investor confidence that the stock will hit that certain number go lower. With that said, the prices are:

Nov. 10.00 Option --  .05  

Dec. 10.00 Option --  .08  

Jan. 10.00 Option --  .12  

Feb. 10.00 Option --  .23 

If you could SELL the DEC $10 Call for $0.10, and BUY the JAN for $0.10, it would cost $0 to complete the transaction. Buy one, sell one, same price. The Prices are at $0.08 and $0.12 respectively, but in an open market, there is room to barter. Buy the better, further out Call, and sell the worse, soon to expire Call for the same price. Imagine doing this 100 times. You own 100 Jan 10 Call, and you are -100 (short) Dec 10 Call.

As the stock moves, all of these prices move. And not only are the prices moving, but people confidence steps up. If the stock goes from 9.50 up to 9.75, suddenly it seems like it MIGHT get to $10. The person with the JAN 10 Call is going to be more sure of it than the guy with the DEC 10 Call because he has a whole extra Month to work with his Option. So suddenly, after a quick move, the prices look like this:

Nov. 10.00 Call --  .25  

Dec. 10.00 Call --  .38 

Jan. 10.00 Call --  .52  

Feb. 10.00 Call --  .73 

So, now we own 100 JAN, and I need to buy back my short -100 DEC 10 Calls. 

Let's review our position -

(BUY 100 JAN  at .10) cost: $1,000  (SELL 100 DEC at .10) net: $1,000. Balance - $0

Later that same day, after the Stock moved from $9.50 - 9.75 -

(SELL 100 JAN at .50) net: $5,000  (BUY 100 DEC at .40) cost: $4,000

It costs us .50 cents per option that we buy or sell. We bought 100, sold 100, then sold 100, then bought back 100 = 400 total contracts, $200 fee.

COSTS: $4000 to buy back DEC, (50 cents per option x 400 options = $200.) $4000 + $200 = $4200

NET: $5000 to SELL Jan

$5,000- $4200 = $800 profit.

If the Stock never makes a move, all of our Options will be worth $0.00 once it's their day to expire. We let them all expire, the positive position will eliminate the negative position, and we do NOT exercise our right to buy the Stock. Our cost is $100 for 200 contracts transacted at .50 each. And we go home sad and frustrated.

Fairleee,"The first thing to understand is the geography of the United Kingdom. Ireland is an island lying off the coast of Great Britain (which comprised England, Scotland and Wales). Historically, Ireland was under British rule from 1801, and subject to numerous invasions by the English prior to them establishing rule. In the early 1900s, a successful Home Rule (i.e., independence) movement arose, and Ireland became independent shortly after the end of WW1, with the exception of the top part of the country - Northern Ireland, which opted to remain part of the United Kingdom.

To put it simply, the main reason why Northern Ireland wanted to remain part of the UK was because much of the population were colonists from the UK, and were predominantly protestant. This group is known as the ""Unionists"", because they want to remain part of the ""Union"" of the United Kingdom. There was a smaller, native population, that was predominantly Catholic, that wanted to split from the UK so the whole country was part of the Republic of Ireland - this is known as ""nationalism"" (as they are Irish nationalists), or ""republicanism"" (as they want to join the Irish republic).

So, the Unionists see themselves as British, and the Nationalists see themselves as Irish. However, as the majority of Northern Ireland's population are Unionists, it is unlikely that Ireland will unify with Northern Ireland. Because the two groups are also split along religious lines (protestants and catholics), this adds an extra element to the situation.

The Troubles were at their worst from the late 60s onwards, and numerous people were killed and injured. The UK deployed part of its army to permanent duty in Northern Ireland, and radical nationalist groups carried out a number of terrorist attacks in both Northern Ireland and the UK - in 1979 the IRA, a nationalist paramilitary group, managed to kill the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten with a bomb. Both Unionists and Nationalists were responsible for a lot of awful violence in Northern Ireland itself, and the British Army didn't always help matters - Bloody Sunday is a particularly notorious example, where the army killed a number of unarmed protestors. In recent years the Troubles have become less severe, and the IRA has officially announced a ceasefire, and no longer engages in bombings or terrorist attacks. This is actually one of the lasting legacies of the last Labour government, and Mo Mowlam, a Labour politician, is credited as being a major force behind the peace process (she was the Secretary for Northern Ireland at the time). The Republic of Ireland has largely acknowledged Northern Ireland's existence, and it has been established that if unification is to occur, it has to be ratified by both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, sectarian violence still does continue, as there is a long, long history of violence in Northern Ireland, and feuds are still ongoing.

So, why is Catholicism and Protestantism relevant? Well, the fact that the two political positions (unionism and nationalism) were also largely split down religious lines was significant, because it is an obvious marker of difference. This is similar to how tribal affiliations in various other nations can be used to justify conflict. Religion is often a very important part of a person's life as it can play a large role in how they define themselves, so anyone who is not part of your religion is automatically an outsider. In Northern Ireland, the protestant and catholic communities have largely self-segregated - in Belfast for example, people know whether an area is Protestant or Catholic. So, it was not the primary cause of the Troubles, but it was another complicating factor.

I hope this answer has been helpful; please note that, bearing in mind this is an ELI5, I have simplified a lot of the issues. The fact is that the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland is very, very complex, so if you are interested in finding out more, the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) on Northern Ireland would be a good place to start.

Within this universe, his other films (Kill Bill, Django Unchained, Inglorious Basterds) exist **as films**. In other words Vince Vega can go to the movies and see Kill Bill. But this also means that Kill Bill characters do not occupy the same space as Inglorous Basterds characters.

Magn3s1um,"The xbox and the ps3 both use headers/special disks that can be checked for authenticity.  When loading a game from the disc, it checks to make sure that these sections (which cannot be burned to using commerical tools) are correct.  It also checks region to make sure the disc is in the correct region (idk why they even do this anymore.  Just let me play whatever the hell I want).  

The gamecube was different because it used different discs (those small ass ones) and burned the data backwards I believe.  The wii just burns the data backwards (spins the disc the opposite way as everything else), which means it is harder to create a replica of the disc.  Also, you'd have to hack the firmware to bypass any checks/region locks still.  

They all do region checks, so basically to get around the checks, you'd have to change the disc drive firmware.  On the xbox360, some of them were easy because they stuck a samsung (or liteon, can't remember) in there with special firmware, and someone ended up finding the commercial driver for that disc drive and were able to put the firmware on there instead of the firmware that does auth checks.  There were like 4 different drives that could have been in the xbox360, and I think only a couple of them had parallel drivers that could be put over the xbox 360.  Also, they had to modify the operating system (you'd have to format your drive with a special modified xbox 360 operating system on your hard drive that would bypass checking that the firmware was a valid firmware).

The playstation 3 didn't really allow you to update the disc drive firmware I don't think until someone found a way to flash the NAND chips on some of the playstation 3s (not all of them could though). I think there was an OS hack in there as well, but I don't know much about modding the playstation 3, although I have been working on #rpcs3, so I know quite a bit about the internals, just not the operating system/hard ware exploits.  

There's also some chips you can buy that you solder onto the motherboards.  What these chips do is intercept these authenticity checks and then send back the correct data.

ampellang,"Ok, I will explain how copy protection works on PS1 and PS2, since that's what I am well versed on, but I can't say definitively how it works on other consoles.

So to start, you have to understand that the tracks on CD/DVDs are not a perfect spiral.  There is a ""wobble"", which is that the track itself moves back and forth in a sine wave perpendicular to the direction of the track.  This ""wobble"" is 15 kilohertz and some change, IIRC.  The tracks exist independently of the data, which is to say, when you buy a blank disc, the track, with its wobble, is already there.  A Playstation game changes the wobble slightly on the lead-in (the part of the track closest to the center where that the drive uses to orient itself prior to reading any data).  So when the head is orienting itself on the lead-in, it follows the wobble of the track.  By measuring voltage and impedance of the motor that runs the head, the system is able to determine exactly how fast the head is moving back and forth, and determine that it is different from a normal 15khz.  If the wobble is exactly correct, a analog-to-digital converter circuit then sends the okay (this depends on the region, for America the chip sends hex the representation of ""SCEA"") to the CPU and allows the game to be played.

This is why it is still impossible to play burned games on a PS1 without modifying the console in some fashion.",null,0,cdod1s9,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3
IntHatBar,"Many methods of copy protection have been invented and cracked over the years.  An example: PlayStation 1 (remember the black discs?) have a special CD Drive that can read data from a track on the disc that is not accessible using standard CD drives.  The drive seeks to this special spot (near the center of the disc) and reads a special code from this track to verify game is legit.  Hackers quickly found ways to get around this.  The most prolific solution was to modify the PS1 to intercept the signal and respond with the appropriate code.  This logic was built into a small integrated circuit and sold online as device allowing users to verify ""backup"" discs.  If one has the 'mod chip' installed in the PS1, he/she can simply copy an original black disc using a typical CD burner then play it on the modified PS1.

When you ask your operating system to make a copy of a disk, you are essentially saying ""please take data from here and put it there in whatever way you please""

When copying, operating systems don't generally *write to a specific track or sector* on the disk. Often the native copy command, can't for instance write to track 1, sector 1 specifically. 

So when the creator makes the disk he puts a code right in that spot.  If that code is not there when the software starts up (the s/w checks with a low level command, ""is there an X on track 1, sector 1) it knows it's a copy.

Obamacare ""ACA"" is a controversial piece of legislation that wasn't even passed under a regular legislative process, but rather late at night, under a budgetary process. No debate, no reading, no discussion, just ""pass it to see what's in it."" (Nancy Pelosi, 10:30pm D-CA)
No one has read it in full, yet SCOTUS decided to uphold it. As the time passes, We The People find out about more and more of ""what is in it."" only 212 people in the House (All outgoing Democrats, most which aren't in the House anymore) voted for it, 34 Democrats opposed it and all Republican/Opposition opposed it. It was a [unilaterally enacted, single party](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml) legislation, highly unpopular, even at the time of early 2009, amid recession.
Obamacare ACA is the only ""law"" or ""tax"" (depends on who you talk to, how they chose to defend it) that will not be modifiable by future Congress (We The People) past the year 2017. This, in itself, is unconstitutional. No law, including the US Constitution itself is immune from change, by future legislation. In addition, we are now finding out that even churches need to start providing funding for contraceptives and abortions. Reason why SCOTUS rewrote it and called it a ""tax"" and thus legal. This ""tax"" raises approximately a Trillion dollars (~$1,000,000,000,000) for the Federal Government. Democrats call this ""deficit reduction through tax, [as featured in CNN.""](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/25/fact-check-repealing-obamacare-adds-to-deficit/)
 Most people are smart enough to form their own opinion, there are many other ways of reducing deficit (like, how about.. STOP SPENDING. Reduce spending, quit subsidizing corporations?)
But it's OK,..because [LOOOK! FREE CONDOMS!!](http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obamacare-event-hands-out-condoms-prizes_769034.html)

Government cannot compete with free markets where consumers make millions of decisions every day thus resulting in an efficient market. Free markets come up with innovations and products that consumers buy every day, as competitive free markets should. This drives down costs, drives up competition. Net benefit is the consumer, reflected in lower prices and high availability. Any industry. Placing limits, rules and regulations on the aforementioned results in ""unintended consequences"" such as, higher prices, cancellations, calls for reform, etc.

There never was a ""free market"" in US medical care, even prior to ACA Obamacare. There always were numerous barriers to entry, regulations, licensing, fines and rules and therefore little competition. (read: Runaway healthcare costs.) Gov’t has been in healthcare business far too long.
If this were not true, if you think you may have sprained your ankle, you could go to your local x-ray tech shop, pay for service, for a look-see. Instead, government mandates that you see ""a licensed physician with an X-ray interpretation."" Why? Because over the years, lawsuits and subsequently the government bans have pretty much deleted any entrepreneurs from offering such services, under the guise: ""for your safety.""
So now, *for your safety*, because most people are stupid, and most companies are evil and most doctors are greedy.. *for your safety*, ""the Government will be running healthcare"" the best way the government knows how. Like DMV, IRS or any other agency you'd rather not deal with, but need.
In summation, this is just a beginning. More cancellations are to follow. We now live under a government where the Executive branch has apparently seized the power reserved for Congress (writing laws) and as such, Executive branch has modified ACA Obamacare 18 times so far without any congressional input. The so called ""employer mandate delay"" was one such example. This was delayed for after the midterm elections next year, because once the employer mandate hits businesses, upwards of 70 million people could receive further cancellations, according to who you talk to. We shall see.

BassoonHero,"As has been noted, E and B do have sharps – F and C. This really isn't any different than C sharp being the same note as D flat.

But why are B and C closer together than C and D? The answer is that there are twelve distinct ""pitch classes"" in western music, but seven in a ""diatonic"" scale such as the C Major scale. When notation was being standardized, the C Major scale became the ""default"", and the seven pitch classes in that scale got simple names, whereas the other five pitch classes have to be referred to via flat/sharp names.

But why does the diatonic scale have seven notes? You can arrange the pitch classes in the C Major scale (or any diatonic scale) so that each is separated from its neighbor by the interval of a ""fifth"": (F, C, G, D, A, E, B). This is, in fact, more or less how the scale was defined. Why seven notes? Because this is the smallest scale that will contain every interval. Chop off a pitch class at either end, and you cannot form the ""tritone"" (six semitones). Chop off one more and you cannot form a single semitone.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"So, everyone who receives income pays taxes on that income, whether or not they ""work"" or ""make any"" which are actually very difficult things to define when you look at them closely, and impossible to administer or,police in a large scale. 

But, basically the tax code says that all money you receive is taxable, unless something in the millions of pages of tax code, regulations, revenue letters, court rulings, and other sources.  

Essentially, every rich person pays a lot in taxes on income that they actually receive with one glaring exception -- municipal,bond investment income is totally tax free, regardless of amount received, total income, or wealth.  

So, for example, if I out $1 billion into municipal bonds that pay me an average of 5% per year! then I keep my billion plus I received $50 million in income every single year -- totally tax free.   By contrast, if instead of lending the billion to some local,government, I lend that money to a local private company for 5%, then I will still keep my billion (assuming the company doesn't fail), I will make my $50 million per year in interest income, and I will pay about 40% of that -- almost $20 million every single year -- in federal taxes plus state taxes (as high as an additional 12% or $6 million in some states).  

So, municipal bond interest income is the only real total tax code scam that wealthy people can use to actually receive,muse, and consume income while spying zero taxes. If Americans were actually educated about this, it would go away immediately.  But both political parties tolerate this game while pointing out totally irrelevant stuff and meaningless but heated sloganeering.  In addition to giving people a free ride, this municipal bond income exemption also forces residents of fiscally sound states to subsidize the fiscally reckless states, which just encourages the fiscally reckless states and their voters to tolerate fiscally reckless behavior.  

All forms of investment income, rental income, non-municipal interest income, and corporate income are heavily taxed or, where deductions exist, they were consciously chosen for public policy reasons to encourage specific behavior, such as research and development, charitable giving, expanding capital plant and equipment, exploration, construction, and similar behavior.  

I'd say that the mortgage interest deduction is also,a scam, but it primarily benefits existing home owners at the expense of renters and effectively subsidizes the realtors, mortgage bankers, and home builders.  

Edit -- literally thousands of pages can be written about how horrible the tax system is and why a corrupt federal government -- with both parties conspiring -- refuses to make it simpler and only keeps making it more complicated. But, people should start thinking about the most glaring weaknesses -- municipal bond interest income being totally exempt from all taxes and the overall complexity of the tax code as a whole.

FellowConspirator,"I presume that this question specifically relates to the GAO report on the purchase of 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition by the Department of Homeland Security in 2012. That number of rounds is about 3 times what the US military used over the 8 years in Iraq. DHS was also cited for purchasing a large number of hollow-point rounds, which cost almost twice as much as full metal jacket rounds. That ammo was purchased specifically by and for the DHS without intent to share with other government agencies (like the military).

The official explanation for the purchase from the DHS was: we need ammo and it's cheaper to purchase in bulk. No explanation for the purchase of hollow-point ammunitions was given. A spokesman said ""With more than 100,000 armed law enforcement personnel in DHS, significant quantities of ammunition are used to support law enforcement operations, quarterly qualifications, and training, to include advanced firearms training exercises.""

The GAO is investigating. Conspiracy theorists suggest that it may be a scheme to reduce gun violence by tying up the ammo manufacturers, causing shortages and increasing prices (there were shortages and increased prices, that part was true). However, the most likely scenarios are: someone did it just because they could, or someone had a financial or political interest tied to the manufacturers.

Maybe they're drastically changing their training program, but they haven't said that and probably wouldn't tell us if that's the case.

Since the Tesla Model S starts at $62,400^[3](http://www.teslamotors.com/models/facts) with a median US incomes are about $50k^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States) for a rate of 124.8% of annual income, you do have a point that Tesla's are relatively more expensive. They don't cater to lower-middle class, but rather the upper-middle - or at least those willing to reach beyond their means. 

Indeed by the 1920, the price of Model Ts fell to $260,^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Price) and while - due to the great depression - incomes were only at $1,500,^[4](http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/learning_history/children_depression/depression_children_menu.cfm) this still ran as little as about 17.3% of annual income.

However, it was not uncommon for cars to sell for a lot more. To start, by the time Fords had dropped to $500, a Chevrolet ran $850.^[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Baby_Grand) The 1910 National advertised at $2,500^[6](http://www.chuckstoyland.com/national/19101914/) or 208.3% average annual income. Baker automobiles ranged from $1,600 to $4,000 (roughly 130% to 330%).^[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Motor_Vehicle) A 1928 Duesenberg would have set you back $11,000 after having a coach made for it,^[8](http://www.howstuffworks.com/1928-1934-duesenberg-j-series.htm) which is something like $145,000 in current dollars.^[9](http://www.westegg.com/inflation/)

The difference is, you can't buy 22 mid-range cars (now referring to the Model A) for $145,000. Gasoline economy cars can be purchased in the high teens (Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla), but certainly not the $8,500 that 17%-of-annual-income would equate to. To stick with mid-range cars (and thus compare apples to apples as best we can) we need to look at a Toyota Avalon Hybrid or Ford Fusion Energi which sell for $37-38k.^[10](http://www.truecar.com/) Ultimately, the issue is much like /u/AnteChronos stated, compared to a $40k car is a $60k only for the wealthy?

The sensation you might feel that ""both of those are expensive"" is really quite accurate, albeit a bit backwards. As I've already noted, you can't buy 22 new mid-rage cars for $145k. Indeed, for that to be the case, then they'd have to cost $6,600 and **no** new car costs that little. In fact, the $145k is really more like 40k * 22 = $880k, which only barely gets you into the realm of ""super cars""^[11](http://exoticcars.about.com/od/toptens/tp/MostExpensiveCars.htm) that can seriously be compared to a Duesenberg. 

It's not that a $60k car is for the wealthy (if a Mclaren SLR is an A to the Bugatti's A+, and a Ford Focus is a D-, then a Tesla is priced like a D but looks and performs like a C+.), but that wealth is less equitably distributed now than it was in the 1920s.^[12](http://www.cbpp.org/images/cms/11-28-11pov-f3.jpg) The money still goes further, but someone else has all the money.

You can't drive across the country and find a parking log full of unsold, brand new Tesla Roadsters every 5 miles, but you can do that with GM, Chevrolet, Ford, Chrysler, etc.  Tesla's are essentially built to order at this point, so the supply is at an extreme low, demand is high enough from the people that can readily afford it, and being that Tesla doesn't have decades of design to build upon, the R&amp;D cost is high, they're a small company and can't afford maximizing their bulk material discounts, so the price is high.  When they start selling more, and they increase production to increase supply and the demand is satisfied, the price will decrease, not only due to higher supply and lower demand, but the decreased costs to produce the vehicle that comes from being a bigger company, reusing part designs from the previous year (eliminating huge chunks of R&amp;D), and so on. 

Think of the Nintendo Wii.  It came out at a certain higher price, everyone wanted one, they didn't have enough to sell to everyone in the beginning.

When the demand became too low, they created the Wii U, hoping for the same cycle, but it didn't seem to work out too great.

panzerkampfwagen,"When WW2 ended the 2 big kids on the block were the USA and the USSR (many incorrectly refer to the latter as Russia).

They had been allies during WW2 but that alliance was due to the whole, ""Enemy of my enemy thing,"" and not because they were natural allies.  After the war ended the USA wanted the lands it captured, along with the Western Allies of the Allies, to become democracies.  The USSR wanted the territories it captured to become socialist.  This caused a divide between the 2 Superpowers.  

The next almost half century was filled with both Superpowers trying to increase their spheres of influence around the world.

suspiciousface,"In the 1950s, the world was entering a new ice age. The USSR planned to re-heat the world using love and communism, based on research done by captured Nazi scientists shortly after the end of WWII. If this plan failed, the USSR was going to simply relocate to North America to escape the deadly cold.

This was obviously unacceptable, for a number of reasons. America was already having huge problems with ""hippies"", the slang term for evil communist agents. ""Free Love"" was promoted, as microwave ovens were quite expensive, so the communist plan would have less negative impact on the common man. If the entire population of the USSR arrived in America as planned, they could use democracy's one weakness against it and simply vote a communist party into power, abolishing democracy, capitalism, and the American dream. 

Canada wasn't a big part of the cold war because we were democratic and had already massed our population on the US border in case things got too cold in the Great White North. 

America had also captured Nazi scientists, but instead of communism, they intended to fix the ""global cooling"" problem by finding a way to turn on all the microwave ovens in the world at the same time, with the doors open. Due to the lack of microwave oven related information available in the world at the time, this would be impossible until after the problem had been solved.

The Cuban Missile Crisis came about as several countries had turned to the communist side with the USSR. Unfortunately, love and communism had not yet caused the world to heat up, and desperate times call for desperate measures. Cuba determined that the moon's reflected sunlight was outweighed by the sunlight blocked when the moon was between Earth and the Sun. Their solution:

Blow up the Moon.

America had already been investigating methods of capturing ""moon heat"" and transporting it back to Earth. Obviously this would be impossible if the moon was blown up, and America wanted to use the Cuban missiles to launch giant microwave ray guns into space, to better be able to microwave the planet.

Things were very tense for a while, as blowing up the moon would mean disaster for coastal cities, and the ice age was progressing faster than previously predicted. The USSR was becoming increasingly aware that democracy and the microwave-method was directly inhibiting their communist ideals. The solution was to concentrate all the microwave emissions directly on democratic nations like the US, warming the planet and frying their enemies simultaneously. Getting wind of these plans, the US had the rather unimaginative idea of doing the exact same thing to the USSR, but first.

Various different interest groups in the USSR didn't really want to zap the US, or get zapped for that matter. They broke off and descended closer to the mantle, a warmer section of the Earth. This is also where Atlantis and Zion (from the Matrix trilogy) are located. 

Anyways, the whole thing was more or less wrapped up by teenagers who discovered that they could create aerosol flamethrowers that look totally badass. In the process and rising popularity of this practice, enough CFCs were released into the atmosphere to warm it up, halting the impending ice age.

Unfortunately, this made the Earth into something of a ""greenhouse"", so now armies of trees advance on human civilization, and we have to cut down vast forests daily just to protect ourselves. There is a lot of tension in the Middle East because pieces of the moon were transported there in secret after the first moon landing. Plants are allergic to moon-rock, which is why there are no plants on the moon, and also why the Middle East has fewer, and stranger, plants.

The US maintains interest there currently due to ""towel-heads"", a derogatory term meant to ridicule those still interested in blowing up the moon. Being that these people still live on the surface, and wear regular fabrics, the term ridicules their lack of helmets/protective gear, other than turbans and ceremonial daggers, which obviously would not protect one from falling moon-bits.

The moon is also where heaven is, so the US is still very vehemently opposed to blowing it up. The rise of secular America has resulted in the beginnings of a process that will allow California to separate and sink to the Mantle, where it will join Atlantis, Zion, and the USSR separatists.

Many aspects of this have been criticized or explored through popular culture. For example, Star Wars: A New Hope was a thinly veiled warning of what may come if we allowed the moon-exploders to accomplish their goals.

CoolStoryJohn,"WWII ended with two primary power brokers: the U.S. and USSR.  Both countries were inherently distrustful of each other for two reasons: a) their systems of government (capitalist-democratic and socialist-communist) were significantly different, and b) after having fought a bloody, prolonged war together, both countries knew what the other nation was capable of militarily. 

 It really broke down to fear.  The U.S. wanted to cement its place in the world as the sole hyperpower, but the USSR threatened that designation by being so powerful itself.  While initially the USSR opposed the U.S. on more ideological grounds (the belief that capitalism was a true evil and the U.S. was the greatest exporter of this evil), that opposition grew less ideological by the end of WWII (less about the evils of capitalism and more about also wanting to be the world's sole hyperpower).  

As the post-WWII 20th century rolled on, a lot of the world took sides.  Most of eastern Europe and some South American countries allied themselves with the USSR and generally all of the western Democracies allied themselves with the U.S. (all other countries taking a ""wait and see"" stance--neutrality).  Both sides fought each other through what are now known as proxy conflicts.  In other words, the U.S. and USSR would find a conflict (often Democracy vs. Communism themed) in the world and each would support whichever side more favored their interests.  The side that won added credibility and power to whichever country supported them.  On top of these proxy conflicts, espionage was incredibly common, with USSR/allied spies in the west and U.S./allied spies in the east. 

Eventually, the west realized that the USSR had achieved a status that would result in mutually assured destruction (MAD) if they ever launched a nuclear strike at the east.  The USSR long had nuclear weapons, but MAD requires more than for both sides to just have atom bombs--there need to be nukes AND a delivery mechanism that cannot be disabled in the event of an attack (for example, the U.S. has planes flying and submarines operating 24/7 armed with nuclear missiles in the event of a nuclear attack on U.S. soil...so, if the U.S. is attacked, it will be able to offer a nuclear response regardless of how much damage it sustains).  Once the west realized that the USSR had mastered this delivery mechanism and MAD took effect, the chance of a direct armed conflict between the two sides (which one could argue would have been very likely if MAD was never achieved) diminished to about 0%.  The result was more proxy and more espionage until eventually the USSR more-or-less collapsed itself in the 90's (a very complicated issue itself) and the U.S./allies ""won"" the cold war.

dalevywasbri,"So before WW2 there were a multitude of competing powers. The most important of them were reliant on their past economic dominance for their position ie France and England. But the US is easily the largest economic power in the world before WW2 but has yet to be able to make in roads in to the rest of the world, that is to become a global power. And the USSR, while faltering, is a massive country with a lot of potential and tons of ideological prestige (Communism both before and after WW2 was a potent ideological power).
WW2 happens.
France, UK, Western Russia, Germany, Italy and Eastern europe are basically wastelands after the war. None of the former powers (Germany, France, UK or Italy) are psyched about abolishing capitalism and are therefore natural allies of the US. The US govt is looking around the world as all of these former colonies are falling - and obviously not all of them are naturally capitalistic- and so it wants to keep the peace and make more money. And The USSR at this time is under Stalin who is so paranoid he will kill anyone doing a good job. So it seemed to Americans that if we simply contain Communism in the Soviet Bloc give it a few years and the Soviets will fall and there will be even more markets to sell our goods.

So the first generation of US military planners are pretty cynical about this - The Soviets aren't close to taking over europe, they can barely keep the lights on.

The soviets, basically completely despite Stalin, start to recover and get some of their shit together. And The Second Generation of US military planners, in the 50's, are scared shitless of communism.

And then the Cuban missile crisis happens and the US military planners realize that this is somethin that they have to tread very lightly on and so tensions resolve. Money is great and all but if we kill all fauna on earth that would probably be bad for business.

Vietnam is just about making sure communism can't expand its market power and therefore its ability to make more military hardware.

And then Reagan's advisors were like ""you know what could make republicans win alot more electoral races? If we got money from arms manufacturers."" and so they brought the Cold war back from the grave.

And all the while since Stalin died the Communist leadership is so cynical about communism there is very little real work in trying to turn the world revolutionary - and effectively the Soviets are slowly getting less powerful.

shawnaroo,"They don't, but it's very common. During WWII, the government instituted wage freezes as part of the war economy, so companies offered potential employees various benefits in order to help hire good workers. One of the big benefits offered was health insurance. For better or worse (probably worse), it sort of stuck, and health insurance via employment became pretty standard since then. It even became subsidized, because the government offers various tax breaks to companies that provide health insurance to their employees.

One result of this has been that the health insurance marketplace for individuals has been a huge mess. Very complicated and very expensive. The ACA attempts to try and make the marketplace work better for individuals, but it's still in its early days and it's hard to say how well it will work in the long term.

On a company plan insurance providers cannot turn down enrollees for pre existing conditions.

Basically any money they spend on health insurance as a perk of the job gets to be written off tax-free, unlike what they spend on wages or other benefits. If they just gave the money in cash to the employees to buy their own insurance, income taxes would apply and take a chunk of the money before it got spent.

sacundim,"Well, first of all, somebody has to sue them, and I don't think there are many such lawsuits.  I suspect there just aren't many people who are actually turned down because of ethnicity—because most white people simply don't apply for these jobs.

Second, I don't know about where you live, but here in the S.F. Bay Area the workforce at ethnic restaurants is more diverse than what your question would imply:

1. Most small restaurants hire Latino immigrants as bussers or line cooks—but rarely as waiters.  This includes plenty of Asian restaurants—my neighborhood ramen restaurant, for example, has a Japanese chef directing a team of mostly Central American line cooks.  The owner is Japanese as is the wait staff except for one half-Japanese (who speaks perfectly fluent Japanese).  Most of the clientele is recent Chinese immigrants and Asian-Americans.
2. A lot of ""Japanese"" restaurants here are actually owned and operated by other ethnicities—most commonly by Koreans.  The reason, as I understand it, is that Japanese food has better profit margins.  (And these restaurants again usually have Latino line cooks and bussers.)
3. There are exceptions to this, still—for example, there's a Vietnamese restaurant in my town where one of the wait staff is Latino; he started as a busser, but I think the restaurant owners realized the value of having a Spanish-speaking waiter.  The restaurant is next door to an Asian chain supermarket that actually has a very good Latino products section and attracts a Latino as well as an Asian clientele.  The employees there are roughly evenly split between Chinese and Latino, though only about 25% of the cashiers are Latino.

So actually, the discrimination question out here is rather about whether Latinos are excluded from wait staff jobs.  But certainly a lot of them are undocumented, so they're not suing…

**EDIT:** Another example in my town: Peruvian restaurant, owned by Peruvians, Peruvian chef with some Mexican line cooks.  Dishes in the $12-18 range; at first most of the clientele was middle class Spanish speakers, and all of the wait staff spoke Spanish as well.  But word got out and it became more popular among English speakers; nowadays most of the customers are English-only speakers, and they've hired several wait staff that don't speak Spanish.

Then there's the shabu-shabu restaurant that used to have mostly Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian wait staff, and Latino cooks…  The Japanese takeout corner shop with the Mexican guy who makes great oyakodon… etc.",null,7,cdo9frf,1rkphs,explainlikeimfive,top_week,47
poisonous_crotch,"There is a lot of guessing and misinformation going on in this thread. Every business in the United States is subject to [Title VII of the Civil rights act of 1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_VII) if they have 15 or more employees unless they qualify for a bona fide occupational qualifier (BFOQ). 

Here is the criteria for a BFOQ as defined by legal precedence:

&gt;""To prove the bona fide occupational qualifications defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the ""essence"" or ""central mission of the employer's business,"" and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative.""

For example, private Catholic schools can require teachers to be Catholic in most cases since it is their mission to teach with Catholic values. I would find it difficult to believe a BFOQ would be granted to an ethnic restaurant when almost anyone can follow a recipe or take an order. It ultimately comes down to job duties and if a special trait is needed to perform essential functions. Most ethnic restaurants get off from this rule since they employee 15 people or less.

d3rp_h3rp,"As others have mentioned, a business can claim an exception to the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act if they employ fewer than 15 people, or if ethnicity is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). Although race, as in skin color, can never be part of a BFOQ, ethnicity can be. (Eg. French chef in a french restaurant.) The BFOQ exception is narrowly tailored, however. So an ethnic restaurant discriminating on the basis of ethnicity by only hiring chefs of the ethnicity in order to retain authenticity is probably acceptable, but only hiring servers or dishwashers of that ethnicity is probably closer to violating Title VII. 

Strictly within the letter of the law, many businesses engage in what could be considered illegal discrimination every day. Why does this still occur so frequently you may ask? Well first, you have to prove that you were discriminated against on the basis of your protected status. There are multitudes of obvious evidentiary problems in proving discrimination, especially that the discrimination was committed intentionally, not inadvertently. Second, the damages suffered by the aggrieved person are usually nominal. You didn't get the job as a dishwasher at that restaurant because you weren't the same ethnicity as them? Yeah, sounds discriminatory, and maybe it was. But what are you going to sue them for and expect to get from them? A few months pay maybe? Damages in these types of cases are usually so nominal that lawyers who practice this kind of law will not take your case. Lawyers who do take these cases do so on a volume basis. Ie. take as many of these cases as you can and send out letters to businesses threatening to sue unless they settle for a lesser value. Very rarely do these cases actually go to trial because of what it costs the lawyer in his or her time spent. Third, if you do go to trial, and the employer claims BFOQ or business necessity defense, there's even more chance that the employer may actually win, and the Plaintiffs lawyer gets nothing for all the time they just spent.

Sure, there's the Equal employment opportunity commission (EEOC), whose job it is supposed to be to enforce these laws, aside from private lawsuits, but the system basically works the same as a private lawsuit. The only difference is that the government pays the EEOC lawyer to investigate complaints and file lawsuits against employers, whereas the private lawyer only does so because of the potential to profit if they win. And when you think about how many Americans are clamoring about how the government is too big and spends to much money, you shouldn't be surprised to know that less than 5% of EEOC complaints result in some legal action, and the ones that do may take up to 4 years between initial complaint, and filing of a claim.

Finally, as mentioned initially, most restaurants like this are small businesses, so if they employ fewer than 15 people they can discriminate more or less all they want and it's not illegal. 

TL;DR It's usually not big enough of a deal for people who are discriminated against when they are not hired by an ethnic restaurant to sue over it. Legal fees will cost more than the potential reward if you win. The restaurant may also claim some exemptions under the law, so their discrimination is not per se illegal discrimination.",null,0,cdohpwl,1rkphs,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

After going through some administrative processes, you get in court. To prove your discriminatory claim in court you have to show 4 things. 

One of the things that you have to show is that you are qualified. Employers have what is known as a BFOQ defense( Bona Fide Occupational Qualification). An employer can show that it would not matter what national origin you are because you were not qualified for the job. Let's you get passed over for a server gig at a restaurant in El Paso, Texas. The restaurant owner decides to hire a person of Hispanic decent and could speak spanish fluently instead of you, a person who for this example is not of Hispanic decent and cannot speak spanish fluently.

DeathMadeTangible,"Supposedly, humans lose anywhere between 50-250 hairs a day, but the hair regrows so quickly that you would never know. It's only when we reach a certain age, that the hair regrowth cycle can not keep up with the amount of hair lost. Kind of like how skin cell regeneration can not keep up as we get older, thus we age. Other factors play into this equation such as hormonal production of testosterone (which causes destruction of the hair follicles) and in some people, this can manifest into something called ""androgenic alopecia."" 
Androgen = sex hormone. Androgenic alopecia does not only happen to middle-aged men, it can happen to post-pubescent boys and girls, as well as those in their 20s.  

Hair grows and sheds in 3 stages:

* Anaphase: Life cycle of 3-7 years. Numbers vary online, but something like 70 to 90% of your hair at any given time is in this category.

* Cataphase: Cycle of 3-4 months. Hair root (not the follicle) migrates closer to the surface of your skin. If you've ever tweezed/plucked a hair, you know that some hairs come out pretty easily and others HURT and will sometimes come with a little ""white ball"" at the end of the hair which was removed from the skin. This ""white ball"" is the hair root.

* Telophase: Cycle of 3-4 months when hair growth STOPS and is naturally forced outwards from the dermal layer and ""falls out.""  


Note: doing things such as trichotillomania, combing, brushing, braiding, forming dreadlocks, blow drying, shampooing, playing with your hair, all negatively affect the Anaphase cycle, which is why we sometimes see loose hairs in the shower or on our combs. This is usually not cause for alarm, but in some people, particularly men, it can be. There are shampoos especially formulated to stop hairloss, most people have heard of ""Rogaine."" Rogaine contains a chemical called Minoxidil, dilates blood vessels in the scalp and encourages hair regrowth in this way. Minoxidil is not effective for everyone, but has a pretty good success rate. Ironically, Minoxidil can actually make you LOSE hair faster by speeding up the Telophase cycle. In addition, Minoxidil compounds are often applied directly to the scalp and are formulated with alcohol as a preservative - which can destroy hair.  

However, there are alternatives which do not force your body to artificially restart Anaphase as much as they simply encourage a healthy scalp/hair follicle environment by using natural ingredients which improve blood circulation to the scalp and kill off pathogenic fungi/bacteria which can affect hair growth. One such shampoo is ""Regenpure"" and it does not contain Minoxidil.

Salacious-,"Let's do this chronologically.

There was a guy named Booker Dewitt. He fought at the Battle of Wounded Knee, killed a lot of indians, and felt really bad about it. After the battle, he found people being baptized in the river. At first he volunteered for the baptism.

Here, the universe splits. It becomes World A, in which Booker does not go through with the Baptism, and goes back to his life and becomes a strike buster. In World B, he becomes Zachary Comstock, remains in the military and goes to Columbia. 

Booker in World A eventually has a baby, Anna. Comstock, in world B, is unable to have a baby because of experiments done by Leteuce. Comstock in world B wants to have a baby, and Leteuce thinks that she can get him one from the world of her ""brother"" (who is really her in the alternate universe, similar to how Comstock/Booker are the same person). Booker has a ton of gambling debts but no way to pay off the debts, so Male Leteuce says he can pay off the debts by giving them his baby. He agrees to do that, and they take the baby, but Booker changes his mind and chases them. Leteuece gets Anna through the rift, but part of her pinky gets cut off and stays in Booker's world, meaning she exists in both World A and World B at the same time. This gives her the ability to open portals between worlds. These rifts can also span across various times (for example, in one early scene Elizabeth opens a rift to NYC, and the theater marquis shows ""Star Wars"" being played, even though it's only 1912 in the game).

Booker sinks into alcoholism and depression after losing his baby, carves her initials (AD) into his hand, and gets into more debt. Leteuce again offers to wipe away the debts, if he goes to this city and brings a certain girl to New York. He agrees, and they bring him out to Maine, and pass through a rift at some point without him knowing. He goes into the light house and goes up to Columbia, rescues Elizabeth from her tower, they flee the city, etc. Elizabeth is captured by Songbird and brought back to Comstock's house. Future version of Elizabeth brings Booker to the future and shows him what happened as a result of not having stopped Songbird from taking her, then sends him back to stop Songbird. Elizabeth opens a tear to Rapture (from Bioshock 1) and Songbird is killed by the water pressure. Then they go up to the lighthouse. Each lighthouse represents a ""World"" created by a choice (like, Booker's choice to get baptized or not). Each world branches off from many different important choices. Anna realizes that as long as there is a world in which Comstock exists, there will be a world in which she ends up destroying everyone using Columbia. So, she opens a tear and they go back to the moment where Comstock began: the baptism. There, the many versions of Elizabeth that had all reached the same conclusion meet up and drown Booker before he can become Comstock, thus preventing that horrible future from ever happening, and that's why they all disappear.",null,16,cdo79rg,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,105

You are Booker. You, due to some issues, gave away your baby daughter. The trauma of this caused you some problems, and your memory of the incident appears to be a little shoddy.

Later, you are in debt. You are given an opportunity to find a girl and bring her back to wipe out the debt. You take it, and end up on a floating island where you are seen as an outsider and everyone loses their shit. You defend yourself and begin your trek towards the girl.

Many dead bodies later you find the girl. She wants to go to Paris. You want to wipe out your debt. Hilarity/violence ensues.

Meanwhile, her daddy Comstock wants to kill you, so the city is up in arms trying to turn you into liquid goop. The girl, Elizabeth, shows you she can open up tears between worlds/dimensions, and so you use them to get around. It's kind of cool, but a little creepy. 

Anyways, she gets captured, and you try to save her, fail, get a lecture from future Elizabeth, go back, get tossed around between dimensions for a while, and end up killing Comstock. You begin to realize there is something else going on, but that you have forgotten.

Cue flashback. Elizabeth is your daughter. Comstock is you in the future, but a unique future you whose nards are toasted by overusing a machine that opens tears like what Elizabeth can do. It's one of many futures in which you become Comstock. Not all futures end that way, but some do. Elizabeth notes that the only way to truly stop Comstock is to make sure Comstock never exists - so she and other Elizabeths from other 'dimensions' drown your ass. Thus you die, Comstock is never born, and potentially Elizabeth is never born, therefore none of this matters.

RexMundane,"Since the whole story rather confuses itself a few times, most of this is interpretation as much as anything, so grain of salt.

There was a man named Booker, and during the battle at Wounded Knee he did some very bad things. On his way home he stumbles on a baptism, and participates. But, at the last minute he resists, reasoning the bad things he's done can't be washed away in a moment and a prayer. 

He grows older, becomes bitter, taking a series of jobs working for ever harder and crueler men. He marries, but his wife dies in childbirth, and in time he sells his daughter Anna to a crime boss to pay for his gambling debts. Despondent with grief, cynicism, and drink, he loses himself in his misery and ultimately forgets any happy moment he ever knew, and there he remains for some 15 years or so.

Desperate again with gambling debts, he takes another job to rescue a young woman from a city called Columbia, which is made of buildings that float among the clouds, led by the prophet Zachary Hale Comstock. The young woman in question is Elizabeth, Comstock's daughter, locked in a tower, and is herself is a bit of a mystery, missing part of her little finger, uncommonly intelligent, and posessiong supernatural powers. 

Rescuing her, avoiding the monstrous Songbird, and getting through the political struggles of a class structure at war with itself, Booker and Elizabeth, in order to affect their escape, Booker and Elizabeth ultimately destroy the tower where Elizabeth was kept, releasing all the energy that had previously kept Elizabeth's diminished, and she becomes, in effect, a kind of goddess, capable of exploring alternate universes past and present. And it is here Booker learns the truth. Comstock is, in fact, Booker, and Elizabeth is actually Booker's Daughter Anna.

All those years ago, at the Baptism, in an alternate universe, there *was* a version of Booker who decided that, yes, all his cruel misdeeds *could* be wiped away easily. That, by extension, perhaps any cruelty can be mitigated by circumstance and ambition, that any ends can justify all means. And of that mindset he pursued the construction of Columbia using the bizarre science of a physicist named Rosalind Lutece which would allow not just for levitation, but crossing planes of reality. 

To accomplish his dream he needs a daughter of his own bloodline, but the scientific experiments would render him sterile, and so he, along with Rosalind, would conspire with Robert, the version of Lutece from Booker's universe, to take Booker's daughter Anna. Knowing this, and how much trouble is caused by it all, Booker realizes the only way to stop the madness and evil Comstock would eventually become responsible for, is to back, yet again, to the baptism, to go under the water, and never come up again, sacrificing his life, which he does with the help of various iterations of Elizabeth/Anna.

After all of this, Booker awakens on the day he would trade his daughter Anna to the mob boss. Was all of it a dream? A vision of a parallel universe and bad times to come? Or all a memory of a reality undone by Elizabeth? ",null,1,cdo8bud,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5

On a still or slow moving image the quality difference isn't evident. However if you begin to add motion to the equation (sports and gaming most notably) you will see much more of a blurring effect on televisions with a lower refresh rate. A television with a 120hz refresh rate presents nearly twice as many frames refreshed as a 60hz display. 

I can see it most notably when playing *The Impossible Game* on a 60hz telelvision (LCD) compared to one with a 600hz (plasma). [See the difference](http://imgur.com/a/ck5OP)? The level itself is moving from right to left causing a slight motion blur while the label of attempts and the orange box-like character do not move and are stable in their quality. One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of manufacturers use things like refresh rates and contrast ratios to sell more units when it really isn't any different from the display sitting right next to it. In addition - there are often options in the display's settings to add *artificial* frames to a display's input.

If you're trying to put a 24fps movie onto a screen that refreshes 60 times per second, there's no simple way to do this that lets you show each frame of the movie for the same length of time - you'd need a TV that showed 72 frames for a movie frame to show for 3 screen frames, or 48hz to show a movie frame for 2 screen frames.  In practice, they use a ""3:2 pulldown"" - alternating between showing a movie frame for 3 frames on the TV and 2 on the TV.  Some people don't like how this looks.

If you have a TV that natively shows 120 frames per second, this isn't a problem.  30hz video can show each frame for 4 frames on the TV, 60hz signals can show it for 2 and movies that were originally recorded in 24fps can show each frame for 5 refreshes of the screen.

As far as I know, there's no widely used standards for video that are actually using all 120Hz.  Some TVs will try to smooth out video &amp; guess what the in-between frames are - some people like this and some think it's horrible.

So, Franz was killed by a group who want Serbia to be independent.

When Franz was killed, Austria instituted harsh measures to crack down. Russia told them to back off, which eventually led to those two going to war.

There were a number of other factors beyond alliances. Germany was the new, growing power in Europe and they thought they could get some significant concessions from the other countries if they won the war, like colonies and other trade rights, because the other countries had snapped up the good territories before German unification.

Well, not exactly an answer but something to chew on (for your brain)

In quantum physics and string theory, there are multiple dimensions (more than 4, changes from theory to theory). Also everything is at every state it CAN be at the same time.

Now it is claimed that these dimensions and all the possible realities exist and are 'membranes'. Think of them as balloons, each expanding as they are inflated. If the two alternate universes collide (balloons bumping into each other), they first start pushing each other then they collapse (the two balloons blowing up). The energy is so huge that, such an event can be the energy source and the cause of our big bang..

So theoretically, two alternate universes collided and the resulting energy gave birth to our universe. Now the brain fodder: If two universes collide to create another, how did the first universe come into existence? Maybe it did not require a huge energy like our big bang?

At the birth of our nation, founding fathers, like James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were influenced by Roger Williams, who wrote ""there needs to be a hedge between the garden of the church, and the wilderness of the world."" 
These men made sure that the US government respects all religions, and wouldn't ""tax them to destruction"" ( a phrase from the 1970 Supreme Court Case:  Walz v Tax Commission of the City of New York). The ruling of this case said that grants of tax exemptions for religious institutions.
Justice Burger stated in the ruling: ""  the exemptions for religious organizations created only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less of an involvement than would be created by taxation of churches, and the effect of the exemptions was thus not an excessive government entanglement with religion. The grant of a tax exemption was not sponsorship of the organizations because the government did not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstained from demanding that the churches support the state. The exemption created a more minimal and remote involvement between church and state than did taxation because it restricted the fiscal relationship between church and state and reinforced the desired separation insulating one from the other.

SqueakyGate,"&gt; We live in a world with advanced medicine and doctors

Actually you do...and well probably most of reddit. For many, the access to basic needs (clean water, food, shelter, medicine, dentists etc.) is a daily struggle. So for them I would say traditional mechanisms of natural selection are still very much at play.

Evolution works by two main mechanisms, natural selection and sexual selection. Traits which are *naturally* selected for improve the chances of the individual surviving to sexual maturity. Traits which are *sexually* selected for improve the chances of an individual reproducing. Evolution occurs when the frequency of alleles (gene variants) changes over time. A person does not evolve, a population does. Also remember that traits and behaviours are not just driven by genes. An expressed trait or behaviour is the sum of the genes + environment. Moreover what is beneficial in one environment can be detrimental in another. Consider this: for much of human history being able to store fat was a good thing because by and large resources were scarce. Now, for certain populations resources are in abundance thus being able to store fat is a bad thing. This is because our bodies naturally want to store fat because of this ancient scarcity, now its working against us - we have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases etc.

The [hardy-Weinberg principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy–Weinberg_principle) explores the hypothetical situation where evolution ceases. It ""states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. These influences include *non-random mating, mutation, selection, genetic drift, gene flow and meiotic drive*. Because one or more of these influences are typically present in real populations, the Hardy–Weinberg principle describes an ideal condition against which the effects of these influences can be analyzed."" Thus there is no real world situation where all of these assumptions are met even in places with advanced medicine.

Humans are always interacting with their environment, even if that is living in a big modern city.. Our population gene frequencies are always changing. Thus we are always evolving. Yes, some people are indeed surviving into adulthood who would otherwise probably die but that does not equal to a halt in evolution. 

Moreover, many diseases or illnesses that we treat, like huntington's arise or are expressed only after an individual has reproduced thus their ""bad"" genes have already made it into the next generation. In certain cases we can genotype people and determine the level of their genetic risk in which case they may or may not decide to reproduce. However, the ability to do this is limited...there are many diseases which we cannot predict from a person's genes thus they unknowingly pass these on anyway.

Finally, humans are always being influenced by sexual selection. What is considered attractive is also influenced by culture and thus can vary from place to place and through time. Not to long ago being fat was considered attractive because an individual had the means and resources to accumulate wealth. Now, in western cultures being thin is considered attractive. Be careful - some traits can be influenced by genes (eye colour, hair colour, height, weight) but others are not (hairstyles, clothing etc.). Both can change over time, and both are influenced by culture but only some will result in physical/behavioural changes to the human population. For example, there was a first human, born about 10,000 years ago with a blue eyed gene. This person was obviously considered attractive because their blue eyed gene was past on into subsequent populations (i.e. they managed to have children, and their children had children). If that first blue eyed person was considered unattractive then  blue eyes might not have been as widespread as they are today. Blue eyes do not provide any survival advantage - e.g. they don't help you see better or farther - they provide a sexual advantage in certain populations.

Edit: I simplified the blue eyed example from the true story of blue eyes arising, but the core of it is the same. ",null,5,cdo92k1,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8

entropydecreaser,"Short answer: yes.

Evolution occurs whenever the frequency of alleles in a population changes over time. Alleles are essentially ""types"" of genes that code for specific traits. For example, there's an allele for black hair, an allele for blonde hair, and an allele for red hair. The hair colour you get depends on which allele you have. This is a huge oversimplification, but it gives us a good-enough groundwork when talking about the theory behind evolution.

There are several things to keep in mind. The first is that evolution is not only governed by natural selection. There are four factors that result in evolution: mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. I'll go through each one and discuss why humans are continuing to evolve.

Mutations are the random introduction of new alleles in a population. They arise as a result of errors in DNA replication, or other factors. So, regardless of medicine, mutations will always arise. Mutations are not as significant of a factor as the other three, so I won't go into detail here.

Gene flow is the introduction of alleles to a population because of immigration. This is very significant when applied to humans. Let's look at London, for example. A thousand years ago, almost all Londoners had Caucasian alleles that coded for white skin, light hair, etc... Now, however, there are people immigrating to London from around the world (I'm going to use India in this example). So Indians move to London, and are essentially adding new alleles to the population, that code for brown skin, black hair, etc.... Assuming that there are white/Indian couples, their kids now have different set of alleles than Londoners would have had a thousand years ago. If we go back to the initial definition of evolution, regarding the change in allele frequencies in a population, this clearly satisfies that.

Next is genetic drift. This is the random change in allele frequencies over time. Though this does happen, the population of humans is big enough that we can dismiss it as being not particularly influential.

Lastly, natural selection. I assume that you understand natural selection due to your question, but I'll explain for any readers that might not. Natural selection occurs when certain alleles are ""favoured"" over other ones in a particular environment. For example, in a cold environment, dogs with thick fur will presumably live longer and have more offspring than those with thin fur. Over time, since those with thin fur die out and don't have as many kids, the allele coding for thin fur disappears from the population. The one coding for thick fur increases in frequency. This is where medication comes in. Historically, diseases frequently killed many people and those that were resistant survived. If we take the example of smallpox being introduced to the New World, many Native Americans died, but those that were resistant lived and continued to have kids and spread their alleles. Thus, alleles that caused a resistance to smallpox, or overall better health, increased in frequency. Now, medication erases many of these selective pressures. Those with diabetes in the first world don't die as much anymore. Previously, alleles that caused people to be prone to diabetes would have been decreasing over time, because those with that allele died young and didn't have kids. Now, they continue to live just like healthy people, and they presumably have as kids that inherit these alleles. So, in a sense, you have a valid point. However, there are plenty of diseases that we don't have easy cures for. Cancer and AIDS are two examples. Individuals who are resistant to HIV/AIDS are presumably going to live longer and have more kids (generally) than those who are not resistant, so we can expect certain alleles to increase in frequency over time, and others to decrease.

There is one other point I want to make about natural selection. There is a particular kind of natural selection called sexual selection. This is when females pick their mates based on certain characteristics, and those that are chosen have more kids than those who are not chosen. By having more kids, the alleles that coded for these characteristics are passed on. Sexual selection is certainly existent in modern populations. For example, women often prefer men that are muscular over men that are fat. Of course, musculature and fat are hugely affected by lifestyle, but genetics also plays a role. Assuming that these muscular men have sex more and have more kids than fat men do (on average), then over a long period of time, alleles coding for big muscles will increase and those coding for a predisposition to fat will decrease.

Consider having that bad gene might be barely survivable in one person, but maybe when combined in someone with a specific other gene the two cancel out the bad and produce a new feature.  Without the new survivability of that 'bad' gene the chances of the two being found together was very small, but now that it's survivable it gets a chance to find that other gene.

Darabo,"I attended the 2010 Expo in Shanghai multiple times for multiple reasons so perhaps I can shed some light about it.

The major World Expos are every ten years, usually lasts around six months or so and are a modern day variant of the World's Fair (which brought us great monuments such as the Eiffel Tower and so forth).  

Each Expo has a theme the various countries and organizations have to follow in order to showcase it for the advancement of the future and blah blah.  As with the Eiffel Tower in Paris I think electricity was revealed in an expo about 100 years ago as were other major inventions so it's considered a big deal if a city hosts the expo.  If I remember correctly the theme for 2010 was *Better City, Better Life* and the different countries/organizations had items related to it.

Note how I also say organizations which range from Coca-Cola to the United Nations.  In the end however due to the flux of tourists into the area for the expo most of the venues for these countries/organizations will be nothing advertisements/propaganda highlighting their country and promoting tourism and so forth. 

In regards to the economy there will be thousands of buildings, venues and etc. built just for this expo.  This means thousands of construction jobs, workers, planners and etc.  Then during the expo there will be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of tourists which means even more revenue for the city.  Plus the host country tries to one up everyone else's venue since it's a sort of friendly competition and goes all out in a major fashion.  For example China's booth during the Shanghai Expo in 2010 was about ten stories tall and was easily the best building in the Expo.  

Here's a photo of the China Pavilion but it's one of those buildings where it looks sort of small until you get close and then you see how huge it it.

CoolKidBrigade,"It is better to turn down your heat when you are not home. tl;dr: The amount of energy it takes to bring your house from cold to warm is less than the amount of energy required to keep it warm all day.

To answer your question, you need to define *better*. I'll take better to mean *wastes the least amount of energy*. If each technique keeps your house the same temperature when you are home (the energy inside is constant), what we need to compare is **how much energy gets leaked outside**.

When your house is hotter inside than outside, the energy (heat) will move from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration. The warmer your house is than the outside, the faster this will happen. It's the same reason why you can boil water faster on a stovetop set to high than a stovetop set to medium-high. The hotter something is (like the burner), the faster heat will flow from the source to the surrounding environment (like the water). You can look up Newton's Law of Cooling for equations that describe this effect.

So, when you keep the house warm all day, you leak heat outside at a constant rate. The only way to leak heat faster is if you heat the house above room temperature. If you turn down your heat when you're gone, at first the heat leaks at the same rate as a heated house, but as the house cools the rate of heat leaking will slow down simply because there is less of a temperature difference between outside and inside. When you need to reheat the cold house, it doesn't matter that it might feel like you are using a lot of energy, as you bring the temperature of the house up you are always leaking heat at a slower rate than if you kept it that temperature the entire time.",null,2,cdoa9lq,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,30

If you're not running the AC you're not using electricity and if you're not running heat you're not using gas.  Not using those things means you spend less month to month.

------------------------

It costs money to heat the house in the winter and AC the house in the summer and either case they sit around 72 degF.  So if no one is in the house during work hours (8 hours a day) then it's not worth paying for 8 hours of heating/cooling which is what just about every modern thermostat does these days.  They let the house heat up in the summer and not run the AC or it lets the temp drop in the winter by not running the heat.

brokengoose,"I'm going to assume that by ""better"", you mean ""cheaper"". 

Think about it this way: is it better to turn the thermostat down if you're going out of town for a month? Yes. Obviously. How about a week? A day? A few hours?

In other words, what's the magic point at which it becomes better to leave the heat on? The correct answer is usually, ""Never."" You'll always use the least energy by turning down the heat when it's not needed. That usually means that it's cheapest to turn down the heat whenever you leave the house.

The one exception would be if your heat comes from a source that charges different rates depending on the time of day. (Say, an apartment with electric heat.) In that case, if there's a huge difference in price, it might make sense to keep the heat on during a cheap part of the day so that you can run the heat less during a more expensive part of the day. That's a really complicated problem to solve, but fortunately, it doesn't apply to most people.

A lot of people assume that when a multi-stage furnace kicks into ""high"" that it's operating less efficiently. That's usually not true. Usually, a furnce churning away at full power is more efficient than one that's kicking on for a few minutes every hour.

Edit to add: My experience is that people who argue that leaving the heat on is ""better"" are really more worried about how long it takes to heat the floors and cold corners. They feel stupid arguing that ""turning the heat down when we're gone makes it less comfortable to walk across the floor with my shoes off for a few hours"", so they concoct strange arguments that defy the laws of thermodynamics.

The basic equation is this:
How long would your heater be running in order to bring the house back up to temp &lt;vs&gt; How long would your heater be running during the time you are gone.  

In my experience it is worth turning down the temp a bit.  

A/C generally takes longer to cool a house a few degrees than a heater does to heat a house up a few degrees.

SoLongFall,"TL:DR- It is better to keep the temperature closer to outside temperatures to decrease power consumption, however the benefit decreases with better insulation. Edit: Don't drop the temperature below 50 or 55 F to keep the pipes from freezing.

Alright, there are several ways that your house transfers temperature but basically we have discovered that the energy in heat must go somewhere.  In this case we have four ways that the heat can transfer.

Radiation: this sort of heat transfer will happen through energy carrying electromagnetic waves. This is solely based upon the temperature of the object and not the surroundings. The higher the temperature of the object and the more surface area, the more heat/energy it will radiate.

Convection: This is the transfer of heat through flowing winds and water. This one depends upon the temperature difference of the two objects(house/outside) and the bigger the difference, the faster you try to heat up the wind!

Conduction: The other types of heat transfer deal with the walls and roof of your house, this one deals with the floor(or earth if you like living one with nature and have dirt floors.)  In this case the earth stays ~50ish degrees so some of your energy is going to heating up the the surface of the floor.

Advection: Some of the air inside of your house goes outside taking all of that precious heat with it and some air comes inside.  You will need to reheat this air and the more you have to heat it the more energy it will use.

Now all of this depends on heat getting to the outside walls of your house. See, your house is essentially two cubes with one inside of the other.  The inner cube is the floor you walk on and the drywall inside of your house with that sweet wallpaper while the outside is what you show to the world as well as the foundation of your house.

The heat will move from the inside to the outside through your walls based upon the first three ways of heat transfer listed above. This is where insulation comes into play. The better insulation you have the ""slower"" it will move through the walls and the less the inside of your house will heat up the outside of your house.

2. Do not put the good people in jail

Ethically, everyone deserves the right to due process and a fair trial to determine their guilt. Until the defendant is found guilty and convicted of the crime, they are supposed to be presumed innocent and treated as such, in order to guarantee a fair and just system.

Also keep in mind that sometimes a person may technically be guilty of committing a crime, but their actions may be ethically or morally justified in some way. So, while the lawyer may realize their client did actually commit the crime (e.g. they did kill a person), they may take moral comfort in the fact that their client only did so under (potentially) morally excusable circumstances (e.g. self defense, under duress, to save someone else's life, to end someone's suffering, etc.)

Also, not all lawyers are willing to defend a client who has freely admitted their guilt, it's really up to the lawyer to decide whether they are willing to represent such clients in court to defend their innocence. In such cases, it could be that the lawyer is not actually defending the client's innocence, but rather is hired simply to represent the client in court and to negotiate an appropriate plea bargain deal to reduce the sentence to whatever extent is possible.

DuckySaysQuack,"Political science is not a real science so sometimes the title is confusing. That said, political science is a degree that mixes history, philosophy, regional cultural studies, economics, and government. It is usually the precursor degree one takes to get a law degree.

Basically it teaches you about how the government works, the basic assumptions of political philosophy, and the historical and cultural context in which led up to political thought and ideology to how the government works is today. You learn about how our ideas of freedom, justice, democracy, communism, socialism etc all come from philosophers and thinkers in history and how they evolved into what they are today.

Classes you will expect to take would include:

Philosophy classes on thought and theories of government.

Government classes (how the US or foreign governments work).

History classes and area study classes.

Economics about trade, taxation, etc.

Sociology and globalization classes.

Communication classes.

Languages.

Poli sci majors are often jacks of all trades but experts on few. Expect LOTS of writing papers and essays in a political science degree. Where other degrees teach you how to solve math problems, build things, solve diseases, etc, poli sci degrees teach you how to think critically and communicate in written and oral form effectively. Poli sci degree teaches you how to write well and write persuasively.

Poli sci graduates go on to become congressional aides, government workers, teachers, campaign organizers, law students, researchers, journalists, etc. Lots of jobs with writing skills.

1. System of government (i.e., how the US (or whatever nation you live in) operates (how laws are made, branches of government, etc.)

2. Comparative government. Look at the different types of governmental systems (presidential, parliamentary, dictatorship, etc.)

3. International relations. How governments operate between and amongst each other. Different types and styles of diplomacy.

4. Political theory. Usually involves a lot of philosophy and reading of Plato, Machiavella, etc as they determine the fundamental nature of what politics is.

5. Public policy. How public policy is formed (who writes the laws, interest groups, who enforces or executes the policy).

6. Political history. Basically a history of politics and culture  in your home system (i.e. how did two parties form? Why are there different states? Why is the amendment process the way it is?)

7. Statistics. Poli sci has a lot of statistics (for polling, research, etc.) So expect a stats course or two.

And there is a lot more. Most programs have specialized classes (such as Congress, Supreme Court, Economics, etc.) That go into great detail.

When a light photon enters a layer of snow, it goes through an ice crystal on the top, which changes its direction slightly and sends it on to a new ice crystal, which does the same thing. Basically, all the crystals bounce the light all around so that it comes right back out of the snow pile. It does the same thing to all the different light frequencies, so all colors of light are bounced back out. The ""color"" of all the frequencies in the visible spectrum combined in equal measure is white, so this is the color we see in snow, while it's not the color we see in the individual ice crystals that form snow.

Basically, if you just had a big block of ice, light can pass right through it, where as with snow, light is being reflected and bounced around many many times, through many crystals of snow.",null,1,cdoasge,1rl2xe,explainlikeimfive,top_week,39
Nickel5,"Expanding on criedley's comment as to give a bit more to the reason why.  Atoms aren't arranged so they're right next to each other (which makes sense, since atoms aren't REALLY round spheres).  They form a crystal, they have a pattern.  This pattern repeats across the structure.  When light waves enter a material, certain wavelengths get ""lost"" within the structure, others bounce back, we see the wavelengths that bounce back.  The crystal repeats across the entire material, so the color is consistent.

Compare this to snow.  Each snowflake is random.  The snowflakes fall in a random pile.  There is no order in a snowbank.  Therefore, all wavelengths get reflected eventually.  Resulting in white.

Compare this to ice.  When water freezes, the water molecules have time to align themselves as to reach a the lowest energy possible.  This alignment will be the same for each water molecule.  It happens that at this arrangement, light waves are able to be reflected in such a way to let us see through.

The NSA specializes in signals intelligence - getting information from data transmitted among people or groups or governments or what have you. They deal with encryption, decryption, and information/data security for the US government. 

The NSA is under the Department of Defense, and reports to the Director of National Intelligence.

The CIA is its own agency (not managed by the DoD), but it does still report to the Director of National Intelligence. The Defense Clandestine Service has been established by the Department of Defense, to serve, for all intents and purposes, as its version of the CIA.

Again, neither the CIA or NSA are law enforcement agencies.

The ATF and FBI, however, are both law enforcement agencies under the Department of Justice.

The FBI, in general, investigates federal crimes, which involve laws broken at the federal level, not state or local levels. For example, speeding is dealt with in a more local jurisdiction, by city, county, or state police. Tax evasion, or the possession of banned weapons would be an example of federal crimes.

The ATF, in general, investigates (and works to prevent) unlawful use, manufacture and possession of firearms and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products. The ATF is also responsible for licensing the sale, possession, and transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce.

The ATF used to be part of the Treasury Department, but in 2002, with the establishment of the Dept. of Homeland Security, the ATF was moved to the Dept. of Justice.

The Secret Service was also under the Treasury Department. They were moved to the Dept. of Homeland Security in 2003. They investigate financial crimes, such as the counterfeiting of money and major fraud. They are also tasked with protecting current and former national leaders and their families: presidents, past presidents, vice presidents, presidential candidates, etc.

The Department of Homeland Security, simply, is like the Department of Defense, except DHS works in the civilian sphere to protect the U.S. inside, at, and outside its borders. It focuses on prevention of, preparation for, and response to domestic emergencies - particularly terrorism.

You can see from this very basic comparison that, even though there is overlap, not all of these organizations do the same thing. Because the DoD has different goals from the DHS (beyond ""protect the U.S.""), you can see why they each have their own agencies (with vastly different responsibilities) working towards the overall mission.

We also have so many laws that breaking up intelligence gathering and enforcement into different areas makes overall organization easier, even though there are disputes over territory and jurisdiction sometimes. It could probably be simplified to a large extent, but combining all of these into one huge agency would probably create a bigger nightmare. Instead, more should be done to promote inter-agency cooperation and data sharing, and reduced competition.

Hirodo,"Well take a seat this post may take awhile.  As states elsewhere each organization was originally created for a specific purposes.  Sometimes these purposes could not be combined for legal reasons, an issue I'll explain a little later on.

First, the FBI was created as a solution to the pesky problem of gangsters and jurisdiction.  During the 1920's and 1930's many bank robbers, bootleggers, and other mafioso types could keep away from the law by crossing state lines.  Crossing into another state would effectively halt any chase and apprehension by the authorities in the state the crime was committed in.  The FBI was created as a Federal Police like force that could continue the investigation and chase despite criminals crossing state lines.  Needless to say the FBI has grown to be the go to investigative law enforcement agency, dealing with high profile crimes and other federal level crimes.

CIA: The CIA grew out of the WWII intelligence agency the OSS(think early Medal of Honor games).  The CIA main goal was operational  intelligence and foreign intelligence aka spy stuff.  This is still what they do.  The CIA main goal is to find out what we don't know, usually from the source, such as agents inside the host countries and any contacts they have fostered.  During the last fifty years or so the CIA has grown to not just include covert monitoring but covert action as well.  The CIA Special Activities Division is very active in war zones and other countries forcing changes, such as overthrows.  In fact the first US forces into Afghanistan where CIA operatives from SAD  Of course any and all of this is subject to speculation.  

NSA: This is actually a very simple agency from an overall perspective.  The NSA provides intelligence, both domestic and foreign, by electronic means aka SIGINT.  The NSA is a component of the DoD.

Secret Service:  The Secret Service started as the law enforcement and criminal investigation arm of the Treasury Department.  The Secret Service is one of the oldest forms of federal law dating back to the Civil War.  Back then they're role was slightly larger but for the purpose of being brief I'll skip that part.  The Secret Service fell into the protection of the President and other VIPs after the assassination of William Henry.  

ATF: Will talk about during Homeland Security

Homeland Security:  Now here is where everything ties together, kinda.  The Department of Homeland Security is just that, a cabinet level Department that over sees many agencies, including the Secret Service and FEMA.  The main mission of Homeland Security is the internal protection of the United States by threats, both domestic and foreign.  Although not completely compromised of Law Enforcement Agencies, Homeland Security does maintain a certain level of LE capabilities when these agencies have missions that correlate to actual security.  For example the Coast Guard is now an agency of Homeland Security, there main mission is domestic maritime policing, or Customs and Border patrol whose main mission is security of the borders and entry points.  Homeland Security agencies do not focus of the prosecution of criminals other then the ones stated above.  The falls to the Department of Justice, where the FBI and ATF reside.  In essence the ATF is like the FBI but with a strong focus on, you guessed it, Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco.  They do more then policing work as they also regulate the sales and transfer of such items.

It is considered respectful in English to not use someone's name in front of them until invited to do so.  This stems from an ancient belief that reciting a name gives you power over that person.  

This is why in formal settings we say ""Madam Mayor"" and ""Mr. President"" instead of calling them by their names.  Sometimes we mean to show respect, but we need to use names in order to be understood - this is basically how surnames came to be.  So we say ""Mr. Smith"" until we're invited to call him ""John.""

Parent is a position of high authority and respect within the family.  So we don't use our parents names, we instead refer to them by their title, though because we learn ""Mother"" and ""Father"" at such early ages, we find ""Mom(my)"" and ""Dad(dy)"" constructions by most children.

Interestingly there are positions so high that we can't even use the name of the title in their presence.  This is mostly royalty where we say, ""Your/His/Her Majesty.""

Female prostitutes reported the condition when interviewed by Kinsey, as well as other sex researchers. 

It's real, and it can happen to anyone. While the solution is an orgasm, and simple masturbation to orgasm can cure it, it wouldn't be wrong to say that sex with someone else would also alleviate it, and probably do a better job, unless the person it happened to was particularly skilled at masturbation, and who am I kidding this is the internet I'm talking to. 

Personally, I don't get blue balls anymore, but I've also trained my kegels to the point where I can hold off an ejaculation or ejaculate and keep going while not losing an erection. I have, on occasion, had multiple orgasms with only the last one resulting in ejaculation. I also jelq and stretch, so the amount of work I put into my sex life and the quality of that work probably skews my answer a bit.

Koooooj,"1 PM is one hour past noon.  Similarly, 1 AM is one hour past midnight.  This is a justification for why we don't call noon 1 o'clock (which would make it go 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm (noon)).  That would solve one problem but introduce a new one.

That sets us up with a system that should go 10 am, 11 am 12 ?m (noon), 1 pm, and so on.  11 am is clearly before noon and 1 pm is clearly after noon, so what do we do with noon itself?

If you just look at the even hour times then it would seem that noon ought to still be AM--12 is more similar to 10 and 11 than it is to 1 and 2, so it should get the same suffix, right?  However, ask yourself:  is 12:30 before or after noon (talking about the 12:30 that occurs near mid day)?  12:30 is clearly after noon and thus ought to be labeled as pm.  The same is true of 12:15 or 12:01.  Thus, if 12:00 is to be AM then we would have 12:00 AM, 12:01 PM, 12:02 PM, and so on.  Now that seems out of place.

In fact, if you continue that argument then we can look at seconds as well--12:00:00 AM, 12:00:01 PM, 12:00:02 PM, and so on.  Since noon is only a single instant in time we find that for essentially the whole 12th hour the time is already pm.  Therefore, making noon be 12 AM is inconsistent more so than making it be 12 PM is inconsistent.

Now, there is a completely consistent solution.  We can still make 1 hour past noon be 1 o'clock and we can make it so we don't have that weird discontinuity from 11 AM to 12 PM.  We simply call noon and midnight 0 o'clock pm and am, respectively.  This is actually the most consistent--0 is more like 1 and 2 than it is like 10 and 11, so labeling noon as 0 o'clock PM is consistent there, and 0:30 PM conveys the idea that it is 30 minutes past noon (while 12:30 PM would suggest that it's 12.5 hours after noon).  This is the most internally consistent 12 hour clock, but the existing 12 hour clock going from 1 to 12 instead of 0 to 11 already has too much hold for this idea to gain much traction--using the existing clock works just fine.

The other consistent solution is to do away with a 12 hour clock in the first place and just call midnight 0 o'clock and count up from there.  We have 10 am, 11 am, 12 pm, 13 pm, 14 pm, and so on--the break from am to pm happens at noon (if it's reported at all--we never have to specify which 18 o'clock we're talking about) but we don't reset the numbering an hour later so there's no problem!

backwheniwasfive,"Before the Marian reforms, the Roman military forces were exclusively made up of citizens-- people of property (3500 sesterces, say about 1750 loaves of bread) and capable of supplying their own arms.

Naturally this imposed a ceiling both on the number of potential soldiers, and their training-- units would be more reliable later with standardized equipment and training.

After Marius changed things, a legion was composed of:

* Roughly 6000 men: 4800 fighters, 1200 noncombatants

* 10 *cohorts* in a legion, so 480 fighting men in each, give or take and 120 noncombatants.

* * 6 *centuries* in each cohort, or around 80 fighters and 20 noncombatants, hence the term century.

* * According to Wiki the first cohort was overstrength, TIL.  Makes sense though-- HQ guards and extras for runners etc.
* * * Each century divided into 10 squads (*contubernium*, led by a *decanus* -- you can probably see ""decade"" in that), again 8 soldiers and 2 noncombatants, who ate together.

These soldiers would fight for 16 years initially, later 20.  TIL Augustus made these retired soldiers *evocati*, or reservists, to form an experienced officer corps at need.

That's about it for the legions.  However, the military also included wide ranges of Auxilia (Greek for slaves, but in this case just irregulars) -- engineers, spearman, horsemen, anyone who didn't fight in the legionary style.   

The *Equites* (social class) who had provided Roman cavalry up to this point were pretty much left to become leaders or stay home.

'This Item is going to be worth &lt;something&gt;' 

What its based on changes how the currency operates - if its based on a solid commodity, like gold or silver, its [representative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money) of the value of that underlying commodity.

When that &lt;something&gt; doesn't really exist, beyond the government saying 'this is what we will use for money,' its called [Fiat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money).

Bitcoin is a form of Fiat currency - it has no underlying commodity on which it has value. Its value is derived from limited supplies, high demand, and current market trends that put weight on the currencies focus on anonymous decentralized transactions. If the demand drops, or confidence in its ability to be anonymous or decentralized drops, the value will drop as well. Or, if it is a market in which there is limited to no volatility, e.g. not a lot of people buying and selling, or there is little post-transaction value. For instance, if BTC ends up being banned by several large countries, then its basically useless for transactions in those countries, and its value will drop - it doesn't matter if you have $1M USD in Bitcoins, if you have no where to spend them and no way to convert it to the currency you want, its basically useless.",null,1,cdodz3w,1rlcbk,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3
Koooooj,"Anyone can invent a currency, and in fact dozens of people have followed in Bitcoin's footsteps and created similar systems, most with a few cosmetic changes.  This may seem weird, but you've seen private currencies for a long time and probably never even noticed them.  For example, take ISK, the currency in EVE online.  It is entirely issued by the game's developers and only has value to buy things within the game, but there are also exchanges where you can trade USD to ISK just as you can trade USD for EUR.  In a very real sense the developers of that game invented a currency.

The real trick is to get a currency to become valuable, and to do that you have to get people to start using it.  Now, if you start printing up your own monopoly money then people aren't going to value it--there's no scarcity model (i.e. you could go and start printing 100 trillion dollar bills and crash the market), there's no legal backing (i.e. if you pay your bills in monopoly money then you will get sued for *not* paying your bills and you will lose the lawsuit), and there's no other property that makes your monopoly money superior to your national currency.

Bitcoin, however, addresses these points.  There's a very strong scarcity model--25 Bitcoins are released every 10 minutes or so and there's very little anyone can do to mess with that rate in any substantial way; there's a maximum of 21 million that will ever be produced.  Also there are lots of properties that people want--you can transact nearly instantly online with very low (or no) fees, largely anonymously, without asking a bank for permission.  These properties made the initial users want to use Bitcoin which sparked the initial value, which has grown as more people realize that cutting out banks feels pretty awesome (although we're far from that point).

As for who started it, he goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, which is roughly a Japanese equivalent of John Doe.  It is suspected that he may be British since he used British English spellings in some of the code he wrote.  It is believed that he is a single person, but he could very well be more than one person.  IIRC the leader of The Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Anderson, knows Satoshi's identity, or at least has spoken with him (he could *be* Satoshi for all we know).  Satoshi has not publicly revealed himself nor has he made any public statements in a very long time.

Patient is brought in by ambulance unconscious to an ER ward.

1. ABC: Is the airway compromised? Is the patient breathing? Establish circulation through IV lines.

2. Try to get history from family members/paramedics/whoever is there

3. Physical exam to determine whats wrong. Often involves shining a light into the eyes to see if the patient is neurological intact. Also involves checking the anal sphincter for similar reasons. Checking for response to pain, vocal commands, etc.

4. Imaging. Usually CT because it is fast and can determine if there are any bleeds in the brain or stroke. Also sometimes accompanied by lumbar puncture depending on the results of the CT. If, for example, you are suspecting a subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of brain bleed), a CT may not catch it and you will need to do a lumbar puncture to be definitive.

-Breathing
-Circulation

Then it's about gathering information such as blood pressure, breath rate, complexion, pupils for a report once the patient is transferred to a hospital. Anything out of the ordinary here could tell you what might be going on.
A patient might be respond to pain, which can let you know where injuries are in a head to toe examination
or they might not be responsive to pain which is just another piece of information to give to the professionals.

James becomes an astro scientist and builds spaceships with lasers, forcefields and warp drives on them before anyone else does. Also, he cures cancer. Go figure.

One day, some sleazy two bit journalist makes an amazing discovery; James was genetically modified at birth.  All undesirable traits and genetics were removed so he could become the perfect human being. 

Suddenly, James's achievements are meaningless to the general population. He still produces amazing works and breakthroughs, but he is no longer one of us. He's something else. 

Religious people will try to kill him. He is not a product of God. He is Satan incarnate brought forth by evil scientists to disrespect God. 

Athiests will be jealous. Why weren't they lucky enough to be genetically modified at birth? Why couldn't they be born for greatness? Just living and dying. It's bullshit! Why should he get to be so great?

Your average person won't entirely understand the issue, but get that genetically modifying anything is bad (Vegans), people aren't experiments (Right's activists), Male Privilege can now be sold in a test-tube (Feminism), We need more people like this to go fight our wars (Military).

However, scientists have surveyed 'near death experiences'. These are thought to be caused by the flood of hallucinegenic chemicals in our brains as it thinks it is dying.  These are thought to be the basis for many religious experiences in extremely sick patients.

For an example here (and ***don't fucking do this***) there is a way that you can pass yourself out.  When I was young and ***STUPID*** (again, don't look this up and do it retard, if you're dumb enough to you desperately need the brain cells you'd kill doing it) I did this a few times.  One of these times I swear I lived years of my life in those few seconds I was passed out.  Years.  As real as sitting here now.  To this day I'd be weirded out of someone shook my shoulder saying my name like my wife did to wake me up... it was that real.

But it didn't happen, I was sitting in the hallway twitching for five seconds... that's it.  So whatever you ""See"" is nonsense.  There's nothing to test there, your brain freaks out and spits out garbage which you interpret as something else.  It's largely 'blank' area that your brain [fills in later](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/How-Our-Brains-Make-Memories.html).

After living that and knowing enough about the brain to understand it, I can't even jokingly humor 'near death' stories.  Sorry if it's not a ""Well anything is possible"" acceptance which is so politically correct, reality is what reality is.  So the end result is that even if, EVEN IF, there is something on 'the other side', you won't find it like this.  Because the 'shut down' process is scrambled flailing and blank spots which you fill in with whatever magic you want to later.  

The only way you could make 'science' out of that is by doing it to hundreds of people and getting identical reports.  And we've had that... and they're not. Aside from the ""Bright Light"".  

So does this ""Bright Light"" tell us anything?

YES!

It tells us that lack of blood flow to the eyes is seen as light.

If you look at unemployment rates back in 2007, before the global economic meltdown, their unemployment rate was already around the 7-8% the US has today.  So, although they had been making steady progress towards lowering it for years, the result was that they had only managed to get to where the US is today.  The world banking collapse caused unemployment to spiral out of control.  It doesn't help that 11% of Spain's GDP comes from tourism, a particularly hard hit sector during any recession.

Greece (27%), with the help of Goldman Sachs &amp; JPMorgan Chase among others, lied to the rest of Europe about how much it was borrowing to fund its economy.

sir_sri,"&gt;We were told this in our high school Econ class, but it was never discussed or explained.

So a few things

1.  How countries count unemployment is different.

2.  Europe is actually fairing worse as a whole than it did during the great depression.  (It started out doing better than the US, but because the US is much more  centralized than europe federal spending the US has buffeted places like Florida and Nevada which would have been the greece and spain of a US union).

3.  Europe - even the countries in bad shape, have reasonably strong social safety nets, and particularly Spain, Italy and Greece have different cultures than the US where it's not unheard of to have people live with their parents until they're well into life.  This means the absolutely huge unemployed youth in europe (the age 20-30 crowd) are living off their parents and participating in underground (i.e. uncounted for cash) labour markets.  

4.  The problems europe faces are reasonably well understood, the problem is political paralysis and it's very very difficult to do much about it.  Either they need a much stronger central EU government responsible for much more spending, or the Euro needs to break up.  Absent those the EU needs to be willing to target more inflation (which given that inflation is 0.8% is not saying much).  None of those is particularly easy to accomplish politically, germany is against inflation, political integration failed and dismantling the euro would be admitting defeat on a project that need not fail.

forcefx,"This may not be 100% but this is my understanding of the unemployment rates across the countries/continents.
It depends on your definition of unemployment. Basically there is Frictional Unemployment, Cyclical Unemployment, and Structural Unemployment. At a very basic level unemployment can be broken down into voluntary and involuntary unemployment. The US rate of unemployment expressed to the Public is the involuntary unemployment rate, or those who do not wish to work/ try to work. /u/Zebo91 put it well when he said, 

&gt; ""The 8% is the workforce that does not have a job and is actively applying for work. That does not factor people who have given up looking or hasn't put any applications out in a while."" 

Involuntary unemployment is generally a larger problem. As of September 2013 the European Union Unemployment rate is 11%, not way too far off from the 7.3% in the United States.

 The 25% figure is most likely including all types of unemployment whereas the 11% is the voluntary unemployment rate. While Italy and France have the highest unemployment rates as of June 2013, Germany and the Netherlands are both below US rates.


TLDR; Voluntary vs. Involuntary unemployment. They show us the number that only includes those not looking for work, etc. The unemployment is EU: 11% vs. US: 7.3% as of September 2013

GryphonNumber7,"1. Countries define unemployment differently. Every country fudges the numbers in one way or another. In America, the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes 6 different measures of unemployment, each with an increasingly expansive definition of unemployment. U3 is the most often repeated measure, currently standing at 7.3%. U6, the most expansive definition, encompasses part time under-employed workers, those who've been discouraged from looking, and all other ""marginally attached"" persons. It's at about 13.8%. When talking about unemployment across different countries, you need to be sure you're looking at statistics that are actually measuring the same thing.
2. Many European countries, especially the ones that are having economic troubles today, have a recent history of bad government that exacerbated economic problems, leading to chronic high unemployment and socioeconomic dislocation. For example Spain had a fascist government until the 1970s, and around the same time Greece was ruled by a military junta. Italy has had like 40 different Prime Ministers since it adopted its modern constitution in 1946. By comparison, America has had only 12 presidents over that same time frame. Over time, the populations in these countries got used to having high unemployment, and started to consider that the norm.
3. America has grown accustomed to a certain level of affluence since World War II ended and we became the dominant military and economic power on Earth. So what might be acceptable levels of unemployment in other countries isn't good enough for us. And because we are used to almost total employment, we never developed the expansive welfare programs that Europeans did in their effort to rebuild after WW2, so when someone loses their job in America, it can hurt them more than in other rich countries.",null,0,cdoy07q,1rluaa,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5
Kropotsmoke,"Unemployment has deleterious effects on peoples' psychologies and their material conditions.  Entire families suffer.  People struggle with feelings of uselessness, anxiety, depression.

It's a catastrophe because it implies tons of people are suffering greatly, both materially and mentally.  Think about the effects unemployment cause to children -- to their nutrition, their education, and so on.  They can sense they're in an unstable home and can understand / read the mood of their parents.  This has terrible, debilitating effects on families.

In fact, the huge rate in Europe is a catastrophe as well (a ""larger catastrophe"" as someone else points out), but it probably symbolizes less total social damage than the rate in the U.S.  This is because at the very least there are public/social standards in Europe like a developed, well-functioning health care system that provides even for those priced out of an insanely expensive corporate system.

If we hit Eurozone level unemploymment rates in the US without their saftey net, we'd be in real serious trouble as businesses would start closing in a type of ""domino effect"" (unemployment leads to business closures which leads to more unemployment).

conomy is operating at maximum capacity, (everyone is working as hard as possible, all businesses are operating at maximum efficiency) there will still be some people unemployed due to various factors. Let's look at those factors.

1. 

Frictional Unemployment: 

Basically this is where people have just been layer off or quit and are unemployed but manage to get a new job fairly quickly. For instance if you work for Dole selling bananas for Reddit to use as a scale in photos, but suddenly a giant plantain comes along and destroys Reddit's ability to use bananas as a scale, thus reddit no longer uses bananas and you get layed off as a result. However luckily in a  month you get hired quickly to sell bananas to truck drivers in Africa who use it to temporarily fix truck Truck differentials (This is a real thing actually). Thus you were unemployed for a small amount of time thus it would temporarily cause an increase in unemployment

TL;DR Unemployment can vary based on how often people change jobs.

2. Structural Unemployment

People who can't a job, but want a job. They often lack the credentials to get a job or there is simply not enough jobs total for the population. This is where government policy tends to come into effect, a country with a very strong unemployment benefits program and other welfare might have higher rates of structural unemployment since they can rely on the programs more rather than taking a very low paying job. 


There is also another area doesn't really fit in to these categories at all, and that is people involved in illegal business or who have undeclared income. A hypothetical scenario is a crack dealer who claims unemployment benefits because he has no income to report other than his illegal money. Thus a country that has a large amount of people who falsely claim that they are unemployed when they are actually Meth dealing ex chemistry teachers.

So I wouldn't generalize too much about the whole continent of Europe, but generally European countries as a whole have stronger welfare programs and thus a higher structural unemployment, that is probably one of the biggest reasons, not sure about the other two. Also some countries in Europe have shittier economies. 

Though this really only makes sense if you're framing this in the context of unemployment that is most commonly used for government policy. The unemployment rate used is really only helpful from a monetary and perhaps fiscal macroeconomic policy viewpoint. It's not really a good measure of quality of life or an individualistic perspective of an economy.

Some of it has to do with the strength of families, particularly extended families. 

Most Americans think of their money as 'theirs'. It's not their brothers or their nephews or anyone else's. It's a very individualistic culture. 

In some southern European countries, the family is both bigger and more communal. There's a family 'pot'.

So 25% unemployment in USA means that many households will have no income, or at least a 50% drop in income, which is a disaster. 

But in parts of (Southern) Europe, a 25% unemployment rate might mean that out of four brothers, three still have jobs, and they cover for each other. The unemployed one might be in charge of looking after the grandmother.

Also, keeping things in the family means that credit is easier. If you are on hard times in America you will probably have to max out credit cards, and that puts you into serious debt quickly. In southern Europe you are more likely to be able to borrow cheaply from an uncle or a cousin - on the proviso that, when it comes to it, you then give their kid a leg up. What goes around comes around. 

Certain immigrant communities in the USA - Italians, Greeks, Jewish etc - understood this well, and were usually able to go from nothing to something in a generation or two. Then they bought cars, moved to the suburbs, plugged themselves into MTV, and wondered where it all went.

open_sketchbook,"ITT: A horde of libertarians and a very narrow view. Lemme balance that by giving a more leftist POV.

The small-scale examples given in the other examples, whereby rise in wages and rise in living expenses are directly correlated, is true inside of a small-scale closed system. However, it fails to account for changes that occur at larger scales.

First off, you are absolutely right. Just raising the minimum wage will do very little on it's own. However, it is an important part of creating a **demand side economy**. You'll also want to ensure business regulation will prevent monopolies from emerging in the new markets created by the new demand, and you want to make sure your tax scheme is progressive enough to prevent the rich from getting so rich they flip it around again, creating the situation you described. So, yes, preventing an executive from making too much more than the workers can help, but you have to be careful not to overdo it; you still need investment capital.

*So, why have a demand-side economy?*

Simply put, the health of an economy is tied to the flow of money. If money is changing hands, it generally means things are getting done, goods and services are trading hands and have good value associated with it, and you have an example of the old saying ""A rising tide lifts all boats."" While the actual value of individual units of currency might change, in an economy that is both growing and health, purchasing power increases. As growth is primarily fueled by technological innovation and doesn't really look to slow down, increasing the value of labour to match is healthy!

The next thing to understand is that poor people and rich people handle their money very differently. Poor people, they spend their money as soon as they get it, on things like rent, food, clothes, medical care, etc. They don't (and can't) hold on to very much. By contrast, rich people traditionally either save their money, or shunt their money off into the financial sector, where it is *invested*. Ideally, that money is invested in ways that enhance the economy by keeping the money flowing; into businesses, especially small businesses, on a competitive stock market, and into limited markets. That dynamic of investiture is what forms the basis of the financial sector of the market.

Now, something interesting happens when the system gets ""top heavy"", when the richer portion of society has a disproportionately large chunk of the money compared to the poorer half. (like, for example, in a society which believes in supply side ""trickle down"" economics) Essentially, this causes the financial sector, especially small portions of it, to become bloated with capital. Money is invested at a faster rate than growth can keep up with, because money is not the only limiting factor on growth.

Investment is rarely straightforward. Oftentimes, an investment is actually an investment into an investment ad nausium which is finally being invested in the actual market. What happens is that large portions of the economy are segregated off, circulating only in an incestuous subset of the financial industry chasing real value to be invested in for growth. Other people, usually middle class people who want to be rich, take out loans in order to invest in these seemingly-valuable markets. Pretty soon, there is more money being invested than the things are actually worth. When people realize this has happened and they won't see a return on their investments, the bubble ""pop"".

This is known as a ""Bust"", and it involves the sudden loss of value in a market as everyone tries to get out as once. This not only releases a bunch of money back ""into the wild"", leading to inflation, but saddles a bunch of people with worthless investments they can't get rid of. Booms and busts are commonplace in an economy; without regulation, they are extremely vicious, creating periods of extreme growth followed by even worse depressions.

So why does this matter for minimum wage?

Because the people making minimum wage don't invest in the financial market. Money comes to them through their jobs and is immediately spent on *stuff*, which pays other people their salaries so they can spend it on *stuff*, and so on and so forth. When you pay minimum wage workers, more, they still do that, but they have more options. They might be able to afford to eat out and eat better, so new markets open up for restaurants and quality food. They can buy electronics and entertainment, so those markets expand. Competition in these markets is no longer strictly a race to the bottom in terms of prices, which creates a more diversified economy as luxury options move in. You still have people who own those companies and make lots of money and are rich, but they are not making quite as much as they were, their profit margins are narrower (further encouraging competition and reducing monopolization) and less money is shunted off into the financial sector, so booms are not so frantic and busts are not so drastic.

A ""demand-side"" economy sees more regular, stable growth in markets that are more in line with the long-term value of a market, because most of the money is coming from consistent spenders (the poor) instead of investment chasers (the rich). The growth of the economy is seen directly by everyone, instead of just to investors. Rich people still exist and still invest, providing the raw capital needed to break new ground into fresh markets and reaping the benefits, but because the system is more bottom-heavy, investments are more metered and safer. Less runaway booms and busts.

Either way, you get growth, usually fairly comparable numbers, when you look at it over long periods of time. But in a supply side economy where minimum wage is low, thus devaluing labour and massively increasing profits for the rich, the economy spikes and drops harshly, wasting capital and hurting the people at the bottom who can't afford to have their labour devalued any further. In a demand-side economy, the growth is a steady line, with little dips and rises. Less money is squandered and prices are more stable, so your money goes further!

So, everyone else here is absolutely right; in a closed system, raising the minimum wage would be meaningless. But it's not a closed system; the economy of labour exists alongside things like financial sector, like government and public spending, and like the global market.

****TL;DR****
Higher minimum wage and redistribution of the economy so poor people have a higher proportion of the money leads to steadier, more stable economic growth with better competition by growing new markets in proportion to the consumer rather than the investor. However, this sort of economy also requires greater regulation and progressive taxation.

**Why? Because economies are driven by middle class consumers. We need to keep the cash flowing back to business so they can invest in new services, goods and labor/people.** During the recession one of the major problems was that everyone froze their spending. Supermarkets and Car Dealerships were not seeing people purchase cars or TV's so the big businesses suffered. As a result, businesses layed off middle class employees and spending froze over night. Both Bush and Obama used a ""stimulus"" (cutting checks for 600 - 1200+ dollars to middle class families) in order combat the recession. Why did they do this? Because economists overwhelmingly agreed that this was the right thing to do and that it had an overall positive effect.

McDoogleSnatch,"First, [consider looking at this graph.](http://www.heritage.org/~/media/Images/Reports/2013/06/SherkChart1.ashx?h=405&amp;w=600)  Purged from the US Department of labor, this chart illustrates that the minimum wage we currently have is $1 *above* the historical average going back to 1947.  Taking into consideration how [tax relief effects those on minimum wage further skews the truth](http://cdn.epionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/minimum-wage-historical-chart.png).  The current notion that minimum wage workers are making so much less, relatively to people in the past making minimum wage, is preposterous.  Especially if you factor in all how technology has made one's standard of living increase for the equivalent cost of living.

This notion that we should have a $15/hour minimum wage, seems to have [originated by a *banned* TED talk given by Nick Hanauer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBx2Y5HhplI)  Refutations of his opinion can be found [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/22/a-15-minimum-wage-is-a-terrible-idea/), [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/09/01/the-absurdity-of-a-15-minimum-wage/) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jk3fRC8kqs)(this one is an interview with the guy).  He gets his number by looking not a historical averages in wages, but *increases in productivity rates*.  The problem with his rationalization is simple.  Suppose you own a Wal-Mart and you pay to install 12 self-checkout counters.  Four of them can be run by one person, reducing your labor force from 12 to 3.  Because productivity in this case quadrupled, Nick would reason that the remaining employees should have their wages quadrupled to compensate, since they are four times more productive.  If you can't understand why that is absurd at first glance, then I can't help you.

Consider for a moment what a $15/hour wage would mean.  A couple, working at McDonalds full time, would be making $60,000/year.  That's [$10,000 more a year than the median income](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Distribution_of_Annual_Household_Income_in_the_United_States.png) of all Americans for a job that requires the absolute bare minimum in skills and experience.  Can you imagine the consequences to our country's productivity and job growth should this be an option?

That begs the question, if $15/hour is unreasonable, what is a lower amount that would have less detrimental effects on the economy and still foster a ""living wage?""  Of course, that necessitates defining what a ""living wage"" is.  It requires calculating the cost of rent, food, transportation, child care and medical costs.  These all vary from city to city, and state to state.  As I live in Austin, [here is a breakdown of the living wage estimates courtesy of some dude at MIT](http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/48015).  For the sake of argument, lets assume all of these numbers are accurate.  Do you notice that in all of the cases in which someone is without a child, the minimum wage *exceeds* the living wage requirements?  You may then ask, how many workers are on minimum wage have children?  There's no one study that illustrates this, but looking at [data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011tbls.htm#2) and the [Census](http://www.census.gov/hhes/families/files/cps2012/Figure10.pdf), a reasonably high estimate would be 20% of minimum wage workers.  That breaks down to just 1% of all employees.  Is it so catastrophic that 1% of the workforce isn't making a ""living wage?""  What other country in the world can make such a claim?  This minimum wage/living wage argument is blown *way* out of proportion.  It's done primarily by union leaders, community organizers, and members of the political left who exacerbate the problem for their own personal ambitions.

And should you say that we should still do *something* for that 1% of the workforce, then why not look to encourage community outreach programs to help.  Local charities are looking for reasons to give their money away and a single mother working a minimum wage job is someone they wouldn't turn down.  What about encouraging people *not* to have out-of-wedlock children? This is more than sufficient, especially because the turnover rate in minimum wage jobs are so high.  Meaning, once a person is there, getting skills and improving their resume, they leave the job to find one with a better wage.",null,4,cdoqmf3,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8
t_hab,"In most cases, it can't. 

If under a free market, your job is worth $12, then placing a minimum wage at $15 eliminates your job. **You don't get a pay raise, it has become illegal for you to work at the wage that somebody is wiling to pay you and that you want to work at.**

Not only that, but the person down the hall making $20 who depended on your work also gets fired. The person making $22 who can do his job without you, but less efficiently, gets a pay cut.

Of course, now the company can't produce as much as it used to or at the same quality, so it has to charge its customers a lot more and give them a lot less. Basically, you end up with a lot of slack in the economy (it shows up on the supply and demand curves as two triangles that are wasted, otherwise known as deadweight loss). If the company has to raise its price and lower its quality beyond a certain point, then no customer will buy its products and either it will close down (firing everybody in town) or move (firing/relocating everybody in town). 

**Basically minimum wage is an almost entirely useless tool to improve standards of living and equality. That's important to note, since improving standards of living and equality are extremely important things to do.**

**So when can a minimum wage be useful? Well, in the case of a labour monopsony (single employer) a regulated wage can help prevent employee abuse.** Setting it too high will cause the problems described above, but not setting it at all can cause the opposite problem, so setting it as close to the right wage as possible helps to reduce the inefficiency. 

**Minimum wage also serves as a signal.** While perfectly efficient economies wouldn't need a signal for the ideal wage, imperfect markets (the kinds we have) use all kinds of signals. If I am a small entrepreneur and I want to know how much to pay an inexperienced, part-time, unskilled labourer in a non-dangerous job, I might not know how to look up industry statistics. Instead, I take the minimum wage as the indication as to what that person is worth. If they have some skills, I might take minimum wage as the signal and adjust upwards by a certain percentage. While any level of minimum wage will prevent some people from working, low enough minimum wages will cause almost no negative impact on the economy but also serve as a signal that avoids low-skilled workers getting abused out of ignorance. 

In the information age we are finding better signals, but the minimum wage is still a useful one. Hopefully we will be able to completely do away with it in the near future, but today, it still serves a useful purpose. **The problem is that some people think its purpose is to raise general wages, but in reality it can only serve to help prevent extreme cases of abuse.** There are other tools that must be used in order to bridge the income gap and help raise the standard of living for the most poor.",null,4,cdorxzg,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8

That way workers' purchasing power doesn't drop from already pathetic levels into total povery levels (as it did over the last 30 years).To remedy that problem we need an initial increase in the minimum wage (to restore its purchasing power) and then to link it to the CPI. 

The inflation would effect everyone equally but the worst off would no longer feel it the most harshly as it is today. A more evenly distributed economy is actually a recipe for economic success since it means more aggregate demand. It's all about the marginal propensity to consume. That's the probability that an increase in income of $1 will be spent rather than saved. Rich people generally consume less as a % of their income than poor. The more money being spent in general the better the economy functions.

The point of minimum wage is to ensure that companies can't translate low wages into increased profits for the CEO, shareholders etc. In a perfect capitalist economy where everyone knows exactly how much their labor is worth and there is absolutely no question about how much you should get paid minimum wage is unecissary. You would make whatever is fair and would allow you to provide for yourself as that wage would be tied to the price of goods given the fact that firms would pay their workers based on what they would make based on how much they sell. Unfortunately, in real life I have no idea how much people accross the country with the same job as myself make so I can't tell my employer exactly how much I am worth. A minimum wage allows the goverment to help determine how much a person's labor can be worth at the bare minimum preventing exploitation of workers and ensuring that at the minimum people can survive when they have a job.

The current minimum wage is no longer sufficient to provide enough for basic survival needs. I and many others believe it must be raised to ensure that workers are payed at very least enough to survive given the current CPI (Living Wage).

tl;dr: Minimum wage ensures workers aren't exploited and no longer is high enough to allow people to maintain a reasonable standard of living.

One issue is that the government is subsidizing private companies it far too many ways.  We all pay taxes that go to support services for these workers (food stamps, etc).  Do you think its fair that people fund these services through taxes, so that companies can make bigger profits?  Pay their execs bigger pensions? If a company survives off of paying people less than they need to survive because of a system set in place by their own lobbyists and tax breaks then I don't feel bad for them if they choose to close shop rather than run a slightly less profitable business.

I have worked for many small companies over the years and I have seen it first hand.  People are not hiring workers because of profit or how much they are making selling xyz.

bjornartl,"Minimum wage is a little bit like game theory. Look at the climate debate. The cold war. This is why we have treaties. Everyone wants to be the one that has cheaper production. Or has more military force. More whatever the conflict is about. The solution to such conflicts are treaties where all parties decide they are better off if ALL parties involved reduce equally. The reason why this is not always possible is because they cant always decide what is equal, or who should be more equal than the others. 

When it comes to minimum wage it's a little easier. There's a higher power, a government who can decide who, what and when these ""treaties"" should count for. 

A government could for instance enforce a minimum wage for the food industry only. This would help avoid the outsourcing a lot of labor, but it's not like the fast food industry would stop selling food in the US. Unlike a phone-tech assistant these jobs require working hands on US soil. 

Thing is that probably most work that can be done without being located in the US for less than 15$ probably already is outsourced, so you might as well not make it limited to say the food industry. 

So wouldn't the prices go up on their products? Not necessarily. They don't pay people more if they make more revenue. The price of labor is mostly decided by supply and demand. This means that every time a nation is losing jobs and markets, then there is a high demand for jobs that they can take advantage of. These swings will always happen. Nations change, and then it takes time to adapt to new markets more suitable for their nation. In the US, this would probably mean a higher focus on better education towards tech and greater investment in tech development along with other particularly and less about manual labor but that's a way different discussion. Point is that swings will happen and they always take time to adjust. 

So basically it does two things: 1) it helps reduces between classes in the US. These classes are more or less made up by 3 stands of sociaty: a) people who have ownership in US companies who either succeeds in markets suitable for the US nation, and/or outsources. b) The people who work for these companies in the US because they make up a profession that is desirable to said companies/markets and c) which is the last and lowest stand which are the people who are not desired by any of these markets/companies but does jobs they cannot outsource. 
Minimum wage helps the second class(b) but more importantly it prevents massive abuse against the third stand of society. 

2) It helps spread(read; keep) more money within the US. Money spent towards third(c) class professions are money spent on services they more or less must've spent money on anyways. This again leads to less buyer force directed towards imported goods and pleasures. 

Both these points are economically profitable for the US. Being a first world country they are expected to have a certain amount of welfare, although it is shit compared to the rest of the first world/western world. Having more people be able to afford their daily lives through their own work is good. And who pays for this? The middle and upper class, through the services they purchase. 
Then less money goes overseas. 

Now who want you to think this is a waste of money? Well, the upper class(a) first and foremost, but also to a great extent class b. Togather they make up a big enough voters pool so that they have a great chance, and I'd argue they have already to a great deal too, steer politics in their own advantage through (political) campaigns and advertisement.

People like to assign blame, so let's play the blame game.  Whose fault is it?

Well... if you want a contractor to remodel your kitchen, what do you do?

Maybe you go on-line and just google 'kitchen remodel contractors'.  They will get you a list.  You ask for a quote.  Maybe you ask for references.  Maybe you even follow-up on the references.  Finally you pick one and the contractor does a terrible job.  Is that your fault?  What could you have done to anticipate what a shit job the contractor did?

Maybe you ask friends for recommendations and you pick from there.  Then the contractor does a shit job.  Is it your friend's fault?  They contractor did a fine job for them.  Is it your fault?  How could you have known?

Maybe you use the same contractor who did your bathroom.  They did a fine job that time.  Then it all goes wrong.  Is it still your fault?

Perhaps the answer is you should have been constantly checking up on their work - making sure that if things did go wrong, you found out as early as possible then you could take steps...?  But you're not a fitter, or a plumber.  You don't know about tiling.  How you possible even tell if things were going well?  Well... you could hire someone to supervise, but that costs money.

japko,"There is an interesting theory about that, actually. Do you know the [Jesus illusion](http://files.myopera.com/Dava/albums/170157/Jesus%20Illusion.png)?

Our mind usually tries to adapt to things. In the said illusion, our mind notices that there is a big black blob in our sight, that carries no information with it. It makes no sense. So it's best to ignore it. Our perception mechanisms start to create a ""counter-reaction"" - something that would even out the nonsensical blob, and make it one with the background. The longer the blob is there, not moving, the stronger this counter reaction be. After a couple of minutes, when you stop looking on the blob, and look on, say, a wall, you will see the counterreaction of your brain - an image that happens to look like the face of Jesus. It could be anything though. Your nose, for example, is removed from your sight in a similar way, only you never get to see the counter-reaction, because you always have a nose in its place, hopefully.

Now, the same applies for all stimuli, but there is an interesting glitch in some of them. There was an interesting study about people who give blood. When you do it for the first time, it's scary, painful, and takes some time to get back to feeling 100% good after the deed, but your organism creates an anti-reaction - and when the pain wears off, you actually feel pretty good physically. The more you give blood, the less scared you are, the more used to the procedure you are, and in effect, the less pain you feel (also thanks to the feel-good counter-reaction).BUT! The major finding in this study is, that with time the counter-reaction does NOT fade, like the initial painful stimulus does. It stays on the same level, making giving blood pleasant, some even described is as addictive.

It is hypothesised that the same mechanism happens with other things, like cold showers, blue cheese, wine, and (finally to the point), beer. It's not tasty at first, but your brain creates a countermeasure to relieve you in your beer-drinking pain, an anti-taste, if you will. With time, you get used to the taste, but the magnitude of the positive antitaste stays the same, so you end up enjoying the whole thing.


**tl;dr: it's thanks to a counter-reaction to negative stimuli that your brain creates.**

I know this from a lecture on positive psychology, but I managed to find some online sources: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609018 .

Alcohol is a poison and you are not supposed to like it. When people tell me they like alcohol I like to joke that they are ""affected"". Basically they like getting drunk and the sensations are tied together.  I wish I had a better understanding but all I know on the subject is that we are creatures of habit.

And overtime, the burn of the acid probably doesn't even register unless you have a cold or have just consumed spicy food.  But to someone in a third world country who has never had Coke, soda is hard to choke down the first time because of the acid and the cloyingly sweet level of sugar.

Like so, there are pleasant qualities associated with wine, beer, and coffee. And there are unpleasant qualities associated with wine, beer, and coffee.

When you ""acquire a taste"" you are **not** learning to love an unpleasant flavor…that would be nonsensical. The truth is that the unpleasant flavors fade away over time, leaving you free to discover and enjoy the pleasant qualities unfettered.

It's a lot like that for Wine/Whisky/Beer/Coffee.

First few drinks, all you notice is the main taste - which is bitter. Then you start noticing the additional tastes. Essentially, your baseline has shifted. The bitter is still there but you notice it less. Now you notice the differences between different types of wines or different types of beer and you start realizing you prefer one or the other. This relative preference starts getting coded into your mind and you start treating the liking as absolute. This is the stage at which people start saying, ""Oh, I love the Zinfandel. Not so much the Cabernet Sauvignon.""

Also, the brain rewards us for persistence. If you keep trying wine/beer/coffee/whisky the brain starts hiding the unpleasant sensory information as it seeks out the subtleties. As a bonus, you start thinking of yourself as a connoisseur and you get hooked.

Also, I see a lot of people saying how they hate coffee and that it's bitter. To them I'd say that good coffee is barely bitter and that behind what little bitterness there may be there is a wealth of nuance and flavour waiting to be discovered.

restricteddata,"Every so often the US military creates a document called the Nuclear Posture Review, which outlines the current US nuclear weapons policy and sets the policy for the next five years. The most recent one was [completed in 2010](http://www.defense.gov/npr/docs/2010%20Nuclear%20Posture%20Review%20Report.pdf). It says a lot about preventing nuclear terrorism, modernizing the stockpile (without making new warheads), providing assurance to NATO allies, reducing stockpile sizes, and so on.

It says very little, however, about when the US would use nuclear weapons. This is a deliberate ambiguity. The US does not want to say, ""we will never use them except in reply to nuclear attacks,"" because it fears that might invite an adversary to think that even terrible non-nuclear attacks might be ""safe."" It also does not want to say, ""we will definitely use nuclear weapons in response to an WMD attack"" because the President always wants to keep his options open. US nuclear policy is extremely vague as a result. It is basically ""we won't use them, unless we really think we have to."" It does not rule out, for example, using nuclear ""bunker busters"" to destroy fortified targets. It does not rule out using nukes in reply to chemical or biological attacks. It also does not guarantee they would be used in those instances, either.

QuickSpore,"Needless to say the facts in the matter are disputed. Prior to WWI the area known as Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Around this time there was a group of Jews living in Palestine, all across the Middle East really. And the European Jews were tired of being treated like second class citizens. Hitler was far from the first European leader to put blame on the Jews, or to round them up and kill them. He was pretty much the best at it though. So these European Jews chose their old ancestral land as the one which would become a Jewish homeland. 

Bit by bit Jews moved to Palestine, buying land and setting up communities. The Turks weren't too happy about that. The last thing they wanted was another strong ethnicity in the empire. But they never cut off immigration completely. And small numbers of Jews continued to move into the area.

When WWI broke out, the British made a lot of promises. They promised the area to the Arabs. They promised the area to the Jews. And they promised to split it up and rule it with the French. Of course the promise they kept was to rule it themselves as a ""protectorate."" Both the Jews and the Arabs (there were no ""Palestinians"" yet) took offense at this. And both Jewish and Arab terrorist coups formed. And a three way low level micro-war broke out. The British clamped down on Jewish migration, incidentally dooming a lot of Jews, but a small amount of illegal immigration continued to take place.

By the end of WWIi it was clear the British weren't going to hold on to the area. And frankly they didn't want it anymore, more trouble than it was worth. Step one was the area east of the Jordan river was spun off as Trans-Jordan. There were very few Jews and so it was clear that would be Arab regardless. But dividing the area west of the Jordan was a mess. And there was even a question of whether it should even be divided at all. After a few years the British tossed the problem to the UN. And in 1948 the UN came up with a plan, the area would be split. About 60% would go to the Arabs in Palestine, 40% would go to the Jews, and Jerusalem would become an ""international"" city. It wasn't clear exactly how that last part would work out. Largely the Jews said absolutely, we accept. And largely the Arabs said, we don't accept. And the British said, screw it we're leaving.

The day the British left, the Jews declared the formation of the state of Israel. And the Arab nations all declared war on Israel. I the end when the fighting was over, Israel had most of Palestine. Egypt had Gaza. And Jordan had the West Bank. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were forced from their homes all across the Middle East. And a lot of Palestinians fled from their homes in what became Israel.

Israel was established as a Jewish democratic nation. But it should be mentioned at this time that there were a lot of Arabs living in the new Israeli state. And they are citizens to this day, with voting rights and everything. It should also be mentioned that Jews and Arabs are not treated exactly the same.

After this Israel and the Arab states fought other additional wars. And Israel conquered Gaza, the West Bank, Sinai, and the Golan Heights. Originally Israel held these territories with a promise of ""land for peace."" They gave the Sinai back to Egypt for a peace treaty. But neither Egypt or Jordan wanted Palestine back. And the Palestinians didn't have anyone willing and capable of negotiating with Israel.

Somewhere about this time the Israelis got the bright idea that settling Israelis in the occupied territories would both make them more secure and induce the Palestinians to the table. That didn't exactly work. And some Israeli extremists view them as a chance to grab more or even all of Palestine and create a Greater Israel.

So right now the two parties are disagreeing on most everything. The extremists on both sides would love to see the others driven ""into the sea."" And even the moderates can't agree on where borders should be, if Arabs should be allowed to return to their old lands in Israel, who gets Jerusalem... and which parts. And both sides regularly kill innocents on the other side, making it harder to compromise. ",null,0,cdopvj3,1rm94a,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6

AyCarrumba,"Two reasons:

* The earth has an inclined axis of rotation - the pole around which it spins is leaning over slightly. This means that as the earth orbits around the sun, the north pole leans ""towards"" the sun for 6 months, then ""away for 6 months, and vice versa. This gives rise to the Arctic circle, North of which the sun does not set for 6 months.

* The suns rays can be regarded as being ""parallel"" when they hit earth. What this means is that at the equator, a certain amount of solar energy is concentrated on a small patch of the earth because it hits it at 90 degrees. As you near the poles, the same amount of energy hits the earth at a very shallow angle, meaning that it is spread over a much larger area of earth. Lower energy input = cooler.

The combination of these effects is that each pole beyond the Arctic or Antarctic circle experiences 6 months of very shallow angle daylight, and then 6 months of darkness. They are cooler because they receive much less solar energy. Incidentally, because they are icy and bright white, they actually reflect more of that sunlight back as well - darker ground would absorb more heat.

So, they get much less sunlight, they are dark 6 months out of the year, and they absorb less of that small amount of heat as well. ",null,0,cdoq7we,1rmffr,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

There are overclocking competitions where people can get computers up to double or triple their natural speeds, but it pretty much always involves cooling with something like liquid nitrogen.

Also, there would not be as much benefit as you would think from having a processor so fast.  A 10ghz processor is not 10x as fast as a 1ghz processor with an equivalent architecture.  The reason is that while the faster processor may be capable of performing 10x as many actions per second, the processor has to spend a much larger portion of its time waiting for the rest of the computer.  It takes time for data to travel between a computer's memory or hard drive or network connection and the processor, and the processor might have to sit there for anywhere from nanoseconds to milliseconds waiting for information to get to it.

Most modern advances in processor design (at least since ghz stopped increasing after the Pentium 4 era) have to do with the processor being able to handle more tasks simultaneously (more cores, hyperthreading), being smarter about reordering the things it is being asked to do so it can still work while waiting for information to come in, storing more information close to the processor (bigger caches), and things like that.",null,0,cdopqoc,1rmg62,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3

But you can make something faster without increasing the clockspeed. 

In the simplest way of thinking about it, if I have 1 unit operating at 3GHz or 4 units identical to the first operating at 3GHz, well the 4 units is then 4x as fast as the 1, roughly.  CPU's are a great deal more complex than that, and it's not trivial to get perfect utilization out of multiple CPU's but adding repeated units can produce a lot of speedup without increasing clock speeds.

There are specialized processor types (or parts) that can get into the 10GHz range (notably some math stuff), but if you want a 20GHz processor you need a 20GHz clock, you need to be able to read a long string of 1's or 0's extremely precisely or you can get all messed up data etc.

Snafu_Coaxer_2013,"There's a huge number of reasons for this, and I'll try touch on a few, but it's very important to first recognize a few assumptions. Firstly, you're coming at this from the perspective of someone who exists post-rise of the West so you're going to look at the world as being on a sort of linear progression of technology. That isn't how anyone viewed technology prior to the point that it changed radically in the span of a single lifetime, so around the late 18th/early 19th century. 

Also, note that to someone in the periods we're talking about, these sort of differences in technology might not appear to exist and ""technology"" the concept only really 'exists' in the popular mind by the early modern age.

Anyway, the main reasons I can think of that Europe ended up with superior technology to much of the rest of the world:

- Geographically, Europe isn't particularly well suited to farming (especially Northern Europe). While there are some very productive regions, there's nothing like the Mekong Delta and the continent is often too cold or the terrain too undulating to grow large quantities of crop. This means that agriculture is often very difficult. This has three effects: firstly, it means that the population is less content with an agrarian-based society, secondly, it facilitates trade within the region. Lastly, it's a huge limit on the growth of urban areas. So Europe is typified by very dense, very small urban settlements.

- Those geographical factors set up the perfect environment for huge economic growth. If I need to buy Egyptian grain, I need something Egyptians cant produce themselves, like wine. Using far more modern economic theory, we know that the most productive trade is done between highly specialized economies with very different advantages, and this leads to increased wealth for all economies involved. This develops rapidly in Europe, however it's not going to develop as well in South East Asia or North America, where food is abundant (and so trade in these places becomes a largely diplomatic exercise, rather than a vital force. Trade is a source of imported luxury goods, not a vital lifeline for the majority of the population). So we know that Europe is going to be more interconnected and wealthier in the long run than many other places with abundant food and smaller trade flows. 

- Greater trade flows means that ideas travel faster through Europe than through other locations. For example, if i'm in Peru and everything I consume is locally produced, there is little need for new ideas, and, more importantly, if i did have an innovative idea, it would likely never reach say, Mexico without generations of people physically migrating. However, an innovative farming idea in Baghdad is likely going to reach Vienna in less than a year. So the ""research base"", the knowledge that you've building off, is much greater in Europe (especially if you view Europe as a monolithic entity).

- Socially, the Black Death creates a need to radically restructure society. This leads to the Renaissance period, which triggers renewed interest in the Classical world and things like philosophy. This causes the Reformation, which, for a bunch of highly contentious reasons, leads to Northern Europe developing at a very fast pace (this is in a large part due to Protestantism removing much of the outer-worldliness of Catholicism, and much of the comfort it provided it's practitioners in terms of the promise of heaven). Coupled with a lack of agricultural land and an abundance of fuel sources, the Industrial Revolution occurs first in the region.",null,0,cdosar9,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4
whatIsThisBullCrap,"This is my own theory, and as far as I know not commonly supported. But I'll share it anyways, because I think it's at least a contributing factor. 

Basically, trade. Specifically, information trade. Europe was very connected to much of the world, and they were in constant contact with Arabia, India, China, North Africa, etc. This meant that information, most importantly technology could be shared. The result of this is that technology advances faster. 

Consider this basic example: ammunition, arches, and plows (just three random things that popped into my head) are complicated technology. They might each take 100 years to invent and perfect. For a single culture to invent all three would take 300 years. Or, three different cultures could invent one each. That way, the whole old world has them in 100 years, plus a couple for the information to spread. Obviously, technology doesn't work like this. First of all, it can take 1000s of years before someone realizes the need or potential for something, and then in a year it could be complete. There's also no reason you can't work on more than one piece of technology at the same time. However, this does demonstrate that having more peoples to invent technology that can be shared does speed of up the process. 

On the other hand, the Americans and southern Africans were more isolated. In America, the natives had ni contact with other peoples, and even amongst themselves wasn't that common except for with a few select tribes. In southern Africa, it was a similar story. Isolated tribes, and even when Europeans began exploring the rest of the continent, there was little trade, as it was mostly colonozation and resource-hunting. This means Americans and southern Africans didn't get the benefit of other societies' inventions ",null,0,cdos9ks,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

When British people say the word, ""power"", the it ends with a sound more closely related to and e or an a sound. On the other hand when an American says power, they put more emphasis on the r sound.

When we put this into singing, a lot of the time most popular artists use the shorter sounds than the longer sounds, though you'll find with most country western singers, they have the more longer, emphasised sounds when singing.

The European cycle, though, is rather easily gamed and is pretty lenient to begin with, resulting in further inflated fuel efficiency figures.

This is easily illustrated by comparing the Prius' fuel efficiency in North America and Europe.  In the US, the EPA rates it at 50 MP(US)G.  In Europe, though, it's 72.4 MP(I)G.  Keep in mind that this is the exact same car with the exact same engine using the exact same fuel.

It is also common that if someone for some reason absolutely cannot travel to eat with their family on thanksgiving a friend invites them to join his or her family.

(For example, I saw someone offering a ride from and to Pittsburgh to as far as Connecticut, their destination.) Thanksgiving is something that many people celebrate, but it's not exactly like you see in the movies. (Few things ever are...)

It's part of the American creation myth. The Pilgrims, struggling with the unexpected harshness of American winters, find unexpected friends among the Indians, who share their plentiful abundance with them. (Of course, the Native Americans celebrate a National Day of Mourning today, so like most history, perspective is important.) But this story is taught in elementary schools, and then kids are given the day off. The idea continues through college, when a lot of kids are going home for the first time of the year.

Most people are given the day off work. Some stores are open, so this is a shitty time of year to work retail. (Especially with 'Black Friday' coming up tomorrow.) It's a time for sometimes distant family members to come together, share a hearty meal, and spend a day thinking about how awesome things are, all things considered.

But it's also not terrible to miss out on a meal. Don't get me wrong, if you're not cooking (or not able to cook) it's very, very common for neighbors to see if you want a plate. ""What are you doing for Thanksgiving?"" is one of the most common questions Americans hear this week.

Iamtheonewhobawks,"Until the recent advent of Black Friday and its subsequent bleed-over into this thanksgiving's Black Thursday, Thanksgiving was uniquely difficult to commercialize. Its not a gift-giving holiday, there are no costumes, there is no emphasis on any one specific subculture.

There are no specific religious connotations, there is no epic origin story. That means that thanksgiving movies and songs and so on are relatively rare. You can only make so many about eating a large bird.

Thanksgiving is traditionally a holiday from the usual U.S. holiday experience. Every other one is surrounded by massive commercialization. Christmas decorations show up in stores in October, right alongside miles of cheap Halloween candy and disposable costumes. Easter is all about pastel colored everything, and since it is specifically christian anything Easter-themed will sell. Valentines day, a ""lets eat chocolate and fuck"" pseudo-holiday, is filled with obligatory purchases. Buy your SO some valentine's day themed food/clothes/jewelry/trip or its considered deeply insensitive.

New Years is an inescapable media storm. Fewer products to buy directly, a million special things on TV.

But Thanksgiving is just so hard to capitalize on. Its not a party holiday like St. Patrick's day or Cinco De Mayo, no presents are given, no trips are scheduled. The best anyone could think of was some cheap turkey-and-native-american decorations.


Of course, now we have Black Friday, which started being a thing sometime around the new millennium and seems to be attempting to change Thanksgiving into a new President's Day or MLK Day. A holiday where you celebrate specifically by going shopping. I guess we'll see how that goes.

Our economy is competitively based, our civil liberties heavily concerned with the rights of the individual. Success is defined by wealth, celebrity, sex-appeal, etc.

InfamousBrad,"Odd that nobody is bringing up the fact that while having ""festivals of thanksgiving"" was a Puritan custom, they weren't held on a regular schedule, or even every year, until 1863: the year that President Lincoln declared that the last Thursday of November would, forever, be a day of thanksgiving for the fact that the war was turning around, that it was beginning to look like America would survive its war with the rebels.

But it was also a good time to make an annual festival a month out from Christmas, because the 1860s overlap the time that Christmas presents (like everything else in the home) were turning into something you bought, that came from factories, instead of being things that you made at home, or that your servants made for you.

So American Thanksgiving became as big, and important, as it is because it overlaps four themes, meets four strong needs that are very, very American:

* It's a foundational religious holiday among people who are still pushing the myth that America was founded as a Christian nation, ...

* It's a celebration of what was, until fairly recently, America's most important and profitable export industry, agriculture, and ...

* It's a celebration of military victory (most often, in modern times, taking the form or reminding people to pray for our troops abroad in foreign wars), ...

* It's a ceremony marking the official beginning of the Christmas season; with the rise of Thanksgiving, America switched its Christmas season calendar from the traditional December 24th through January 6th to our current fourth Thursday of November through December 25th.

It is also a time to reflect on the story of the Native Americans, both how they helped the pilgrims initially and how they treated each other later.

Mephysteaux,"Gifts are not typically exchanged on Thanksgiving. Strangers do typically wish each other a happy Thanksgiving/holiday. While Thanksgiving is traditionally a family holiday, some people do see/call friends. In particular, if a friend isn't spending Thanksgiving with someone (often due to being separated from their family), it's fairly customary to invite them to spend Thanksgiving with your family. Native Americans rarely get thanked. Religious people often thank God, but the feeling of gratitude generally isn't directed at anything or anyone in particular, unless they're directly involved. It's considered a generally American holiday, so it's celebrated by people regardless of their race, religion, or political affiliations. I wouldn't say there are people who express 'Anti-Thanksgiving' views, but there are some who say the story is watered down, and that the Thanksgiving story everyone knows takes away from the fact that Native Americans were abused by white settlers. Also, the big controversy recently is that a lot of employers, especially in retail, make their employees work on Thanksgiving. This is partly because Black Friday, which is considered one of the busiest shopping days of the year, is tomorrow.

GreenTea-,"The history, as I understand it, simplified: a ""day of Thanksgiving"" including a feast, to thank God for a fortunate event or blessing, is a tradition that goes way back. In America, there was a famous Thanksgiving in the 17th century when English settlers in Massachusetts joined with Native Americans to celebrate a successful harvest. It really happened, although it has been mythologized over the years.

Flash forward to the 19th century, ""days of Thanksgiving"" have continued but with no set date. The Civil War has torn the country apart and president Abraham Lincoln, inspired by a citizen's letter, decides to declare a national day of Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November. That's how it became the national holiday that it is today. For much more detail, see Wikipedia.

Modern Thanksgiving:

People of all faiths and nonbelievers celebrate the holiday to give thanks to their deity, to just be grateful/appreciative...or just to have a big meal. Many families try to get together, hence the driving large distances for people who have moved away.

Gifts are not a traditional part of the holiday. It's all about food, family, and (for many Americans) football! Also watching parades (mostly on TV).

Yes, it is normal to say ""Happy Thanksgiving!"" (or, ""Happy Holiday"", especially this year with Hanukkah overlapping it).

Friends certainly could be involved, although the focus is on family for most people. However, the night before Thanksgiving, many old high school friends reunite because they have all come back to their parents' homes after being away at college or moving away.

Unfortunately, actual Native Americans are not a big part of most public Thanksgiving events--although I'm sure it happens somewhere.

Amazingly, Thanksgiving seems to be equally enjoyed by liberal and conservative Americans. Food is universal. :) There's not much anti-Thanksgiving sentiment, although you do see some from Native American activists. Also vegans I guess, since turkey is the traditional main dish (although many vegetarians/vegans celebrate happily with non-meat dishes).

The official public holiday is only Thanksgiving Day itself. Some workplaces also close for the following day, making a wonderful 4-day weekend, but others don't (especially retail--the dreaded ""Black Friday"").

havalinaaa,"You have it right about the why - when the first (successful) colonists arrived, they didn't know how to survive here and the Wampanoag tribe helped them out, showing them the wonders of corn and other things. They had a big meal to celebrate. We commemorate that meal with Thanksgiving. It is a secular holiday, though of course there are religious people who like to make it about religion and thanking god for a bountiful harvest, but as an atheist I say it's usually non-religious people's favorite big holiday. It's supposed to be about being thankful for all you have in your life, lots of families go around the table saying what they're thankful for or something similar. 


You typically have a large meal with your extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc) and sometimes with your friends instead if you don't want to deal with that (it's sort of unofficially traditional for political arguments to happen, personality clashes to come up, all the 'joy' of family time basically) or can't afford to travel - or if your friend can't go you bring them to your family's thanksgiving. There are lots of football games that people watch all day while sitting in a turkey-induced food coma stupor. Also, a big parade happens in NYC that most kids love to watch on tv. 


You do say 'happy thanksgiving' to people. As far as I know (I'm white), all races celebrate thanksgiving. There are no gifts. I've never heard of people being anti-thanksgiving, just anti-the sale that happen the next day. 


It happens the fourth Thurs. in November, and that day is an official holiday that most people have off work, schools are closed, etc. Some people also get Friday off but not everyone (all schools are usually closed though), and of course there are people that have to work both days (cops, doctors, gas station clerks, etc - and more recently, some large chain stores are open).

psychologythrill,"there's another explanation also. there's this thing called 'object permanence' which is an infants ability to represent an object in its mind. To get an idea of this, think of playing with a baby and his toy, and then hiding the toy under a blanket. until a certain age the baby wouldnt look under the blanket for the toy because it doesnt yet have object permanence, or  a symbol of the toy in its mind. So the theory goes that until a child acquires object permanence it wont be able to represent objects/scenarios in it's mind and so wont have that kind of memory.
Language also uses symbols (the idea that a word represents a concrete thing) and so another idea is that using language throughout the day will aid memory formation and so before children begin speaking, their memories will be weaker. evidence of this was shown in the different social environments that north american vs asian children have. Its more common for NA parents to discuss the events of the day with their children (what happened today, what did you learn, etc) and this is not so common in asian cultures.

SunAvatar,"We don't really know exactly why, but there are several proposed explanations.

* **Neurological immaturity.** The brain structures that form lasting personal memories are just not fully formed yet. This is probably the most popular theory, yet it has the problem of explaining why two-year-olds can frequently remember things that happened when they were one.

* **Emotional immaturity.** Emotion is heavily involved in recollection, and during the first few years the brain structures that regulate emotion are still developing. Supporting this theory is that the occurrence of deeply meaningful and emotional events in a young child's life, such as the birth of a sibling, can lead to earlier memories.

* **Repression.** The first few years of life are so traumatic that they are simply repressed. Supporting this theory is the fact that adults who were abused or traumatized in childhood frequently have their first memories even later, around 5-6.

* **Lack of self-awareness.** Until a certain age, toddlers don't really understand that they are a person with unique characteristics, and separate from all others.

The bottle of beer with a wet paper towel will experience evaporation of the water soaking the towel, this evaporation wicks heat out of the beer bottle faster than if you let the cold climate of the freezer cool the beer normally.

At the moment the US as a whole has [~63Gigawatts excess capacity in it's energy sector](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=9671), that is not evenly spread, and some areas already experiencing ""brown outs"" would certainly struggle under significant extra loads.

Tesla will, eventually, be allowed to sell their cars as they wish. Those who want a Tesla will simply order them across state lines, online... at some point state regulators will realise they're harming their economy more than they're helping it. 

Other car manufacturers are also looking at more direct selling. Fiat is trialling stores in shopping malls (with a range of cars available to test drive in the parking lot).

As ACrusaderA said, the light might flicker but it's very uncommon for something serious to go wrong. [NASA](http://www.f-106deltadart.com/nasa_lightning_research.htm) actually did a bunch of tests on this back in the 80's by flying a F-106 through violent electrical storms and determined that the most likely outcome of an airborne lightening strike is that the lightening will simply pass harmlessly through the plane and head to the ground (where it was trying to go anyway).

pelicandb,"**Sorry this is not quite ELI5, but some people gave very incorrect explanations.**

Lightning does hit airplanes regularly. Modern airplanes have been designed so that when lightning strikes it is not very noticeable to the passengers.

The fact that planes are not grounded does not prevent lightning from striking the plane. While flying near an electrically charged cloud, the cloud can induce polarity: The total electric charge stays the same, but the cloud pulls positive charge to one side of the plane and negative to the other, and this increases the chances of getting struck. 

However, the planes are designed so lightning passes through the plane and out the other end, and continues to the ground or another cloud. Since lightning must pass through the plane, they are either made with metal skins, or if they are made from graphite composite, a thin copper layer is added to make the composite more conductive.

To protect the passengers, crew, and equipment, they are insulated from the outside skins. The lightning passes through the outside surface of the plane and leaves the contents unharmed. The plane acts like a [Faraday cage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage).

Due to the English Proclamation, colonists were told to stick to the east coast of the United States to prevent conflict with the Native Americans inhabiting the area.",null,0,cdozpg1,1rni9t,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
mikelo22,"The US tried to bring Canada into the fold initially in their invasion of Quebec. Wasn't smart though since it was during the winter. Needless to say, the expeditionary force sent to capture Quebec City failed and withdrew. After that, we never really tried again and focused on our own borders as the war soon shifted to the south.

Later, however, there were some diplomatic negotiations with the region later to be known as New Brunswick, though this never panned out. As someone else mentioned, during the Revolutionary War, many of the loyalists to the crown fled north into Canada. Thus, the loyalists had a very strong foothold in Canada politically.

Canada also wasn't anywhere near populated like the colonies were. They were mostly military and trade outposts. So it's not like there could be an appeal to the common folk to instigate a revolution like in the colonies; if a ""revolution"" was to come, it would have to come through diplomatic and political means.

In the War of 1812, the US did invade Canada, though not really to colonize it since Canada didn't really exist at this time... it was simply a British territory. If I recall, the Americans did gain some territory around Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, while the British Canadians made excursions into the Ohio Valley. At the end of the war, lands gained were given back on both sides and returned to the status quo. The War of 1812 is commonly referred to as the 2nd Revolutionary War because it was the US's attempt to legitimize itself as an independent and autonomous country. Before this, the British held very little respect for America's sovereignty, especially on the high seas via trade. While much cost came along with the war, the end finally legitimized the US as a sovereign nation that Britain would be forced to respect.

In the early 1800s, there was another border dispute by expansionist Democrats in the border dispute between Great Britain/Canada over where the official border should be between the Oregon territory and British Columbia. Americans wanted the 54-40' parallel (leading to the slogan ""Fifty-four Forty or Fight!"") while the British demanded the 42nd parallel. Instead of it leading to war, they eventually compromised on the 49th parallel. This officially gave the US the territory later to be incorporated as the state of Washington.

By this point, however, America had turned its sights south into Mexico where it annexed Texas and other southwestern territories later to be known as New Mexico and Arizona.",null,1,cdp4ucd,1rni9t,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

suicidebylifestyle," Lot of the time it's related to the blood vessels in your brain they get smaller or bigger and put pressure on other structures such as the membranes that surround your brain.

Example, if you are really hung over and have a head ache it is because you are dehydrated, how does this happen you may ask? Basically your brain is incredibly amazing and rather stupid at the same time.

Body: shit were really dehydrated we need some water where can we get it.

And your brain being the generous chap that it is steps up to the plate.

Brain: hey I've got plenty of water here have some!

And the membranes that envelope your brain don't shrink along with it as it loses water putting tension on then making your head hurt.

That's just one example.

By and large it has to do with the expansion and constriction of your blood vessels, unless there is some other underlying problem.

EDIT: I've been getting a lot of replies saying how I'm wrong and this or that aren't cause by the pathology I've stated here and I never claimed this to be the sole cause of headaches, read the entire post before you send snarky messages.

flamingmanny,"This is copied from another thread, i saved only this excerpt so unfortunately i don't know who the original writer of this is. Very informative, whoever posted this:

There's actually an [""international classification of headache disorders""](http://cep.sagepub.com/content/33/9/629.long) that classifies the different types of headaches. The brain itself has no pain receptors, because all pain receptors send their signals to the brain. It's the thing that's doing the ""feeling"" of the pain. This is why awake brain surgery works as well as it does: the neurosurgeon can go in an electrically stimulate the awake brain and remove brain tissue without the patient feeling anything.

As can be seen in the ICHD, there are many kinds of headaches. Some are caused by muscle tension in the head and neck. Others by inflammation pressing against nerves. Some even caused what's called ""referred pain"", which is when it feels like the pain is in one place, but that's actually a ""phantom"" pain being caused somewhere else.
The classic examples are heart attacks and ice-cream headaches. In ice-cream headaches, the rapid cooling of blood vessels in the throat and mouth stimulate the trigeminal nerve which brings in pain information from the head, making it feel like your head is in pain when the stimulation is actually happening in the mouth.

For other headaches, it's good to know about the three protective layers, called meninges, that cover the brain: thepia mater (soft mother), which adheres to the brain and is very fine; the arachnoid layer, which sort of provides a barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and the rest of the circulatory system; and the dura mater (hard mother), which feels very leathery, like bat wings, and holds in the cerebrospinal fluid.
These meninges also help form the blood brain barrier and cover a lot of the fine blood vessels that supply the brain with blood.

Both the blood vessels and meninges have pain receptors. The pain receptors in these regions can be stimulated by a lot of things. For example, meningitis is when these become enflamed due to infection. This inflammation is painful due to the stretching and pressure. Similarly, pressure changes brought about by dehydration or changes in blood salinity or what have you (like in a hangover) can also cause pain that we feel as ""headaches"".

So in short: there's not one kind of ""headache"", and sometimes even though a headache feels like it's located in one place, it's not really because of the phantom stimulation from referred pain.",null,13,cdp2rr0,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,65

TheOsteopath,"One frequent cause of headaches involves the muscles at the top of the neck/base of the skull getting irritated by poor posture, like sitting at a computer for too long, and tightening up. The Occipital nerve which runs close to the muscles gets pressed on which causes the headache.

Just like banging your funny bone, the pressure on the nerve causes symptoms to be felt in the area the nerve runs to. The funny bone is the ulnar nerve and you feel it in your fingers, pressure from tight muscles on the Occipital nerve makes you feel it over the top of your skull.

FeatherAlchemist,"There are a variety of migraines that can be triggered by things such as allergies (gluten, sugar, egg/dairy allergies are extremely common and often overlooked as an underlying cause). Other triggers can be caffeine related (sometimes caffeine will help to alleviate a migraine, sometimes it will be a trigger), change in air pressure/weather changes, change in altitude, light sensitivity, and more. Chronic migraine sufferers often report an aura of light/sudden blips of darkness before receiving an intense migraine, as well as dizziness, nausea, senisitivity to sound or movement, a loss of speech, and in severe cases - seizures. For some people, migraines can't be explained away with dehydration. Long time sufferers may very well have a chemical imbalance/hormonal imbalance, a family history of migraines, an intolerance to common stress, etc (the reasons are so varied and wide, that it is important to know your family medical history in cases like this). For anyone who suffers migraines frequently, it is important to seek medical help. MRI's, CAT scans, and blood tests may be necessary to determine that it isn't a build-up of fluids causing pressure on the brain, a tumor/cancer, some sort of damage, an aneurism, a nutritional deficiency, an unknown allergy, etc. For most, a migraine is a very uncommon experience, rare enough that they may only experience one or two in their entire life. For others, learning to manage a life with frequent migraines is quite different, and they may live their entire life without ever finding a cure or a cause. If you have ever experienced an actual migraine, you know, undoubtedly, that it is nothing like a headache or a hangover. That pounding in your head resounds through your entire body to the point that even the sound of your own heartbeat makes you turn with fever and sickness. It can last hours (if you're lucky), or days... For the lucky few, a simple antiseizure medication can often help (as sometimes does an antidepressant). These can help to alleviate the pain or offer the sufferer some control before a migraine strikes. For others, migraines are something that the sufferer will often have to learn to cope with and endure. Migraines might mean that the sufferer make permanent, life changing decisions in their diet and exercise routines as a way to seek some control (in my case, this helped me greatly). Migraine sufferers should also note, that the use of OTC's can cause long-term issues. Paying careful attention to proper doses and following instructions are important in matters like this. If an OTC does not work, do not continue to pop more pills. Your body will eventually build a tolerance, and your migraines might become more difficult to treat, as a result. 

Source: I was diagnosed with chronically transformed migraines and have been seen by specialists, as well as been in and out of hospitals since I was 14.

TL/DR: There are several types of migraines. Not all are caused by dehydration. Many outside factors can influence any individual to suffer a migraine, some of which, have no cause or known cure. ",null,0,cdp0hro,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,13

Oznog99,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache

It's a good question, because the brain itself does not have pain-sensing nerves at all.  

&gt;Rather, the pain is caused by disturbance of the pain-sensitive structures around the brain. Nine areas of the head and neck have these pain-sensitive structures, which are the cranium (the periosteum of the skull), muscles, nerves, arteries and veins, subcutaneous tissues, eyes, ears, sinuses and mucous membranes.

&gt;Headache often results from traction to or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels. The nociceptors may also be stimulated by other factors than head trauma or tumors and cause headaches. Some of these include stress, dilated blood vessels and muscular tension. Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fiber to the nerve cells in the brain, signaling that a part of the body hurts.

That's still rather vague!  And unusual- when stressed, it's not common to have, say, your left foot suddenly ache so much you can't function.  For no reason, and then stop.  Unexplained pain from receptors with no apparent stimulus is [neuralgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia), and the process is not well-understood at all, headaches included, apparently.

I think the best answer to your specific question is ""we don't really know, exactly"".  Sometimes that's just the answer.

Because brain itself is insensitive to pain and even if touched directly it can only cause funny sensations in the areas of the body represented by that portion that is touched.

Whereas the layer covering the brain which holds the blood vessels are very sensitive. As someone mentioned earlier hangover headaches are from here.

Too much alcohol -too much byproducts (and even constipation)causes toxic products in the vessels-irritation of vessels-Headache!

In Migraine too much emotion and tension will make the blood vessels go crazy which get tired and become flaccid and blood keeps gushing in causes it to stretch more including the layer covering brain-Headache!!

Emotional headaches are when muscles of scalp and neck spasm(i.e when muscles get too stressed out lactic acid is produced which causes pain) but still it feels like your head hurts from inside because all types of headaches are referred outside and feels the same.

1 Shot is USUALLY 35% (depends on the booze). per 100ml. A beer is like...7%/100ml. So, if you drank 500mls of 7% beer, it would be the same as drinking 1 shot. Can you understand that? 

Bars generally have a guideline on their serving sizes so they a) Don't overserve customers, and b) don't lose money. If a glass of wine has like, 20% alcohol, then drinking a glass at 150ml would be the equivalent of drinking one shot still. 

It all really comes down to math. All liquor is generally priced in relation to it's percentage of alcohol (Unless it's imported/fancy/popular/etc),  which is why the bottle of wine in the grocery store is like, $10, while a bottle of fireball is $20.

Whatever number is advertised, like the 230 million MegaMillions jackpot, is what you would get *if you let the lottery handle the money for you*. If you choose annuities, they take the lump sum and invest it for you, and they think they can get you 230 million dollars. Before taxes.

It_wasnt_me_honest,"The parts that go into a PC all conform to agreed upon standards.  What the parts do, where they go, what the connector looks like, how the power is attached.  All standardized.  You can almost think of the various components like lego bricks.  You buy a selection of the right color and shape and plug them together.

The software environment is also standardized.  The main board (or 'motherboard') for example has software on board (the BIOS) that can recognize keyboards and video cards, can access the hard drive and read a DVD ROM.  This means you can take your Operating System (e.g. Windows) DVD ROM, pop it in the drive, power-on and your system will install itself.

When Windows is done installing, it will often be able to use all your devices either immediately, or once you pop in the driver disk for your new video card.  If the video card or printer manufacturer have done a good job then this should be trivial.  Device manufacturers write software for Windows based on Microsoft published specifications and then have to pass a set of tests (called 'certification') in order to publish their device software.  Things can still go wrong - if the manufacture hasn't done good quality assurance then bugs can get through that can crash the operating system (omg Windows suxorz.. uh... no).  Usually though, things just work almost like magic.

Consoles aren't like that.  Consoles are not like lego sets put together with well-defined pieces that can be plugged in and out. Typically the insides of a console are rigid - they can't be changed.  They're put together in one configuration and can't be changed.  This does two things: First, it keeps the costs down. Making a mainboard with all the components fixed is cheaper than building individual components and connecting them.  Second, it presents a fixed configuration to the games companies.  They can write their game knowing that it will always work at these graphics levels and at this resolution.  They don't have to build the flexibility to work with 5 years worth of different graphics card performance.  They can tweak and tune their game graphics so it looks as good as possible without risk of some unexpected variable (old busted graphics card) coming in and ruining the experience.

On the software side, the operating system will be hard-coded in the platform, and cryptographically signed (which means it contains a magic number that mathematically proves the software came from the vendor).  This doesn't mean it's not upgradable, just not upgradable by you.  You can't but the OS install on a DVD.

Console vendors often make either miniscule profit or an actual loss on the console itself in order to get it out in the world in mass quantities (i.e. they can't price it too high otherwise people won't buy it).  They actually make their money on games.  Every game you buy, a slice will go to the console vendor, and that's what makes the whole enterprise a viable business.  The console vendors, then, can't have people installing unlicensed software on the machine as that would defeat the business model.  So signed binaries are everywhere.

&gt;If people can build computers at home so easily

We have to be careful about terminology here.  When I 'build' a computer at home, I'm really doing something a robot or illiterate chinese factory worker could do - I'm just taking parts I've purchased and sticking them together.  The serious business of making the parts is not something you can do at home, and you need billions of dollars in hardware to make the parts. 

Game consoles use custom hardware that deliberately does not talk to certain regular PC hardware, their software deliberately is just a little bit different.  Both the XB3 and PS4 use basically PC architectures, and the hard drives are readable on Windows and FreeBSD computers 
(freeBSD is the base OS in the PS4), and a few things like that, but most of the serious hardware is a variant on consumer parts, notably the CPU/GPU combo.  

PC's rely on a very broad collection of agreements and standards by companies that make sure all of the components talk to each other and that software can talk to the hardware (or at least should, UEFI and the linux guys have had some disagreements).  The console parts won't talk to a regular PC, and the software won't run on a regular PC.

This is an important distinction, because besides Playstation and XBox, you also cannot build a Mac. These components are all controlled by apple. While apple now uses Intel processors you cannot buy the chip that would allow it to run an Apple operating system.

Certain companies like Dell and Apple are trying to change this back so they can make more money being the only producer of hard and software for their devices. 

Also, you cannot just change out parts for consoles, they want you to buy new ones instead. For instance, I had to change the optical drive on my Xbox and it was not as simple as swapping the parts. I had to use special hardware and software to get a code off the old drive to program it onto the new one so it would play games. Without this all I had was an expensive DVD player. 

It would play games downloaded on the hard drive that were purchased online but it would not read a game disc without the code. Lets say for instance that I had either thrown out the old one or the old one was shot completely then I would be forced to get a new console. 

This used to be the way it was with pc's before Bill Gates convinced IBM to open source their hardware but leave the software closed. This is how Microsoft got so big and IBM stayed the same size.  Now anyone can make the hardware you need to build a pc but the software is proprietary.

Scotland is a relatively poor part of the UK that has benefited quite a lot from payments from the central government over the centuries for things like health care and roads etc.   But it has oil reserves, well some anyway, which have inflated GDP lately.  

So first thing - scotland only has about 5 million people, of the UK's 63 ish.  So if they leave, in the grand scheme of things it won't make much difference.

But how oil revenues are carved up would be non trivial, as would how the territory is split.  There no answer here because it hasn't been decided.  Presumably scotland would get most of the oil as most of it is close to scotland

&gt;standard of living, etc?

In the long run it's bad for scotland.  It won't matter much to the UK.  Unlike Ireland, which was a 3rd world country (caused by deliberate UK policy) attached to europe when it got independence Scotland is overall well off.  That would start to gradually erode as the practical realities of trying to do business in scotland sink in.  Without oil they don't have anything, and while they could try and set themselves up as an Ireland like english speaking tax haven, how many more tax havens does europe need (or want), and if they can't be a tax haven what are they?  There isn't a critical mass of people for any meaningful industry anymore, and trying to use the Euro or the pound would turn them into a greece or spain.   For a little while it would all seem rosy, as the ship building and the IT sector seemed great, and then the problems of goods and people across borders, the currency imbalances etc. would all sink in.

&gt;etc?

The etc is really the main question.  Unlike just about everyone else who has asked for and gotten independence scotland is not particularly culturally distinct from the UK on a day to day basis.  At least not anymore.  They all speak the same language, albeit with an accent, they go to similar jobs, they live in similar houses they already have representation in government, they go home and watch TV and play games and go to bars and pubs etc in much the same way as their english counter parts.  The scottish are not particularly committed to one religion that is being oppressed by another or any of that.  So what do they get?  

Somewhat like Canada and australia and new zealand they get to waste a pile of money having independent foreign policies which almost no one in the world cares about because they're too small to matter, and most of the serious important issues it will get to spend a pile of money to feel good about itself for agreeing to do what everyone else sane is doing anyway.  Made worse is that scotland is never going to get much bigger.  While Canada and Australia could conceivably pass England in population by the end of the century or so, scotland is going to be, well, small.  

The UK has military bases in Scotland and Scotts serve in the  British military, that would change, and less money in one pot will make it a bit harder to have major military assets like aircraft carriers and airplane R&amp;D and that sort of thing.   That weakens the UK a little bit, but makes scotland basically irrelevant in the world.  

If the EU got its act together into a single megastate it basically wouldn't matter at all.  It would be like splitting New York state in half.  You can... or you cannot, in the end it doesn't make much difference to anyone.  Arbitrary lines on a map are arbitrary.  

N.B. I'm in Canada, we have our own separatists in Quebec, who do seem to be culturally different from the rest of us in Canada.

They also tell soldiers and guardsmen to wiggle their toes, as the muscles contracting and relaxing helps push blood back up to your heart/head and so on. 

From wikipedia:
""The return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the skeletal-muscle pump, and by the thoracic pump action of breathing during respiration. Standing or sitting for a prolonged period of time can cause low venous return from venous pooling (vascular) shock. Fainting can occur but usually baroreceptors within the aortic sinuses initiate a baroreflex such angiotensin II and norepinephrine stimulate vasoconstriction and heart rate increases to return blood flow. Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting. In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness. Jet pilots wear pressurized suits to help maintain their venous return and blood pressure.""

Different animals have different levels of sensitivity to the vibrations caused by sound waves, this is why a dog can hear a dog whistle but a human can't. A dog has a more sensitive hearing ability and therefore a wider range of hearing than a human.

The increased sensitivity of hearing in a dog can cause them to interpret the same sound as a human, but louder.

Now, assuming that the sound is well within the hearing frequencies of both animals, yes the most sensitive animal at that particular pitch will hear a louder sound.

I can't think of a very clean way to prove this without getting complicated. Think of a tone that steadily rises in pitch until it is no longer in our hearing range. It will seem to slowly decrease in dB, even if it is kept at a steady volume.

Sneezes are caused by irritation in the nostril(s)/sometimes throat and your body's natural reaction is to expel the foreign objects. I believe this causes your diaphragm to contract (or expand?) and shove all the air from your lungs and stomach out so that the air pressure forces the object out. During this process, your trachea contracts (to 2/3 its normal diameter if I'm not mistaken) in order to further increase air pressure. As the air is rapidly forced through this narrow passage, sneezes can be different in different people based on any of the following:
    
* trachea diameter
* muscular strength (the force with which the diaphragm expels air)
* spasms (i.e. sometimes I sneeze twice in the space of one sneeze and it sounds different)
* how much air is flowing

The famous example of this is a teacher who was told certain students in her class were tested and that some were 'bloomers' and should be expected to do well, while others were 'strugglers' and should be expected to do worse (the students were never tested, this was all randomly made up but the teacher didnt know that). At the end of the year the students were tested for real and the bloomers in fact excelled while the strugglers were worse off. The teacher had expectations of these students and those expectations shaped her behaviour towards the kids which resulted in the expectations being met.

Another example could be if society has a stereotype that a certain subgroup of people are mean. So we treat them as if they're mean and we dont like them because thats what we expect..well they're likely to not like that and treat us poorly in return, confirming the stereotype that theyre mean.

Most smart people tend to agree that dinosaurs died because of a big disaster called the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Probably because a big rock from space hit the earth and sent a lot of dust into the sky. This dust blocked out the sun and made the world very cold. Like the north poll where Santa lives. As we all know, only Santa and his helpers and reindeer live in the north poll. That is because when it is cold and dark, plants can't grow, so the big animals that eat the plants die because they are hungry and cold :(

Smaller animals can live with a lot less food, and mammals have fur and warm blood to keep them alive in the cold. This is why they survived the cold winter that lasted many years. 

Eventually all the dinosaurs died except for some birds (did you know birds used to be dinosaurs?) because they are small, and some could dive under the water or make warm little burrows. Mammals then took the place of dinosaurs when the world warmed up again. They got bigger and bigger, like elephants and whales! (The largest animal to ever live still exists, it is the blue whale! We call such animals ""megafauna"". For a long time these giant animals lived happily, grazing on lush green pastures and making friends. Then there came man. 

Unlike other animals, man is very sneaky. He can work together to catch and eat really big animals, even an animal as big as the blue whale I just told you about! He can use weapons like spears and knives and even make traps. That is why many of the big, slow and delicious animals we used to have were all eaten up.

As far as I know whales can get around this by not having the same type of extremities, like arms and legs.

The reason proportionately larger animals are less efficient is because mass is a function of the cube of height, but the strength of bones and muscle are a function of the square of height (because [their strength is related to the size of the 2D cross section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_strength#Overview), not due to the mass of the bone or muscle - picture trying to make a house out of paper).

When I'm in the studio, I like to have my vocals a LOT louder than they would normally be, so I get a custom mix in my cans- where a drummer might need to hear a little more bass guitar. 

If I'm laying down a guitar track, I want MY guitar panned hard to one side and a touch louder.

Most water sources carried bacteria (things that make your tummy hurt and can even make you fall asleep forever like your goldfish did). Even now, water can only be drunk after it has been cleaned, but back then they didn't know how to clean water. So back in the old days, people noticed that if they mixed enough alcohol with their water, they wouldn't get sick.

Bnni,"They didn't discover a method of tearing things apart, they are observing a phenomenon they don't have a proper explanation for yet, as with many things in quantum mechanics. 

Keep in mind that I am by no means an expert.

There is a fundamental property true for all quantum objects, in that you cannot determine one partner of a pair of complimentary properties with 100% precision. The more precisely you try to determine one, the less precisely you can determine the other one in a single measurement. This is called the uncertainty principle. Thus I am a little bit sceptical about their method of attempting to measure multiple parameters at the same time.

What they are doing here as it seems, is measure the location of a photon at the left side, where they have a 100% chance to travel to, but are able to detect just the polarization at the right side in a separate measurement, where the chance of them to travel to is 0%. Taking measurements here though causes a disturbance in the system, changing the path the photons take, and changing its location (it's no longer 100% on the left side), thus explaining why they could measure just the polarization at the right side now. 

Then, they try to measure both properties at the same time, with lower precision and with lower influence on the system as they say, but get the same outcome, the location being 100% on the left side, and the polarization being on the right side, which seems a bit paradox.

I feel this is ultimately a problem of the measurement influencing a system. To observe it, we have to disturb it.",null,0,cdp9ist,1ro32y,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

If you plot pressure against temperature, you will get a line that is declining with sinking temperature, no matter the volume or amount of substance used (those need to be constant though). So if you keep following this line (""extrapolating"" it), until you reach a pressure of 0 you will be at -273,15°C, or 0 Kelvin, absolute zero.

Since there can be no such thing as negative pressure (as pressure is an expression of force and area, both of which cannot be negative either), we have effectively reached a point where it would be no longer logical to continue, or simply something we cannot describe with our laws of nature. 

Keep in mind that a pressure of 0 also implies that there is no movement of molecules and atoms anymore, as to apply pressure, a particle needs to collide with a surface.

Obviously the slowest the particles could move is not moving at all. Thus, no movement means no energy, which means no temperature. This is why the coldest something can be is 0 (no movement).

edit: if you want to know why we can calculate this without actually being able to achieve it, it's just by using formulas that we have. For example, with the formula F=ma, if you wanted to know how much force was needed to accelerate a 999,999,999 kg object 99,999,999,999,999 m/s^2, you could just plug it in solve.

sir_sri,"&gt;Someone young like me doesn't have $1000 to spend on a single share of Google.

If you don't have several thousands of dollars to lose you shouldn't be investing in individual stocks.  Any single company could have all sorts of things go wrong with it and you would lose everything, that you cannot afford to lose.  

&gt;and their stock would go up as a result, right?

Not really no.

A few thousand people buying one share is irrelevant to the share price.   The way you should be buying into google (or anyone) is by buying into a mutual fund that has several tech stocks.  You get a tiny piece of the larger pie, but you're not stuck to a single company. 

&gt;Or do they not want that for some reason?

They want to drive away hordes of small investors who have no meaningful portion of the company.  1 million investors with 1 share each are only worth a billion dollars, which is less than 1% of the value of the company.  That's a lot of paperwork for basically nothing.  Particularly if they're  highly volatile and trading small numbers of shares around.  


&gt;please explain if this is not the case

Different companies have different strategies, particularly when it comes to stock splitting. If you feel there are enough shares available, or if you feel that you stock is so expensive as to even be pricing mutual funds out of the market you may need to consider a split, unless you only want long term investors.  Cheap stocks can see a lot of trading volume from people trying to get a few dollars a share here or there. 

Berkshire hathaway (warren buffets company) is the example of strongly resisting - to a point of excess.  Their share price as of when I type this is 174 000 USD per share.  Yes, 174k.

A lot of companies split around $1000 for the reason you are saying - people are hesitant to spend that much money for just one ""thing"", and if they can buy four stocks for $250 each (or just one for $250) then they feel the barrier of entry is lower, the risk is lower (?), etc.  It's purely psychological.  However, typically when a strong company whose stock has been rising splits it stock there is a quick upsurge in the effective stock price as people want to ""get in"" on the new price, they feel they can finally afford it, or whatever.  I would be interested in some statistics on this actually, maybe that is just my bias talking.

The opposite is true in my very limited experience too - I worked at a company who did a reverse stock split to try and get their price above $1 a share, as if that would magically put them into the big leagues and suddenly the company would turn around.  So we traded in two $0.55 per share stocks for one $1.10 and within a week the new price was down around $0.80 and just kept falling after that.

Judges appointed by the King or Queen would literally travel from town to town hearing cases and passing down judgements. In the absence of a comprehensive statutory code, judges would base their decisions on their understanding of how the law should work, and how judges before them had decided similar cases.

On their return to London, courts would record their judgements and the reasoning behind them and share them with their fellow judges. That way, when a judge encountered a similar case on their circuit, they would be able to decide it consistently with the last judge who had decided that case. Alternatively, a senior judge might overrule their junior and create a new precedent.

The Common Law is the result of these thousand years of legal decisions. Judges in Common Law jurisdictions are expected to decide cases consistently with their predecessors, and in turn pass on how they interpret the law in newly arising circumstances to their successors.

How ""legitimate"" the Common Law is depends on your jurisdiction. The degree to which the Common Law is adopted in your local legal system is determined by your local laws. Especially, different countries tend to clearly mark where their local system of precedent diverges from the British system they inherited it from - decisions before that date being binding legal precedent, and decisions after that date only being suggestions on how the law might be interpreted.

Alcohol inhibits the body's ability to produce an anti-duretic hormone that controls urination. Lowered levels of this hormone means lowered bladder capacity and more bathroom trips.

With alcohol you urinate about 160% of the liquid you consume. That really depends on your body weight and composition, but the important concept is that you are getting rid of more water than you're taking in.

1. They have a pharmacological effect opposite that of the toxin (using a stimulant to counteract a depressant for example)
2. They block the receptor the toxin binds to, blunting the effect of the toxin (for example, naloxone, an opioid antagonist, binds to narcotic receptor sites on neurons and prevents opioids from binding competitively) If you drank methanol, you could be given ethanol (grain alcohol) which has a greater affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase which turns methanol into toxic formaldehyde. The goal is to pass the methanol through the urine unchanged so it has no toxic effects.
3. They bind directly to the toxin so it cannot bind to receptors in the body (for example, CroFab binds to snake venom so an inactive conjugate of the crofab and venom is excreted without toxic effects)

Prior to the advent of a reliable mechanical clock which is the ability to determine longitude at sea basically... you guessed what direction you were pointed, hope you don't screw it up, and hope you live through the experience.  And yes, a lot of people didn't live through the experience.

You've been able to reasonably deduce latitude from something like the 3rd century BC (when latitude and longitude were developed), even in open water.  So sometimes people sailed to the correct latitude and then sailed straight east/west (or tried to anyway), that's not trivial when you're powered by sails that lead you not exactly where you intended.

From the mid 1500's on into the 1700's various european monarchs were offering quite a lot of money to try and solve this problem.  Finding longitude is a relatively easy problem on land, not so easy at sea btw.

One of the most basic ways to do this was with very precise measurement of time.  If you know the local time, and the time at some other fixed point (say Greenwich observatory) you could tell where you were.  Unfortunately methods of telling time - hourglasses and pendulums don't work for shit in a ship bobbing around in the open ocean. You can correctly tell *local* time from the sun, but that doesn't do you any good unless you know local time at some fixed point.  

In the mid 1700's (and for quite a while after) the method was based on very complex data tables about the position of of the moon at known points.  Not ideal, but it was good enough until the mid 1850's when high precision mechanical clocks became affordable. (and then in the 1900's they used radio positioning, which along with GPS type systems is still what is used).

GaryDo,"**TL;DR an awful lot of painstaking measurement by hand, the construction of physical reference points and mathematics**

A process known as chain surveying by triangles. Essentially you very carefully measured a large straight line distance by hand using a chain of known length^1. Then using trigonometry you could work out the distance of the other two sides. The whole area to be mapped (for instance the whole of the UK by Ordnance Survey) could be broken down in to triangles and mapped in this way. Whilst in theory you could map the whole country based on one single measurement of length, in reality tolerances (small errors that make your calculations too large or small) would build over time and throw your map way out. As such they had to do those physical measurements by hand all over the country to ensure their numbers were not straying far from reality.  

[You can still see the ""Triangulation Stations"" all over the UK](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/upload/531489/images/trig.jpg)

HashTagWaterFelon,"Short answer is that it depends, and serious deformities may or may not ever actually arise.

The thing is that if the initial two had ""perfect"" genomes with no mutations corresponding to serious defects, there is no reason that their breeding (or that of their descendants) would necessarily give rise to a population with those defects. If they aren't there to begin with, they wouldn't be created by inbreeding. The founder effect is the formal name for how low diversity groups starting a population can lead to high incidences of genetic defects. But that is only because the genes for those traits were brought by a founding member of the population. Inbreeding NEVER creates a genetic mutation. It only increases the chance that one already present will be expressed.

And anyways, if the two people happened to carry in some serious problem traits, as in serious to the point that they would kill off the affected person, then natural selection would act to start pushing the gene's prevalence downwards anyway. Simulations with programs mathematically assigning fitness levels to mice show how when a given gene gives a higher probability of successfully breeding, that the inferior gene is purged to a minimal level very quickly (described in Reece and Campbell, ""Biology"", 7th edition)

So in short, assuming that these two individuals were healthy to start with, that pretty much guarantees that there are enough ""healthy"" genes in play to rebuild the population. Situations like the Kentucky families that took on a blue skin tone was because that trait didn't really reduce fitness levels by much (if it did, the blue ones would die and that gene would fade out). You would have a low level of genetic diversity, yes, which would leave humanity vulnerable to being ravaged by a disease or other pressure of that kind. So you could very easily get some strange traits popping up, but if they were ""serious deformities"" to the point that they mess with a person's ability to propagate themselves, then no, that trait wouldn't show up and stay around.",null,6,cdpg3e8,1rootd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,25

&gt;It's because punching (like running) is a highly-coordinated activity that relies on proprioceptive feedback throughout the motion to work. Since the thalamus clamps down both on the transmission of the motor signals you'd need to effectively complete the motion and the perception of joint-motion data while you're asleep, everything feels bogged down and slow.

&gt;Compare that to 'flying', which is a), something we can't do normally, so we have no basis for comparison to see if it feels right or not, and b) superman-style flying about doesn't require significant body motion anyway.

Also, there have been studies on Oxytocin's affects on forms of autism, so you might look for those if you're interested.

As for describing things on a more personal level, perhaps it's easiest first to imagine anxiety since you're familiar with it (and so am I, unfortunately!). There are ""gut"" feelings attached to it, right? Not everyone can name those feelings easily, but for me, when I think about feeling anxious, I think of words like ""jittery"" or ""nervous."" I think about having a nervous or upset stomach, about sweaty palms, about feeling like everything is coming to a head in a way that I won't be able to manage.

If I see someone else running toward a bus or getting ready to give a big presentation with trembling hands, I think about what *I* might feel, were I in their place. In those cases, it's anxiety. *I* would hate to miss a bus I desperately needed to be on. *I* would hate to feel nervous before a big presentation. 

It's not always about being able to name emotions, I think, or necessarily being able to know what to do with another person's emotions. It's about imagining you are another person and thinking about how you might feel in their place. I'm not at all sure if that helps, but that's the best way I can describe it.

How ""far"" someone can imagine things from others' perspectives varies. Some people can imagine how it'd feel to be that person running toward the bus. Others can imagine how it'd feel to be a person half a world away who's just lost their home to a devastating earthquake.

If you're asking more about the romantic side of things, that becomes more complex because what's ""normal"" and expected in relationships is heavily influenced by the culture you are surrounded by. How ""swept up"" people feel varies a lot, too, and ebbs and flows with partners and stages of life. Being a teenager, you're probably around a lot of people who are feeling a *lot* of things in this department—the best and worst of love, hate, jealousy, etc.—and likely feel overwhelmed by most of it.

BassoonHero,"There is a lot of mythology about this, so I'll try to post a complete answer. This brushes on some old holy wars, so please read the whole thing before leaving angry comments.

The first important point is that a virus is a specific type of malware. A virus exploits holes in an operating system to spread itself from system to system. You might get a virus from an infected disc or flash drive, or from another system on your network. If you install it yourself, then it's not a virus, even if you were tricked into installing it. A piece of malware disguised as something innocuous is called a trojan horse, or just a ""trojan"" for short.

There is a variety of trojan horse malware out there for the Mac OS, for Windows, and even for Linux. However, there are few viruses that will infect modern Windows and *none* that affect the modern Mac OS. For Windows, this has not long been the case. A decade ago, Windows viruses abounded, and users had to be very careful to keep up with software updates and to run antimalware programs. At the same time, there were *still* no Mac OS X viruses in the wild.

Common internet wisdom holds that this is because the Mac OS was far less popular at the time, so no one tried to write a virus for it. While intuitively appealing, this explanation is faulty for several reasons.

First, it strains one's credulity to suppose that this could explain a *total* lack of viruses for Mac OS X. Surely someone *somewhere* would have seen that while the Mac market was smaller, it was also ripe for subversion. Mac users of the time were justifiably (if irritatingly) smug about not needing to run antivirus programs. If there had been no additional hurdles to creating a Mac OS X virus, then it should have been *easier* to infect Macs, because their users were not accustomed to taking precautions. Moreover, surely some ambitious hacker must have realized the infamy that writing the first virus for OS X would bring.

Second, the prevalence of other types of malware, such as trojan horse software, has increased as the Mac's market share waxes. It's commonplace to hear that yet another Mac-based trojan has been spotted in the wild, yet still not a single virus. If the Mac's market share is sufficient to attract trojans, then why not viruses?

Third, the true cause is evinced by a decline in Windows viruses over the past several years. True, Windows's market share has declined somewhat, but the number of true viruses has dropped precipitously. The drop is all out of proportion to the fall in market share, and, crucially, the prevalence of viruses for other platforms (such as Mac OS X) has not increased to make up for it.

So if we can eliminate market share as the cause, then what? Well, the answer is simple, if sadly contentious. During the ""dark ages"" of Windows viruses, the Windows OS was far more vulnerable to viruses than either its contemporaries or the modern Windows OS. The ""malware explosion"" that accompanied the rise of internet use among ordinary users hit Windows the hardest because Windows was the easiest OS to write a virus for. The subsequent decline of true viruses came as Microsoft worked to close security holes, retire old APIs, and generally modernize their OS.

In a way, it's only by happenstance that the Mac OS avoided this. The ""classic"" Mac OS (versions 1–9) predated Windows, and by the late '90s, it was showing its age. It was designed for a world where a personal computer had a single, trusted user. Where this assumption was violated, there were security holes. And there were definitely viruses, although in those days, you were more likely to catch one from a friend's floppy disk than from the internet. There were also myriad technical limitations that are well-documented elsewhere. So Apple decided to replace the OS wholesale. This was a long and painful process, and an interesting one if you find this sort of thing interesting, but in the end, they had OS X, a modern, multi-user UNIX-based OS. And no viruses.

Windows's evolution took a more gradual path. Windows NT (""New technologies"") was in some technical respects a dramatic step forward, but Microsoft was very careful not to move too fast, lest compatibility problems alienate their users. Apple, on the other hand, maintained compatibility by requiring their users to emulate the classic OS within OS X, an approach that infuriated users but allowed Apple's engineers to make a much cleaner break with the bad old days.

So during the ""dark ages"", Mac users had a brand new modern OS, whereas Windows users had an aging single-user OS full of holes that Microsoft was working to plug. Today, Windows is a different animal – Microsoft's strategy of replacing the planks as the ship sailed seems to have mostly worked. And a modern Windows PC is very unlikely to get a computer virus.

TheDoctorApollo,"While it is true that there is more awareness for Celiac's Disease and that will lead to increased diagnosis, I am not aware of any evidence that suggests it is more common now compared to 5, 10+ year ago.

Most people who are self-diagnosed Celiacs have absolutely nothing wrong with them, but instead just want to jump on board the band wagon. Perhaps they have an intolerance to gluten, but an intolerance is very different than an allergy which is what defines Celiac's Disease. For someone to truly be allergic to gluten they must have an adaptive immune response to it. As I said, most people are either doing it because they want the health benefits of a gluten-free diet or because it's the cool thing to do. I had a friend that decided she was allergic to gluten this summer. I couldn't help but call her out on it when she decided that pizza and beer didn't count in her new lifestyle.

If your sister was actually diagnosed with Celiac's by an allergist (MD who specializes in allergies) than it is possible that you have it as well. There is some evidence to suggest that there is a genetic link in Celiac's disease. It is worth getting check out by a health professional, prolonged exposure to gluten can cause tissue remodeling in someone with Celiac's, which may lead to cancer or chronic inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome.

liquefaction187,"Awareness does help, but there are many other factors. I believe there's been a steep increase over the last 20-30 years that is only now becoming public knowledge. Children have more sensitive immune systems than adults, and those who have spent their whole lives only eating lots of unfermented gluten from a few strains have a more severe immune system reaction than adults who ate less gluten, grew up on fermented gluten, and ate more diverse gluten. 

For starters, we are overexposed to gluten - we eat more processed foods than we did in the past. Gluten is also added to more foods than ever because it's cheap. It's cheap because it stores well, and it's subsidized. While in the past we ate many different strains of wheat, currently we eat only a few strains. Modern wheat is bred to be extremely high in gluten, because gluten is great for texture. 

The way we process wheat has also changed. Commercial yeast wasn't developed until the 1960s. Before that, wheat had to be fermented to help it rise. A starter was created for this purpose. Starters are usually made from flour and water. The flour and water would be naturally colonized by local bacteria, which would be fed with more flour and water on a regular basis (or less often for sourdough), and these bacteria are what caused dough to rise. That starter was used to make each loaf of bread. The bacteria served another helpful function as well - to break down the harmful substances in grains by digesting them and leaving behind harmless substances humans can digest easily. 

There's a good reason grain is a common allergy. Like animals, plants can have defenses. Not all though - some plants, like fruits, want to be eaten. Their seeds are spread through feces, so it makes sense for them to be delicious and not cause issues in things that eat them. Unsprouted grains, however, die when eaten, so they developed a hull as a defense. That hull contains phytic acid, which blocks absorption of calcium, iron, and other nutrients we need. It's called an anti-nutrient for that reason. Another mildly toxic substance in seeds is lectin. In small amounts, these substances won't cause permanent issues, just some mild stomach upset in those not accustomed. However, when eaten multiple times a day, our bodies sometimes start to react. 

Another thing makes lectins and anti-nutrients in grains more harmful today than in the past. Grains were left in the fields to sprout long ago. Just like fruit now is picked before it's ripe, followers of modern agricultural methods don't allow the grain to sprout, as sprouted grain goes bad more quickly. Sprouted grain also contained fewer of these anti-nutrients as it doesn't need the defenses that a seed does. 

Even in people who aren't intolerant/allergic, gluten causes inflammation due to this toxic substance, as well as lectins. This inflammation causes the intestines to swell. The swelling causes tiny holes to be opened. When this happens, tiny particles of food leak outside of the intestines where they're supposed to be, into the body. At this point our body sees the particles as foreign invaders, and begins to attack them. This is called Leaky Gut Syndrome and is in debate within the medical community, but many people (myself included) have seen relief by avoiding substances that cause inflammation. Had I waited around for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me, I'd still be too sick to leave the house. 

If you think about how your immune system is designed to react to a tiny germ, it's easy to understand how a tiny particle of gluten could cause a reaction as well. Our bodies are reacting to what they see as a constant poisoning by doing what they are supposed to do - trying to make us stop eating something that's bad for us.

defguysezhuh,"When calling 911 in the United States, Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing (D/HH) people have several options (links to additional information are included as I go along):

* **Video Relay Service (VRS) &amp; Video Phones (VP) -** They can use VPs to call 911 immediately via VRS.  Basically, the Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person will dial 911 over the video phone, a certified sign language interpreter will respond first, and then dial 911 is dialed immediately via telephone line in a 3-way conference call (deaf person to interpreter to dispatch).  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located (at home or at a business) registered on that account so that when dialing 911, the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the 911 dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency.  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a time-saver when dealing with emergencies, but is also provides clear and direct communication when a Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing person, like anyone in an emergency situation, may be panicking and would likely ""stutter"" with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address.  For more information on how VPs &amp; VRS work, you can check out **[Purple Communications](http://purple.us/)** or **[Sorenson Communication](http://www.sorenson.com/)**, which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida (with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA, I believe).

* **TTY/TDD &amp; Text Relay Services-**  Just to avoid confusion: TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context, but have two different names for the same device.  Some people know it better by one name over the other, so I included both, though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out.  Moving on, it's been pointed out that **[TTYs/TDDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_devices_for_the_deaf)** are an ""outdated technology.""  For the most part, this is true.  A D/HH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other D/HH friends/family members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place.  However, not all D/HH people know sign language.  As such, these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls.  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls, they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the D/HH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that D/HH person.  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the D/HH person as if they were speaking to that person directly.  So, it’s the same idea as calling 911 on a VRS call, but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign.

* **Captioned Telephones-** If you still use a landline telephone, you can use a **[CapTel](http://captel.com/)** phone, which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss (usually a Hard-of-Hearing person and not a Deaf person).  Basically, you’ll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed.  Using speech recognition software, everything being spoken by the person you’re calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone (similar to subtitles on a TV) with the silent operator’s ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software.  Recently, Sprint created a **[CapTel mobile app](http://www.sprintcaptel.com/wireless-captel-sprint)** so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline.  Same principle as using the Text/Video Relay Services, but you won’t have an operator talking for you.  You’ll be talking for yourself, so less delay in 911 calls.

* **Text Messages -** This is still in the works.  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to 911 because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if you’re a victim of attack and trying to hide (e.g., school shootings, muggings, home robberies, rape, etc.), so this is extremely beneficial not only to D/HH, but also to hearing people as well.  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how **[Text-to-911](http://www.fcc.gov/text-to-911)** is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up &amp; running.  However, as /u/MastersInDisasters points out: SMS, as it is defined now, is NOT a reliable protocol. If possible, use voice 911.

I hope this information helps!

**TL;DR -** We have several options: Videophones, TTY/TDDs, Captioned Telephones, and Text Messages (limited locations only for texts but slowly expanding).

Please use voice calls."" I still speak perfectly, but I was in a situation where speaking would get me killed. Same with them seeing my phone.

The Xbox and the PS4 have virtually the same CPU(an 8 core AMD Jaguar), except the the Xbox is clocked slightly higher, 1.6GHZ vs 1.75 GHZ for the PS4. 


However the games on the Xbox will only have access to six cores, 90% of the GPU, and 5gb of memory(out of 8). I suspect that the PS4 has  some limitations like these as well, but I can't find any info on that. The PS4 doesn't have stuff like the Kinect though, so the limitations may be less.


Games are rarely CPU bound though. The GPU tends to have a hugely greater impact on performance for. According to RPS, 4 Jaguar cores have less then a quarter of the performance of a i5-3570K. This means that my fairly lowly i5-2320 destroys the CPU of a PS4 or Xbox. WTF? I don't even have a gaming computer.



As for the GPU, the PS4 has 0.52 more teraflops then the xbox. The PS4 also has some other advantages like more ROPs and stream processors. However the Xbox is clocked a little higher. I think it is pretty safe to say based on this alone that the PS4 has a fair bit more horsepower then the xbox. Check this out if you want to here more about those stream processors and ROPs. http://www.ign.com/blogs/finalverdict/2013/10/26/xbox-one-vs-playstation-4-hardware-and-specifications/


COD Ghosts also runs at 720p on the Xbox, as compared to 1080p on the PS4.


The PS4's standard memory is wayyyyyyyyyyyy better then the Xbox's. The catch is that the Xbox also has 32 MB of ESRAM. This is the part I'm not sure about. Sorry. I'd have to assume it makes them pretty much equal, except the ESRAM might be harder to utilize.

The Xbox supposedly has a better audio processor, taking a load off the CPU. Little bit of difference. 


Overall I think the PS4 wins.

Good job on letting the media get to you, OP. Let's debunk this right away, shall we?

There are 4,156 Walmarts in USA. Let's be conservative and say that only 4,000 of them do black friday.

According to [this](http://blackfridaydeathcount.com), there have only been 4 deaths and 75 injuries since black friday started in 2006, 7 years ago. 2 of those deaths were due to a shooting, not technically black friday's fault.

So we have 2 deaths and 75 injuries over 7 years of black fridays. That's .29 deaths a year and 10.7 injuries a year. Spread out among the 4000 walmarts, that's 0.0000725 deaths per walmart a year and 0.002675 injuries per walmart a year.

doctorrobotica,"Because corporate profit is more important than civilization.   This is an unfortunate game theory problem that motivates these companies:  Their primary goal is to generate the most revenue.  And this is not *new* revenue in the sense of companies that produce new products or services, but revenue from the same fixed pie (WalMart, etc are all fighting for the same consumer for the same product.)   If everyone opened at the same time on Friday, the total amount sold would be equivalent. However by opening one hour before your competitor, you get some of his slice of the pie.  And so on, until suddenly we don't enjoy Thanksgiving at all and minimum wage staff is made to suffer so the WalMart heirs can by another yacht.

Another area this same problem arises is the minimum wage:  Almost all serious economists agree that if companies suddenly increased wages (disproportionally at the bottom) - say, raising the minimum to $12/hr - it would greatly benefit the economy.  But if your competitor doesn't do it and you do, it hurts you in the short term (and possibly you go under) because your employees make more, but don't necessarily spend it at your store.

warriorsatthedisco,"They learn to understand what the word means. I'm no expert(I'm not deaf) but it's similar to how people speed-read. The reason why you can't just a pick up a book and speed read it is because most people are taught to read with phonetics(telling people that the letters ""c-a-t"" mean ""cat""(they would speak the word cat aloud so that the child would understand)). Since you learn to read with phonetics, basically you're teaching the person to read the words, and ""translate"" them into spoken language in your mind. Then your mind deciphers the spoken word. I think this is why kids usually have to read aloud before they can read in their head.

Because we learn to read phonetically, the fastest we can read is about the fastest we can speak. What speed readers do is ""silence"" the voice inside their head. They learn to associate the word itself(not the sound of the word when spoken aloud) with it's meaning.

People who can't read think like this: They see the word ""cat"" on paper. They say the word ""cat"" in their head afterwords. After hearing the word cat, they visualize/understand a cat. Obviously this all happens so quick that you think of it as instantaneous. A speed reader skips the second step where they say the word aloud in their head, thus reducing comprehension time.

t0mbstone,"Basically, due to its shape, it's easier for a boat to move forwards in the water than for it to move sideways.

This means that if you point the boat into the wind, but at an angle, the wind ends up blowing the boat sideways. The boat doesn't want to move sideways, though, so it ends up sliding both sideways and towards the angle it's pointed at.

This enables you to move forwards (and sideways) across the wind. By changing your angle to the opposite direction every so often, you can essentially zig-zag your way towards a destination, even if it's up-wind.

beerMonger11,"No sailboat can sail directly into the wind. But most modern boats can sail at about a 45 degree angle into the wind. 

Essentially sailboats have 2 wings on them. One in the air and one in the water (the centerboard or keel). Both of them are very important to making the boat move upwind. The sail itself uses lift from the wind going around the sail, to pull itself up. Think about blowing over a piece of paper. The paper will move upwards towards the moving air. This is basically how the sail works.

The other wing, the keel or centerboard, does the same thing, only at a 90 degree angle to the force of the sail. You get an apparent motion in line with the length of the boat. 

You mentioned the boats in AC4. Those are mostly the square sailed kind, which basically only went downwind, and used different trade winds to get where they wanted to go.

plasticluthier,"I'll explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about 12;

Three sets of forces are happening while you're sailing a boat. 

* 1. You have the wind pushing on the sail.
* 2. You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind.
* 3. The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shape.

Now, when you're sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry. If you squeeze directly from the sides, the cherry stone wont go anywhere, but if you squeeze from the back, the stone will come out of the front. It's the same with sailing, the wind pushes on the sails, the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards. Now, you can't sail straight into the wind, the forces wouldn't balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise, backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too. So, to balance all the forces, you zig-zag into the wind, turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn. This is called tacking. 

Now, sails are tight in when you're going into the wind, completely out when you're going away from the wind and pulled in until they stop flapping at all other points. generally, the position of the centreboard matches the position of the sails. 

If you need to know any more, I'd suggest going sailing. I have no idea what AC4 is. ",null,3,cdpj6al,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

Congratulations! You're using a lot more of your lungs than you used to. While you're running, you're building up an oxygen debt as your muscles start to use more and more oxygen than you've asked them to in the past, and your lungs are struggling to keep up. As a result, you start really expanding your chest muscles -- does this sound familiar? This can be where side stitches come from. 

However, your lungs are really only used to taking in so much oxygen. Chances are when you're just sitting around during the day, or walking places, you only take very shallow breaths. The alveoli at the bottom of your lungs don't see much action and they get lazy, but when you start taking deep, heaving breaths you start to use them -- and they don't like that very much. 

This can happen regardless of whether it's cold or warm outside, and regardless of whether you're breathing in through your mouth and out through your nose or what have you (and for the record, I'm pretty sure you can breath through whichever orifices you choose [er, within reason] and breath out through whichever orifices you choose [again, choose wisely] as long as you're getting enough breath. Some people recommend breathing through both your nose and your mouth!)

In either case, it really just means that you're helping your lungs gain capacity. I would suggest looking up some breathing exercises online, being really conscious of how deeply you breathe during your day, and most importantly, keep running. :)

**I thought you were referring to a burning sensation in your legs before you tire. Oops.**



I'm not an expert, but I think you're referring to the effects of the build up of lactic acid.

As I understand it, when your body can't deliver enough oxygen to your muscles, it temporarily forms ""lactate"" which helps break down glucose and give you energy. 

However, one of the downfalls of this process is that you'll eventually experience increased acidity levels in your muscle cells (hence, lactic acid). Now, the whole process doesn't work very well in acidic environments, so the whole process is hindered and this is where you'll tend to get that muscle fatigue feeling. This is all done as a natural mechanism to prevent muscle damage caused by over-exertion. 

Once your body slows down, oxygen becomes more available and the whole system sort of reverses itself and everything is back to normal.

TL;DR: When oxygen is limited, your body resorts to other means that provide a temporary fix, but this process naturally halts and reverses itself before the quick fix causes any permanent damage.

sir_sri,"&gt; Why can't they just SAY ""Check system time""?

Because the line of code that failed doesn't know that the problem is that your system time is wrong.  When you do a search for error codes or when you go look at the MS knowledge base you're looking at common causes for an error.

But when you write code you have something like this

If some condition is true (do whatever is supposed to happen).

If not, throw off an error code that indicated this condition failed.  

The solution to the problem is to figure out what caused the condition to be wrong in the first place, but then, maybe it's *supposed* to be wrong some of the time.  


Software is a series of complex interlocking systems, particularly operating systems where you have thousands of programmers who have worked for years.  The guy doing a software update is checking to see if time time is valid, the guy who wrote the clock software 5 years ago did so with whatever his assumptions were (that time servers would be accessible for example).  

Enter you trying to update.  The programmer who wrote the update only knows how to check that the time is valid or not, he has no way to peak into the time keeping code to know that the problem was some time sync failed, and that caused his time to be wrong.  He just knows the time is wrong, and there are a lot of potential reasons for that.

The simplest strategy is just to output that the time is wrong, then exit gracefully instead of just crashing.

The real problems starts when you try to determine why is the time wrong at that place. Is it because of a timing issue earlier on? Or the user changed the date settings during the update? To check if the user changed the date settings, you have to write tons of code, many hundreds of lines which can (will) in turn, produce more bugs.

In addition, from a software development perspective, writing a detailed explanation for the cause of the error takes lots of time. Normally, a placemarker is left in the code where the error message will go, so that they can put an error message in just before the software is released. If the code is changed before the release, then the text of the error message has to be changed too. Giving the messages an error number ends up saving time and reduces the possibility that someone will forget to change the error description.

computervirologist,"Computer viruses fall under the category of malware, or malicious software. Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware, a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs. 

A computer virus is usually an executable file that, when executed, will usually perform the following tasks: 

* search for other files on the computer
* if the file is a program, copy the virus's code to that program
* execute a payload (which may or may not be destructive)

Once a program gets a virus's code injected into it, it becomes an infected program. An infected program, when executed, will run the virus code first before running the original code of the program.

Since viruses only infect files when they're executed, they rely on user interaction in order to spread. Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus, any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now. Keep in mind though, that unless the virus has elevated privileges, it can only infect programs that the current user has write-access to. 

An anti-virus virus is a program that spreads like a virus, but when it's code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it. Think of it like a chain: virus, anti-virus virus, original program. First the virus code will run, then the anti-virus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it, then the original program will run. Anti-virus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used. 

Besides viruses, there are also computer trojans, spyware, ransomware, backdoors, worms, and fork bombs.

Trojans are rogue programs, they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else. For example, many trojan programs ironically claim to be anti-virus software, but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malware.

Spyware is any program that collects users' personal data without their knowledge and consent. Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user. In fact, many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature. 

ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom. Cryptolocker, for example, will encrypt the user's files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files. The password for decryption is stored on the hacker's computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up. 

backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker. Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet. A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person, usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down. 

A worm is an autonomous computer virus. Unlike computer viruses, worms do not require human interaction in order to spread. Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading. When a worm is running on a computer, it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as it's host. It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers. Once it finds a host with vulnerable software, the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer. 

Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship. Multiple viruses may infect a worm, allowing the viruses to be transported across networks. Once the worm reaches a destination, the viruses copy themselves to that machine too. You can think of the viruses as piggy-back riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate. Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated worm.

Finally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb. Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources. The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive, requiring a hard reboot. If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads, the computer will crash every time it is turned on. The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up, is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system.

diMario,"Quantum mechanics, or more broadly quantum physics, studies matter on the level of elementary particles. It turns out that strange things happen when you dig down to a smaller and smaller scale of things.

For instance, electric things. In everyday life you can have a light bulb rating 60 Watt, 40 Watt, 25 Watt and so on. If Philips were so inclined, they could easily make a light bulb rating 41.5 watt or 7.89 Watt. In every day life, things happen on a sliding scale. A certain property can have a value of 1, or a value of 2, or any other value in between 1 and 2.

Not so in quantum physics. When you look at things in a smaller and smaller scale, the properties that you measure take on distinct values. For electric current for instance, you can measure a flow of 1 unit of charge per second, or you can measure a flow of 2 units of charge per second, *but you cannot measure a unit of 1.5 charge per second*.

This is explained by theorizing that electric charge in everyday life is made up by the sum of a bunch of very small but distinct elementary electric charges of which you can have either 1, or 2, but not one and a half.

In order to describe this phenomenon, physicists say that electric charge is *quantized* (from which comes the ""quantum"" part of the name).

Now, as it turns out, not only electric charge but practically all properties of matter that you care to study exhibit this behaviour.

One of the (theoretical) consequences is that when speaking about properties on the quantum scale of things, you cannot deal in certainties but only in probabilities. When I perform a thousand measurements in a certain quantum physical experiment, I'll find that roughly 300 times the outcome is 5, and 700 times the outcome is 9. But when I perform a single measurement, I cannot predict whether the outcome is 5 or 9. Weird, isn't it?

Quantum physics solves this weirdness by assuming that before the measurement, the property I am about to measure is *5 and 9, both at the same time*. Only after I have measured it, the quantum system ""has decided"" whether it was 5 or 9.

This means that only *after* I observe a system, the system ""decides"" what value it will show me. Thus it is said that reality (the value of the property) is influenced by observation (the fact that I measure it).

Why would some particles bend more than others? This could be corrected for by assuming that these corpuscles speed up when passing through glass. Still, there are other phenomena that the particle theory does not describe, such as diffraction.

---

Eventually, physicists came to support a different theory of light. Instead of discrete particles, light was a wave. Not like a water wave though, this wave only moved tranversely, like [so](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Electromagneticwave3D.gif). This explained light much better than the particle theory. 

The most striking example is in diffraction. Imagine you have a solid sheet of metal with two slits cut in it, a sensor screen some ways behind it, and you shine a light onto this [contraption](http://www.empiricalzeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/double-slit-box1.jpg). If light were a particle, you should see two bars on the sensor, like [this](http://stephenwhitt.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/double-slit-bullets.jpg?w=490), because the particles go through and continue going straight. However, if light were a wave, the sensor would have [a more complicated pattern](http://grad.physics.sunysb.edu/~amarch/int.gif), because the waves [interfere with each other](http://www.atom.uni-frankfurt.de/research/synchrotron/photonmolecule/H2_double/3_double_slit/double-slit-plane-wave.gif). It turns out, when you do this experiment, that you get the interference pattern. Coupled with the fact that you can explain pretty much all properties of light, this theory is pretty convincing. So it's settled, light is a wave, right?

---

The challenge to this theory came from an unexpected direction. When you heat up an object, it emits light. And physicists had equations to predict how much light of a particular frequency. While these worked well for low frequencies, they predicted that objects emitted infinite energy in the higher ones. Clearly this is wrong. Planck showed that this problem does not occur if light comes in discrete quantities. Other properties, such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are also well described if light comes in lumps. So are we back to the particle theory again? If we are, how do we explain the double-slit experiment?

---

Let's go back to it again. If it is really a particle, then why does the interference pattern form? Say we place detectors at the slits. If light is a wave, then it'll trigger both. If it's a particle, it'll just trigger one. When we do this, we see that only one is triggered. So light is a particle! But when you check the screen, the interference pattern has disappeared, and two stripes show up instead! So we take away the detectors and try again. Now it reappears. If words don't cut it for you, watch [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Wave-particle_duality.ogv).

When we watch the slits, light behaves like particles. When we don't, it behaves like waves. How can we reconcile these two behaviors? The answer is: light behaves like some very unintuitive *thing*.

---

Quantum physics is the study of how on earth this works. This wave-particle duality only seems to show up for small objects (think on the scale of atoms). Some of the consequences of this include:

* Objects exist in a [superposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) of all possible states, weighted towards the more ""likely"" ones. Measuring the object collapses this superposition to a more defined state.
* The more [precisely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle) you measure the position of an object, the less you know about its momentum.
* Occasionally, objects can [tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling) across gaps or barriers that they otherwise could not cross.
* You can [entangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) two particles so that measuring one disturbs the other, regardless of how far apart they are.",null,0,cdpuf79,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2

The sympathetic nervous system when activated provides ""fight or flight"" stimuli, such as increased heart rate, constricting pupils etc.

The parasympathetic nervous system activates ""rest and digest"" stimuli such as decreased heart rate and increased digestion. Nicotine acts on nicotinic receptors present on neurons all over your body. The receptor carries out a parasympathetic tone.

I'm pretty sure that link is correct.(I'm on my phone) but the quick answer comes down to this. We don't know. Science is really only there to explain things. We can't know right now what came before the universe because we can't see anything but our universe. We have a working hypothesis of the start of the universe which was less a big ball of gas and more like a condensed point of space and time and stuff making material.

Piggles_Hunter,"I'm no physicist so bear with me. You need to remove the idea of a ball of gas exploding to fill the universe. It is the universe itself inflating, it isn't exploding into anything. It wasn't an explosion like you and I relate to. It's more like the rapid and massive expansion of pure energy, but there was no matter, no gas at all. It had to expand and cool a fair bit until the universe had cooled enough to allow for matter to come into existence from the converted energy. The first particles came about a few minutes after the initiation. Neutral stable atoms around 300,000 thousand of years later. 

No one really knows what came before and it is an area of intense research with a number of theories. Nothing in the existing universe can precede the Big Bang so the conditions that set it off are outside our experience, outside time and space. 

Some think that the universe began as a quantum fluctuation that was able to last long enough for the process of inflation start. Once that process began there was no way for the fluctuation to annihilate itself and you end up with this runaway inflation of the universe. This comes from the understanding that spacetime is in constant state of fluctuation. There are virtual particle appearing and disappearing all around us. Although it is specuated that the [Higgs Field](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_field) prevents this from reoccuring within our universe again. 

Another is where a pair of 5 dimensional [branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane) collide with each other and produce a massive amount of energy which creates the trigger of the Big Bang.

QuickSpore,"Hang with me, because things get pretty weird. The early universe was so radically different from the universe as we know it today, it is hard to wrap our brains around it.

The Bang Bang is when,among other things, time began. Asking what was ""before"" literally makes no sense in the context of the theory. It is like asking what is north of the North Pole.

It is also when matter came into being. So there was no ball of gas... there was no nothing. Even in the early universe there was no gas. Everything had so much energy even atoms couldn't form. The subatomic particles were whizzing about too fast to form larger particles.

And asking about a ""cause"" for the Big Bang is hard as well. As far as we know the universe is it. Maybe there is something more, but we can't sense or interact with it... because it would exist outside of the universe. We can make guesses about what it might be.

Scientists are not comfortable with this. They would love to know. But how do you examine ""before"" when there literally isn't a before.

redliness,"For most of history, colour has not been associated with a gender. In the 19th century, the reverse of the current situation became fashionable in Europe -- pink as a colour for boys, and blue for girls. Rumour was that this originated in using blue for blue-eyed babies or blond(e) babies and pink for brown-eyed or brown-haired, with girls being more likely to be blonde or blue-eyed -- but there's no way of knowing if that is the origin, or just what some magazines happened to advise.

This fashion spread up until around the mid-20th century. In 1948, Prince Charles was born. His nursery was decorated in pale blue, and he was seen wearing pale blue clothes. Magazines did colour-photograph features on the royal baby, and it was something of a sensation, like the royal wedding was recently (Charles being the future king, and all). It's often said that this was the event that made blue a fashionable colour for boys, as mothers around the UK started dressing and decorating like their Queen did, then catching on in other English-speaking countries.

There's no way to know if that's definitely true, because this isn't some iron law that was signed into effect on a given day, but it's *probably* true, or at least a major influence, because that is the time that pink and blue reversed their positions and became actual gender signifiers (prior to this, blue was generally associated with girls and pink with boys, but it wasn't taboo to wear the alternate colour and those colours weren't used to *represent* girls and boys).",null,15,cdpi8a6,1rpazv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,71

Women were seen as benevolent, calm and patient, which was associated with the color blue. Light blue was thus considered the appropriate color for girls, who were just small women.  

During the early 20th century women began to stand up against gender-discrimination in central Europe and started dressing their daughters in pink and rose as well.

Quick rundown:

1) If major arteries or connecting arterioles (Cerebral medial, posterior, anterior, basal or carotid) are hit, there is a high probability of death. If not, things get interesting:

2)If not, then its down to what brain matter is destroyed (And this is how researchers attributed function to area: 

Frontal lobe: Non life essential (See Patient Phineas Gage), destruction results in change of personality, executive function (higher moral, thought, rationalising and inhibition processes.

Temporal lobe ( lower side): Non life essential (See Patient: HM), destruction may result in loss of memory functions (hippocampus), loss or intensification of primal emotion (fear anger etc) (amygdala). 

If you drew a line from ear to ear along the top most point of your head, this is roughly (slightly more anteriorely) where the motoric and sensory cortex would be. Damage here results in loss of the ability to feel, or move.

Parietal lobe (top side): Non life essential, damage may lead to cognitive  changes, however its very possible that no obvious changes may be seen.

Occipital lobe (back of head): Non life essential, vision loss.

Deep brain (Di-encephalon, Mes encephalon etc.) and brainstem.
Traumatic damage here is almost certainly deadly. 

Most important life functions are breathing, arousal, and decending motoric tracts. 

3)
Lastly, infection is a major concern. High dose Antibiotic (probably broad spectrum) is necessary.

TLDR: 1) If you dont pop a major artery, 2) You can hit non life-essential brain matter and 3) Survive infection, you can survive a shot to the brain and not die.",null,9,cdpjjq5,1rpdhm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,83

YourDoubt,"Actually, the very 'front' is the most 'losable' part of brain tissue to keep you 'alive,' to say nothing of the Circle of Willis (which is more at the base of the 'front'). The Brainstem is typically where the respiratory and other vital maintenance areas are, if you take this out, you will definitely die. An interesting example of losing a large chunk of the Frontal lobe is [Phineas Gage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage). 

What is important to note is that the brain is incredibly vasculated, if you knock out a vessel (which is likely), you not only have to deal with the blood loss to vital regions of the brain, but the blood itself is incredibly neurotoxic, and before that, you have to deal with inter cranial pressure(of course if you have a bullet wound, you likely have a shunt already formed for the blood to come out.) Also, you have to understand that some bullets can create a shockwave of force that can travel through the body itself and cause damage in areas not local to wound itself. There is also the issue of the brain having a completely different immune system, so you may have to deal with an incredible infection.


So, to recap, if you survive the trauma of bloodloss, toxic damage from blood and intracrainial, avoid widespread tissue damage from the bullet traveling through the brain and bouncing around(this can happen with .22 caliber bullets, its a not uncommon method of execution in the underworld of our society), have ALL the bullet fragments miss your medulla you could survive.

redrew89,"I had a commuted fracture of the third metacarpal of my left hand back in April. In my experience, the point of the fracture is the origin point of the pain. (And boy, did it hurt like a bitch.) As mentioned by /u/_Momotsuki and others, the pain is actually caused by the nerve fiber that runs the length of the bone, carrying impulses to the muscles along said bone, and returning sensory information back to the brain. The bones themselves contains no nerves. (Aside from the spine, but that's different, as the spinal column isn't a single bone, but many discs stacked on one another, hollow on the inside so that the spinal nerve can be protected and flexibility is still possible.)

As far as anecdotal experience is concerned, you know for certain if you have a broken bone just by the pain alone. It starts as a very intense stabbing feeling at the point of the fracture. Inflammation occurs rapidly, resulting in swelling, and a throbbing ache as the surrounding tissue attempts to stabilize the bones. My hand injury had to be treated with an Open Reduction, Internal Fixation (ORIF) technique, where an orthopedic surgeon had to make an incision into the back of my hand, reduce the fracture so that the two bone fragments were aligned properly, then insert a steel pin inside the bone to keep the two pieces together while they healed.

yakusokuN8,"First of all, before answering any of the questions, let me emphasize that the things that non-Americans see are highly atypical and not representative of what happens everywhere.  There's 300 million or so of us, and if you see 300 people acting crazed, that's one person in a million.  You aren't seeing the vast majority of the other calmer, bored, tired shoppers who wait patiently in long lines in stores where nothing happens.  These things don't make the news.  

&gt;In such videos, people always seem to be grabbing items at random. Is this true? Or do they have specific items in mind?

In the videos you see, they probably aren't grabbing things randomly, but there's so many people, that it's hard to calmly make your way through the crowd and tapping someone on the shoulder and saying, ""pardon me, can you pass me one of those?""  They most likely have items in mind, but the craziest people seeking out the best deals are usually after expensive, large items, like television sets and it's difficult to just grab one of the shelf, tuck it under your arm and get out of the way.

&gt;If they're grabbing items at random (just because they're 'cheap'), what is the rationale behind that? Do people grab and buy lots of things they don't even actually want?

This sometimes happens, but it's far from the norm.

&gt;If people aren't grabbing items at random, do they decide before-hand? Do places like Walmart advertise, let's say, iPads as 20% off, and then the riots happen because everyone had a pre-meditated goal to grab that one particular item?

Oh God, does Walmart advertise.  I was over at my parent's place on Thanksgiving night and within one hour of watching a football game, I must have seen 6 Walmart ads, no exaggeration.  We get ads in the mail, ads in the newspaper, and ads on radio and television nonstop for days.  It's really impossible not to know that there are stores having deals on Friday.  As you've noted, yes, often stores like Walmart will feature one big item that's normally $400, marked down to $200 and a few people every year get zealous about being the person to get it, because quantities are usually limited - just enough to get people excited and in the store, but not always enough for everyone to buy it who wants it.

&gt; Why are sales such a big deal to begin with? Sure, I like to save money as much as the next guy. But mostly I can't be bothered going out of my way for the sake of a sale. I don't mind paying a bit more money for the sake of convenience - even though I only work part-time and have a low income.

I'm not justifying the kind of crazy behavior that makes the news in other parts of the world about us, but it's not just a little more, at least percentage.  Some items are marked down 50%, so if you don't get it now, you will be paying literally double if you go a week later.  In the case of the really expensive things, this can mean a few hundred dollars and for many who don't earn much, this may mean a lot of hours.  If you earn $10/hr, $200 off a tv is half a week's pay.

&gt;what makes Black Friday in the US so different to the equivalents in other countries? What inspires all the excitement?

Honestly, companies advertise for weeks, the media hypes it up to *create* a story, then *reports* a story, where it happens and makes it seem like it's a huge thing, and so what's normally less hectic than shopping on Christmas Eve has now become a major deal with huge crowds and chaos.

Don't think the U.S. is unique, though.  When H&amp;M stores were opening in Europe and other parts of the world, there were crowds lined up to the stores.  When big name movie stars show up at premieres in London and the like, fans line up for hours.  Fanaticism isn't localized to the U.S.",null,38,cdpj66t,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,274

She goes straight for one of the big sale items and grabs one, takes it to a random part of the store where there aren't very many people and leaves it on a shelf, then goes back to watch ""the feeding frenzy"" going on where the big sale items are displayed. I think she likes the feeling of being in on the secret that there is one of those items a few aisles over and no one knows it.

Cedosg,"Honestly, Black Friday has always been a joy for me...

We have one of the biggest walmart in the area and it is always well stocked if you come early that is.

Anyway, much of this has to do with timing and expectation. You are out with your family in the cold and just want a nice Christmas present for your loved ones, but when you get to the location, you see piles of people. This often results in a highly competitive instinct to get what you have came for.

What shows are people's expectation that they come away with something to show for it.

Last night, i did most of my shopping at boscov and jc Penney (had to get some dress clothes for myself and brother in law) and it was pretty hectic.

We then decided to head down to the walmart next to the mall, and we weren't able to get anything worth our trip. Thankfully we didn't have to travel a long way, but for families that want that special something, it is not unusual that they go crazy.

For your point about other countries, you haven't really been to Singapore during one of those computer expos or that great Singapore sale, have you? I have seen grandmas fighting over a silk blouse.. It is not an usual occurrence as you make it sound to be.

Get the price of popular items extremely low, have very limited quantities and advertise the heck out of it so that everyone knows about that Ipad that comes with a $100 dollars gift card or that $98 tv... and have a sufficiently large population in a small area.

Mdcastle,"Part of it is Friday is a holiday for most people that don't work in the service industries. All the people in suits that normally make news are at home, so it's a slow news day anyway, and since it's a holiday people start to go shopping for Christmas. The media and the retailers have hyped it up in recent years, with say $1000 flat screen TVs marked down to $499.99, as ""doorbusters"" They lose money, but not a lot as they only have 10 of them per store, so people line up the night before and camp out, and maybe 1,000 people mob the store when it opens hoping to get one, and when they don't they still buy other things. There's also a trend among stores to one-up each other by opening earlier than the competition, (you can probably only get to the doorbuster at the first store of the day), so stores are opening earlier and ealier, first early morning Friday, then midnight Friday, and now even Thanksgiving evening, which is creating more news stories about how service workers are getting shortchanged as far as spending time with their families, (Thanksgiving in the US is when everyone comes home to grandma's house to eat dinner).

We wake up at 3 am, grab hot chocolate and wait in the freezing weather outside the store. As soon as the doors are open, we bolt inside, rushing for the deals that we planned for and many other random bargains. By 7 am, we've hit all our stores and we grab breakfast at the pancake corral. Then, we come home for a nap, and later we consolidate everything we bought and sort out what we're going to return the next day. It's a fun tradition, but it's been ruined since stores started opening on thanksgiving day

From my experience,  people are rarely violent... I've never seen anything bad. That being said, there is a definite rush for the good deals. I remember one morning they opened up one door and people were filling in, but we were so far back that we wouldn't be able to snag one of the thirty $50 bluray players (back when they were never cheaper than $100). But then! A miracle! The other door opens and my sister and I rush through, sprint across the store, hurdling over decorations and into the pile of electronics on sale. That day, we ended up with three bluray players. My dad was proud.

We find that certain mental states, like anxiety, are correlated to different levels of GABA activity. More GABA, more inhibition, less anxiety (and also less physical coordination, etc). Other compounds that act on GABA receptors include the benzodiazepines, like Xanax, which are used to treat anxiety. The effects of alcohol on anxiety tend to come into perceivable effect at lower doses than those that affect physical coordination.

GreenTea-,"Basically, to make you perceive the sound as ""wider"" and more realistic.

Stereo sound attempts to recreate the experience of hearing a real band (or whatever) playing in the room with you--you hear with two ears, of course, and each of your ears picks up slightly different sounds because they are different distances from the source. So your left ear might hear a little more guitar while your right ear hears more keyboard.

Sound mixers try to reproduce that effect by making certain tracks louder in one stereo channel than the other, tricking your ears/brain into thinking you're hearing sounds coming from different directions, which makes the sound ""wider.""

Eventually people also began using stereo as an effect in itself, for example having certain sounds ""pan"" quickly from one side to another, which isn't particularly realistic, but sounds cool.

True, it would be easier to mix everything in mono, but when your equipment is working properly, stereo sounds better (to most people). :)",null,1,cdpk3nz,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7
Xelopheris,Not necessarily. If there are two similar sounds (like two guitars for instance) it might be better for one to be on the left and one to be on the right so that the sounds stay independent until your brain mashes them together.,null,2,cdpjze4,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7
systoll,"Essentially, Stereo sound [different sound for each ear] exists because we *can* distinguish which ear a sound is being played in -- and we use this information to determine where sounds are coming from. Putting everything through both earphones at the same level makes it sound like everything's in the same place, right in front of us. It's not *terrible*, but not ideal. By making different elements louder for one ear and softer in the other, producers can create the illusion of different instruments existing in different places around you. This sounds more realistic, and also makes it easier for you to distinguish and follow particular instruments. 

But others have explained this stuff. I'm here to demonstrate it. 

Most iPods have an accessibility setting to make both earphones play the same thing. On iOS, you can find it in Settings &gt;General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Mono Audio. Enable it with functional headphones, and you'll notice a substantial difference. It also serves as a 'fix' when one of your earphones breaks. Or, if you want to use it as intended, when you go deaf in one ear.

EDIT: Buuut... quick question. When you say you can only hear select layers of a song, does that include having the main vocals getting (mostly) stripped out of (most) songs?

danpaquette,"&gt; What happens after a company forgets to renew their domain name? 

Once the domain expires, it enters a renewal grace period of about 30 days where the original owner can reclaim it. Once that 30 days is up, it enters a ""redemption period"" where the domain is frozen for 30 more days and drops from the zone file. The original owner can reclaim or make changes to the domain, but the registrar fees at this point are often well into the hundreds of dollars (which is easily still worth it if the alternative is losing your business).

For about 5 to 10 days, it goes through deletion processing where it is dropped from the registry and is available to be registered by the general public.

Some registrars will retain their deleted domains to auction them off; whether they do it themselves or have an agreement with a third party auction house depends on the registrar.

More often than not, a domain that had an established website never makes it through deletion processing and is sold off for auction. Old domains that had measurable bodies of content, users, or search volume can be extremely valuable and can sell for many thousands of dollars.

When it's bought at auction, the new owner can use the domain as they see fit. The vast majority of auctioned domains end up in a portfolio of domains owned by a reseller; we call them a squatter. They often prompt the original domain owners, their competitors, and other interested parties to buy the domain well above cost. 

&gt; Can the person who bought it afterwards negotiate a huge price for the company to get it back?

This is legal as long as the domain isn't a registered trademark and they aren't trying to actively impersonate the original owners of the domain. If there are trademark or legal issues, there are avenues people can take to reclaim their domains; otherwise, they're out of luck and either have to pay the squatter's exorbitant fees or find another domain. I've had companies that drop their domains because no one was monitoring their registrar billing information that were squatted and reoffered to them for tens of thousands of dollars. 

The moral of the story is to always make sure your billing information is up-to-date, and set your domains to auto-renew.",null,15,cdpl9aq,1rpk3n,explainlikeimfive,top_week,107

so dgestion does take some effort on your bodies part, but the actual driving factor in the ""tired"" feeling after a large meal is insulin. When you eat startchy foods you are in effect pumping sugar in your veins. Your body releases insulin as a response. Insulin quickly removes sugar from your blood stream (by storing it as fat). It also puts your body into an anabolic state. Insulin basically is a hormone that is screaming at your body to grow and sleep. This is the ""sugar crash"" you see in little kids. It happens in adults too, and with complex carbs as well, not just simple ones.

you probably notice this is alot more prevelant after eating a big side of mashed potatoes then it is after you eat 2 lbs of chicken wings.

Verdandeify,"There's a really great book about this called Guns, Germs, and Steel that explains why some societies have gotten so much more progress than others.

A couple of things.

The ""northern half"" includes North America, which is one of the least advanced, historically. So saying that ""the northern half"" contains the most developed countries in the world is only partially true. If you take the United States, well, that's essentially a really large European colony, and can take advantage of Eurasia's natural advantage.

So that leads to the question: Why did Eurasia have that kind of advantage, anyways? Why did Europe colonize the world instead of Africa or South America? It's a couple of things, actually: The east-west axis of Eurasia, the availability of domesticable animals, and the availability of good quality metal ores.

The Americas are primarily north-south in their orientation, and it's obvious that there are larger differences in latitude than longitude. You can bring that awesome wheat variety you've just domesticated eastward or westward, like what happened in Europe, but it's hard to move that wheat north or south, where it's colder or warmer, and where the weather is probably different.

Secondly, Europe and the Middle East have by far the most large animals available for domestication, and that's a huge deal. When you have a large animal working your fields, you are a lot more productive, and the more productive you are, the more people your land can sustain. Agricultural societies are always a lot more dense than non-agricultural societies, and more dense societies can sustain more non-productive citizens like philosophers, artists, kings, and soldiers. 

Domestic animals also increase your ability to travel, and the amount of luggage you can tow around. When you're limited to smallish loads carryable in a hand cart, you're not going to be able to realistically trade as much as you could if you had a horse-drawn cart, and you're not going to want to go as far. You're not going to be able to really use the massive power of the wheel, because you can't scale up as far as you can if you had an ox-sized being hauling stuff.

Lastly, the advantage of iron and bronze over stone and wood is self-evident. If you have bronze, you're going to beat your stone-equipped enemies and can access iron. If you can access iron, you're going to defeat your bronze-equipped enemies and can access steel, and so on.

Rodorador,"When you mean northern hemisphere I think you truly mean the US and the majority of European nations. Many vast regions that are officially part of the northern hemisphere like Central America, Northern Africa and regions of Asia are actually considered ""third world,"" meaning really that they are underdeveloped by European/""first world"" standards. 

I am not sure why you would pose the question from a European standard, but I am going to hypothesize that it is because you were raised in a region of the world where folks are educated with European standards. 

Now, while the book guns germs and steel is definitely a fascinating account of why certain societies are more powerful than others or have the ability to conquer other societies does not answer the question of why such societies are justified in doing so. I will not get into this, since OPs question was not a moral question. The question was about why the ""north is more developed than the ""south.""

The main reason is the fact of colonialism. European powers like Holland, Spain and Portugal, upon coming into contact with the cultures that had been existing in what we call the ""Americas"" for thousands of years, decided that they would like to conquest the people and the land they used to to create a sustainable living environment for their civilizations. I am not sure how European powers decided to do this, but what resulted was a history of large scale exploitation, theft and enslavement and forced serfdom of entire civilizations. 

If you recall, during the renaissance era, when colonization was in its beginning stages, (Columbus had accidentally landed in America in 1492), gold and silver were measures of a countries wealth and used to trade goods. You can read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations for more info.  

Present day Bolivia and Peru as well as Mexico were excavated by Spain until every ounce that could be found by contemporary technology (enslaved Indigenous miners) of gold, silver and precious metals was shipped to Europe. So much gold was found that European gold reserves quadrupled. 

Once Europe had effectively colonized and extracted the wealth of American civilizations, we move to a period of time called imperialism. This is a term meant to signify a process by which European nations set up government in other regions of the world to dominate and hold power over other people for the empire's benefit. In modern day, although former colonies like the majority of the African continent and all of the Americas were allowed to become independent sovereign states, we still see the legacy of colonization and imperialism continue to keep what we call ""third world"" countries from developing. Structures like the world bank's structural readjustment programs and the US agricultural subsidy prevent these countries from developing. 

The agriculture subsidy has put out so many country's agriculture sector out of business, even though they would have a comparative advantage (ie make crops for cheaper than the us).

Structural readjustment loans from the world bank and IMF give loans to ""third world"" countries, but force them to run their fiscal policy in such a way to force the countries to overdevelop their raw goods sector. This is bad because these nations don't have the funds to develop processed goods like computers or other non-raw resources or technological processes, or their human capital.  What ends up happening and is happening, is that southern countries are still in debt, and the loan programs are not enabling the countries to get out of debt, but keeping them in the cycle of debt. Thus is the legacy of societies who felt justified in conquering other societies.

Doubtless, there are a million things that were different between englanders and the rest of the world. Empirically, we can't tell what factor(s) accounted for the change. That's because empirical work deals with correlation, not causation - but that topic is for another day.

So sticking to theory, what could cause a culture to pursue a better living standard? I can think of only two things: the desire by millions of individuals to make a better material life for themselves and the expectation that they will be able to keep their improvements. For the progress to affect everyone, they all need to be working in mutually beneficial ways. 

Essentially, England had a society that can best be described as capitalist. Its culture embraced the belief that it is morally good to want a better material world, as well as the belief that it is morally appropriate to pursue that better world on a personal level - as long as no one else is hurt by the pursuit. 

And this is just me guessing, but I would say that the other Western European countries had near enough cultures that they could incorporate the progress England started. Unfortunately for parts of the world, personal property isn't respected (certain types of property are stolen or legally prohibited), or there doesn't exist a belief that it is okay to pursue a better material living standard.

SecureThruObscure,"Depends. 

Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation. 

The reason is pretty straightforward. Your blood (and veins) act like a radiator system. They're brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area, and then sent off to a different part of the body. 

Is it's cold out, your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities.  It then radiates (transmits) that heat to the fingers, toes, etc. 

Typically, they lose heat (especially in cold weather).  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without. 


It's worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia (less blood gets to the skin/fingers, less heat gets lost), and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals.

Shmalpin,"Your extremities are naturally the coldest parts of your body (this is why gout crystals most commonly form in the big toe).  They are the farthest away from the heated core of the body, so it follows that they are more susceptible to the cold than your head, abdomen, chest, etc.  In the cold, the body attempts to generate heat in the extremities - this manifests as shivering.  If cold in the extremities persists, the body shunts blood away from the arms and legs to preserve a warm, functional core temperature.  
  
If someone genuinely has ""bad circulation"" or a pathological reason that their extremities are very cold-sensitive (and not an offhand, self-made diagnosis) then it would be due to a lack of blood reaching the extremities.  Individuals with autoimmune disorders (like Lupus), Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Vasculitis generally suffer from some sort of peripheral blood vessel damage.  This damage leads to less core-warmed blood reaching the extremities.  When less blood is getting to your arms and legs, they naturally become closer to the temperature of their environment.  Diabetes and Hypertension are becoming increasingly prevalent, but autoimmune disorders and vasculitis are extremely rare.

So, if the doctor subjectively perceives that you've gotten better faster or more effectively than you'd have done otherwise, that's part of it. If your own subjective opinion as the patient does the same thing, that's also part of it. 

There are a million factors that can influence this, from such purely subjective factors as cited above, to random remissions due to causes that are never determined, to other medications the patient never informs the physician about, to various cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, etc, etc, etc.  The important point here is that if you sum up everything that can appear to affect the outcome other than efficacy of the intervention itself, you get the placebo effect. 

Now, it's also important to note what the placebo effect **is not**. It isn't a special mind over matter ability, or at least there's no particularly strong reason to think so.  Placebo tends to affect most strongly those conditions that have a strong subjective component, such as pain.

If you have taken a drug that slows down the heart, this can counteract the effect. If your heart has stopped beating; aside from CPR we give epinephrine every few minutes until your heart starts pumping on its own or you die.

HoverboardViking,"Well, I think the best way of explaining it is, you know how your 3rd grade teacher was really nice and you never got in trouble, even though you were always causing problems?

That all sort of changed with your 4th grade teacher, didn't it? Nobody messed with him or tried to test him. They respected him a lot more.

The 39th president of the U.S.A was Jimmy Carter, although not a terrible president, people even today look at him as soft. He did some good things, but the country was just coming out of a terrible period of war; the cold war was still chilling around and Stagflation was casting freeze trap everwhere-- where, how should I say it, the cost of everything was going up, but at the same time, the economy was slowing down.

There was a feeling like the U.S.A was losing control and Reagan came in and even though all he had to do was smile, he gave people the feeling that things would change.

I'm not sure if you ever heard the term 'Reaganomics' but Reagan cut taxes, removed barriers in production, and provided benefits and tax breaks to upper level income people in the country.

Did it work? Well, it doesn't really matter. Some people will say yes, others will say he indebted the country further to make some citizens richer.

He was looked at like a hero by lots of people in the country. Now, with all that said, let's get at your question.

Reagan was a 'tough' guy. The cold war was going on between the U.S.A and Russia and where Jimmy Carter took a more peaceful course, Reagan went Super Saiyan 3. He stockpiled more weapons and in the end, he won.

""Take down this wall."" More importantly he won peacefully. He ended the cold war. Did he really? Hard to say. But that's how people saw it.

So, in short, Reagan was a famous movie star, an old guy who comes in and 'saves' the country from our economic problems, ends the cold war, put us back on a traditional path, like when grandpa comes over smoking his pipe and saying how he fought in ww2, complaining that mommy doesn't use enough butter in her mashed potatoes.

Everyone boosted him up so high, a small thing like the Iran-Contra couldn't change how people saw him. He'd have to lvl Charizard to 100 and then just let it go, or, I don't know, buy an X-BOX one and PS4 and then give them to the girl down the block, something really terrible for anything to change.

It also helps that conservatives and republicans have referenced how 'good' was, non stop for the last 24-25 years.

mookie88,"Ok let me try to give you the perspective that me and my friends have as 20 year old college students who talk about politics regularly and Reagan frequently comes up. All of us, even the Democrats, agree that our parents have a kind of blind admiration for Reagan as they can't really give us a reason for viewing him as a great president, but here's what we think. The combination of new technology being integrated into the stock market, massive outsourcing, looser economic restrictions, and crack downs on unions gave the middle class much stronger buying power (for the time, at least) but actually ended up levying almost irreparable damage on America's social mobility. He also had little care for political correctness and used terms like ""welfare queens"" and engrained in people the incorrect fact the welfare was being abused by those on it, basically perpetuating a kind of de facto racism that persists to this day, and it should be obvious how this was appealing to Whites from all social classes. Also his ""Trickle-down"" economics, which in theory sounds really appealing but fails to account for the natural greed and self servitude that permeates among all humans, but because of economic success due to other factors it appeared to work (due to failures in modern day Canada, Bush 1, and Bush 2, it's clear Trickle-down doesn't work as well as thought). Anyway he empowered the middle class and there was even a mild recession towards the end of his second term which people didn't attribute to him but instead blamed on ""new technology"", because of his cult of personality. So basically he was loved because he built an aura of invincibility and growth which was powered by short term fixes to our problems (which are even today causing us problems i.e. outsourcing) and the fact that he had a massive cult of personality populated by young middle class kids coming out of college who were allowed massive spending power due to the cheapening of goods and the influx of jobs because of the growth technology (which had little if anything to do with Reagan) and military spending.

Drew2248,"You say that Reagan is ""held to be one of the best US presidents,"" but who believes this?  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagan's accomplishments.  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans.  In any case, even if he were ""held"" to be an amazing president, the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had. 

JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president.  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the 1950s while being, himself, young and vigorous, having an attractive wife and young children (the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelt's and that had been nearly 60 years before JFK), and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights, the Peace Corps, nuclear disarmament, and so forth.  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful, attractive, witty, and energetic.  But, Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president. No civil rights laws and so forth.  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in people's memories.  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish.  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process, in a way. 

Reagan's reputation developed somewhat similarly, though not quite in the same way as Kennedy's.  After all, Reagan did not die in office, but he was very good on TV, witty, pleasant, easygoing like JFK, and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him. So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had.  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits, and Reagan's children from his two marriages (he had been divorced and remarried) were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets.  But he was a nice guy, had a good sense of humor, and his appeal on TV always benefitted him.  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal, no matter what their abilities really are. And Reagan was not a bright man.  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm, that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with, and that America could do no harm.  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man, and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do.  

As for his actual policies as president, he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union. He had come, late in his presidency, to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing. But this was very much different from the rest of Reagan's foreign policy.   

Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive (as Kennedy's had been, as well, with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in 1962).  Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly.  He is often credited with ""defeating"" the Soviet Union, but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents' efforts as from Reagans, and it resulted at least as much from the USSR's own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures, arguably more from internal problems than from what the U.S. did.  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble.  But, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually ""fell"" during the presidency of Reagan's successor, G.H.W. Bush.  Maybe he should get all the credit?  Of course that would be silly, too, but crediting Reagan is just as illogical.  

What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy (like JFK) who made them feel good, that he stood up to the Soviets (but so had Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, and other presidents, often much more dramatically), and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the 1970s.  So, Americans felt better in the 1980s.  Was this Reagan's doing?  

Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending, and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy, and other factors.  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today -- he began the 30-year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others.  This legacy was one of Reagan's worst and we are still suffering because of it.  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the 1980s, and most Americans don't understand very well the economic changes of the last 30 years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the 1920s. This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations, shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top.  

Reagan was also very anti-union (his firing of air traffic controllers), accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor (whatever you might think of unions) in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time.  Reagan was also a strongly anti-environmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws.  On popular issues like these, Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy.  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president.  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS (those who got the disease were most often ""leftie"" homosexuals which Republicans did not care about) or to improve the medical system in any way.  In fact, Reagan's social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president.  

In short (?) our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians.  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre.  But neither is ranked among the top presidents. 

The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and, instead, they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people, was reviving the economy, was a patriot on foreign policy.  These claims are inaccurate, but the average American does not read much, I'm afraid, or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they ""feel"" about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing. And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan (he was reelected in 1984, of course) or buy most of the claims made in his favor, and in the last years of his presidency Reagan's popularity was dropping.  

This was partly due to his involvement in the Iran-Contra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagan's impeachment, but didn't. He somehow survived to the end of his term, and he got Alzheimer's fairly soon after leaving the White House, he was already very old, and people generally liked him, so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him.  The public simply choose not to care.  But the facts are there, nevertheless.  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past, had been divorced, and lied a little about his accomplishments, but was very charming and told good stories, so people liked him anyway. 

Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them.  Abraham Lincoln, often ranked as the best president today, was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good.  Popular views are shaped by emotion, sentiment, misunderstandings, a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues, and faulty memories.  Truman was widely disparaged as president, then there was a Truman Revival in the 1970s after we'd had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better, and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more.  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher, I think, due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were.  In any case, I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president.  It's the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy.  Heck, I liked him, but I hated his policies and still do. ",null,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4

I'm old enough to remember him, and what I remember is that he was kind of a doofus. A nice guy, well-meaning, but hardly the great hero he's made out to be. The depiction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU9lv_WqK6k) is, believe it or not, pretty much how a lot of us regarded him at the time. It probably seems very unlikely, since you've likely heard the more recent 'awesome' depictions of him. He was just a guy, and hardly a spectacular one. There were a *lot* of depictions about as flattering as this (and some much less so). There were also plenty of much more positive ones. He was not one-dimensional, after all, and he fairly won two terms, with good margins. He was controversial in many ways, but hardly despised. Even those of us who rejected many of his ideas and policies respected him, for the most part. If nothing else, he was likeable and personable, down to earth, and a terrific speaker. (Though many of us recognised that as the product of his earlier acting career and his years of corporate speakership; he was trained and highly practiced, but we did not confuse that with competence, high intelligence, or vision. We knew good acting when we saw it.)

I don't want to condemn him, but it bothers me a lot how modern conesrvatives regard him, because he was not very much like the way they paint him now. Reagan himself would be pretty disturbed at it, I think. He was conservative, but he was one of the last of the *paleo*conservatives, men of an earlier time who clearly remembered the prewar period and a different system of ways and values than we have now. By the standards of his time, he was more or less moderate, and was well liked by many liberals and conservatives alike. But by modern standards, he was more liberal than conservative, despite the very distorited image presented of him now. People can lie, but facts don't. Reagan favoured reasonable gun control, argued for union rights, holds the all-time presidential record for signing environmental regulation (much of which he personally championed), and was the first president to put up a gay couple at the White House, over the objections of many more conservative people.

I want to make it clear that he was not a cartoon. He was a real guy. But he was *just* a guy, neither villain or hero. It's weird and unsettling to me how people talk about him now.

VoreGidal,"The myth of Reagan as a great economic, free market messiah is conservative propaganda: http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/02/05/142288/reagan-centennial/

Some stand-out quotes:

2. Reagan nearly tripled the federal budget deficit. During the Reagan years, the debt increased to nearly $3 trillion, “roughly three times as much as the first 80 years of the century had done altogether.” Reagan enacted a major tax cut his first year in office and government revenue dropped off precipitously. Despite the conservative myth that tax cuts somehow increase revenue, the government went deeper into debt and Reagan had to raise taxes just a year after he enacted his tax cut. Despite ten more tax hikes on everything from gasoline to corporate income, Reagan was never able to get the deficit under control.

3. Unemployment soared after Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts. Unemployment jumped to 10.8 percent after Reagan enacted his much-touted tax cut, and it took years for the rate to get back down to its previous level. Meanwhile, income inequality exploded. Despite the myth that Reagan presided over an era of unmatched economic boom for all Americans, Reagan disproportionately taxed the poor and middle class, but the economic growth of the 1980′s did little help them. “Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled,” the New York Times’ David Leonhardt noted.

4. Reagan grew the size of the federal government tremendously. Reagan promised “to move boldly, decisively, and quickly to control the runaway growth of federal spending,” but federal spending “ballooned” under Reagan. He bailed out Social Security in 1983 after attempting to privatize it, and set up a progressive taxation system to keep it funded into the future. He promised to cut government agencies like the Department of Energy and Education but ended up adding one of the largest — the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which today has a budget of nearly $90 billion and close to 300,000 employees. He also hiked defense spending by over $100 billion a year to a level not seen since the height of the Vietnam war.",null,3,cdpzabn,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6

Its called ""myth making"".  Reagan's reputation is a cultivated myth, and does not stand up to serious examination.  Google ""the clothes have no emperor"" for the definitive book, written just have his terms ended.  This book consists only of quotes, where he over and over again shoots himself in the foot.

He started having alzheimer's symptoms early on, and slowly deteriorated.  He is credited with writing all these beautiful letters, but there was a ""Freudian Slip"" by Nancy Reagan when the letters book was published, where she used the word ""we"" when talking about their letter writing activity in the evenings.  She recovered quickly and changed that, but the slip is out there.

I'm pretty sure the letter writing was part of exercises where she tried valiantly to hold back his looming dementia.

It is actually Rock 'n Roll that brought down the Berlin Wall, ... read what the people in Russia have to say about how emboldened they were with the ideas of freedom conveyed in that music (especially the Beatles).

Reagan was governor of California, and ordered the CS gassing from overflying helicopters) of students on the campus at Berkeley in the

The night of first election, I saw live TV of him walking through back halls toward the ballroom to make his acceptance speech.

The really weird thing is that most of his actual economic policies (outside of the famous - ""read my lips, no more taxes"" - which he violated once elected) were right in line with modern democratic economic thinking.

SlothingOut,"So a unitary government is a government system where there is one central government with all residual power. There may be state/municipal governments, but in a unilateral state these have no constitutionally protected rights or powers. An example would be the former Soviet Union, don't be confused though, this system is not always communist, most monarchies would also fall into this category. Many small countries also tend to be unilateral as well.

 Federalist systems have at least two levels of government with constitutionally protected autonomy and have formally divided powers. An example would be Canada, or the USA.

Alternative systems are hard to find, most systems are usually one of the two, I can't think of any examples of other systems off the top of my head. Hypothetically speaking you could have a system where you only have provincial or state based governments all with equal powers, but I can't think of any practical examples of this.

Dr_Merkwurdigliebe,"(Thanks for asking a great ELI5 question. We need more of these around here.)

The difference lies in where power is (at least in theory) concentrated. 

In a unitary system, all power and legislative authority rest with the national government. This means that the national government is the only one allowed to make new laws, and that it makes laws for the entire country. The UK operates under a unitary system. A unitary system allows for broad application of national policies and standardizes government services across regions.

A federal system splits up power between the national government and regional governments. The US is an example of a federal system; the national government has the power to do certain things (like raise an army and regulate inter-state trade) and the states have the power to do other things (like run schools and build roads). This allows different states to pass different laws based on what works best for them. It also limits the power of the national government.

There is actually a third government type that goes along with federal and unitary systems: confederations. Confederations are on the opposite end of the spectrum from unitary governments. In a confederation, the nation is divided into regions or states like in a federation, however, rather than the regional and national governments being in a balance, the regional governments hold the vast majority of the power (the opposite of a unitary system). This means that most laws are tailored to local interests, which is good, however problems can arise when a confederacy needs to act together as a single nation, like in wartime, since the national government is too weak to act effectively.",null,0,cdpq1px,1rpza1,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1

marpiddycity,"When radioactive material decays it throws off different particles of varying size and amounts of energy. When those particles collide with your particles their energy is transferred to yours. Think of hitting a pool ball with the  cue ball.  

The radioactive particles are of such a high amount of energy that after they ""ping"" into one of your particles they'll keep bouncing around. And each particle it interacts with is going to bounce around transferring kinetic energy to more and more particles.
The more energy a particle has the higher degree of temperature.  So if you are exposed to too much radiation you will cook yourself.  Sun burn is a result of too much ultraviolet radiation, for example, while the microwave radiation that cooks your hot pockets is a different type.

The average person is exposed to about 300 mRem of radiation per year. More so if you smoke, eat a lot of bananas, drink a lot of milk or dwell in a basement.

Alpha particles are, comparatively, very big and therefore very slow moving. They are stopped by your layer of dead skin. However, if you were to ingest them they can do terrible damage... y'know, because your intestines are inside you. Beta particles are stopped by your clothing, they have a little more energy than alphas but, again, being exposed internally is a bigger worry.
Neutron and gamma radiation involve much faster, smaller particles.

With getting cooked eventually happening if you are exposed to very high amounts of radiation, you also have the possibility of slower damage from radiation resulting. A cell will form more copies of itself. So if a cell is ""pinged"" too many times the cell produces faulty copies of itself, and then those cells go on to form faulty copies of itself, etc. Or perhaps the cell is too damaged to produce daughter cells and the cell simply dies off.  Over time this results in damage (this is what happens to people who tan too much and look wrinkly and withered). 

However, getting dosed with a small amount over time means that while you might sustain cell damage it won't be to the extent that your cells reproduce damaged daughter cells; which is why after a few days or weeks your sunburn goes away because your damaged cells went on to produce new healthy cells. Which is why that 300 mRem/ year isn't a bad thing.

In summary: radioactive particles are high in energy, which equates to higher temperature. Therefore the more particles you are bombarded with the more your own cells/ organic matter are going to either die, become damaged, or cook.

ixian_probe,"There are two types of radiation explosure, acute (all happens at once) or chronic (slowly over a long time). In the case of Elysium, Max (Matt Daymond) is exposed to a lethal medium level dose of radiation. It is important to understand that people do not  become more radioactive when exposed to radiation. Instead, their bodies are damaged by the radiation in ways that are bad for their health. 
There is also another confusing expression you need to understand. Often acute radiation exposure is called radiation poisoning, even though it is actually not a poisoning at all! 

The reason it is called radiation poisoning is because the damage that happens to the body resembles very much what happens when people are poisoned. If they are exposed to a very high dose of radiation they start vomit and bleed from their lungs, stomach and such within a few hours. This happens because the radiation kills so many cells inside their bodies that the body start to leak so badly that the body can't ""patch the holes"" fast enough to keep itself alive. 

For a medium (but still lethal) radiation dose the damage is still very serious but people will live for a few days before the effects occur. Inside the body you have particular areas such as the bone marrow where new red blood cells and the white immune cells are made. As long as your bone marrow can produce new cells, the red blood cells will transport oxygen inside your body and the white immune cells will attack bacterias and other harmful invaders of the body. Unfortunately, the bone marrow is very sensitive to radioactive radiation and can be seriously damaged by radiation long before the rest of the body becomes badly damages. After a few days the body will run out of white and red blood cells and people start to die from either an infection or because they can't get enough oxygen to keep the body alive.

Lastly, cancer becomes the main cause of death only after someone survives a medium level radiation exposure or if they were exposed to a low level acute/ chronic(long term) radiation.

When it is ""activated"" by being treated with oxygen the surface of the carbon many of the neutral sites and some of the sites of positive charge are changed so they now have negative charges. This leaves the surface of the charcoal with regions of neutral, positive, and negative charge. In practice this means that just about any material suspended or dissolved in a fluid can find a location of attraction on the carbon which it sticks to, removing it from the liquid.

It can then simply be allowed to settle out of or float to the top of the liquid (depending on the density of the carbon used) as it will have a different density than the water.

AtomicSans,"The main difference is processing power.

An animated movie, a Pixar movie for example, is pre-rendered on massive arrays of computers called render farms. The calculations needed take large amounts of time to finish, and if I remember correctly, a ten-second scene of an animated movie takes somewhere close to half an hour to fully render. This explains why special effects look so good. However, after the movie is rendered, it is turned into a video file, which is simply a series of still pictures played rapidly so that it appears to move (Oversimplified. If you want to know how video compression works, there's lots of explanations out there for you to look at.) Playing this video isn't hard to do, which is why a DVD or Blu-Ray player, which isn't very computationally powerful, is able to play such good-looking movies.

Games are quite different. Instead of being rendered already for you, your console/PC has to perform all the texture, lighting, polygon, shader, etc. calculations and rendering on its own. Also, unlike movie render farms, these calculations have to be done near-instantaneously to keep up with your controller/mouse and keyboard inputs. To account for this, game developers are forced to make game elements easy and fast to calculate.

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_and_celebrities),...

&gt; Recruiting Scientologist celebrities and getting them to endorse Scientology to the public at large has always been very important to the Church of Scientology. Scientology has had a written program governing celebrity recruitment since at least 1955, when L. Ron Hubbard created ""Project Celebrity"", offering rewards to Scientologists who recruited targeted celebrities.

&gt; The Church of Scientology operates special Celebrity Centres. Scientology policy governs the Celebrity Centres (the main one in Los Angeles and others in Paris, Nashville, and elsewhere), stating that ""one of the major purposes of the Celebrity Centre and its staff is to expand the number of celebrities in Scientology."" (Scientology Flag Order 2310) Another order describes Celebrity Centre's Public Clearing Division and its goal, ""broad public into Scientology from celebrity dissemination""; this division has departments for planning celebrity events and routing the general public onto Scientology services as a result of celebrity involvement.

&gt; As founder L. Ron Hubbard put it: ""Celebrities are very Special people and have a very distinct line of dissemination.

misanthrope82,"Guns are classified according to their action and their caliber.  The types of action for long guns (carbines, rifles and shotguns) are Pump, Lever, Semi-automatic, break barrel, Bolt action, Revolver, and automatic.  Pump guns require the operator to pull the fore end grip back then push it forward to chamber the next round.  Lever is where the operator has to pull a lever down then back up to chamber the next round.  Revolver (very few long guns use this) is a cylinder that holds generally 5 rounds that rotates every time the trigger is pulled, and can be fired either single or double action (cocked or un-cocked).  Break barrel is usually a single or double shot gun (rarely triple) that requires the user to open a hinge that exposes the spent shells to be replaced with new rounds.  Semi-automatic is a gun that has either a magazine or an internal magazine that fires every time the trigger is pulled until it is out of ammunition, fully automatic is the same except it fires in either burst or full auto as long as the trigger is depressed.  Bolt action has a magazine (detachable or internal) that every time it is fired the user has to unlock the bolt, pull it back to eject a shell then push forward to chamber a new round.

For Pistols, the same rules apply, they just have no stock to shoulder, and they have shorter barrels.  All of the same actions apply (I can't think of any pump, lever or bolt action ones but that does not mean they do not exist).

There are also black powder/muzzleloaders.  These are single shot guns that do not use a cartridge, are loaded from the firing end and require an external ignition source, like a percussion cap or a flint striker.  

Now to the numbers.  These indicate the caliber of the firearms.  Caliber is the diameter of the projectile in inches.  .22 is 0.22 inch diameter bullet.  .223 is a 0.223 inch bullet (5.56 mm).  The confusing part comes with the types of ammunition.  There are a bunch of different .45s.  There is .45 ACP, which is used in semi-automatic .45s and a very few .45 revolvers.  There is .45 long colt, used in revolvers.  There is .45 Heavy, or Buffalo, used in revolvers.  There is 45-70Government, used in big rifles and gatling guns.  then there is the big guy, the .454 Casul.  It is basically the magnum .45, only to be used in revolvers specifically marked for its use.  a lot of calibers are like this, so if you are buying ammunition for a gun for the first time, do not assume just because it says .357 that it will shoot in a .357 revolver.

monkeiboi,"A handgun is a firearm that typically wielded and fired by ""one hand"", although this is not technically accurate, the general concept is that the weapon is designed to be gripped by one hand. A revolver, as mentioned below, is a handgun in which the cartridges or shot is carried in a cylindrical ""wheel"" that rotates either by manual manipulation( single action) or by action of pulling the trigger (double action) and moves the next round into position to be fired. The other type of handgun is referred to as an ""automatic"" or ""semi-automatic"" handgun. (With semi-automatic being the more accurate term). In this design the weapon functions by automatically cycling the next cartridge into the chamber by using the force of expelled gases to eject a spent casing and load a fresh one, typically from a spring loaded magazine. Most of these fire one round per pull of the trigger (hence SEMI-automatic). Handguns that fire multiple rounds with each pull of the trigger are generally referred to as machine pistols. Handguns fire ""pistol"" rounds, which are generally shorter and sometimes fatter than rifle rounds. Bullets have a lower velocity and shorter range, consistent with their intended function.

A rifle, is a firearm that is designed to be wielded and fired with two hands, has rifling in the barrel, and fires a full size or intermediate sized cartridge.  

A shotgun is also a two handed firearm,but distinct from a rifle in that it usually has a smooth bore barrel (although rifled shotguns are common) and designed to fire ""shot"" (many small pellets, birdshot may have hundreds of bb sized pellets, where 00 buckshot is nine .30 cal lead pellets. any variation like that you can think of) or slug rounds, which are thick heavy bullets. The distiction is that shotgun rounds generally do not fit snugly in barrel when traveling out, like a rifle. (A rifled shotgun allows the shooter to fire a smooth slug sized bullet, with performance similiar to a rifle because it is a tighter fit) Shotguns are beneficial in that one shotgun can fire shot, slugs, or basically anything that will fit in the barrel, but always have a shorter range and velocity than a rifle.

Because of this, X number of procedures/medications/etc that have already been administered are not going to be paid for. So to compensate they raise prices on everything else. Those that do pay are offsetting the cost of those that cannot.

The manufacturer and insurers in the US.  The pharmacist, the delivery guy.  

But also the 10 dollars you're paying in South Africa may in part be a tax writeoff for the company (they're selling it below cost) or they're manufacturing it locally with local quality control - which is good enough for africa but if you want to do quality control in the US or Europe you have to pay US or EU labour rates and that sort of thing drives up costs.

Poor countries (including South Africa) have basically told the drug companies that they cannot afford patents.  If you make a drug that saves lives you'll sell it for next to nothing or they'll ignore the patent, make it themselves and then the manufacturer will get nothing at all.

Drug production itself isn't very expensive, for most drugs, the big costs are in R&amp;D.  Companies make their money back by having patents and charging basically whatever they want.  But patents are up to a country, and South Africa has no obligation to grant drug patents at all.  

As a practical reality this system wouldn't be sustainable, the people doing R&amp;D all need to get paid and for every successful new drug there are a lot of dead ends in research that need to be paid for.

dvfw,"The FDA requires that all drugs, before entering the market, meet a very large set of requirements. This means that the cost of producing the drugs increases dramatically, and so does the final production cost. The regulations, as well as patent laws, also serve to kill smaller competitors, which means the decreased supply of the drugs causes a higher price.

[""In the wake of the 1962 amendments, the FDA’s regulation of new drugs became increasingly stringent and risk averse, leading critics to complain of overregulation. The bureaucracy at the FDA acquired a reputation for remarkable inefficiency and delay, with processing times for new drug applications (NDAs) typically extending to two years or more, and paperwork reaching into tens of thousands of pages. Meanwhile, the time and expense of new drug development increased dramatically. By 1976 the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated $24 million, 10 to 20 times as much as in the early 1960s, while development times had climbed from a couple
of years to the better part of a decade.""](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1985/5/cj5n1-10.pdf)",null,2,cdptiug,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2
